The Court has reviewed the
petition filed on October 2, 2024 by Petitioner Carolina Valencia (Petitioner)
on behalf of Claimant Sofia Mejia, age 11. The Court denies the petition without prejudice for the following
reasons: 
 
Petitioner must write the correct Court address in the
petition and proposed order in order to provide adequate notice.
 
Item 3b must be completed instead of 3a.
 
Petitioner asserts that a tree limb fell on Claimant
causing pain to her back, right thumb, and right hand. The medical
records/reports in attachment 8 do not show that Claimant is fully recovered
from her injuries. Petitioner must provide further records or a parent
declaration, regarding Claimant’s current condition. 
 
Petitioner must complete item 7 describing Claimant’s
treatment. 
 
Petitioner
must provide attachment 11b3.
 
Attachment
11b5 should not include Claimant’s settlement.  Therefore, the values in 11b should not
include Claimant’s settlement since they should reflect “persons other
than claimant.” 
 
Attachment 11b(6) must describe reasons for the apportionment
of the settlements among the plaintiffs.  
 
Item 12b(5)(ii), which indicates only $350 in medical
liens, should be amended since item 12b(5)b shows a $1,838 lien from City of
Alhambra Fire Department; this lien should also be included in the total lien
amount. 
 
Petitioner must provide attachment 12b5 since it was
marked. 
 
Petitioner requests $500 in attorney fees which represents
25% of the gross settlement. The Court finds this amount to be reasonable. 
 
Petitioner marked item 14b but did not provide the
attachment with proof of the fees and expenses incurred and the payments made
or obligations to pay incurred. Also, given the fact that the settlement amount
cannot pay all the medical expenses, Petitioner must state which liens will be
paid from the remaining proceeds. If Claimant is obligated to pay these fees,
and not Petitioner, then item 14a should be marked instead.
 
In the Proposed Order (MC-351), item 8a(2) should
not be completed since the medical expenses are already written in 8a(3). The
value in 8a(3) is not calculated properly, it should also include the $61,90
medi-cal lien. Item 8b2 should be amended; in the petition, the net settlement
amount is -$749.90. 
 
 
Accordingly, the Court denies the petition without
prejudice.
 
Petitioner shall give notice and file a proof
of service of such.

The Court has reviewed the
petition filed on October 2, 2024 by Petitioner Carolina Valencia (Petitioner)
on behalf of Claimant Ava Mejia, age 9. The Court denies the petition without prejudice for the following
reasons: 
 
Petitioner must write the correct Court address in the
petition and proposed order in order to provide adequate notice.
 
Item 3b must be completed instead of 3a.
 
Petitioner asserts that a tree limb fell on Claimant
causing pain to her arm, right/left leg, and causing a cut on her hand. The
medical records/reports in attachment 8 do not show that Claimant is fully
recovered from her injuries. Petitioner must provide further records or a
parent declaration, regarding Claimant’s current condition. 
 
Petitioner must complete item 7 describing Claimant’s
treatment. 
 
Petitioner
must provide attachment 11b3.
 
Item 11b5
should not include Claimant’s settlement since that section should only reflect
“persons other than claimant.” 
 
Attachment 11b(6) must describe reasons for the
apportionment of the settlements among the plaintiffs.  
 
According to the letter in attachment 12b(4)(c), the
Medi-Cal lien is $71.25, not $71.28 as indicated in the petition. (See item
12b4, 16d.) As a result, the total medical expenses sought to be reimbursed,
must be reviewed; item 12a(4) must also be amended, and should be consistent
throughout the petition.  
 
Item 12b(5)(ii), which indicates only $350 in medical
liens, should be amended since item 12b(5)b shows a $1,838 lien from City of
Alhambra Fire Department; this lien should also be included in the total lien
amount. 
 
Petitioner requests $500 in attorney fees which
represents 25% of the gross settlement. The Court finds this amount to
be reasonable. 
 
Petitioner marked item 14b but did not provide the
attachment with proof of the fees and expenses incurred and the payments made
or obligations to pay incurred. Also, given the fact that the settlement amount
cannot pay all the medical expenses, Petitioner must state which liens will be
paid from the remaining proceeds. If Claimant is obligated to pay these fees,
and not Petitioner, then item 14a should be marked instead.
 
Item 16b should contain the Medi-Cal lien (the amount
should not be in 16d). 
 
The response in item 17e must be changed.
 
In the Proposed Order (MC-351), item 6 should reflect the
gross settlement ($2,000). 
Item 8a(2) should not be completed since the medical
expenses are already written in 8a(3). The value in 8a(3) is not calculated properly,
it should also include the $71.25 medi-cal lien. There should be only
one attachment 8a(3) with the correct Medi-Cal lien amount for this Claimant. 
 
 
Accordingly, the Court denies the petition without
prejudice.
 
Petitioner shall give notice and file a
proof of service of such.

The Court has reviewed the
petition filed on October 2, 2024 by Petitioner Melissa Nieto (Petitioner) on
behalf of Claimant Ryan Nieto, age 9. The Court denies the petition without prejudice for the following
reasons: 
 
Petitioner must write the correct Court address in the
petition and proposed order in order to provide adequate notice.
 
Item 3b must be completed instead of 3a.
 
Petitioner asserts that a tree limb fell on Claimant, but
that he was “not really injured.” (Item 6.) Petitioner must provide
further records or a parent declaration, regarding Claimant’s current
condition. 
 
Petitioner must complete item 7 describing Claimant’s
treatment. 
 
Petitioner
must provide attachment 11b3.
 
Attachment 11b(6) must describe reasons for the
apportionment of the settlements among the plaintiffs.  
 
Petitioner requests $300 in attorney fees which
represents 25% of the gross settlement. The fee agreement for
Petitioner/Claimant must be provided in attachment 17a. Only the
agreement for Carolina Valencia, Ava Mejia, and Sophia Mejia was provided. 
 
Attachment 18b5 must be revised with the name and address
of the parent and the money or other property to be delivered. The statement
that no funds are available appears to be mistaken.
 
In the Proposed Order (MC-351), item 8a(2) and 8a(3)
should be left blank. Item 8b2 must contain Petitioner’s address where the
money will be delivered. 
 
 
Accordingly, the Court denies the petition without
prejudice.
 
Petitioner shall give notice and file a
proof of service of such.
