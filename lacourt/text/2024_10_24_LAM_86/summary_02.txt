Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the petitioners' request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the disclosure of their personnel records. The petitioners, Yvonne Marin and Dylan Farris, were arrested for engaging in oral copulation in public and subsequently resigned from their positions at the Torrance Unified School District. The District notified the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) of the petitioners' resignations and the nature of the allegations leading to their resignations. The petitioners seek to prevent the disclosure of these records, citing privacy concerns. However, the Judge finds that there is reasonable cause to believe that the allegations were well-founded and that the District's records referencing the petitioners' arrests are not exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act.
