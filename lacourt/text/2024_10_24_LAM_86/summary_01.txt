And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Vincent Mouton's motion to proceed without opposition. Mouton claimed that the respondents, Kimley Louie, Los Angeles County Department of Consumer and Business Affairs, and Rental Housing Oversight Commission, County of Los Angeles, never served any responses, oppositions, or answers on him. However, the judge found that the respondents had indeed served and filed answers, and that Mouton was not entitled to proceed without opposition. The judge noted that a writ cannot be granted by default and that the court must disregard any errors in the pleadings or proceedings that do not affect the substantial rights of the parties. The judge also found that allowing Mouton to proceed without opposition would trample upon the respondents' substantial rights.
