 Hearing Date:  April 26, 2024



 
Defendant
Healthcare Financial Solutions, LLC’s demurrer to the second amended complaint
of Plaintiff Allstate Insurance Company is sustained as to the 1st and 2nd
causes of action with 20 days leave to amend.
Defendant
Healthcare Financial Solutions, LLC’s motion to strike is denied as moot.
 
Defendant Healthcare Financial Solutions, LLC (“HFS”) (“Defendant”)
[previously identified as Doe 1] demurs to each cause of action in
Plaintiff People of the State of California, ex rel. Allstate Insurance
Company’s (“Allstate”) (“Plaintiff”) second amended complaint (“SAC”) alleged
against it.  (Notice of Demurrer, pg. 2.)  
Defendants also move to strike Plaintiff’s SAC.  (Notice Demurrer, pg. 2.)[1]
 
Procedural
Background
          Plaintiff
filed its initial complaint as a qui tam relator on behalf of the People
of the State of California and on behalf of itself on December 10, 2021.  Plaintiff filed its FAC on October 21, 2022,
against Non-moving Defendants Alan Todd Turner, M.D. (“Turner”), George Mednik,
M.D. (“Mednik”), Adam Avelardo Perez (“Perez”), New Hope Imaging Services, LLC
(“New Hope”), and DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, (collectively, “Defendants”)
alleging two causes of action: (1) violation of CIFPA, Insurance Code §1871.7;
and (2) violation of the Unfair Competition Law, Business & Professions
Code §17200 et seq.  On June 15, 2023,
this Court sustained Defendants’ demurrers to the 1st and 2nd causes of action
with 30 days leave to amend.  (6/15/23
Minute Order.)  On September 18, 2023,
Plaintiff filed its operative SAC alleging the same two causes of action
against Defendants.
          On January
26, 2024, Plaintiff filed an amendment to the complaint substituting the name
of DOE 1 with HFS.  (1/26/24 Amendment to
Complaint HFS.)
          HFS filed
its demurrer and motion to strike on March 21, 2024.  On April 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed its
oppositions.  On April 17, 2024, HFS
filed its replies.
 
Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer, the demurring party must meet and
confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party
who filed the pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would resolve the
objections to the pleading and obviate the need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a), emphasis added.) 
HFS’ counsel declares he met with Plaintiff’s counsel on March
5, 2024, via teleconference in an attempt to informally resolve the issues in
the instant demurrer.  (Decl. of Cooper
¶2.)  HFS’ counsel declares the parties
were unable to resolve their disputes without Court intervention.  (See Decl. of Cooper ¶3.)  HFS’ meet and confer declaration is
sufficient under C.C.P. §430.41. 
Therefore, the Court will consider the instant demurrer.
 
Summary of Allegations
Plaintiff alleges Defendants carried out a scheme to defraud
insurance companies that cover claims for services related to Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (“MRI”).  (SAC ¶2, Exh. A.)
Plaintiff alleges because Defendants submitted (or caused
to be submitted) at least 398 fraudulent claims to Allstate, California law
imposes penalties of at least $1,990,000 and assessments of up to $4,200,000.  (SAC ¶¶6, 7, Exh. A.)
 
A.  
Demurrer
Summary of Demurrer
HFS demurs to the 1st and 2nd
causes of action on the basis they do not state facts sufficient to constitute
causes of action against HFS and are uncertain. 
(Demurrer, pg. 3.)
 
Failure to State a Cause of
Action
Violation of CIFPA, Insurance Code §1871.7 (1st COA)
Insurance Code §1871.7 provides, in part:
(a)  It is unlawful to knowingly employ
runners, cappers, steerers, or other persons to procure clients or patients to
perform or obtain services or benefits pursuant to Division 4 (commencing with
Section 3200) of the Labor Code or to procure clients or patients to perform or
obtain services or benefits under a contract of insurance or that will be the
basis for a claim against an insured individual or his or her insurer.
 
(b)  Every person who violates any provision of
this section or Section 549, 550, or 551 of the Penal Code shall be subject, in
addition to any other penalties that may be prescribed by law, to a civil
penalty of not less than five thousand dollars ($5,000) nor more than ten
thousand dollars ($10,000), plus an assessment of not more than three times the
amount of each claim for compensation, as defined in Section 3207 of the Labor
Code or pursuant to a contract of insurance. The court shall have the power to
grant other equitable relief, including temporary injunctive relief, as is
necessary to prevent the transfer, concealment, or dissipation of illegal
proceeds, or to protect the public. The penalty prescribed in this paragraph
shall be assessed for each fraudulent claim presented to an insurance company
by a defendant and not for each violation.
 
(Ins. Code §§1871.1(a)-(b).)
False claim actions are subject to “heightened fraud-like
pleading requirements.”  (State of
California ex rel. McCann v. Bank of America, N.A. (2011) 191 Cal.App.4th
897, 906.)  “As in any action sounding in
fraud, the allegations of a [California False Claims Act] complaint must be
pleaded with particularity. The complaint must plead ‘the time, place, and contents
of the false representations, as well as the identity of the person making the
misrepresentation and what he obtained thereby.’”  (Id., internal citations
omitted.)  Specificity is necessary in
alleging claims under Insurance Code §1871.7(b), as it incorporates Penal Code
§550, which in turn requires a specific intent to defraud.  (People v. Blick (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th
759, 772-775 [a violation of Penal Code §550 requires that the person charged
must “intend to commit a fraud”].)
Where a complaint is amended after the statute of
limitations has run to identify a fictitiously-named defendant, and to assert a
cause of action against that defendant not included in the original complaint,
the amended complaint will be given relation back effect, provided the original
complaint stated a valid cause of action against the now-identified “Doe”
defendant; plaintiff was “genuinely ignorant” of the defendant’s identity or
the facts rendering defendant liable when the original complaint was filed; and
the amended complaint, identifying the defendant, is based on the “same general
set of facts” as the original and refers to the “same accident and same
injuries.”  (Austin v. Massachusetts
Bonding & Insurance Co. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 596, 600-601; San Diego
Navy Broadway Complex Coalition v. California Coastal Commission (2019) 40
Cal.App.5th 563, 579; Eghtesad v. State Farm General Insurance Co.
(2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 406, 415 [citing text].)
For the amendment to relate back, the original complaint
must name “Doe” defendants in the caption, and the charging allegations must
state a valid claim against the fictitiously named defendants. It is sufficient
if the allegations run against “defendants” generally, or against “defendants
and each of them.”  (See Austin,
56 Cal.pg. 2d at 600; see also Woo v. Superior Court (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th
169, 176 [citing text].)
Serving someone as a “Doe” defendant after the statute of
limitations has run may seriously impair the ability to defend. Hence, relation
back effect will be given only when plaintiff was proceeding in good faith;
i.e., only where plaintiff was genuinely ignorant of that person's identity or
liability when the action was commenced.  (Miller v. Thomas (1981) 121 Cal.App.3d
440, 445-446; McClatchy v. Coblentz, Patch, Duffy & Bass, LLP (2016)
247 Cal.App.4th 368, 371-372; Organizacion Comunidad de Alviso v. City of
San Jose (2021) 60 Cal.App.5th 783, 795 [constructive notice of defendant’s
name and role precludes designating defendant by fictitious name].)
To defeat the amendment, the burden is on defendant to
prove plaintiff’s earlier awareness of defendant’s identity and facts creating
its liability.  (See Fara Estates
Homeowners Association v. Fara Estates, Ltd. (9th Cir. 1998) 134 F.3d 377,
377 [applying California law]; Breceda v. Gamsby (1968) 267 Cal.App.2d
167, 179.)
Here, HFS does not challenge Plaintiff’s DOE amendment on
the basis plaintiff was aware earlier than the date of its amendment as to
defendant’s identity and facts creating its liability, rather HFS argues
Plaintiff required leave of this Court to file its DOE amendment.  Not so. 
In Los Angeles Superior Court, leave of Court is not required to file a
DOE amendment.  (See The Rutter
Guide, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 6-E §6:613 [“In some courts,
plaintiff’s attorney must prepare an application and order to amend the
complaint. In other courts (e.g., Los Angeles), printed forms are available for
amendments of this type; all the attorney has to do is fill in the name of the
defendant who is being served as one of the “Does.”].)  In light of this fact, the Court analyzes
whether Plaintiff’s cause of action is alleged against HFS.
The Court finds Plaintiff fails to sufficiently allege a
cause of action against HFS under CIFPA with the
requisite specificity.  Plaintiff cannot
merely tack on allegations against HFS by arguing in its opposition that the
allegations against Perez and New Hope also apply to HFS.  A cause of action against HFS must articulate
the “the time, place, and contents of the false representations, as well as the
identity of the person making the misrepresentation and what he obtained
thereby.”  (State of California ex
rel. McCann, 191 Cal.App.4th at pg. 906.) 
The Second Amended Complaint’s 1 cause of action fails to do so.  
Accordingly, HFS’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st cause of
action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Violation of
Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”) (2nd COA) 
The UCL prohibits “unlawful, unfair or fraudulent” business
acts or practices.  (Bus. & Prof.
Code §17200 et seq.)  By proscribing “any
unlawful” business act or practice, the UCL “borrows” rules set out in other
laws and makes violations of those rules independently actionable.  (Zhang v. Superior Court (2013) 57
Cal.4th 364, 370.)  A “violation of
another law is a predicate for stating a cause of action under the UCL’s
unlawful prong.”  (Berryman v. Merit
Property Management, Inc. (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1554.)  Conversely, “[w]hen a statutory claim fails, a
derivative UCL claim also fails.”  (Aleksick
v. 7-Eleven, Inc. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1176, 1185.)
Plaintiff fails to allege a  UCL cause of action against HFS because its
statutory claim against HFS under CIFPA has failed.  (Id.)
Accordingly, HFS’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s 2nd cause of
action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
HFS’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st
and 2nd causes of action in its SAC is sustained with 20 days leave to
amend.
Moving Party to give notice.
 
B.    Motion
to Strike
In light of the Court’s ruling on HFS’ demurrer, HFS’
motion to strike is denied as moot.
 
Conclusion
HFS’ motion to strike is denied as moot.
Moving Party to give notice.
