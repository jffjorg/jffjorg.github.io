And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Patricia Rodriguez's motion to be relieved as counsel for defendant Ricardo Rios and defendant Hayrapet Hakopchrkyan. The motion is based on a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The court has reviewed the completed forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053 and has confirmed that the attorney-client relationship has broken down. The court has granted the motion, and the attorney will be relieved upon filing proof of service on their client of the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil.
