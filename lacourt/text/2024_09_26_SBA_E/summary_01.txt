And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion to strike punitive damages from the Complaint and has granted the motion with leave to amend. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts showing punitive damages to survive a motion to strike. The Plaintiff's argument that the Defendant's failure to secure the metal plate constitutes despicable conduct that willfully and consciously disregarded the safety and rights of the Plaintiff is conclusory and fails to show that any agent of the Defendant ratified the conduct that led to the alleged malice. The Court agrees with the Defendant that the Complaint does not contain specific allegations showing that the Defendant acted with malice towards the Plaintiff. The motion is granted with leave to amend, allowing the Plaintiff to re-file the Complaint with sufficient facts showing punitive damages.
