Summary: This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories and a request for sanctions against the defendants. The plaintiff, Karen Flores, filed a complaint alleging claims against the defendants, Everbrands, Inc., Michael Florman, Yon Lai, and Does 1-25. The defendants failed to serve verified responses to the Form Interrogatories, and the plaintiff filed motions to compel responses and request sanctions. After the motions were filed, the defendants verified their responses. The Court finds that the motions are moot at this point and denies the motions to compel responses and requests for sanctions. The Court also denies the requests for sanctions, finding that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust.
