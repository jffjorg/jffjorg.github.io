And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants have moved to continue the trial of this action by six months, citing numerous discovery disputes that have interfered with trial preparation. The court finds that the defendants have shown good cause for the continuance, as they have made diligent efforts to obtain essential evidence despite the discovery disputes. The court will grant the defendants' motion to continue the trial, but only for three months. The court will also continue the hearing on the defendants' motion for summary adjudication and the final status conference. However, the court will not extend the mandatory five-year deadline to bring the action to trial.
