 Case Number:  22STCV13106    Hearing Date:   April 8, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendants’
Motion to Continue Trial 
            Defendants move to continue the
trial of this action by 6 months.  “The court may grant a continuance only on an
affirmative showing of good cause requiring” it.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)  “A party’s excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts” indicates good cause.  (Rule
3.1332(c)(6).)
            Defendants
show good cause to continue the trial. 
The parties have had numerous discovery disputes.  These disputes have interfered with trial
preparation by all parties.  The court
will continue the trial by three months. 
            Plaintiff Maureen Martinez filed a
partial opposition stating she does not oppose a continuance provided that (a)
the court continues the hearing on defendants’ motion for summary adjudication,
and (b) defendants stipulate to extend the mandatory five-year deadline to
bring the action to trial.  The court
finds that continuing the hearing on the motion for summary adjudication is
appropriate.  The court will make no
order regarding the deadline to bring the action to trial.  
Disposition
            Defendants’ motion to continue trial
is granted in part.  
The
court hereby continues the hearing on defendants’ motion for summary
adjudication from June 10, 2024, to September 13, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.  The court hereby continues the final
status conference from August 12, 2024, to November 18, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.  The court hereby continues the jury
trial from August 28, 2024, to December 4, 2024, at 10:00 a.m.  All pretrial deadlines are continued
to follow the new trial date.
