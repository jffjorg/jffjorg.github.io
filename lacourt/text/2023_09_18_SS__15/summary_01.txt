And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled on several motions in limine filed by the defendants, HCR ManorCare, Inc. and VWR International, LLC. The judge denied motions to exclude evidence that there is no safe level of asbestos exposure and that every exposure contributes to a cumulative dose, as well as motions to exclude OSHA and EPA reports and evidence of a position statement from the Joint Policy Committee of the Societies of Epidemiology.

The judge also denied motions to exclude evidence about dust levels based on witnesses' visual observations and evidence that a company has no documents dated before 1983. The judge found that the evidence is relevant and may be admissible.

However, the judge granted the motion to exclude evidence about a position statement from the Joint Policy Committee of the Societies of Epidemiology, finding that it is hearsay and not subject to an exception.

The judge's ruling is tentative and may be subject to change after further consideration or argument at the hearing.
