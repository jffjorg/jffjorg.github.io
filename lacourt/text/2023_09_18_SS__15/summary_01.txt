And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled on several motions in limine filed by the defendants, HCR ManorCare, Inc. and VWR International, LLC. The judge denied motions to exclude evidence that there is no safe level of asbestos exposure and that every exposure contributes to a cumulative dose, as well as motions to exclude OSHA and EPA reports and evidence of a position statement from the Joint Policy Committee of the Societies of Epidemiology.

The judge also denied motions to exclude evidence about dust levels based on witnesses' visual observations and evidence that a company has no documents dated before 1983. The judge found that the evidence is relevant and may be admissible.

However, the judge granted the motion to exclude evidence about a position statement from the Joint Policy Committee of the Societies of Epidemiology, finding that it is hearsay and not subject to an exception.

The judge's ruling is tentative and may be subject to change after further consideration or argument at the hearing.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the defendants' motions in limine (MIL) Nos. 1-10 and has made the following rulings. MIL No. 1, which seeks to exclude arguments that there is no safe level of asbestos and every exposure contributes to a cumulative dose, is denied without prejudice to objections at trial. MIL No. 2, which argues that OSHA and EPA reports are hearsay, is also denied without prejudice to objections at trial.

MIL No. 3, which seeks to preclude Plaintiff's telling the jury the contents of documents relied upon by experts, is denied without prejudice to objections at trial. MIL No. 4, which seeks to exclude evidence of a position statement from the Joint Policy Committee of the Societies of Epidemiology, is granted. The court finds that the statement is hearsay and not subject to an exception.

MIL Nos. 5-9 were not filed. MIL No. 10, which seeks to exclude evidence about dust levels based on witnesses' visual observations, is denied without prejudice to objections at trial. Finally, MIL No. 10, which seeks to preclude evidence that VWR International, LLC has no documents dated before the November 4, 1983 OSHA emergency temporary order about asbestos, is denied without prejudice to objections at trial.

The court notes that the motions are too vague and do not identify specific expert testimony or evidence to be excluded. The court also finds that the lack of some pre-1983 document may or may not be relevant and cannot anticipate at this time whether the evidence will be relevant or not. If during trial, Plaintiff's questions become harassing or inquiry about irrelevant matters, Defendant should object at that time. The moving party is to give notice.

## English Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding motions in limine (MIL) filed by defendants HCR ManorCare, Inc. and VWR International, LLC in a case concerning asbestos exposure. 

The judge denied most of the defendants' motions, finding them too vague or lacking sufficient justification. For example, the defendants wanted to exclude arguments about the scientific consensus on asbestos exposure and the standard for proving causation, but the judge deemed these arguments too broad and not sufficiently specific. 

The judge also denied motions to exclude OSHA and EPA reports and documents relied upon by experts, stating that objections could be raised at trial if necessary. 

However, the judge granted HCR ManorCare's motion to exclude a position statement from the Joint Policy Committee of the Societies of Epidemiology, finding it hearsay, irrelevant, and potentially confusing for the jury. 

The judge noted that the moving party must give notice regarding the ruling.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions in limine filed by the defendants. The defendants' motions to exclude certain evidence and arguments are denied without prejudice to objections at trial. The motions were deemed too vague and did not identify specific evidence or expert testimony to be excluded.

Defendant HCR ManorCare, Inc. moved to exclude arguments about the standard for proving causation and what "substantial factor" means, but the motion was denied as it did not comply with the July 8, 2022 CMO. The defendant also moved to exclude OSHA and EPA reports as hearsay, but the motion was denied as it did not identify any specific reports to be excluded.

Defendant HCR ManorCare, Inc. also moved to preclude Plaintiff's telling the jury the contents of documents relied upon by experts, but the motion was denied as it did not identify any specific evidence to be excluded. Similarly, the defendant's motion to exclude evidence of a position statement from the Joint Policy Committee of the Societies of Epidemiology was granted as the statement is hearsay and not subject to an exception.

Defendant VWR International, LLC moved to preclude evidence that it has no documents dated before the November 4, 1983 OSHA emergency temporary order about asbestos, but the motion was denied as it was too vague and the court cannot anticipate whether the lack of some pre-1983 document may or may not be relevant.

The judge notes that the moving parties should give notice and that objections to the evidence and arguments may be made at trial.

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions in limine filed by the defendants in the case. The defendants, HCR ManorCare, Inc. and VWR International, LLC, had filed several motions to exclude certain evidence from being presented at trial. The judge has denied most of the motions, finding that they were too vague or that the defendants had not shown good cause to depart from a previous court order. The judge did grant one motion, which sought to exclude evidence of a position statement from the Joint Policy Committee of the Societies of Epidemiology, finding that the statement was hearsay and not subject to an exception. The judge also noted that some of the motions were too vague and that the defendants had not identified specific evidence to be excluded. The ruling is tentative and may be subject to change after further argument and consideration. The moving party is required to give notice of the ruling.

**Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge issued a tentative ruling on several Motions in Limine (MIL) filed by the defendants, HCR ManorCare, Inc. and VWR International, LLC, in an asbestos exposure case.

*   **MIL No. 1, 5-9:** No motion was filed.
*   **MIL No. 2:** HCR ManorCare's motion to exclude arguments about asbestos exposure and causation (no safe level, cumulative dose) was denied as too vague. The court also noted that motions to exclude expert opinion on "substantial factor" were previously deemed made and denied.
*   **MIL No. 3:** HCR ManorCare's motion to preclude the plaintiff from telling the jury the contents of documents relied upon by experts was denied as too vague, and because some documents may be admissible.
*   **MIL No. 4:** HCR ManorCare's motion to exclude a Joint Policy Committee statement was granted because the statement was hearsay, not subject to an exception, published after the alleged exposure, not evidence of the defendant's knowledge, and a call for political action rather than unbiased science.
*   **MIL No. 10 (HCR ManorCare):** HCR ManorCare's motion to exclude evidence about dust levels based on visual observations was denied because witnesses have personal knowledge of their observations, and the evidence may be relevant.
*   **MIL No. 10 (VWR International):** VWR International's motion to preclude evidence that it has no documents dated before November 4, 1983, was denied as too vague.

In most instances where the motions were denied, it was "without prejudice," meaning the defendants can object again at trial if the evidence is presented. The moving party is responsible for providing notice of the ruling.
