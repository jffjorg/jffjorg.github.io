And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted plaintiff Stephen Watkins' request for a default judgment against defendant Brittany Loyd. The judge also denied Loyd's motion to use the court's digital evidence presentation system and her motion for reconsideration.

The judge found that Loyd's motion for reconsideration was untimely, as it was filed more than a month after the deadline. The judge also found that Loyd failed to show sufficient grounds for reconsideration, as she did not explain why she could not have presented new evidence earlier.

The judge rejected Loyd's arguments that she was not properly served with process and that her former counsel did not adequately represent her. The judge also rejected Loyd's argument that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over her, finding that she had purposefully availed herself of the benefits of California and that the controversy arose out of her contacts with the state.

The judge denied Loyd's motion to use the digital evidence presentation system, finding that it was unnecessary as the court had already viewed and considered the video evidence.
