And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling indicates that the Court has received information about the return of a process server, the filing of Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Protection by Defendant Dang, and the entry of default against Defendant Nguyen. The judge notes that if Plaintiff is correct, the "Automatic Stay" applies regarding Defendant Dang, but without knowing when Defendant Dang commenced the bankruptcy proceeding, the Court cannot determine if the default entered against Defendant Dang was proper. The judge also notes that Counsel for Defendant, Kalab A. Honey, states that counsel's office was retained to represent Nguyen on June 5, 2024 after the default was entered against Nguyen. The judge is seeking to determine if the default entered against Dang was proper.
