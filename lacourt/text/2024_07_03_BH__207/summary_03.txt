And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment entered against her on April 12, 2024. The defendant argues that she was never personally served with the summons and that the proof of service is defective. The judge finds that the defendant has advanced sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of proper service and that any doubt about granting the relief sought is resolved in her favor. The judge orders the defendant to file and serve a response to the complaint on or before July 31, 2024, and sets a case management conference for September 24, 2024.
