And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a proposed Second Amended Complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add new defendants and allegations, including a claim for bad faith denial of an insurance contract and a request for declaratory relief. The court finds that the plaintiff has substantially complied with the procedural requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, and that the opposing party was not misled or prejudiced by the proposed amendments. The court will generally not consider the merits of the proposed amendment in determining whether to grant leave to amend. The court orders the plaintiff to file and serve the proposed Second Amended Complaint on or before July 31, 2024.
