[1] “The return of a process server registered pursuant
to Chapter 16 (commencing with Section 22350) of Division 8 of the Business and
Professions Code upon process or notice establishes a presumption, affecting
the burden of producing evidence, of the facts stated in the return.”  (Evid. Code, § 647.)
 


[2] Plaintiff states that Defendant Dang has filed for
Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Protection.  (See
Opposition, p.  1.)  Accordingly, the Court notes that if
Plaintiff is correct the “Automatic Stay” applies regarding Defendant Dang, but
without knowing when Defendant Dang commenced the bankruptcy proceeding, the
Court cannot determine if the default entered against Defendant Dang was
proper.
 


[3] Counsel for Defendant, Kalab A. Honey, states that
counsel’s office was retained to represent Nguyen on June 5, 2024 after the
default was entered against Nguyen.  (See
Declaration of Kalab A. Honey, ¶ 2.)
