[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
CROSS-DEFENDANT
  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MOTION TO STRIKE PORTIONS OF THE CROSS-COMPLAINT



 
Procedural
Background
On March 20, 2020, Plaintiff City of Los Angeles (“City”) filed the
instant action for violations of the Los Angeles Municipal Code (“LAMC”) and
for public nuisance against Defendants Lance Jay Robbins Paloma Partnership
(“LJRPP”), 7TH Street Associates, Inc., and Lance Jay Robbins (“Robbins”).  
On June 24, 2020, City filed a First Amended Complaint against
Defendants.  The first amended complaint asserted
three causes of action for (1) Unauthorized Change of Use Violation in violation
of LAMC §§ 11.00(l), 12.21.A.1(a), (2) Unauthorized Zone and Land Use
Designation Violation in violation of LAMC §§ 11.00(l), 12.21.A.1(a), 12.09.1,
and (3) Public Nuisance in violation of Civil Code §§ 3479 and 3480.
On August 28, 2020, the Court – presided by the Honorable Jon R.
Takasugi – granted City’s request for a preliminary injunction prohibiting short
term rental use of LJRRP’s Property 15 East Paloma Avenue, Venice until
trial.  (Minute Order 8/28/20.) 
On January 28, 2021, Robbins filed a preemptory challenge, and the
action was reassigned to the Honorable Gregory W. Alarcon.  On January 26, 2022, the instant action was
transferred to the Honorable Wendy Chang. 
On February 8, 2022, LJRRP filed a preemptory challenge, which was
granted.  Accordingly, the instant action
was transferred to the current department. 
(Minute Order 2/9/22.)
On October 31, 2022, the Court granted LJRRP, 7th Street
Associates, Inc., and Robbins’ motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction
based on change in law, namely, the Court of Appeal’s opinion in People v. Venice Suites, LLC (2021) 71
Cal.App.5th 715 (Venice Suites).  (Order 10/31/22.)  On November 2, 2022, the City filed a notice
of appeal of the October 31, 2022 Order. 

On
November 4, 2022, LJRRP and 7th Street Associates, Inc.
(jointly “Cross-Complainants”) filed a cross-complaint against City for declaratory
relief.  On December 16, 2022, City filed
the instant motion to strike portions of the cross-complaint.  On January 13, 2023, Cross-Complainants filed
an opposition.  On January 27, 2023, City
filed a reply.
On
February 2, 2023, the Court granted City’s ex parte application to stay the
instant action pending the City’s appeal of the October 31, 2022 Order and
continued the instant motion to strike to July 13, 2023.  (Minute Order 2/2/23.)  On June 2, 2023, the Court continued the
instant motion to strike to November 16, 2023. 
(Minute Order 6/2/23.)  On August
15, 2023, the Court of Appeal affirmed the October 31, 2022 Order.  On October 10, 2023, the Court lifted the
stay of the entire action.  (Minute Order
10/10/23.)  
On
October 20, 2023, the Court of Appeal issued the remittitur affirming the
October 31, 2022 Order.  On November 9,
2023, City dismissed the complaint without prejudice.  On November 15, 2023, the parties filed a
stipulation to continue the instant motion to strike due to the passing of
Robbins and the uncertainty whether the cross-complaint would continue to be
litigated.  Accordingly, the motion to
strike was continued to January 3, 2024. 
On January 3, 2024, the Court granted the parties’ stipulation to
further continue the instant motion to strike to February 13, 2024 due to a
medical emergency of Cross-Complainants’ Counsel. 
 
Allegations
of the Operative Cross-Complaint
The Cross-Complaint alleges that:
            LJRPP owns the real property located
at 15 E. Paloma Ave., Los Angeles, California located in the Venice
neighborhood (“the Ellison”). 
(Cross-Complaint ¶ 1.)  7th
St. Associates Inc. is the general partner of LJRPP.  (Id. ¶ 2.)
            “The Ellison was constructed in the
City of Venice (prior to its consolidation with the City of Los Angeles) in or
around 1913 as a multi-unit property.”  (Id.
¶ 7.)  “On or about July 1913, the
Ellison obtained a license from the City of Venice to operate a
hotel/apartment.”  (Id. ¶ 8.)  “For over 100 years, from 1913 to the
present, the Ellison has rented units for all lengths of time, including
rentals for 30 days or less and rentals for 31 days or more.”  (Id. ¶ 9.)
            Since 2015, the City “has improperly
attempted to eliminate the Ellison’s rentals of 30 days or less, despite the
fact that no law has prohibited it. Even if there was such a law that purported
to prohibit rentals for 30 days or less at the Ellison (such as the City's new
Homesharing ordinance), Cross-Complainants nevertheless have the right continue
operating rentals of 30 days or less pursuant to various laws including but not
limited to the following.”  (Id. ¶
10.)
            “Cross-Complainants have vested
rights to continue operating apartment rentals of 30 days or less because the
Ellison obtained a license from the City of Venice in 1913 to operate said
rentals, and the owners of the Ellison performed substantial work and incurred
substantial liabilities in reliance on said license, including building the
Ellison itself. See Avco Community Developers, Inc. v. South Coast Regional
Commission (1976) 17 Cal.3d 785. Said rentals have continued to the present
since 1913, and the City has no right to interfere with said rights. See Goat
Hill Tavern v. City a/Costa Mesa (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1519.”  (Id. ¶ 11.)
            “The California Historical Building
Code allows historic properties to continue, or to revert back to, its historic
use at any time. The Ellison is an historic property because it is listed on
the national, state, and local registers of historical places as a historic
property. As earlier alleged, the Ellison's historic use included apartment
rentals for 30 days or less and 31 days or more. Therefore, application of the
California Historical Building Code means that Cross-Complainants have the
right to continue, or revert back to, its historical use at any time. The City
has no right to interfere with Cross-Complainants' lawful use of the Ellison as
protected in part by the California Historical Building Code.”  (Id. ¶ 12.)
            “The Government Code, and its
predecessor statute, also protect Cross Complainants’ rights to continue
operating apartment rentals for 30 days or less at the Ellison. Said laws
provide that upon consolidation of two cities, laws and rights regarding land
use rights and laws and rights regarding vested rights are not repealed even
after the event of consolidation. As previously alleged, the Ellison was
constructed in 1913 in the City of Venice. The City of Venice did not prohibit
apartment rentals for 30 days or less. The City of Venice did not distinguish
between apartment buildings and hotels in terms of lengths of occupancies.
Also, the Ellison obtained a license from the City of Venice in 1913 to rent
units for all lengths of time pursuant to the City of Venice land use laws. The
City of Venice was consolidated into the City of Los Angeles in 1925. Upon said
consolidation, the City of Venice's laws regarding land use rights (such as
those laws that do not prohibit apartment rentals of 30 days or less and those
that [do] not distinguish apartment buildings and hotels) and regarding vested
rights were not repealed, and in fact are applicable today, thereby providing
the rights and authority for Cross-Complainants to operate apartment rentals
for 30 days or less.”  (Id. ¶ 13.)
            “The recent Court of Appeal decision
of People of the State of California v. Venice Suites LLC, et al. (2021)
71 Cal.App.5th 715 provides that apartment rentals for 30 days or less is an
allowable use of an apartment building in the City of Los Angeles because no
Los Angeles law provides length of occupancy limits. As previously alleged, the
Ellison is a multi-unit rental building in the City of Los Angeles, and its
legal uses include that of an apartment building. Therefore, apartment rentals
for 30 days or less is an allowable use of the Ellison.”  (Id. ¶ 14.)
            “An actual controversy has arisen
and now exists between Cross-Complainants and Cross-Defendant concerning their
respective rights and duties in that Cross Complainants contend that they
presently have the right to continue renting units at the Ellison for all
lengths of time, including rentals for 30 days or less, whereas Cross-Defendant
disputes this position and is trying to wrongfully eliminate
Cross-Complainants' aforementioned rights.” 
(Id. ¶ 15.) 
“Cross-Complainants desire a judicial determination as to their rights
and duties in regard to the Ellison as alleged herein.”  (Id. ¶ 16.)

As the Court may take judicial notice of court records and actions of
the State, (See Evid. Code, § 452(c),(d)), City’s unopposed request for
judicial notice is granted.  However, the
Court does not take judicial notice of the truth of hearsay assertions within
the judicially noticed documents. (See Herrera v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co.
(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.)  
 
Legal Standard
Motions to
strike are used to reach defects or objections to pleadings that are not
challengeable by demurrer (i.e., words, phrases, prayer for damages,
etc.).  (See CCP §§ 435-437.)  A party
may file a motion to strike in whole or in part within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading, however, if a party serves and files a motion to strike
without demurring to the complaint, the time to answer is extended.  (CCP §§ 435(b)(1), 435(c).)
A motion to
strike lies only where the pleading has irrelevant, false, or improper matter,
or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws.  (CCP § 436.) 
The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the
pleadings or by way of judicial notice. 
(CCP § 437.)
 
Meet and Confer Requirement 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a) requires that “[b]efore filing
a motion to strike pursuant to this chapter, the moving party shall meet
and confer¿in person or by telephone¿with the party who filed the pleading that
is subject to the motion to strike for the purpose of determining whether an
agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the
motion to strike.” The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before
the date the responsive pleading is due and if they are unable to meet the
demurring party shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 435.5(a)(2).)  The moving party must also file and serve a
declaration detailing the meet and confer efforts.  (Id.¿at (a)(3).)¿ If an amended pleading is filed, the parties must
meet and confer again before a motion to strike may be filed to the amended
pleading.  (Id.¿at (a).)  
            Here, City has sufficiently met and conferred.  (Brothers Decl. ¶ 2.)
 
Discussion

City contends that Cross-Complainants are collaterally estopped due to
the Lance Jay Robbins Paloma Partnership v. City of Los Angeles, Los
Angeles Superior Court Case No. 19STCP01937 (“Writ of Mandate Action”) from
raising the claims in paragraphs 11-13 of the Cross-Complaint.
“Issue preclusion, … historically called collateral estoppel,
describes the bar on relitigating issues that were argued and decided in the
first suit.”  (DKN Holdings LLC v.
Faerber (2015) 61 Cal.4th 813, 824.) 
“Issue preclusion prohibits the relitigation of issues argued and
decided in a previous case, even if the second suit raises different causes of
action. [Citation.] Under issue preclusion, the prior judgment conclusively
resolves an issue actually litigated and determined in the first action.”  (Ibid.)  “ ‘[I]ssue preclusion applies (1) after final
adjudication (2) of an identical issue (3) actually litigated and necessarily
decided in the first suit and (4) asserted against one who was a party in the
first suit or one in privity with that party.’ [Citation.]”  (Meridian Financial Services, Inc. v. Phan
(2021) 67 Cal.App.5th 657, 686.)
Here, factors (1) and (4) are clearly met.  The Writ of Mandate Action sought to vacate the
City’s final administrative decision denying LJRPP’s application to correct the
August 25, 1967 Certificate of Occupancy for the Ellison Apartments to be a
“Hotel” rather than an “Apartment House” or alternatively interpret the 1967
Certificate of Occupancy to permit short term rentals.  (Request for Judicial Notice “RJN” Exh. 10
[First Amended Petition].)  The court in
the Writ of Mandate action found in favor of the City and denied the petition
for writ of mandate and the claim for declaratory relief.  (RJN Exh. 1 [Trial Court Ruling in Writ of
Mandate Action].)  Further, the October
1, 2020 order in the Writ of Mandate action is clearly a final judgment because
LJRPP did appeal but dismissed the appeal. 
(RJN Exh. 16 [Notice of Appeal]; RJN Exh. 17 [LJRPP’s request for dismissal
of the appeal]; RJN Exh. 18 [Order dismissing appeal]; RJN Exh. 19 [remittitur dismissing
appeal].)  Moreover, no party disputes
that LJRPP is in privity with all Defendants in the instant action.  However, the issues raised and actually
litigated are not identical.
“For purposes of collateral estoppel, an issue was actually litigated
in a prior proceeding if it was properly raised, submitted for determination,
and determined in that proceeding.”  (Hernandez
v. City of Pomona (2009) 46 Cal.4th 501, 511.)  “The “identical issue” requirement addresses
whether “identical factual allegations” are at stake in the two proceedings,
not whether the ultimate issues or dispositions are the same.’ [Citations.]”  (Id. at pp.511–512.)  “An issue decided in a prior proceeding
establishes collateral estoppel even if some factual matters or legal theories
that could have been presented with respect to that issue were not
presented.”  (Bridgeford v. Pacific
Health Corp. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1034, 1042.)  “A prior decision does not establish
collateral estoppel, however, on issues that could have been raised and decided
in the prior proceeding but were not.”  (Id.
at p.1043.)  
Here, paragraph 11 raises the issue of whether Cross-Complainants have
a vested right to maintain operating apartment rentals of 30 days or less because
Ellison obtained a license in 1913 to operate said rentals and performed work
in reliance on said license. 
(Cross-Complaint ¶ 11.)  Paragraph
12 raises the issue that under the Historical Building Code, Cross-Complainants
had a right to revert to historic use of apartment rentals of 30 days or less.  (Id. ¶ 12.)  Finally, paragraph 13 raises the issue that
the City of Venice’s laws regarding land use rights and vesting rights were not
repealed.  (Id. ¶ 13.)  Each of these issues involves whether Cross-Complainants
can have under 30-day apartment rentals at the Ellison.  These issues were not necessarily litigated
in the underlying Writ of Mandate Action.
In the instant action, the Court of Appeal noted that “[t]he issues
raised and decided in the administrative appeal ultimately included
determinations that the Ellison was an ‘apartment house’ not a ‘hotel,’ and
that the Ellison was not permitted to host short-term rentals because it was in
the RD1.5 11 zone. The determination about whether short-term rentals were a
permissible use appears to have been made because throughout the administrative
proceedings the LJRPP and the City conflated the concept of ‘hotel’ and ‘short-term
rental.’”  (Remittitur for the instant
action (20STCV11588) at pp.10-11.)  Thus,
as the Court of Appeal has expressly noted, though the court in the Writ of
Mandate proceeding did address the various claims for vested rights, (RJN Exh.
1 at pp.10-12), the court repeatedly conflated short-term rentals with hotel.  (RJN Exh. 1, at p.11, [“Petitioner’s other
cited evidence of historic use of the Ellison – i.e. the Ph.D. thesis and
historical advertisements – are not recorded evidence that Ellison has been
used as a Hotel or for STRs. (AR 118, 353-362, 108-111.) In weighing the
evidence, APC could reasonably give more weight to the building records than
the Ph.D. thesis or historical advertisements. This is especially true where
permits issued to prior owners, including the original owner, consistently
referred to the property as an apartment house or building.”], [Italics
and Bold Added].)  The court similarly
conflated short-term rentals with hotels when discussing the applicability of
the California Historical Building Code. 
(RJN Exh. 1 at p.14, [“none of these documents identify Ellison as a historic
hotel, as opposed to a historic apartment house, for purposes of the
registers of historical places.”], [Italics and Bold Added].)
In fact, the court’s order in the Writ of Mandate action clearly notes
that whether “apartment house” included short term rentals was not raised.  (RJN Exh. 1 [Trial Court Ruling in Writ of
Mandate Action], [“It also appears Petitioner did not argue below that
‘apartment house’ should be interpreted to allow STRs.”].)  
Some of the issues raised and litigated in the Writ of Mandate Action
was whether LJRPP had a vested right under statutory law or common law to run
the Ellison as a hotel and whether the Ellison historically operated as a
hotel.  Paragraphs 11-13 in the
Cross-Complaint do not raise these same issues, but rather concern whether
Cross-Complainants have a vested right in running the Ellison with apartment
rentals under 30 days, and whether the Ellison historically had apartment
rentals under 30 days.  The mere fact
that the ultimate disposition is the same is not dispositive for purposes of
collateral estoppel.  (Lucido v.
Superior Court (1990) 51 Cal.3d 335, 34,2 [“The ‘identical issue’
requirement addresses whether ‘identical factual allegations’ are at stake in
the two proceedings, not whether the ultimate issues or dispositions are the
same.”].)  Here, the factual allegation has
changed.  In the instant action,
Cross-Complainants allege that they may continue to operate the subject
property with less than 30 day rentals as an apartment – not as a hotel as
previously alleged in the Writ of Mandate Action.  The issues are not identical.
Accordingly, City’s motion to strike is DENIED.


CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            Based on the foregoing, Cross-Defendant
City of Los Angeles’ motion to strike portions of the cross-complaint is
DENIED.  Cross-Defendant is to answer within
30 days.
            The case management conference is
continued to April 3, 2024 at 8:30 am.
            Moving Party is to give notice and
file proof of service of such.
