```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The demurrers are sustained as to the fourth and fifth causes of action (elder abuse and medical battery) with 15 days leave to amend. The motion to strike is granted as to paragraphs 10, 11, 59, 60, and both paragraphs 61 in the First Amended Complaint (FAC).

The court finds that the FAC fails to plead sufficient facts to support a claim for elder financial abuse, as it does not allege that the defendants took the plaintiff's property or deprived him of any property right. The FAC also fails to plead the elements of medical battery, as it does not allege that the defendant performed a substantially different medical procedure from the one the plaintiff consented to.

The court further finds that the FAC does not adequately plead the elements required for a claim for punitive damages, as it does not allege facts showing oppression, fraud, or malice.
