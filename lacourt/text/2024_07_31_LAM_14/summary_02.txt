Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' demurrer is overruled, and their motion to strike the demand for punitive damages is denied as to defendant Darling and granted as to the corporate defendants with 15 days leave to amend. The court finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded a cause of action for breach of contract, breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and nuisance. The court also finds that defendant Darling's conduct was malicious and despicable, entitling the plaintiff to punitive damages. However, the court grants the motion to strike the demand for punitive damages as to the corporate defendants because the complaint fails to name an officer, director, or managing agent who ratified the alleged malicious conduct.
