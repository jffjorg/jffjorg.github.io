And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion, in part, and denies it, in part. The motion is moot as to Form Interrogatories 2.11, 3.7, 12.1, 15.1, 16.1, 16.2, 16.2, 16.6, and 17.1 as to Requests for Admissions Nos. 4, 5, and 14-53, as the defendant has served supplemental responses. However, the motion is not moot as to Form Interrogatories 2.5(a), 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4, as the defendant's responses are still deficient.

The judge denies the defendant's request for sanctions and finds that imposing sanctions on either party or their counsel would be unjust. The court also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions, as the defendant's failure to serve further responses until after the motion was filed and the deficiency in the responses are not sufficient grounds for sanctions.

The judge orders the defendant to serve further responses to Form Interrogatories 2.5(a), 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 within 30 days. The court also notes that the scheduling of discovery motions by the parties is improper and requires separate motions and reservation dates to allow the court sufficient time to review the motions and prepare its rulings.
