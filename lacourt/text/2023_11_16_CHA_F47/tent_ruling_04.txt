RULING: The motion is granted, in part, and moot
or denied, in part, as set forth below.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiffs Steffanie Stelnick,
Todd Stelnick, and Southern California Real Estate Management, Inc.’s
(collectively, Plaintiffs) claim that Defendants Ryan House and Tamar House
have breached a Settlement Agreement that ended a prior lawsuit.  Plaintiffs contend that the Houses have
repeatedly breached the Settlement Agreement by engaging in competing activity
in violation of a non-compete clauses in the Settlement Agreement.  Plaintiffs’ operative Second Amended
Complaint contains causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract and (2)
Trademark Infringement (15 U.S.C. 1114(1)) against the Houses and others.  
 
On 3/21/23, Plaintiff Steffanie Stelnick (Ms. Stelnick)
served Form Interrogatories, Set 1, and Requests for Admissions, Set 1, on
Defendant Tamar House (Ms. House). 
(Berkowitz Decl., Ex.1, 2). 
Pursuant to an extension of time to respond, on 5/3/23, Ms. House served
responses to the Form Interrogatories and Requests for Admissions.  (Berkowitz Decl., Ex.3-4).  On 5/18/23, Plaintiffs’ counsel emailed a
meet and confer letter to defense counsel regarding what she believed to be
deficiencies in the responses. 
(Berkowitz Decl., Ex.5).  On
5/24/23, defense counsel responded by granting a 30-day extension to file
motions to compel further responses and requested further meet and confer.  (Berkowitz Decl., Ex.6).  Counsel for the parties were unable to
schedule a mutually agreeable time to meet and confer.  (Berkowitz Decl. ¶6).    Therefore, on 7/20/23, Ms. Stelnick filed and
served the instant motion seeking an order compelling Ms. House to serve
further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set 1, Nos. 2.5(a),
2.11, 3.7, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 15.1, 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.6 and 17.1 as to
Requests for Admissions Nos. 4, 5 and 14-53.  Additionally, Ms. Stelnick requests an award
of sanctions against Ms. House and her attorney in the amount of $5,828.25.  Ms. House has opposed the motion and requests
sanctions in the amount of $14,596.00 against Ms. Stelnick and her counsel.  Ms. Stelnick has filed a reply to the
opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
CCP 2030.300 provides, in relevant part: 
 
“(a) On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following
apply:
(1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.
(2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate.
(3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.
(b)(1) A
motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section
2016.040.”
 
Ms. Stelnick contends that Ms. House failed to fully and
completely respond to Form Interrogatories 2.5(a), 2.11,
3.7, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 15.1, 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.6 and 17.1 as to Requests for Admissions Nos. 4, 5 and
14-53 as required by CCP 2030.220. 
 
The opposition to the motion contends that except for the
issue of sanctions, the instant motion is moot because Ms. House served
supplemental responses on 10/30/23 consistent with this Court’s 8/14/23 ruling
on the motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set 1, as
against Ryan House.  (See Liu
Decl. ¶19, Ex.N).  Ms. House further
contends that Ms. Stelnick’s counsel failed to adequately respond to meet and
confer efforts to resolve the issues presented by this motion before Ms. House
served her supplemental responses on 10/30/23 and filed the opposition on
11/2/23.  (Liu Decl. ¶¶9-20,
Ex.G-N).  The opposition also contends
that Ms. House and/or her counsel acted improperly by scheduling the hearings
on the instant motion and multiple other discovery motions on different days
requiring multiple appearances.  (See
Opposition, p.2:10-13; Liu Decl. ¶5).
 
The reply argues that the motion is not moot as certain
of the supplemental responses of Ms. House (as to Form Interrogatories 2.5(a),
12.2, 12.3 and 12.4) are still deficient and the issue of sanctions
remains.  The reply also notes that the
second supplemental responses of Mr. House (which the opposition claims were
served in September 2023, but Ms. Stelnick’s counsel claims were not received
until the end of October 2023) did not resolve the issues in Ms. House’s
responses as they are two different defendants. 

 
Based on the opposition, including the supplemental
responses served on 10/30/23, the Court’s 8/14/23 ruling and the reply, it
appears that the motion is moot as to Form
Interrogatories 2.11, 3.7, 12.1, 15.1, 16.1, 16.2, 16.2, 16.6 and 17.1 as to
Requests for Admissions Nos. 4, 5 and 14-53. 
(See Liu Decl., Ex.N; Reply, p.4:1-p.5:2).  To the extent Ms. Stelnick may still contend
the motion is not moot as to Form Interrogatories 3.7, 16.1, 16.2, 16.3 and 16.6 (the motion as to Ryan House as to these
interrogatories was denied), the request to compel further responses to those
interrogatories is denied for the same reasons set forth in the Court’s 8/14/23
ruling as to Ryan House. 
 
Ms. House’s
supplemental responses to Form Interrogatories, 2.5(a), 12.2, 12.3 and 12.4 are
still deficient.  In response to Form
Interrogatory 2.5(a) which asks for Ms. House’s current residence address, she
has improperly provided her counsel’s address. 
Ms. House’s supplemental responses to Form Interrogatories 12.2, 12.3
and 12.4 include the same objections which the Court noted in its ruling on Ms.
Stelnick’s motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set 1,
as to Ryan House were without merit.  (See
8/14/23 Minute Order, p.3).
 
The Court further notes that it is the Court’s
reservation system which prohibits the scheduling of all of the motions to
compel on the same date.  While certain
of the motions may be very similar, they are not identical as they involve
different parties.  As such the Court
must review each motion to determine the differences (while the differences in
the motions as to Mr. and Mrs. House may only be the names of the parties, the
differences as to Southern California Property Management Company, Inc. will seemingly
be more substantial as certain of the objections made by Mr. and Mrs. House to
interrogatories were based on the fact that they are individuals, not
entities).  Therefore, separate motions
and reservation dates are required to allow the Court sufficient time to review
the motions and prepare its rulings.
 
The Court finds that imposing sanctions on either party
or their counsel under the circumstances would be unjust.  CCP 2030.300(d).  As noted above, the motion lacks merit as to
Form Interrogatories 3.7, 16.1, 16.2, 16.3 and 16.6.  Ms. House is not entitled to sanctions as she
failed to serve further responses until after the motion was filed and as noted
above, certain of those further responses are still deficient.  The Court further notes that Ms. House’s
request for $14,596.00 in sanctions is excessive.  Ms. House’s counsel is attempting to recover
for his time  reviewing past discovery
requests, responses, and Court orders as well as researching and analyzing
substantive and procedural legal issues relating to the discovery requests
which he is  required to do to meet both
his and his client’s discovery obligations. 
(See Liu Decl. ¶23).  If
the Court found that Ms. House was entitled to recover sanctions (which it did
not), she would only be able to recover fees and costs related to the motion,
not fees incurred in properly responding to the discovery.   
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the Court’s 8/14/23 ruling, the supplemental
responses served on 10/30/23 and the reply (which only addresses deficiencies
in the supplemental responses as to Form Interrogatories 2.5(a), 12.2, 12.3,
12.4), it appears that the motion is moot as to Form Interrogatories 2.11, 3.7,
12.1, 15.1, 16.1, 16.2, 16.2, 16.6 and 17.1 as to Requests for Admissions Nos.
4, 5 and 14-53.  (See Liu Decl.,
Ex.N; Reply, p.4:1-p.5:2).  
 
To the extent Ms. Stelnick contends the motion is not
moot as to Form Interrogatories 3.7, 16.1, 16.2, 16.3 and 16.6, the request to
compel further responses to those interrogatories is denied for the same
reasons set forth in the Court’s 8/14/23 ruling as to Ryan House.
 
The motion is granted as to Form Interrogatories, 2.5(a),
12.2, 12.3 and 12.4 as the supplemental responses served on 10/30/23 include
improper objections.  Further responses
are due within 30 days.  
 
Both parties requests for sanctions are denied.
