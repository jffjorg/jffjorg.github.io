And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to compel deposition and orders Defendant Extensions Plus to produce its Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) for deposition and produce documents as set forth in the deposition notice within 14 days. The judge denies the request for sanctions against Defendants Helene Stahl and Extensions Plus and their counsel, Goldberg & Associates, due to lack of specificity and failure to identify the attorney at the firm representing Defendants against whom sanctions are sought. The judge also notes that the repeated failure to comply with the requirement to electronically bookmark exhibits may result in the imposition of sanctions and sets an Order to Show Cause as to why sanctions should not be imposed.
