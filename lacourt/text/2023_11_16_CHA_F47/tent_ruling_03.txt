SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a dispute between neighboring
residential landowners/occupiers. 
Plaintiffs Anderson Boyce and Rosie Boyce (collectively, Plaintiffs) own
and occupy real property located at 29402 Plymouth Road, Castaic, California
91384 (Plaintiffs’ Property).  (A. Boyce
Decl. ¶2).  Defendants Jessica Skinfield
and Francesca Vargas (collectively, Defendants) currently own, lease, occupy
and/or control real property located at 29403 Fenway Court, Castaic, California
91384 (Defendants’ Property).  (A. Boyce
Decl. ¶3).  Defendants Jason McCune and
Andrea McCune (the McCunes) owned, leased, occupied and/or controlled the
Defendants’ Property prior to the Defendants. 
(Complaint ¶5).  
 
Plaintiffs’ Property and Defendants’ Property are
situated so that the properties’ backyards are directly adjacent and separated
by two adjoining fences.  (A. Boyce Decl.
¶5).  There are five eucalyptus trees on
Defendants’ Property along the adjoining fence line which Plaintiffs contend
have large branches extending beyond the fence line onto Plaintiffs’ Property
over Plaintiffs’ pool filtration and pump system.  (Id. ¶6).  
 
Plaintiffs claim that for almost two decades debris from
the eucalyptus trees on Defendants’ Property have caused, and are continuing to
cause, significant damage to Plaintiffs’ Property.  (A. Boyce Decl. ¶¶7-8, Ex.1-3).  Plaintiffs also claim that the eucalyptus
trees have presented and continue to present an unreasonable and substantial
risk of causing bodily injury to Plaintiffs and/or other individuals on
Plaintiffs’ Property.  (Id.,
Ex.4).  Plaintiff further contend that
the eucalyptus trees’ root system is increasingly invading/encroaching under
the property line into the Plaintiffs’ Property causing Plaintiffs’ pool deck,
vinyl fence and other portions of the Boyce Property to crack and lift due to
the pressure of the root system.  (Id.
¶¶ 7-9, Exs.1-3).
 
On 11/10/22, Plaintiffs filed this action for damages and
injunctive relief against the Defendants and the McCunes.  In January 2023, Plaintiffs served the
McCunes.  On 2/28/23, the Court granted
Plaintiffs’ ex parte application to serve the Defendants by publication.  On 4/3/23, the McCunes answered the
complaint.  On 4/5/23, Plaintiffs filed
proof of publication as to the Defendants. 
Defendants have not responded to the Complaint.  
 
On 9/12/23, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ ex parte
application for a temporary restraining order to abate private nuisance and
order to show cause re preliminary injunction. 
(See 9/12/23).  The Court
noted that Plaintiffs may properly serve and notice a motion re preliminary
injunction and reserve a hearing date for same via the court’s online
reservation system.  Id.
 
On 10/19/23, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion seeking
a preliminary injunction to abate a private nuisance as against Defendants
Jessica Skinfield and Francesca Vargas enjoining and requiring these Defendants
to abate the private nuisance and/or perform any and all actions necessary to
assess, investigate, remove, remediate, monitor, treat, or cleanup the
resulting damages from the nuisance.  On
10/19/23, Plaintiffs filed a proof of service indicating that the motion was
personally served on Defendant Jessica Skinfield on 10/15/23.  No proof of service of the motion on
Defendant Francesca Vargas has been filed. 

 
No opposition or other response to the motion has been
filed.  On 11/13/23, Plaintiffs’ counsel
filed a declaration regarding non-receipt of an opposition to the motion.      
 
ANALYSIS
 
An injunction may be granted “[w]hen it appears by the
complaint that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded,” “[w]hen it
appears by…affidavits that the commission or continuance of some act during the
litigation would produce waste, or great or irreparable injury, to a party to
the action,” “[w]hen it appears, during the litigation, that a party to the
action is doing. . .some act in violation of the rights of another party to the
action respecting the subject of the action,” “[w]hen pecuniary compensation
would not afford adequate relief,” and “[w]here it would be extremely difficult
to ascertain the amount of compensation which would afford adequate relief  See CCP 526(a)(1)-(5).  
 
An injunction may be an appropriate remedy for a trespass
or nuisance.  Posey (1991) 229
CA3d 1236; County of Santa Clara (2006) 137 CA4th 292.
 
A preliminary injunction may be granted at any time
before judgment upon a verified complaint, or upon affidavits if the complaint
in the one case, or the affidavits in the other, show satisfactorily that
sufficient grounds exist therefor.  CCP
527(a).  
 
When determining whether to issue a preliminary
injunction, the court must weigh two interrelated factors: (1) the likelihood
the moving party will ultimately prevail on the merits, and (2) the relative
interim harm to the parties from the issuance or non-issuance of the
injunction. Monterossa (2015) 237 CA4th 747, 754.  “Weighing these factors lies within the broad
discretion of the superior court.”  Smith
(2010) 182 CA4th 729, 749; Robbins (1985) 38 C3d 199, 205.  The greater a plaintiff’s showing on one, the
less that must be shown on the other factor to support an injunction.  Butt (1992) 4 C4th 668, 678.
 
Plaintiffs contend that they have shown a high likelihood
of prevailing on the merits and continuous injury to their unique real property
caused by the trees.  (A. Boyce
Decl.).  Plaintiffs argue that they are
in need of immediate injunctive relief because Defendants’ trees have
encroached on Plaintiffs’ property and their refusal to remove their
encroachment has already resulted in: (1) branches falling onto and damaging
Plaintiffs’ property; (2) encroaching roots damaging Plaintiffs’ vinyl fence,
pool deck, pool filtration and pump system, and other portions of the property
as well as inhibiting other plants from growing; (3) substantial risk of
causing bodily injury that poses a risk to both Plaintiffs and their guests;
and (4) continued injury, continued loss of property value, and loss of
Plaintiffs’ comfortable enjoyment of the property unless enjoined.  (A. Boyce Decl. ¶¶7-10, Ex.1-4).
 
However, the purpose of a preliminary injunction is to
preserve the status quo pending a trial on the merits.  Continental Baking Co. (1968) 68 C2d
512, 528; SB Liberty, LLC (2013) 217 CA4th 272, 280.  Injunctions may be classified as
“prohibitory” or “mandatory.”  An injunction
is prohibitory if it requires a person to refrain from a particular act and
mandatory if it compels performance of an affirmative act that changes the
position of the parties or the status quo. 
See Davenport (1997) 52 CA4th 435, 446-448; Oiye
(2012) 211 CA4th 1036, 1048; URS Corp. 15 CA5th 884.  Mandatory preliminary injunctions are rarely granted.  See Teachers Insurance &
Annuity Association (1999) 70 CA4th 1487, 1493 (“The granting of a
mandatory injunction pending trial is not permitted except in extreme cases
where the right thereto is clearly established.” internal quotes
omitted); Integrated Dynamic Solutions, Inc. (2016) 6 CA5th 1178,
1184; Brown (2019) 34 CA5th 915, 925.  

 
Here, Plaintiffs are requesting that “Defendants, and
each of them, and any of their officers, directors, agents, servants,
employees, and attorneys, and all persons acting in concert or in participation
with Defendants, and each of them,” be “enjoined and required to engage in
the following acts/conduct: 1. To abate said nuisance and/or to perform
any and all actions necessary to assess, investigate, remove, remediate,
monitor, treat, or cleanup the resulting damages from the nuisance.”
(emphasis added) (See proposed Order, Motion, pdf p.152:21-27; Notice of
Motion, p.2:4-12).  Based on the
foregoing, it is not clear exactly what Plaintiffs expect Defendants to do
(i.e., cut down the trees; come onto to Plaintiffs’ Property to clean up the
leaves/branches from the trees).  See
CRC 3.1110(a) (“A notice of motion must state in the opening paragraph the
nature of the order being sought and the grounds for issuance of the order.”).    
 
The relief requested seems to constitute, at least in
part, a mandatory preliminary injunction.  

The Court finds that such extreme relief is not warranted
at this point in the litigation as it could correlate to the removal of the
trees and/or Defendants, or their agents, accessing Plaintiffs’ Property to
comply with the order.  Plaintiffs
concede that the situation which they seek to abate by way of the preliminary
injunction has been ongoing for almost twenty years.  (A. Boyce Decl. ¶7).  Despite the conditions purportedly existing
for “nearly two decades,” Plaintiffs seemingly made no effort to resolve the
conditions during the first decade of problems. 
(Id. ¶¶7, 12).  In January
2013, Plaintiffs attempted to address the issue with the prior owners, the
McCunes, of the Defendants’ Property without receiving any response.  (Id. ¶13, Ex.5).  Plaintiffs fail to explain why they took no
steps for approximately five years when they sent another letter to the McCunes
in December of 2018, to which they also failed to respond, and/or why they
waited another approximately 3 ½ years to attempt to address the issue with the
Defendants in May of 2022.  (Id.
¶¶14-15, Ex.6, 7).  Nor have Plaintiffs
offered any evidence of efforts they have made to resolve the issue without
Defendants’ assistance (i.e., cutting limbs of the trees which overhang the
Plaintiffs’ Property).  (See A.
Boyce Decl., generally).
 
Plaintiffs have failed to establish that allowing the
conditions to exist until the matter goes to trial will cause them any more
damage/harm than they contend they have already suffered as a result of the
trees.  The Court finds that granting the
requested relief is not warranted as doing so will not preserve the status quo.  Additionally, as noted above, Plaintiffs have
failed to clearly set forth what Defendants would be required to do or not do,
if the motion is granted.  Further, if
Defendants are required to remove the trees before trial and it is ultimately
determined at trial that Plaintiffs are not entitled to such relief, Defendants
will likely not be able to replace the trees with mature trees or doing so
would be at great expense.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied.
