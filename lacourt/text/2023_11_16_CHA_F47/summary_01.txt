And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is denying a motion filed by Raul Perez to disqualify William F. Hertz, II as attorney/counsel for Enrique Perez and Jonathan Perez in a dispute over real property. The dispute began when Raul filed a complaint against Enrique and Jonathan, and Enrique filed an answer and cross-complaint. Jonathan later filed a cross-complaint against Raul, Enrique, and others. Attorney Hertz represents Enrique and Jonathan, but Raul argues that Attorney Hertz has a conflict of interest because he represents both parties.

The Court analyzed the situation and concluded that, despite Attorney Hertz's continued representation of Enrique, Raul had not shown how he would be prejudiced by allowing Attorney Hertz to continue representing Enrique. The Court also noted that Jonathan's new counsel, James A. Gallo, has filed joinders in papers filed by Attorney Hertz on behalf of Enrique, which does not establish that Attorney Gallo is not independently representing Jonathan's interests.

The Court concluded that if Jonathan does not object to Attorney Hertz's continued representation of Enrique, disqualification would not be warranted. However, if Jonathan objects, disqualification would be warranted. In this case, Jonathan has filed a declaration stating that he does not object to Attorney Hertz's continued representation of Enrique.
