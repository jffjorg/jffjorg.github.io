And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion for leave to file an amended cross-complaint, which adds American Honda Motor Company, Inc. as a cross-defendant for alleged defective airbags in the plaintiff's vehicle. The defendants seek to amend the cross-complaint to include negligence allegations against Honda, based on the discovery of a manufacturing issue with the airbag inflators. The court finds that the amendment is necessary and proper, and that no party will suffer prejudice as a result. The motion is unopposed, and the defendants are ordered to file the proposed amended cross-complaint within 10 days of the date of the order.
