And here is the English-text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling denies without prejudice the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Douglas Younglove, Esq. on behalf of Scott Newberger, the plaintiff. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, which resulted in the plaintiff suing his own attorneys. The Court denies the motion because Counsel failed to provide a declaration stating that the electronic service address is the client's current electronic service address, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d). The Court also notes that Counsel was unable to confirm the plaintiff's current address and did not serve the moving papers on the Clerk of the Court as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1011(b). Counsel is ordered to give notice, and parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
