And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the Plaintiff's request for default judgment against the Defendant, Jaari Zvi, for the third time. The Plaintiff had previously failed to provide a complete default package, including a CIV-100 form and a declaration with admissible evidence of damages. Although the Plaintiff has since submitted a new package, it is still defective, as it uses an outdated form and lacks signature on item 8. The Plaintiff's claims for damages, including property damage, medical specials, and general damages, are also insufficient, as they lack authenticated and admissible evidence. The Court notes that the Plaintiff's refusal to submit medical records due to privacy concerns is not a valid reason, as the right to privacy is waived when a Plaintiff files a lawsuit for related injuries. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's claims for punitive damages are insufficient, as they lack evidence of the Defendant's financial condition and ability to pay. The Plaintiff is ordered to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects within a specified timeframe. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
