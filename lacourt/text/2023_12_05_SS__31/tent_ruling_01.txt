  Case Number:  19STCV07374    Hearing Date:   December 5, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  12/05/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  19STCV07374 IVAN RENE MOORE vs JAARI ZVI REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  JAARI ZVI RECOMMENDATION:   DENY for reasons stated below.  TENTATIVE  This is Plaintiff’s third request for default judgment.   The request for default judgment submitted on October 19, 2023 is DENIED for the following reasons:  Previously, the Court denied Plaintiff’s request on October 5, 2023, and instructed that a default package must include CIV-100, JUD-100, and a declaration by a percipient witness (i.e. Plaintiff) of the damages suffered with admissible supporting evidence of the damages sought. At the time, Plaintiff did not file a CIV-100 or a declaration with supporting admissible evidence. (Min. Order, Oct. 5, 2023.)  On October 19, 2023, Plaintiff sought to cure these defects by filing the aforementioned documents. However, Plaintiff used CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2007], which is an outdated form. Plaintiff must use CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2023], which can be found and downloaded from the court’s online website. Further, the Court notes that CIV-100, item 8 is required per CRC 3.1800(a)(5), and Plaintiff did not sign this portion.   Plaintiff’s action arises from an automobile accident, wherein Plaintiff provides he sustained property damage approximating $4,500. As a result of the property damage, Plaintiff had to rent cars for several months from Enterprise for 2 years, amounting to $9,600. Plaintiff also alleges physical injuries to his neck, head, left shoulder, legs, and back. Plaintiff also contends his medical specials amount to approximately $34,000. However, Plaintiff provides he “will not submit his medical records due to privacy reasons.”   Plaintiff submits no evidence of any of any property damage or any evidence supporting the request for medical specials and general damages. Plaintiff avers he will not submit his medical records for privacy reasons. However, the Court notes that in general, when a Plaintiff makes a claim for personal injuries, the right to privacy regarding Plaintiff’s conditions that he puts directly at issue are waived by filing suit for the related injuries. (Evid. Code, § 996.)  Moreover, to recover property damages and special damages, Plaintiff must substantiate this claim by way of documentation, such as through bills or other records. Plaintiff must provide authenticated and admissible evidence in support of amount of damages sought. (CRC 3.1800(a)(2).) A defaulting defendant admits only the well pled facts concerning liability, not damages; Plaintiff must still introduce admissible prima facie evidence of damages. (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361.) Plaintiff must also provide support for his general damages of pain and suffering with substantiating evidence.   Cal. Civ. Code § 3283 further provides that damages may be awarded in a judicial proceeding for detriment resulting after the commencement thereof, or certain to result in the future. Courts may not award speculative damages, which means compensation for future loss or harm which, although possible, is conjectural or not reasonably certain. (Scognamillo v. Herrick (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1139, 1151 (disapproved of by Lewis v. Ukran (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 886 on other grounds) (citing Bellman v. San Francisco H.S. Dist. (1938) 11 Cal.2d 576, 588).)  Any and all documents provided in support of the damages must be authenticated by way of Plaintiff’s sworn declaration testifying that the item is what it is claimed to be and that he has personal knowledge of the contents contained therein.   Plaintiff also alleges Defendant called him racial slurs and attempted to urinate on him, and seeks $25,000 for humiliation, sadness, grief, and suffering, alleging the act was a hate crime. There is no evidence that the automobile collision was the result of a hate crime. Although Defendant’s alleged slurs against Plaintiff are unacceptable and not condoned, this does not rise to the level of malice and oppression under California Civil Code 3294, nor does Defendant provide any evidence of continued pain and suffering from being called racial slurs.   Plaintiff also seeks punitive damages in the amount of $100,000 for Defendant’s alleged drunk driving and fleeing the scene of the accident. However, Plaintiff’s complaint alleging that Defendant “was drunk driving and caused it to collide with Plaintiff’s automobile with a great impact” (Compl. at ¶12) and that “Defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol and/or other substances or drugs when he caused Plaintiff’s injuries” (Compl. at ¶19.) is insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. Civil Code § 3294 includes a requirement that conduct in conscious disregard of the rights and safety of others be “despicable” in order to support imposition of punitive damages. Allegations that Defendant was intoxicated while driving, without more, is insufficient to meet the standard of imposing punitive damages. Further, in order to recover punitive damages, Plaintiff must prove up Defendant’s net worth. (Adams v. Murakami (1991) 54 Cal.3d 105, 110-12; see also Cummings Medical Corp v. Occupational Medical Corp. (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1291 [some measure of the effect of a punitive damages award in terms of deterrence is required before punitive damages may be awarded in a default judgment].) A court may not award punitive damages in a default judgment setting when the plaintiff fails to present any evidence of a defendant's financial condition, net worth, and ability to pay. (Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal. App.3d 381, 384; Lara v. Cadag (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1061,1064-65.)   No later than _______, Plaintiff is to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects.  Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to ___________.
