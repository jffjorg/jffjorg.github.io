And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Defendant Platinum Security, Inc.'s motions to compel Plaintiff Nico Quiros to respond to discovery requests. The Defendant propounded discovery requests on August 17, 2022, and Plaintiff failed to respond despite being granted two 30-day extensions. The judge finds that Plaintiff was properly served with the discovery requests and that Plaintiff's failure to respond waives any objections. The judge orders Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the discovery requests within 30 days. Additionally, the judge awards sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $810, which includes $630 in attorney's fees and $180 in costs. The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement before the hearing, and if a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court.
