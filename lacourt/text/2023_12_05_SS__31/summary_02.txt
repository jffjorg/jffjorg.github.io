English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Michelle C. Kim regarding a motion to compel further discovery responses filed by plaintiff Danielle Hemple against defendant Bristol Farms. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant's negligence caused a slip and fall incident on February 3, 2019, and seeks to compel the defendant to provide further responses to special interrogatories. The court notes that the plaintiff did not participate in an informal discovery conference (IDC) prior to filing the motion, which is premature and must be continued to a new date. The parties are ordered to participate in an IDC and submit a joint statement of items in dispute at least two weeks prior to the continued hearing date. The court encourages the parties to meet and confer to resolve outstanding issues and hopes that the hearing on the motions to compel further will not be necessary.
