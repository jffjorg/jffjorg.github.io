 Case Number:  22STCV21393    Hearing Date:   December 5, 2023    Dept:  31 SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT  NICO QUIROS, Plaintiff(s),  vs.  WHOLE FOODS MARKET CALIFORNIA, INC., ET AL.,  Defendant(s). ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )       CASE NO: 22STCV21393  [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING UNOPPOSED MOTIONS TO COMPEL  Dept. 31 1:30 p.m.  December 5, 2023  I.  Motions to Compel Defendant Platinum Security, Inc. ("Defendant”) propounded (1) form interrogatories, set one, (2) special interrogatories, set one, and (3) request for production of documents (“RPDs”), set one, on Plaintiff Nico Quiros (“Plaintiff”) on August 17, 2022. Plaintiff’s responses were due on or before September 20, 2022. After granting Plaintiff two 30-day extensions on October 19, 2022, and then on November 4, 2022, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a motion to be relieved as counsel, which was heard and granted on January 18, 2023. On March 2, 2023, defense counsel sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff in pro per. Plaintiff did not respond to the correspondence and has not served responses to date. Defendant therefore seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions.  The instant motions were served on Plaintiff in pro per. The motions are unopposed. For a motion to compel initial discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); § 2031.300, subd. (a).)   Therefore, because the evidence shows Plaintiff was properly served with discovery and failed to respond, Defendant’s motions are GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to Defendant Platinum Security, Inc.’s form interrogatories, set one, special interrogatories, set one, and RPDs, set one, without objections, within thirty (30) days. (CCP §§ 2030.290(a),(b), 2031.300(a),(b).)  II. Sanctions Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).)¿ Plaintiff did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition was filed, pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). Defendant seeks sanctions in the amount of $1,005 for the motion.     A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)     Defendant is awarded 1 hour to prepare each motion at the requested rate of $210 per hour, for a total of $630 in attorney’s fees. Further, Defendant is awarded three motion filing fees of $60, for a total of $180 as costs.     Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff.  Plaintiff is ordered to pay sanctions to Defendant, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $810, within thirty (30) days.  Moving Defendant is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 4th day of December 2023      Hon.
