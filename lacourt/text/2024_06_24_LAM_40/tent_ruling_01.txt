  Case Number:  22STCV19207    Hearing Date:   June 24, 2024    Dept:  40 After review of the record in relation to the pending April 26, 2024, order re: Defendant Vopak North America, Inc. (Vopak), the Court notes as follows. On April 26, 2024, the Court took under submission an application for determination of good faith settlement between Defendant Vopak North America, Inc. (Vopak) and Plaintiff Gresham Lombard. The application was tentatively granted "on the condition of (1) clarification as to proper service on all Defendants that had appeared in this action on February 26, 2024, and (2) clarification as to the terms of the settlement, filed and served no later than June 17, 2024." On April 30, 2024, Vopak filed a proposed order with the Court in relation to its application. No declaration or other filing clarified the two points raised by the Court in the April 26, 2024, order. The record as of the time of this order fails to reflect a clarification from Vopak as to the two questions raised in the April 26, 2024, order. Such a clarification must be properly filed and served by June 17, 2024, as previously ordered. The Court notes for counsel that filings with the Court’s e-system can take one or two court days to appear on the Court’s staff’s docket for this action.
