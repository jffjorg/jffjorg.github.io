  Case Number:  22STCV19207    Hearing Date:   June 24, 2024    Dept:  40  

After review of the record in relation to the
pending April 26, 2024, order re: Defendant Vopak North America, Inc.
(Vopak), the Court notes as follows.

 

On April 26, 2024, the Court took under
submission an application for determination of good faith settlement between
Defendant Vopak and Plaintiff Gresham Lombard. The application was tentatively
granted “on the condition of (1) clarification as to proper service on all
Defendants that had appeared in this action on February 26, 2024, and (2)
clarification as to the terms of the settlement, filed and served no later than
June 17, 2024.”

 

On April 30, 2024, Vopak filed a proposed order
with the Court in relation to its application. The proposed order attaches a
proof of service purporting to reflect service of the February 26, 2024,
application on all parties in this action as required by Code of Civil
Procedure section 877.6, subdivision (a)(2). However, the proof of service does
not satisfy the Court’s April 26, 2024, directive because the current proof of
service is unsigned, rendering it ineffective.

 

Moreover, Vopak has not filed any documents—memo
or declaration—clarifying the terms of the settlement.

 

These deficiencies must be rectified prior to
the Court granting Vopak’s application for determination of good faith
settlement.

 

Vopak should file updated documents by June 17,
2024, but no later than June 23, 2024.  Filings with the Court’s e-system
can take one or more court days to appear on the Court’s staff’s docket. If
Vopak makes filings within two court days of the June 24, 2024, hearing, Vopak
should email PDF courtesy copies of the filings to the Court’s resource account
at SMCDept40@lacourt.org.
