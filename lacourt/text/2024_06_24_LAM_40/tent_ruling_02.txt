 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff’s Demurrer to Defendant’s Answer and Affirmative
  Defenses [Res ID # 9809].



 
I. Background
On January 16, 2024,
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Aidee Jacqueline Tinoco Bucio (Plaintiff) filed her
operative First Amended Complaint in this action (FAC).
On February 26, 2024, Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Khowsrow Benji and Defendant Anna Benji (the Benji Defendants) filed an Answer
to the FAC.
On March 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
demurrer challenging the Answer’s 16 affirmative defenses.
On June 12, 2024, at a hearing relating
to a different motion, the Court ordered the parties to meet and confer
regarding whether Plaintiff’s demurrer would be taken off calendar based on
discussions with the Court at that hearing.
No opposition, reply, or notice of
non-opposition appear in the record. However, on June 20, 2 court days before the
hearing, the Defendant/Cross-Complainant filed a purported Amended Answer. 
Plaintiff’s demurrer is now before
the Court.
 
II. Demurrer:
SUSTAINED with leave to amend, in part, and without leave to amend, in part.
A. Legal Standard
A general demurrer to an answer can
be based on the ground that the answer does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (a); Timberidge
Enters. v. City of Santa Rosa (1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 873, 880; see e.g., Richard
B. Levine v. Higashi (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 566, 573, fn. 4 [answer that
pled statute of limitations as defense but did not comply with pleading
requirement in Code of Civil Procedure section 458 was subject to demurrer];
Universal Land Co. v. All Persons (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 739, 741-743 [demurrer
to answer appropriate where defense is barred by statute of limitations or
laches].)
The general demurrer to an answer
admits all facts well pleaded in the answer, including denials. (Warren v.
Harootunian (1961) 189 Cal.App.2d 546, 548.) For purposes of a demurrer,
each defense in the answer must be considered separately without regard to any
other defense, and thus, a separately stated defense that is sufficient in form
and substance when viewed in isolation does not become insufficient when, on
looking at the answer as a whole, that defense appears inconsistent with other
parts of the answer. (South Shore Land Co. v.
Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 733-734.) As a result, if one of
the defenses or counterclaims is free from the objections urged by demurrer,
then a demurrer to the entire answer must be overruled. (Id. at p. 734;
see Eich v. Greely (1896) 112 Cal. 171, 172-73.) Further, a demurrer may
not be made however to only part of a defense. (Reed v. Drais (1885) 67
Cal 491, 491.) Instead, to determine the sufficiency of a defense, the
individual defense must be considered as a whole. (Ferrier v. Ferrier
(1883) 64 Cal 23, 23.)
B. Court’s Determination
Plaintiff challenges the sixteen
affirmative defenses raised in the Khowsrow Defendants Answer based on three
general grounds: (1) the affirmative defenses merely state a defense without
supporting factual allegations; (2) some of the purported affirmative defenses
are, per established precedent, no defenses at all; and (3) the defenses fail
to identify to which claim(s) they apply.
No opposition, reply, or notice of
non-opposition appear in the record. While the Defendants/Cross-Complainants filed
a purported Amended Answer on June 20, two court days before the hearing, that
filing was untimely (Code Civ. Proc. § 1005 subd. (b)) and does not appear,
even on a brief review, to have resolved all the issues identified below.
The Court finds in favor of
Plaintiff.
The demurrer is SUSTAINED with
leave to amend as to affirmative defenses nos. 4, 7, 9 to 11, and 13 to 16. The
Benji Defendants’ Answer is conclusory in that it states affirmative defenses
without factual allegations supporting these defenses. (Demurrer, pp. 7-8; see Code
Civ. Proc., § 431.30, subd. (b)(2) [answer must contain statement of any new
matter constituting defense]; Quantification Settlement Agreement Cases (2011)
201 Cal.App.4th 758, 812-813 [affirmative defenses must be pleaded with as much
detail as causes of action].)
The demurrer is also SUSTAINED with
leave to amend as to affirmative defenses nos. 5, 8, and 12. While these
affirmative defenses specifically allege ultimate facts supporting them, they
fail to identify the cause of action to which they pertain. For example, the
twelfth affirmative defense involves a good faith dispute as to failure to pay
wages under the Labor Code and Wage Orders. (Answer, p. 4.) However, that
defense at most can pertain to some of the Labor Code claims in the FAC, and
not at all to the FEHA claims. The same reasoning—failure to identify
applicable cause(s) of action—applies to affirmative defenses nos. 4, 7, 9 to
11, and 13 to 15.
Last, the demurrer is SUSTAINED without
leave to amend as to affirmative defenses nos. 1 [failure to state a claim], 2
[plaintiff caused damage], 3 [no proximate cause], and 6 [intervening and
superseding acts], based on the published California authorities cited in the
opposition, which provide that ‘failure to state a claim’ or defenses that merely
attempt to challenge an element of a cause of action are not affirmative
defenses for the purposes of an answer. (Mot, pp. 8-9, citing Bracker v. Am.
Nat’l Food, Inc. (1955) 133 Cal.App.2d 338, 340 [a failure to state a claim
is not an affirmative defense] and Rancho Santa Marg. v. Vail (1938) 11
Cal.2d 501, 543 [an affirmative defense must “create[] a new issue” on which
the defendant bears the burden of proof, and cannot merely be a “traverse” that
contradicts an existing cause of action]; see Code Civ. Proc., § 431.30, subd. (b)(2)
[answer must contain statement of any new matter constituting defense].) 
III. Conclusion
Plaintiff’s Demurrer to Defendant’s
Answer and Affirmative Defenses [Res ID # 9809] is SUSTAINED as follows:
(1) SUSTAINED with leave to amend
as to the Answer’s fourth to fifth and seventh to sixteenth affirmative
defenses; and
(2) SUSTAINED without leave to
amend as to the Answer’s first to third and sixth affirmative defenses.
Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Khowsrow Benji and Defendant Anna Benji shall file an amended answer within ten
court days of this order.
