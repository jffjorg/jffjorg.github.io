And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to continue the trial date. The defendant argued that it needed more time to prepare for trial because it had recently substituted in new counsel and had not yet obtained the plaintiff's medical records from out-of-state facilities. The defendant also argued that it would be prejudiced if it was forced to appear at trial without the county defendants, who had not yet approved the settlement between the county defendants and the plaintiff.

The plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that the defendant had had ample time to prepare for trial and that the defendant's failure to obtain the medical records was due to its own lack of diligence. The court agreed with the plaintiff, finding that the defendant had failed to articulate what specific discovery was necessary and that the defendant had filed the motion too close to the trial date.

The court also noted that the matter of settlement was a foregone conclusion, with the county defendants having already agreed to a good faith settlement with the plaintiff. Therefore, the court denied the defendant's motion to continue the trial date.
