And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Mothers In Action, Inc. (MIA) to the complaint filed by Angela Taylor. The complaint alleges that MIA was negligent in maintaining the premises where Taylor tripped and fell on October 15, 2022. MIA argues that the loss location was owned by the Los Angeles County Metro Transit Authority (LACMTA) and that Taylor made a claim to LACMTA, which bars her claim against MIA. The judge finds that MIA has fulfilled the requirement to meet and confer prior to filing the demurrer and that the function of a demurrer is to test the legal sufficiency of a complaint, not the truthfulness of the allegations. The judge also finds that it is sufficient that Taylor's complaint alleges that she tripped and fell on exposed wires and that "All Defendants" negligently owned, maintained, managed, and operated the premises. Therefore, the judge has OVERRULED MIA's demurrer to the complaint.
