And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Cross-Defendants' motion to vacate the entry of default judgment. The motion was filed late, as it was filed more than six months after the judgment was entered. The judge also found that Cross-Defendants' failure to defend the original action was not excusable neglect. Cross-Defendants claimed that they never received actual notice of the Cross-Complaint, but the judge found that their lack of notice was caused by their own inexcusable neglect, as they had been put on notice of the Cross-Complaint and failed to take any action. The judge also found that Cross-Defendants' counsel's declaration failed to establish that his lack of actual notice was not based on inexcusable neglect. As a result, the judge denied the motion and upheld the default judgment.
