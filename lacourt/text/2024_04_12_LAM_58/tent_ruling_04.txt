            This
action arises from Plaintiff Stephen Kushnir’s $50,000 investment in Defendant Jeremy
David Lehive’s company in exchange for a 25% interest in this business. On
November 10, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint alleging cause of action for (1)
Breach of Contract; (2) Negligent Misrepresentation; (3) Fraud; (4) Violation
of Corp. Code § 25110; (5) Violation of Corp. Code § 25401; (6) Violation of
Corp. Code § 25504; (7) Violation of Corp. Code § 25504.1; (8) Violation of Bus.
& Prof. Code §§ 17200 et seq.; and (9) Money Had and Received.
 
            No
responsive pleading was filed. Default was entered as to Defendant Jeremy David Lehive on February 8, 2024. Further, Does
1-20 have been dismissed. 
 
            Plaintiff
now moves for default judgment against Defendant Jeremy David Lehive. The
request for entry of default judgment is denied. 
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendant Lehive in
the amount of $264,189.67, which includes $12,506.82 in interest and $1,669.15
in costs. 
 
            “Plaintiffs
in a default judgment proceeding must prove they are entitled to the damages
claimed.” (Barragan v. Banco BCH (1986) 188 Cal.App.3d 283, 302 [citing
Code Civ. Proc., § 585 and Taliaferro v. Hoogs (1963) 219 Cal.App.2d
559, 560].) If evidence is presented by declaration, the facts must be shown to
be “within the personal knowledge of the affiant and shall be set forth with
particularity, and each affidavit shall show affirmatively that the affiant, if
sworn as a witness, can testify competently thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 585,
subd. (d).)
 
            Here,
Plaintiff provides a declaration adequately evidencing Plaintiff’s damages in
the amount of $30,000. (Kushnir Decl., ¶¶ 1-8.) However, Plaintiff’s request
for general damages including emotional distress, loss of use of the investment
funds, financial uncertainties, and the substantial time and effort devoted to
the investment and seeking my money back, in the total amount of $200,000 is
entirely without inadequate and without foundation. (Kushnir Decl., ¶ 8.) 
 
            Nor
has Plaintiff provided an adequate calculation for its prejudgment interest
request of $12,506.82. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(3).) In particular,
Plaintiff does not identify when the interest began to accrue on his claim. 
 
            However,
Plaintiff has substantiated his request for costs in the amount of $1,669.15. (4/3/24
Memo. of Costs.)
 
Accordingly, the
request for entry of default judgment is denied. 
 
Alternatively, the
Court will enter default judgment against Defendant Lehive in the amount of
$30,000 plus interest and costs upon the submission of an adequate interest
calculation.
