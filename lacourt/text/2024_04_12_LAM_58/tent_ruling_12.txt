[1]           Notably, Plaintiff
also seeks to take discovery to obtain “evidence that in fact Jabarian’s
statements were false . . ..” (Mot., 2:2-4; see also Mot., 4:12-14, 6:16-24.)
As the opposition notes, the anti-SLAPP motion does not argue the defense of
substantial truth as to most of the challenged statements (except with respect
to reports in the publication regarding litigation between the Armenian Church
and Petros Taglyan). Thus, discovery for the purposes of demonstrating the falsity
cannot be a basis for granting this motion where it is not at issue in the
anti-SLAPP motion and is within Plaintiff’s own personal knowledge. (Mattel, Inc. v. Luce, Forward, Hamilton & Scripps (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1190 [“[D]iscovery should be limited to
the issues raised in the special motion to strike.”].)


[2]           From the
motion, it is unclear what specific documents Plaintiff seeks as no specific
document demand is provided.
