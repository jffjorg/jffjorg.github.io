And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to strike a lawsuit (anti-SLAPP motion) filed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff is seeking to take discovery to obtain evidence that the defendant's statements were false. However, the anti-SLAPP motion does not argue the defense of substantial truth for most of the challenged statements, except for reports in the publication regarding litigation between the Armenian Church and Petros Taglyan. The judge notes that discovery should be limited to the issues raised in the special motion to strike, and therefore, the plaintiff cannot use discovery to demonstrate the falsity of the challenged statements.
