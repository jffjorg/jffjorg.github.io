Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant in the amount of $264,189.67, which includes $12,506.82 in interest and $1,669.15 in costs. The court found that the plaintiff's request for general damages, including emotional distress, loss of use of the investment funds, financial uncertainties, and the substantial time and effort devoted to the investment and seeking a refund, in the total amount of $200,000, was entirely without foundation. The court also found that the plaintiff did not provide an adequate calculation for its prejudgment interest request. However, the court did find that the plaintiff was entitled to recover $30,000 in damages, plus interest and costs, upon the submission of an adequate interest calculation.
