English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to conduct limited discovery to oppose the anti-SLAPP motion. The court finds that the plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of defamation and that the defendants have not contested the evidence of falsity. The court grants discovery from Defendant Jabarian, the primary source of evidence, to determine the factual basis for his statements. The court also denies the motion for discovery from non-party declarants, finding that the declarants' statements are based on hearsay and are not relevant to the issue of actual malice. The court grants the plaintiff's motion to take the deposition of Defendant Jabarian and denies the motion to obtain discovery from the non-party declarants.
