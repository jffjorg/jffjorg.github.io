English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Odalis C. Suarez's motion for summary judgment of the cross-complaint by cross-complainants Brad Korb, In Action Realtors, Inc., and Heather Tyler. The cross-complainants seek indemnity from Suarez for damages allegedly caused by her breach of duty to Perry Lazar, the buyer of the property. Suarez argues that she did not breach her duty to Lazar and that cross-complainants' fraud proximately caused the damages. The judge finds that there are triable issues of material fact on whether Suarez breached her duty to Lazar and whether cross-complainants' fraud occurred. The judge also finds that Suarez's reliance on FATCO's employee Pascual's statements was not reasonable and that Suarez failed to meet her burden of showing that she did not proximately cause any damages to Lazar.
