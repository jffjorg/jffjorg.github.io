Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by plaintiffs/cross-defendants/cross-complainants Perry Lazar and Plone Trust. The court has denied the motions for the following reasons:

* The plaintiffs have not met their burden of showing they own parcel 36, which is a disputed property.
* The court has granted judicial notice of certain documents, but has denied judicial notice of others.
* The court has overruled certain objections to evidence and sustained others.
* The court has denied the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication because the plaintiffs have not shown that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
* The court has denied the motion for quiet title to parcel 36 because the plaintiffs have not shown that they own the northern portion of parcel 36, which is necessary to assert an easement by necessity and easement by reservation.
* The court has denied the motion for cancellation of the correction deed because the plaintiffs have not shown that they own the northern portion of parcel 36.

The court has ordered quiet title to parcel 36, but has not made any final determinations on the issues. The parties are directed to file further briefing and evidence as necessary to resolve the disputes.
