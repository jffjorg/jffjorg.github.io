  Case Number:  21STCV19845    Hearing Date:   December 8, 2023    Dept:  52 Plaintiffs Perry Lazar and Plone
Trust’s Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary
Adjudication
Plaintiffs/cross-defendants/cross-complainants
Perry Lazar and Plone Trust move for summary judgment or summary adjudication
of several causes of action in three different pleadings.
Requests for Judicial Notice
Lazar and Plone Trust make eight
requests for judicial notice of documents. The documents are “[o]fficial acts”
of government entities (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (c)), including recorded
property instruments (see Yvanova
v. New Century Mortgage Corp.
(2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 924, fn. 1), and court
records (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d)(1)). 
The court takes judicial notice of the existence of the documents and
their legal effects but not the truth of their contents or statements of fact.  (See Williams
v. Wraxall (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 120, 130, fn. 7; Gilmore v. Superior
Court (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 416, 418.)
The court grants plaintiffs’ requests for judicial notice Nos.
1-8.
Defendants William E. Devin, III
and Bruce R. Cook request judicial notice of two documents.  Both are court records subject to judicial
notice for their existence and legal effects. 
The court grants Devin and Cook’s requests for judicial notice
Nos. 1 and 2.  
Defendants/cross-complainants
Kalousd Pandazos and Dalila Pandazos request judicial notice of exhibits A-H.  Exhibits A and D-H are real property
instruments subject to judicial notice as discussed above.  Exhibits B and C are administrative accusations
by the Board for Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors, and Geologists against
plaintiffs’ expert witness, Mark D. Sandstrom. 
Assuming they are subject to judicial notice, the documents are not
relevant or necessary to the court’s analysis. 
(See Jordache Enterprises, Inc. v. Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison (1998)
18 Cal.4th 739, 748, fn. 6; Appel v.
Superior Court (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 329, 342, fn. 6.)
The court grants judicial notice of exhibits A and D-H.  The court denies judicial notice of exhibits B and C.
Evidentiary Objections
            Plaintiffs
make 17 objections to the evidence presented by defendants/cross-complainants
Kalousd Pandazos and Dalila Pandazos. 
Objection Nos. 1-10 and 13-17 are overruled.  Objection Nos. 11 and 12 are sustained.  
Plaintiffs make three objections to
the evidence presented by cross-defendant Crescenta Valley Water District.  Objection Nos. 1-3 are overruled.
Legal Standard
A “motion for summary
judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
a judgment as a matter of law.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)  Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing
summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.”  (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)  
A plaintiff moving for
summary judgment “must prove each element of the cause of action on which he
seeks judgment.  Once the plaintiff meets
this burden, the burden shifts to the defendant to show there is a triable
issue of material fact as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.”  (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel
(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1337; Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).)  The court must deny a plaintiff’s motion for
summary judgment if the defendant meets its “burden of showing the existence of
a triable issue of material fact as to any available affirmative defense.”  (Oldcastle Precast, Inc. v. Lumbermens
Mutual Casualty Co. (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 554, 568.)
A defendant moving for summary
judgment must show “that one or more elements of the cause of action… cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)  Once the
defendant does so, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show a triable issue
of at least one material fact.  (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 849.)  
Quiet Title to Fee Interest in Parcel 36
            Plaintiffs
Lazar and Plone Trust move for summary adjudication of their complaint’s first
cause of action for quiet title to a fee interest in parcel 36 against
defendants (a) Cook and Devin and (b) Dalila and Kalousd Pandazos.  As cross-defendants, Lazar and Plone Trust
move for summary adjudication of the first cause of action alleged by Dalila
and Kalousd Pandazos’s second amended cross-complaint for quiet title to a fee
interest in parcel 36.  
The purpose of a quiet title action
“ ‘is to finally settle and determine, as between the parties, all conflicting
claims to the property in controversy, and to decree to each such interest or
estate therein as he [or she] may be entitled to.’ ”  (Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. v. Pyle (2017)
13 Cal.App.5th 513, 524 (Deutsche Bank).)  The plaintiff “must file a verified complaint
including a description of the property, the basis for the plaintiff’s claim of
title, the adverse claims the plaintiff seeks to adjudicate, the date as of which
the plaintiff seeks to adjudicate those claims, and a prayer for the
determination of the plaintiff’s title against the adverse claims.”  (Ibid.) It is axiomatic that, in a
quiet title action, “the plaintiff must prove his title in order to recover.”  (Preciado v. Wilde (2006) 139
Cal.App.4th 321, 326.)
Plaintiffs’ evidence, even if undisputed, does not prove as a
matter of law that they own parcel 36.  Plaintiffs’
claim of title relies on discrepancies between the assessor’s parcel numbers
(APNs) and the legal descriptions in three grant deeds.  Plaintiffs have not shown they can rely on
the APNs, rather than the legal descriptions by metes and bounds by reference
to recorded tract maps.  “An assessor’s
parcel number, also referred to as an ‘ “APN” ... is a numerical identifier
associated with a particular piece of property for property tax assessment
purposes.’ ”  (MTC Financial Inc. v.
California Dept. of Tax & Fee Administration (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 742,
745, fn. 4 (MTC).)  “Generally,
such a number corresponds to an assessor’s map [citation], which is a type of
map that does not have to necessarily correspond with the actual physical
location of a property.”  (Id. at
pp. 749-750.)   
            Revenue and Taxation Code section 327 provides that a
county assessor may use an “accurate map” and assessor parcel numbers in
connection with his or her duties.  The
statute further provides: “Land may be described by a reference to this map
except that land shall not be described in any deed or conveyance by a
reference to any such map unless such map has been filed for record in the
office of the county recorder of the county in which such land is located.”  (Ibid.)
            Revenue and Taxation Code section 11911.1 provides that
an assessor’s parcel “number will be used only for administrative and
procedural purposes and will not be proof of title and in the event of any
conflicts, the stated legal description noted upon the document shall govern.”  In XPO Logistics Freight, Inc. v. Hayward
Property, LLC (2022) 79 Cal.App.5th 1166 (XPO), the Court of Appeal
has applied sections 327 and 11911.1 to hold that a description by metes and
bounds controlled over a reference to APN. 
The court held: 
In determining whether the property description in the
[deed’s] legal description is reasonably susceptible to the inclusion of
acreage beyond the metes and bounds description, Revenue and Taxation Code
sections 327 and 11911.1, read together, preclude basing any such
interpretation on the mere presence of the APN notations.  If a deed is recorded in a county with an
APN-notation requirement, and the deed bears APN notations referring to an unrecorded
assessor’s map, those APN notations may not be treated as part of the deed’s
legal description of the parcel conveyed unless the face of the deed clearly
indicates such an intention.  [Fn.]  While an APN reference might be considered in
resolving an ambiguity that otherwise appears in a deed, the inclusion of the
APN reference does not itself create an ambiguity.  Otherwise, potentially every deed recorded in
a county with an APN-notation requirement would be rendered ambiguous.             
(Id. at p. 1177,
italics added.)
            Plaintiffs present evidence that the grant deed from
Devin and Cook to the Pandazoses recorded December 9, 2003, purports to convey
APN 5867-011-035 but the “legal description attached to the Deed as Exhibit A
includes the metes and bounds of both parcel 35 and parcel 36.”  (Sandstrom Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. E.)  Plaintiffs have not, however, established that
the applicable assessor’s map was recorded. 
If the map was unrecorded, then under XPO their quiet title claim
fails.  This is because under the legal
description of metes and bounds in the December 9, 2003, grant deed, Devin and
Cook sold the entire parcel 36 to the Pandazoses.  Devin and Cook therefore could not have
conveyed title to any part of parcel 36—a property they did not own—to Lazar in
March 2004.
Assuming the
assessor’s map was recorded, the court cannot conclude, on this record, that
plaintiffs are entitled to summary adjudication as a matter of law.  “A deed is a contract subject to all usual
rules of contract interpretation.”  (XPO,
supra, 79 Cal.App.5th at p. 1177.) 
Lazar and Plone Trust must show a basis to resolve the deeds’ ambiguous
legal descriptions by proving the parties intended to transfer properties as
described by the deeds’ APNs instead of their metes and bounds.  “A fundamental rule of contract formation and
interpretation is that the terms of a contract are determined by the parties’
objective manifestations of consent.”  (Tufeld
Corporation v. Beverly Hills Gateway, L.P. (2022) 86 Cal.App.5th 12, 30.)  Plaintiffs have not shown the parties
objectively manifested consent to transfer property as described by the deeds’
APNs rather than metes and bounds.
Plaintiffs rely
on deposition testimony by Bruce R. Cook, one of the two sellers of the
disputed properties.  (M. Separate
Statement, UMF No. 14.)  But he did not
testify regarding what he objectively manifested to the Pandazoses or Lazar in
the property transactions.  He testified
he did not “deed APN 036 to the Pandazoses” at any time.  (M. Ex. 17, Cook Depo., 37:15-23.)  Cook further testified: “Q. And when you sold
APN 035 to the Pandazoses in 2003, what was your understanding of what APN --
well, did you form an understanding as to what APN 035 consisted of?  A. Well, yes. 
My understanding was that it was a 56-wide strip along Ridgepine Road
and Pine Glen Road.”  (Id.,
73:10-15.)  His understanding of the
meaning of APN 035 does not show what he objectively manifested to the
Pandazoses regarding the transaction. 
Plaintiffs also
rely on the Pandazoses’ admissions that they “did not purchase APN 035 in 2003”
or “in 2004” and “have never purchased APN 036.”  (M. Ex. 10, p. 0090, RFA Nos. 9-11; Ex. 11,
p. 0107, response Nos. 9-11.)  These
requests for admission by cross-defendant First American Title Company defined “APN
036” as “that vacate [sic] property that is the subject of this litigation and
with an APN of 5867-011-036.”  (M. Ex.
10, p. 0089, definition No. 4.) 
When read in
context and in the light most favorable to the opposing parties, these
admissions do not prove the Pandazoses never purchased any of the land
plaintiffs now claim as part of parcel 36. 
Their responses do not show they accepted the proposition that APN 036
included both the portions to the north and south of APN 035.  The Pandazoses objected to these requests as
vague, ambiguous, and unintelligible.  (Ex.
11, p. 0107, response Nos. 9-11.)  To
other requests, they responded they lacked sufficient information to admit or
deny that “APN 035 is approximately 83,844 square feet” (Ex. 10, p. 0090, RFA
No. 3; Ex. 11, p. 0107, response No. 3), that “APN 036 is approximately 330,645
square feet” (Ex. 10, p. 0090, RFA No. 12; Ex. 11, p. 0107, response No. 12),
and that “APN 036 consists of two noncontiguous lots” (Ex. 10, p. 0090, RFA No.
14; Ex. 11, p. 0108, response No. 14).
Plaintiffs
further rely on the declaration of Odalis C. Suarez, buyer Lazar’s real estate
agent in the purchase.  (Suarez Decl., ¶ 4.)  Her testimony about which property the Pandazoses
purchased (before the sale to Lazar) relies on Cook’s deposition testimony
described above.  (Id., ¶ 10.)  It therefore does not prove what the sellers
objectively manifested to the Pandazoses.
Causes of Action for Cancellation
of Instrument
            Lazar and Plone Trust move for summary adjudication of
their first cause of action, which combines quiet title to parcel 36 with
cancellation of the “correction deed” from Devin and Cook to the Pandazoses on
March 1, 2004.  Lazar and Plone Trust
also move for summary adjudication of the fourth cause of action for
cancellation of the same “correction deed” alleged against them in the second
amended cross-complaint by the Pandazoses. 

            Lazar and Plone Trust do not meet their initial burden of
presenting evidence that, if undisputed, establishes they are entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.  “Where a
complaint seeks to quiet title to real property and cancel an instrument and
both claims are based on the same facts, it is said that the cancellation claim
is incidental to the claim to quiet title such that the action asserts only one
claim.”  (Deutsche Bank, supra, 13
Cal.App.5th at p. 523.)  These causes of
action for cancellation of instrument arise from the same facts and the same
dispute as the causes of action for quiet title to parcel 36.  Lazar and Plone Trust therefore are not
entitled to summary adjudication on these causes of action for the same reasons
discussed with respect to quiet title.
Plaintiffs’ Claims for Quiet Title
to Easement Across Parcel 35
            Plaintiffs
move for summary adjudication of their complaint’s second and third causes of
action for quiet title to easement by necessity and easement by reservation
against defendants (a) Cook and Devin and (b) Dalila and Kalousd Pandazos.  Plaintiffs’ second cause of action for
easement by necessity asserts an easement across parcel 35 “to access the
northern portion of parcel 36.”  (Comp.,
¶ 25.)  Their third cause of action for
easement by implied reservation similarly asserts “a right-of-way to pass” over
parcel 35 to access parcel 36.  (Id.,
¶ 28.)  
            An
easement for “right-of-way” is appurtenant and attached to the land it
benefits.  (Civ. Code, § 801, subd. 4.)  “ ‘An easement is appurtenant when it is
attached to the land of the owner of the easement, and benefits him as the
owner or possessor of that land.  The
land to which it is attached is called the dominant tenement, and the land
which bears the burden, i. e., the land of another which is used or enjoyed, is
called the servient tenement.’ ”  (City
of Anaheim v. Metropolitan Water Dist. of Southern Cal. (1978) 82 Cal.App.3d
763, 767.)  
Assuming an easement exists for
access across parcel 35 (as the servient tenement) to the northern portion of
parcel 36 (as the dominant tenement), plaintiffs cannot quiet title to that
easement in their favor without owning the dominant tenement.  As discussed above, plaintiffs have not met
their burden of showing they own the northern portion of parcel 36.  They therefore have not met their burden on summary
adjudication of these causes of action.   
Claims Against Crescenta Valley Water
District
On their first amended
cross-complaint against cross-defendant Crescenta Valley Water District,
plaintiffs/cross-complainants Lazar and Plone Trust move for summary
adjudication of the first cause of action for quiet title to a fee interest in
parcel 36 and the second and third causes of action for quiet title to easement
by necessity and easement by reservation. 

Lazar and Plone Trust do not meet
their initial burden on summary adjudication of these causes of action.  Crescenta Valley Water District claims an
interest in some of the northern portion of parcel 36.  The first amended cross-complaint’s causes of
action against Crescenta Valley Water District thus rely on plaintiffs’ ownership
of the northern portion of parcel 36.  For
the reasons discussed above, plaintiffs have not proven they own the northern
portion of parcel 36.  They therefore do
not meet their burden on summary adjudication of quiet title against Crescenta
Valley Water District.  
Disposition
Plaintiffs/cross-defendants/cross-complainants
Perry Lazar and Plone Trust’s motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication is denied.
