 Case Number:  21STCV34102    Hearing Date:   December 8, 2023    Dept:  52 Cross-Defendant Odalis C. Suarez’s Motion for
Summary Judgment
Cross-defendant Odalis C. Suarez moves
for summary judgment of the cross-complaint against her for
“declaratory relief/indemnity” by cross-complainants Brad Korb, In Action
Realtors, Inc., and Heather Tyler.
Requests for Judicial Notice
Suarez makes eight requests for judicial notice.  The
documents are “[o]fficial acts” of government entities (Evid. Code, § 452,
subd. (c)), including recorded property instruments (see Yvanova v. New Century Mortgage Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 924, fn. 1), and court records (Evid. Code, § 452, subd.
(d)(1)).  The court takes judicial notice
of the existence of the documents and their legal effects but not the truth of their
contents or statements of fact.  (See Williams v. Wraxall (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 120, 130, fn. 7; Gilmore v. Superior Court (1991) 230
Cal.App.3d 416, 418.)
The court grants Suarez’s requests for judicial notice Nos.
1-8.
Cross-complainants request judicial
notice of two documents.  Both are court
records subject to judicial notice for their existence and legal effects.  
The court grants cross-complainants’ requests for judicial
notice Nos. 1 and 2.  
Evidentiary Objections
            Cross-complainants make
105 objections to Suarez’s evidence.  Objection Nos. 16, 21, 27, 30-48, 50-66, 73,
78-96, and 105 are overruled. 
Objection Nos. 1-15, 17-20, 22-26, 28, 29, 49, 67-72, 74-77, and 97-104
are sustained. 

            Suarez makes 39
objections to cross-complainants’ evidence. 
Objection Nos. 1-11 and 20-39
are overruled. 
Objection Nos. 12-19 are sustained.  
Legal Standard
            A “motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all
the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material
fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)  Courts “liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.”  (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)  
A defendant moving for summary
judgment must show “that one or more elements of the cause of action… cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)  Once the
defendant does so, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show a triable issue
of at least one material fact.  (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 849.)  
Indemnity Based on Defendant’s Breach of Fiduciary Duty
            Suarez argues that
indemnity based on her purported breach of fiduciary duty to Lazar would be
against public policy.  (Motion, pp.
24-25.)  The court rejects this argument
for two reasons.  
First, Suarez relies on an “exception to the ordinary rules
of implied equitable indemnity” for claims against attorneys.  (Kroll & Tract v. Paris & Paris
(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 1537, 1541 (Kroll); accord Rowell v.
Transpacific Life Ins. Co. (1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 818, 821 (Rowell).)  She provides no authority that this exception
applies to real estate agents.  Here,
though Suarez was an attorney when she “represented Perry Lazar in the transaction
wherein he purchased” the subject property (Suarez Decl., ¶ 4), she was also a
real estate broker (id., ¶ 3). 
The purchase agreement states Suarez was the “real estate broker” for
Lazar.  (M. Ex. 44, p. 0859.)  Though she was also an attorney, Suarez does
not present evidence she represented Lazar in the property transaction as an
attorney.  
Second, the exception only applies to claims for indemnity
arising from a breach of fiduciary duty in the legal action against the person
bringing the claim for indemnity.  “[T]he
normal rules of indemnity from a subsequent exacerbating tortfeasor do not
apply where the alleged subsequent tort is connected with lawyer[’s]
representation of the plaintiff in his action against the one seeking
indemnity.”  (Rowell, supra,
94 Cal.App.3d at p. 821, italics added.) 
The exception applies “when the claim for indemnity is made against an
attorney, is based on a breach of the attorney’s duty to his or her client, and
is brought by an adverse party in litigation which is the same as or related to
that in which the alleged negligence took place.”  (California State Auto. Assn. Inter-Ins.
Bureau v. Bales (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 227, 230 (CSAA), italics
added.)
This exception could apply if Suarez’s breach of duty to
Lazar arose in representing Lazar in this civil action (or a related action)
against Korb, Tyler, and In Action Realty. 
Here, the basis for indemnity is Suarez’s alleged breach of duty to
Lazar in the real estate purchase in 2004. 
The exception does not apply.
Breach of Suarez’s Duty to Lazar
            Cross-complainants
allege a single cause of action against Suarez for “declaratory
relief/indemnity.”  “Ordinarily, where an
indivisible injury is caused by two or more tortfeasors, the tortfeasors may
claim against each other for implied equitable indemnity.”  (CSAA, supra, 221 Cal.App.3d at p.
230.)  
Suarez argues she did not breach her duty to Lazar because
she had no duty to protect Lazar from cross-complainants’ fraud.  (Motion, pp. 25-26; Reply, pp. 5-6.)  She provides no authority that purported
fraud by cross-complainants would absolve her of all liability for
indemnity.  The purpose of comparative equitable
indemnity is “the allocation of loss between joint tortfeasors.”  (American Motorcycle Assn. v. Superior
Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 578, 592 [adopting rule of comparative equitable indemnity instead of
“all-or-nothing” indemnity].)  “[A] party’s
liability for equitable indemnity is based on its proportional share of
responsibility for the damages.”  (Bay
Development, Ltd. v. Superior Court (1990) 50 Cal.3d 1012, 1031 (Bay
Development).)  
Indemnity does not require cross-complainants
to be blameless.  To the contrary, “joint
tortfeasors” generally means both parties in a claim for indemnity breached a
duty to the person harmed.  (See Rest.2d
Torts, § 886A, com. b. [“ ‘joint tortfeasors’ ” means “two or more persons who
are liable to the same person for the same harm”].)  Regardless of whether cross-complainants
breached a duty to Lazar or Suarez, Suarez can still be liable for indemnity if
she also breached a duty to Lazar. 
Assuming that fraud by
cross-complainants would defeat their cause of action for indemnity, the record shows triable issues of material fact on whether they breached
a duty to disclose information to Suarez and Lazar.  “Actionable
nondisclosure relates to facts not discoverable by the plaintiffs.”  (Sweat v. Hollister (1995) 37
Cal.App.4th 603, 608, disapproved on other grounds by Santisas v. Goodin
(1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 609, fn. 5.)  When
a seller or a seller’s agent “ ‘knows of facts materially affecting the value
or desirability of the property which are known or accessible only to him and
also knows that such facts are not known to, or within the reach of the
diligent attention and observation of the buyer, the seller is under a duty to
disclose them to the buyer.’ ”  (Holmes
v. Summer (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1518–1519.)  “[T]he information in question must be
unknown to, or outside ‘the diligent attention and observation of the buyer… .’
”  (Id. at p. 1520; accord Peake
v. Underwood (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 428, 445 [“a seller’s agent has no
affirmative duty to disclose latent defects unless the agent ‘also knows
that such facts are not known to, or within the reach of the diligent attention
and observation of the buyer’ ”].)  
Cross-complainants present evidence
sufficient to raise a triable issue of whether the relevant facts were within
the reach of Suarez’s diligent attention and observation.  Evidence in the record shows she received a
report disclosing some of the relevant facts—but did not read it.  During escrow in the transaction, Suarez
received a preliminary title report from First American Title Insurance Company
(FATCO).  (Suarez Decl., ¶ 14, Ex.
45.)  Text at the bottom of the report
indicates FATCO faxed it to Suarez on February 13, 2004.  (Ibid.)  The first page states, “Owner:
Pandazos.”  (Id., p. 1.)  Suarez knew that was wrong because Bruce Cook
and William Devin were the sellers. 
(Suarez Decl., ¶ 14.)
Cross-complainants submit evidence
Suarez did not read the rest of this preliminary title report before escrow
closed.  At her deposition, Suarez
testified that she had not “read the preliminary title report” before speaking
to FATCO employee Michelle Pascual about the report including “the wrong
owner.”  (Opp. Ex. B, Suarez Depo.,
49:1-4.)  Suarez further testified: “Q. Is
there a reason you didn't read the full preliminary title report when you first
got it?  A. Because the owner was showing
as Mr. Pandazos selling it to Lazar.  I
wanted to find out -- what's the point of reading a report if the owner is
wrong.”  (Id., 49:5-9.)    
That preliminary report’s
exceptions to coverage include “[t]he effect of a document entitled ‘Grant
Deed’, recorded December 9, 2003 as Instrument No. 03-3707014 of Official
Records.  [¶]  Note: Said document should [be] re-recorded
to show the correct legal description.” 
(M. Ex. 45, p. 0863, ¶ 7.)  The
report also states, “Information in possession of [FATCO] indicates that a
division of land may have occurred involving the land described herein.”  (Id., p. 0863, ¶ 8.)  “[T]he land described herein may not
constitute a lawfully created parcel according to the Subdivision Map
Act.”  (Ibid.)  The court cannot conclude that, as a matter
of law, this information would not have put Suarez on inquiry notice of the defects
in title to the property.  A reasonable
trier of fact could find that Suarez breached her duty of care to Lazar because
failing to read the entire report was not diligent.  The trier of fact could also find that, if
Suarez had been diligent, she would have mitigated or prevented the harm to
Lazar.    
Suarez relies on evidence
that FATCO’s employee Pascual told her to “disregard” the initial preliminary
title report.  Suarez provides no
authority she was, as a matter of law, entitled to rely on Pascual’s statements
because Pascual was a real estate professional speaking on behalf of the title
insurance company.  
Furthermore, this argument
cuts both ways.  Someone’s “particular
knowledge and experience should be considered in determining whether the
reliance upon the misrepresentation or nondisclosure was justified.”  (Hoffman v. 162 North Wolfe LLC (2014)
228 Cal.App.4th 1178, 1194.)  In Hoffman,
the court noted plaintiff was “an experienced real estate agent” in finding he
did not justifiably rely on the defendants’ nondisclosure in a real estate
transaction.  (Id. at p.
1197.)  The Court of Appeal has also held
that, as a matter of law, a lawyer did not justifiably rely on someone’s
representation about the meaning of a release. 
(Id. at p. 1194.)  
Here, Pascual and
cross-complainants were not the only real estate professionals involved in this
transaction.  Suarez was the buyer’s real
estate agent.  And she was a lawyer.  A reasonable trier of fact could conclude
that, given her knowledge and experience, Suarez’s reliance on Pascual and
cross-complainants’ representations was not reasonable.  
Proximate Cause
Suarez also argues cross-complainants
proximately caused the damages to Lazar. 
(Motion, pp. 20-21.)  But to be
entitled to judgment as a matter of law, she must prove not just that
cross-complainants proximately caused Lazar’s damages.  She must prove she did not proximately
cause any damages to Lazar.  As discussed
above, the purpose of comparative equitable indemnity is to impose liability
for the defendant’s “proportional share of responsibility for the damages.”  (Bay Development, supra, 50 Cal.3d at
p. 1031.)
            Suarez
does not meet that burden.  “ ‘ “[C]ausation ... is ordinarily a question
of fact which cannot be resolved by summary judgment.  The issue of causation may be decided as a
question of law only if, under undisputed facts, there is no room for a reasonable
difference of opinion.” ’ ”  (Kaney v.
Custance (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 201, 212.) 
There is room for a reasonable difference of opinion on whether Suarez
proximately caused any of Lazar’s damages. 
Cross-complainants present evidence supporting the reasonable inference that,
had Suarez met her duty of care to Lazar, she could have prevented his damages.
Disposition
            Cross-complainant Odalis
C. Suarez’s motion for summary judgment of the cross-complaint by
cross-complainants Brad Korb, In Action Realtors, Inc., and Heather Tyler is denied.
