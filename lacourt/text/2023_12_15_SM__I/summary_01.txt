And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is ruling on a motion by the plaintiff to recover fees related to a previous court case. The plaintiff is seeking $179,729.50 in fees, which is based on the hourly rates of lead counsel ($950-$1050 per hour) and co-counsel ($605-$685 per hour). The judge notes that while the plaintiff has provided declarations from counsel explaining the work done, more evidence is needed to support the request. Specifically, the judge wants to see contemporaneous billing records, which would provide a stronger evidence of the work done. Additionally, the judge wants to know more about the hourly rates charged to paying clients and whether the rates requested have ever been approved by a court. The judge is also concerned about the recoverability of all time worked, as some time may not be related to the underlying case. As a result, the judge is inclined to continue the motion to allow the plaintiff to submit supplemental evidence and a supplemental brief, and will discuss timing with the parties.
