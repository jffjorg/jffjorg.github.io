And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to compel further responses to certain requests for production brought by Cyberline is granted. The requests were propounded by Cyberline and opposed by Safady. The judge agrees with Cyberline that the requests are justified, but the issue is whether the responses are code-compliant. Safady's response to the requests is unclear and raises concerns, as it is phrased as an objection rather than a substantive statement. The judge is concerned that Safady is trying to dodge the discovery and is not providing clear responses. The judge orders Safady to respond to the requests without objection within 15 days, and if necessary, to produce documents at the same time. The request for sanctions is denied.
