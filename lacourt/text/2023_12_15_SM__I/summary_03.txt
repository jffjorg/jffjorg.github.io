Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on two motions to compel discovery in a case between neighbors disputing an easement and driveway. The plaintiff claims the defendant acted poorly regarding their tenant and workmen, while the defendant claims they acted appropriately and within their rights. The plaintiff propounded discovery, but the defendant's responses were deemed insufficient. The defendant promised supplements, but failed to deliver. The judge grants the motion to compel discovery as to certain requests, including those related to the boundaries of the defendant's property, documents evidencing calls to the police, and reports. The judge also orders the defendant to specify the particular documents that constitute their response and to respond to certain requests related to statutes. The judge denies the requests for sanctions, but recommends that the parties hire a discovery referee to resolve future disputes.
