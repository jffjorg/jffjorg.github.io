 SL Retail Owner, LLC v. Keisuke SC LLC, et al.
Friday,
 January 10, 2025
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR
SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF PLAINTIFF, SL RETAIL OWNER, LLC.
 
I.       BACKGROUND
      The
first amended complaint alleges that Plaintiff leased retail space to
Defendant, Keisuke CA Corp., (“Keisuke”) pursuant to a written lease agreement.
Defendant, Christopher Au (“Au”), signed a guaranty of the lease agreement. Keisuke
breached the lease agreement by failing to prepare and deliver to Plaintiff
digital plans for tenant improvements as required by the lease and failed to
open its business by the due date. Keisuke defaulted on its rental payment
obligations, and Au failed to guaranty performance by Keisuke. Plaintiff
alleges one cause of action for breach of the Keisuke guaranty against Au.
      Plaintiff
entered into a second lease agreement with Keisuke CA Corp dba Ushi Ushi at the
Shops at Sportsmen’s Lodge. Defendant Au signed a personal guaranty of the Ushi
Ushi lease agreement. Keisuke breached its obligations by failing to deliver
digital plans to Plaintiff for the improvements and failed to pay rent under
the Ushi Ushi lease agreement. Au breached his guaranty obligations by failing
to pay rent due by Ushi Ushi.
      Plaintiff
alleges two causes of action for breach of personal guaranty against Au for
both leases.
      Plaintiff
requests an order for summary judgment of the entire complaint in its favor, or
alternatively, for summary adjudication of each cause of action for breach of
the two personal guaranties signed by Au. Plaintiff timely served the complaint
on Au, who did not file an opposition.
II.     LEGAL
STANDARDS
      Summary
judgment is proper “if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c subd. (c).) In ruling on the motion, the court considers
the material issues defined by the allegations of the complaint. (Lewinter v. Genmar Industries, Inc.
(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1223.) As the moving party, Plaintiff’s burden on
moving for summary adjudication is to show that there is no defense to a cause
of action by proving each element of the claim. If that threshold burden is
established, the burden shifts to Defendant to show a triable issue of one or
more material facts as to that defense. (Code Civ. Proc., §437c(p)(1).) The
court strictly construes the moving party’s evidence and liberally construes
those of the opposing party. All doubts are resolved in favor of the opposing
party. (Stationers
Corp. v. Dun & Bradstreet, Inc.
(1965) 62 Cal. 2d 412, 417.)
      The
court does not evaluate the credibility of testimony. (Binder
v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75 Cal. App. 4th 832,
840.) The court applies the three-step analysis to motions for summary judgment
or adjudication: (1) identify the issues framed by the pleading, (2) determine
whether the moving party established facts which negate the opponents’ claim,
(3) if a defendant meets its threshold burden of persuasion and the burden
shifts, determine whether the opposing party has controverted those facts with
admissible evidence. (Torres
v. Reardon (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 831, 836.) 

III.    DISCUSSION
      To
prevail on a claim for breach of guaranty, Plaintiff must establish that there
is a valid guaranty, the borrower or principal has defaulted, and the guarantor
failed to perform under the guaranty. (Gray1
CPB, LLC v. Kolokotronis (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 480, 486.) As
no opposition is filed, there is no dispute of the material facts showing the
formation of the Keisuke lease agreement, the formation of the Ushi Ushi lease
agreement, and that Defendant Au signed a guaranty for Keisuke’s and Ushi
Ushi’s failure to perform under the lease agreements. (PUF 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24,
25, 30.) Plaintiff sent notice for Defendants to cure the defaults, which Defendants
failed to cure (PUF 9, 10, 11, 31, 33.) Keisuke and Ushi Ushi breached their
obligations under both lease agreements, and Au, as guarantor, failed to pay
the rents due. (PUF 22, 23, 44, 45.)
      Plaintiff
successfully mitigated damages by hiring a broker at a cost of $60,148.71 to
hire a new tenant who took occupancy and began paying rent on March 7, 2024.
(PUF 15, 17, 37.) Accordingly, Plaintiff’s damages under the Keisuke lease are
$601,988.78 for unpaid rent, interest, and broker fees incurred. (PUF 20.) 
      Plaintiff
hired a broker to successfully find a new tenant for the space leased by Ushi
Ushi. (PUF 37.) The new tenant occupied the premises and began paying rent. (PUF
38, 39.) Plaintiff sustained damages under the Ushi Ushi lease for back rent,
interest, and broker fees, totaling $206,079.73 (PUF 43.) Total damage for both
leases is $808,068.51.
IV.   CONCLUSION
      Plaintiff
has met its threshold burden of showing it is entitled to judgment in its favor
on both causes of action based on the undisputed material facts proffered and
supported by the evidence. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment
is GRANTED.
