And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, SL Retail Owner, LLC. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants, Keisuke SC LLC, et al., breached their lease agreements and failed to deliver digital plans for tenant improvements. The plaintiff also claims that the guarantor, Christopher Au, failed to perform under the guaranty.

The court finds that the undisputed material facts show that the defendants breached their lease agreements, and the guarantor failed to perform under the guaranty. The plaintiff sent notice to cure the defaults, but the defendants failed to do so. The plaintiff successfully mitigated damages by hiring a broker to find a new tenant, and the new tenant began paying rent.

The court grants the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and finds that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in its favor on both causes of action. The plaintiff's damages are calculated at $808,068.51, which includes unpaid rent, interest, and broker fees.
