On
October 18, 2022, Defendants and Cross-Defendants Carlos Orozco and J. Orozco
Enterprises Inc., dba Orozco Landscape and Tree Company filed an answer to Kochanpillai’s cross-complaint. 
On
October 20, 2022, the Court found that this case (case number 21STCV27055) and
case number 21STCV24901 are related within the meaning of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.300(a).  21STCV24901 became
the lead case. The cases were assigned to Department 28 of the Spring Street
Courthouse for all purposes. 
On
June 26, 2023, the Court dismissed Kochanpillai from Plaintiffs’ complaint with
prejudice at Plaintiffs’ request.  In
addition, the Court dismissed Carlos Orozco and J. Orozco Enterprises, Inc. dba
Orozco Landscape and Tree Company from Kochanpillai’s cross-complaint with
prejudice at Kochanpillai’s request. 
On
August 23, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. 
On
December 7, 2023, the Court dismissed Martin’s claims with prejudice at
Plaintiffs’ request. 
On
March 21, 2024, Martin (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for expedited approval
of the compromise of Gutierrez’s claims. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUESTS 
Petitioner Paulina Oropeza Martin asks the Court to approve the compromise of Yasmin Gutierrez’s claims. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“‘[W]ithout
trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the
settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on
the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior
Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
To
obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner
must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and
must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
DISCUSSION      
          The petition contains the following information about the
proposed settlement: 
Gross
settlement amount: $4,500.00 Medical
expenses: $519.95 Negotiated,
contractual, and statutory reductions: $129.98 Amount
to be paid or reimbursed from proceeds: $389.97.00 Attorney’s
fees: $1,125.00 Costs:
$113.36 Balance
of proceeds: $2,871.67 
Section
13a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $519.95.  Section 13a(3) of the petition states that
this amount was reduced by $129.98 as the result of negotiated, contractual,
and statutory reductions.  The remaining
amount of medical expenses, $389.97, is listed in Section 13a(4) as the amount to
be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  Section 13c(2) states that $389.97 is the
amount Medi-Cal has agreed to accept as reimbursement. 
Section
13f(2), however, states that medical services providers have asserted $519.95 in liens
for payments of medical expenses.  If this figure is correct, it means that, in addition to the $389.97 to be paid out of the settlement
proceeds to Medi-Cal, $519.95 must be paid from the settlement proceeds to
these medical services providers.  Petitioner
should determine if the $519.95 figure listed in Section 13f(2) is correct. 
In
addition, Section 17b of the petition does not list the amount of medical
expenses to be paid from the settlement proceeds. 
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition for expedited approval of the
compromise of minor Yasmin Gutierrez’s action filed by Petitioner Paulina
Oropeza Martin on March 21, 2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
