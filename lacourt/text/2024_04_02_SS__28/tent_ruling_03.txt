 Case Number:  22STCV11587    Hearing Date:   April 2, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving and opposing papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
April 5, 2022, Plaintiffs Steven Friedman and Janis Friedman filed this action
against Defendants Daniel Allen (“Allen”), Dana Campbell (“Campbell”), 21st
Century Company, and Does 1-100 for negligence, infliction of emotional
distress, strict liability for ultrahazardous activity, and declaratory relief. 
On
July 14, 2023, the clerk entered Allen’s default. On January 2, 2024, the Court
granted Allen’s motion to vacate the default. 
On
January 12, 2024, Allen filed a demurrer and motion to strike, to be heard on
February 7, 2024.  The Court continued
the hearing to February 28, 2024 at Plaintiff’s request.  The Court later continued the hearing to
April 2, 2024.  On February 14, 2024,
Plaintiff filed oppositions. 
On
January 25, 2024, the Court found that this case (22STCV11587) and case number
23SMCV01086 are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule
3.300(a). Case number 22STCV11587 became the lead case. The cases were assigned
to Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse for all purposes. 
On
January 29, 2024, the Court found that case number 23SMCV01411 is related to
case numbers 22STCV11587 and 23SMCV01086. Case number 22STCV11587 remained the
lead case. The cases were assigned to Department 28 of the Spring Street
Courthouse for all purposes. 
On
February 20, 2024, the Court sustained
Campbell’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’ claims for intentional infliction of
emotional distress and strict liability for engaging in ultrahazardous activity
with 30 days leave to amend. The Court also granted Campbell’s motion to strike
Plaintiffs’ punitive damage claim and allegations of malice, fraud, or
oppression with 30 days leave to amend. 
On
March 21, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint against Allen,
Campbell, 21st Century Insurance Company, and Does 1-100 for negligence
(including negligence per se), infliction of emotional distress, strict liability
for ultrahazardous activity, and declaratory relief.  
Trial
is currently scheduled for March 20, 2025. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Allen
asks the Court to sustain the demurrer to Plaintiffs' claims for infliction of
emotional distress and strict liability for ultrahazardous activity and to
strike the claim for punitive damages and references to malice, fraud, and oppression. 
Plaintiffs
ask the Court to overrule the demurrer and deny the motion to strike. 
DISCUSSION 
“If
by stipulation or as a matter of statutory right plaintiff amends the complaint
before the demurrer hearing, the hearing goes off calendar.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide:
Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 7:122.16, p. 7(l)-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing People ex rel. Strathmann v. Acacia Research Corp.
(2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 487, 506 (Strathmann).) 
In Strathmann,
the Court of Appeal observed: “The filing of the first amended complaint
rendered [the defendant's] demurrer moot since ' "an amendatory pleading
supersedes the original one, which ceases to perform any function as a
pleading. [Citations.]" [Citation.]’ ” (Strathmann, supra, 210
Cal.App.4th at p. 506, quoting Sylmar Air Conditioning v. Pueblo Contracting
Services, Inc. (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1049, 1054.)  Therefore, “[w]hen
Strathmann filed the amended complaint, the hearing on the demurrer should have
been taken off calendar.”  (Ibid.) 
Here,
Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint in response to the Court’s order sustaining Campbell’s demurrer and granting Campbell's motion to strike with 30 days leave to amend.  The first amended complaint superseded the
original complaint, which was the subject of Allen’s pending demurrer and
motion to strike.  Under Strathmann's reasoning, therefore, the Court takes Allen’s demurrer and motion to strike off
calendar.  
CONCLUSION 
The
Court takes Defendant Daniel Allen’s demurrer and motion to strike off calendar. 
Moving
party is to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days of the date of the hearing.
