Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The Court has considered the moving and opposing papers and rules as follows. The Plaintiff, Kamyar Khorshidi, has filed a motion to strike the cross-complaint filed by the Defendant, Laci Rae Buller. The cross-complaint was filed against the Plaintiff by the Defendant and the cross-defendants, Bastoli Auto Body Inc., and Roes 1-50. The Plaintiff argues that the cross-complaint is untimely, lacks factual allegations, and is "devoid of substance." The Defendant argues that the motion is improper and that the parties did not meet and confer. The Court finds that the Plaintiff did not provide a declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a)(3), and therefore denies the motion. The Plaintiff's motion to strike the cross-complaint is denied."
