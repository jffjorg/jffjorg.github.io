And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the complaint filed by Swamp Capital LLC against H.O.T.N. Holdings, LLC, et al. and has sustained the demurrer filed by the defendants with 20 days leave to amend to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd causes of action. The 1st cause of action for breach of contract is sustained because the plaintiff lacks standing to bring the action. The 2nd cause of action for fraud is sustained because the complaint fails to allege the specific facts required to plead fraud. The 3rd cause of action for conversion is sustained because the complaint fails to allege the necessary facts to demonstrate the conversion of the security shares. The 4th cause of action for appointment of a receiver is sustained without leave to amend because receivership is an equitable remedy and not a cause of action. The court overruled the demurrer on the basis of uncertainty.
