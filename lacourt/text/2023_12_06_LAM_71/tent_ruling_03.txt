PMORDONEZ Company’s, BAU Inc.’s, John Greenwood’s, Howard J. “Josh” Mills’,
Pedro Ordonez’s, and Bradley Ulisky’s unopposed demurrer to Plaintiff Swamp
Capital LLC’s complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to
amend as to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd causes of action.  Defendants’ demurrer is sustained without
leave to amend as to the 4th cause of action.
 
          Defendants H.O.T.N.
Holdings, LLC (“Holdings”), H.O.T.N. Club, Inc. (“Club”), Libra Hollywood, LLC
(“Hollywood”), Libra Crenshaw, LLC (“Crenshaw”), Zaremy Inc. (“Zaremy Inc.”),
J. Mills, Inc.’s (“Mills Inc.”), PMOrdonez Company (“PMO Co.”), BAU Inc. (“BAU
Inc.”), John Greenwood (“Greenwood”), Howard J. “Josh” Mills (“Mills”), Pedro
Ordonez (“Ordonez”), and Bradley Ulisky (“Ulisky”) (collectively, “Defendants”)
demur unopposed to the 1st through 4th causes of action in Plaintiff Swamp
Capital LLC’s (“Swamp Capital”) (“Plaintiff”) complaint (“Complaint”).  (Notice of Demurrer, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P.
§§430.10(b)[1],
(f).)
 
Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer, the
moving party must meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would resolve the
objections to the pleading and obviate the need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41.)

Defendants’ counsel filed a
declaration stating he met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel by telephone
on August 1, 2023.  (See
Decl. of Bauer ¶2, Exh. 1.)  Defendants’ counsel declares he sent a follow-up
correspondence to Plaintiff’s counsel the next day.  (Decl. of Bauer ¶2,
Exh. 1.)  Defendants’ counsel declares
the parties continued their communications until October 3, 2023, and the
parties were unable to resolve their issues, necessitating the instant
demurrer.  (Decl. of Bauer ¶7, Exh. 5.)  Defendants’ counsel’s declaration
is sufficient per the requirements of C.C.P. §430.41(a).  (C.C.P. §430.41(a).)  Therefore, the Court will consider the
instant demurrer.
 
          Background
          Plaintiff
filed its operative Complaint on May 30, 2023, against Defendants alleging four
causes of action: (1) breach of contracts; (2) fraud; (3) conversion; and (4) appointment
of a receiver, arising from Plaintiff’s alleged entry into a memorandum of
understanding (“MOU”) with Robert Fierro (“Fierro”), in which Plaintiff
acquired all of Fierro’s rights under a series of agreements entered into by
Fierro and Defendants, namely a Confidential Settlement Agreement and General
Release of Claims (“Settlement Agreement”), Stock Purchase Agreement (“SPA”),
Promissory Note (“Note”), and Pledge Agreement (“Pledge Agreement”)
(collectively, “Contracts”).  (Complaint
¶2, Exhs. A, B, C, D, E.)  Plaintiff
brings the instant action to enforce its alleged rights in the Contracts for
which Plaintiff acquired from Fierro. 
(Complaint ¶20.)
          Defendants
filed the instant demurrer on October 9, 2023. 
As of the date of this hearing no opposition has been filed by
Plaintiff.
 
Demurrer
Summary of
Demurrer
Defendants demur
on the basis that Plaintiff’s 1st through 4th causes of action fail to state
facts sufficient to constitute causes of action against Defendants and are
uncertain.  (Demurrer, pgs. 3-4; C.C.P.
§§430.10(e), (f).)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of
law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State
a Claim
Breach of
Contract (1st COA)
A plaintiff must allege the following elements to state a breach of
contract: (1) existence of contract; (2) plaintiffs’ performance or excuse for
nonperformance; (3) defendants’ breach (or anticipatory breach); and (4) resulting
damage to plaintiff.  (Reichert v. General Insurance Co. (1968) 68 Cal.2d 822, 830; Hale v. Sharp
Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1373, 1387.)  Although a written contract is usually pleaded
by alleging its making and attaching a copy which is incorporated by reference,
a written contract can also be pleaded by alleging the making and the substance
of the relevant terms.  (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Insurance
Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-199; Perry v. Robertson (1988) 201
Cal.App.3d 333, 341.)
Plaintiff alleges it entered into the MOU with Fierro wherein Plaintiff
acquired all of Fierro’s rights under a series of agreements, the Contracts,
Fierro and the Defendants entered into.  (Complaint ¶2, Exhs. A, B, C, D, E.)[2]  Plaintiff alleges at all, each of the Defendants
was the principal, officer, director, employer, or agent of each of the
remaining Defendants, and in doing the things herein alleged, was acting within
the course and scope of such office, employment and/or agency with the permission,
knowledge, consent, and ratification of their co-defendants and each of them.  (Complaint ¶17.)  Plaintiff alleges on information and belief
that there now exists, and at all times herein concerned there existed, a unit
of interest and ownership among Defendants such that any individuality and
separateness among the Defendants have ceased and are each and all the alter
ego of each other.  (Complaint ¶18.)  Plaintiff alleges on information and belief
that Defendants conspired to comingle their money, property, and rights so that
to defraud Fierro and that each Defendant acted in furtherance of such
conspiracy.  (Complaint ¶19.)  Plaintiff alleges on information and belief
that Fierro has performed all the terms and provisions of the Contracts sued
upon herein and has otherwise acted in accordance with California law, and
Plaintiff brings this action in order to enforce the rights in the Contracts
for which Plaintiff has legally acquired from Fierro.  (Complaint ¶20.)  
Plaintiff alleges a dispute arose between Fierro and the Defendants
relating to Fierro’s ownership interest in the Club, Holdings, Hollywood, and
Crenshaw and related matters.  (Complaint
¶21.)  Plaintiff alleges in an effort to resolve
the dispute, the parties participated in a full-day mediation with the
Honorable Jeffrey B. Barton of Judicate West on April 14, 2022.  (Complaint ¶21.)  
Plaintiff alleges as a result of the mediation, Fierro and the
Defendants entered into the Settlement Agreement on July 13, 2022.  (Complaint ¶22.)  Plaintiff alleges the Settlement Agreement
provided that Club would issue twenty-four percent (24%) of its authorized
stock to Fierro and seventy-six percent (76%) to Holdings; Holdings would then
purchase Fierro’s stock in Club pursuant to the SPA.  (Complaint ¶22.)  Plaintiff alleges it also provided that Fierro
shall retain any and all other remedies available should there be a default
under the terms of the Settlement Agreement or any of the Contracts.  (Complaint ¶22.)  
Plaintiff alleges on July 15, 2023, Fierro and the Defendants entered
into the SPA.  (Complaint ¶23.)  Plaintiff alleges the value of Club was established
to be approximately $11.8 million of which Holdings was to purchase Fierro’s
24% interest for $2,834,295, plus interest.  (Complaint ¶23.)  Plaintiff alleges Holdings was to pay for
Fierro’s interest by delivering the Note; the Note was to be secured by the
Pledge Agreement. No payment from Holdings was transferred for its 76% interest
in Club.  (Complaint ¶23.)
Plaintiff alleges Fierro and the Defendants entered into the Note on
July 15, 2022.  (Complaint ¶24.)  Plaintiff alleges the Note has an initial
outstanding balance of $2,834,293.65 and a predetermined repayment schedule
with sixteen (16) installments, requiring a payment of $40,000 on August 15,
2022, $10,000 on September 15, 2022, $200,000 on September 30, 2022, and
payments of $150,000, increasing to $250,000, payable quarterly thereafter
until December 31, 2025.  (Complaint
¶24.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendants
failed to make their payment on September 30, 2022, and thereafter defaulted on
October 15, 2022 (“Default Date”), only 90 days into term of the Note.  (Complaint ¶24.)
Plaintiff alleges Fierro and the Defendants entered into the Pledge
Agreement, also on July 15, 2022. 
(Complaint ¶25.)  Plaintiff
alleges the Pledge Agreement provided for the shares of Club stock recently
acquired from Fierro to be held for the benefit of Fierro as security for the
Note.  (Complaint ¶25.)  Plaintiff alleges in addition to the Club
stock being returned to Fierro, the Pledge Agreement also provides that upon
default (i) the right to vote the security shares would revert to Fierro as of
the time of the default (Section 5.2) and (ii) Defendants covenant that they
would not permit Club, through any transactions, to materially diminish the
value of the security shares (Section 7.1). 
(Complaint ¶25.)  
Plaintiff alleges on March 28, 2023 (“Acquisition Date”), Plaintiff
entered into the MOU, acquiring all of Fierro’s rights under the Contracts.  (Complaint ¶26.)  Plaintiff alleges it informed Defendants of
its acquisition of Fierro’s rights promptly after the Acquisition Date.  (Complaint ¶27.)  Plaintiff alleges from the Default Date
through the Acquisition Date, no communications have been extended from
Defendants to Fierro or Plaintiff.  (Complaint ¶27.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendants have negligently
squandered the revenues generated by retail dispensaries in Palm Desert (owned
by Club), Cathedral City (owned by Club) and Hollywood (owned by Holdings) (collectively,
“Operating Dispensaries”) and mismanaged these assets to the point where these
once-operating retail stores have become shuttered, effectively precluding any
future revenue generation.  (Complaint
¶27.)  Plaintiff alleges April the 20th
(commonly referred to as “420”) is the single most important day in the retail
cannabis industry in terms of total sales and revenues generated.  (Complaint ¶27.)  Plaintiff alleges because of Defendants’
mismanagement, none of the Operating Dispensaries were open on 420, causing
huge losses in value of Defendants’ assets and underlying shares.  (Complaint ¶27.)  
Plaintiff alleges Defendants have recklessly comingled the revenues
from the Operating Dispensaries to invest in certain extraneous, non-revenue
generating ventures like software development, among other things, and have
drawn substantial salaries, effectively siphoning off all available free cash
flow.  (Complaint ¶28.)  Plaintiff alleges there has been virtually no
cash reserves set aside for prudent business operations.  (Complaint ¶28.)  Plaintiff alleges as a result, Defendants
have not paid their taxes as they became due, with approximately $2.0 million
outstanding, and have allowed their accounts payable to swell to the point
where no wholesalers are willing to place any products on Defendants’ shelves.  (Complaint ¶28.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendants’ inexperience
and ignorance have driven their businesses into the ground.  (Complaint ¶29.)  Plaintiff alleges the value of the Club
security shares, for which Defendants have a contractual obligation to preserve,
is presently zero.  (Complaint ¶29.)
Plaintiff alleges Defendants mediated and entered into a settlement
with Fierro regarding his percentage ownership of Club.  (Complaint ¶31.)  Plaintiff alleges the parties agreed that
Fierro’s stake would be 24% or 2,400 shares of Club’s 10,000 total shares.  (Complaint ¶31.)  Plaintiff alleges the parties further agreed
to enter into the SPA, wherein Holding would purchase Fierro’s 24% interest in
Club for $2,834,295.65, plus interest.  (Complaint ¶31.)  Plaintiff alleges because Holding had
virtually no cash reserves, Holding would pay for its acquisition of Fierro’s
shares by delivering the Note for the full purchase price amount.  (Complaint ¶31.)  Plaintiff alleges the Note was secured by the
value of 2,400 Club shares pursuant to the Pledge Agreement.  (Complaint ¶31.) 
Plaintiff alleges approximately 90 days into the Note’s repayment
schedule, Defendants defaulted.  (Complaint ¶32.)  Plaintiff alleges as was Fierro’s right under
the Contracts, he demanded, in writing, that all amounts payable under the Note
and Pledge Agreement become immediately due and payable without notice, declaration,
or other act on the part of the Noteholder.  (Complaint ¶32.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendants waived their
rights to diligence, presentment, demand, protest and notice of any kind.  (Complaint ¶32.)  Plaintiff alleges to date, no payments have been
made by Defendants pursuant to the demand for payment in full.  (Complaint ¶32.)
Plaintiff alleges as a direct result of Defendants’ breach and default
under each and all of the Contracts, Defendants, each and all of them, jointly
and severally, have damaged Plaintiff as a matter of law (through Plaintiff’s
acquisition of Fierro’s rights under the Contracts), in the amount of $2,834,293.65,
together with accrued interest and accruing fees, penalties and pre-judgment interest.  (Complaint ¶33.)
Plaintiff
sufficiently alleges a cause of action for breach of contracts.  Plaintiff alleges the existence of the Contracts.  (Complaint ¶¶2, 26, 31,
Exhs. A, B, C, D, E.).  Plaintiff alleges performance of the
Contracts.  (Complaint ¶20.) Plaintiff
alleges breach of the contracts. 
(Complaint ¶32.)  Plaintiff
alleges damages.  (Complaint ¶33.)  Plaintiff sufficiently alleges the Contracts’
terms by attaching copies of Contracts to the complaint.
However,
Plaintiff lacks standing to bring the instant cause of action because the MOU
is signed between Ali Shekarchian and Fierro, not between Plaintiff and
Fierro.  (See Complaint, Exh. A.)
Accordingly,
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st cause of action
for breach of contracts is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Fraud (2nd COA)
A cause of action for fraud
requires the following elements: (1)misrepresentation; (2) knowledge of falsity
(or “scienter”); (3) intent to defraud (induce reliance); (4) justifiable
reliance; and, (5) resulting damage.  (Engalla
v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 974.)
Fraud
actions are subject to strict requirements of particularity in pleading.  (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc.
v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216.)  Fraud must be pleaded with specificity rather
than with general and conclusory allegations.  (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003)
30 Cal.4th 167, 184.)  The specificity
requirement means a plaintiff must allege facts showing how, when, where, to
whom, and by what means the representations were made, and, in the case of a
corporate defendant, the plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who
made the representations, their authority to speak on behalf of the
corporation, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when the
representation was made.  (Lazar v.
Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645; West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 793.)
Plaintiff
alleges as a result of their mediation and Settlement Agreement, Defendants
represented to Fierro that they would acquire his 24% interest in Club for
$2,834,293.65, plus interest.  (Complaint
¶35.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendants knew
at the time of the Settlement Agreement that they did not have the cash to purchase
Fierro’s shares.  (Complaint ¶35.)  Plaintiff alleges instead, they delivered the
Note and the Pledge Agreement representing to Fierro that the Note payments
would be funded from the revenues of the Operating Dispensaries.  (Complaint ¶35.)  
Plaintiff
alleges at the time of the Settlement Agreement, Defendants knew, or reasonably
should have known, that the profits of the Operating Dispensaries would be
inadequate to debt service the Note.  (Complaint ¶36.)  Plaintiff alleges despite substantial gross
revenues in certain months, Defendants knew, or reasonably should have known,
that the Operating Dispensaries were not generating enough profits to service
the Note, given all the other redirections of cash out from the Operating
Dispensaries to Defendants’ other ventures which Defendants refused to
discontinue.  (Complaint ¶36.)  
Plaintiff
alleges the Note had a predetermined payment schedule.  (Complaint ¶37.)  Plaintiff alleges substantially smaller
payments were due on August 15th ($40,000) and September 15th ($10,000).  (Complaint ¶37.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendants were able to
make these smaller payments knowing, or reasonably being expected to know, that
the Operating Dispensaries couldn’t possibly make the $200,000 payment due
September 30th.  (Complaint ¶37.)  Plaintiff alleges rather than informing
Fierro of their anticipatory breach of the Contracts, Defendants intended to
deceive Fierro by allowing him to believe that the Operating Dispensaries would
be able to debt service the Note. 
(Complaint ¶37.)  
Plaintiff
alleges it relied on Defendants’ deceit to its detriment.  (Complaint ¶38.)  Plaintiff alleges as a direct result of
Defendants’ fraud, Defendants, each and all of them, jointly and severally,
have damaged Plaintiff as a matter of law (through Plaintiff’s acquisition of
Fierro’s rights under the Contracts), in the amount of $3,000,000, together
with accrued interest and accruing fees, penalties and pre-judgment interest.  (Complaint ¶38.)
Plaintiff
fails to allege how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representations were made, and, in the case of a corporate defendant, the
plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who made the representations,
their authority to speak on behalf of the corporation, to whom they spoke, what
they said or wrote, and when the representation was made.  (Lazar, 12 Cal.4th at pg. 645; West,
214 Cal.App.4th at pg. 793.)
Accordingly,
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s 2nd of action for fraud
is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.

 
Conversion (3rd COA)
“Conversion is the wrongful
exercise of dominion over the property of another.  The elements of a conversion are: (1) the
plaintiff's ownership or right to possession of the property at the time of the
conversion; (2) the defendant’s conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of
property rights; and (3) damages. It is not necessary that there be a manual
taking of the property; it is only necessary to show an assumption of control
or ownership over the property, or that the alleged converter has applied the
property to his own use.”  (Farmers
Insurance Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 451-452; see also
Prakashpalan v. Engstrom, Lipscomb and Lack (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1105,
1135; PCO, Inc. v. Christensen, Miller, Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil &
Shapiro, LLP (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 384, 395, 397 [money cannot be the
subject of a cause of action for conversion unless there is an identifiable
sum, and dictum that, “plaintiffs may have stated a cause of action for
conversion by alleging, in effect, an amount of cash ‘capable of
identification’”]; Fischer v. Machado (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1069, 1072; Weiss
v. Marcus (1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 590, 599 [“While money cannot be the subject
of an action for conversion unless a specific sum capable of identification is
involved, it is not necessary that each coin or bill be earmarked.”].)
“[I]t is ‘well settled in
California that shares of corporate stock are subject to an action in
conversion’ and ‘it is not necessary that possession of the certificate
evidencing title be disturbed.’ Instead, it is sufficient that there is
interference with the owner's ‘free and unhampered right to dispose of property
without limitations imposed by strangers to the title.’” (Applied Medical
Corp. v. Thomas (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 927, 938.)
Plaintiff alleges as an
inducement to get Fierro to enter into the Contracts, Defendants entered into
the Pledge Agreement wherein 2,400 shares of Club would be held by Defendants
as security collateral for the Note.  (Complaint ¶40.)  Plaintiff alleges in the event of default,
the security shares would revert back to Fierro, and he would hold the sole
right to exercise voting and other consensual rights and receive and hold such
dividends and other distributions payable under such shares.  (Complaint ¶40.)  
Plaintiff alleges Defendants
further covenant that they would not permit Club, through any transactions, to
materially diminish the value of the security shares (Section 7.1).  (Complaint ¶41.)
Plaintiff alleges when
Defendants defaulted under the Note, ownership control in the security shares reverted
to Fierro.  (Complaint ¶42.)  Plaintiff alleges While these shares were
being held in trust for the benefit of Fierro, Defendants permitted Club,
through a series of mismanaged transactions, to materially diminish the value
of the security shares, virtually to zero, thereby breaching their covenant to
preserve their value.  (Complaint
¶42.)  Plaintiff alleges as a direct
result of Defendants’ conversion of the security shares, Defendants, each and all
of them, jointly and severally, have damaged Plaintiff as a matter of law (through
Plaintiff’s acquisition of Fierro’s rights under the Contracts), in the amount
of $3,000,000, together with accrued interest and accruing fees, penalties and
pre-judgment interest.  (Complaint
¶42.)  
Plaintiff sufficiently
alleges it had a right to possess 2,400 shares of Club (Complaint ¶¶26, 40).  Plaintiff fails to allege Defendants
substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s property by destroying the 2,400 shares of Club;
Plaintiff merely alleges Defendants
permitted Club, through a series of mismanaged transactions, to materially diminish
the value of the security shares, virtually to zero, thereby breaching their
covenant to preserve their value.  (Complaint ¶42.)  Plaintiff does not allege the shares of Club
have been destroyed.
Accordingly, Defendants’
demurrer to Plaintiff’s 3rd of action for conversion is sustained with 20 days
leave to amend.
 
Appointment of Receiver (4th
COA)
Receivership is an equitable
remedy, not a cause of action. The appointment of a receiver rests in a large
measure in the sound discretion of the court. “However, such power is not
entirely uncontrolled and must be exercised with due regard to the facts
presented in each particular case.”  (Alhambra-Shumway
Mines, Inc. v, Alhambra Gold Mine Corp. (1953) 116 Cal.App.2d 869, 873.)
Accordingly, Defendants’
demurrer to Plaintiff’s 4th of action for appointment of a receivership is
sustained without leave to amend.
 
Uncertainty
A demurrer for uncertainty
will be sustained only where the complaint is so bad that defendant cannot
reasonably respond—i.e., he or she cannot reasonably determine what issues must
be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him or
her.¿ (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612,
616.)¿ 
If the complaint contains
enough facts to apprise defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet,
failure to label each cause of action is not ground for demurrer: “Although
inconvenient, annoying and inconsiderate, the lack of labels . . . does not substantially
impair [defendant’s] ability to understand the complaint.” (Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 n.2.)¿ 
Where a demurrer is made upon
this ground, it must distinctly specify exactly how or why the pleading is
uncertain, and where such uncertainty appears (by reference to page and line
numbers of the complaint).¿ (See Fenton v. Groveland Community Services
District (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 797, 809.)¿ 
Defendants fail to specify
where the uncertainty appears by reference to page line and numbers in the
complaint.¿ (See id.)¿ Further, the pleading is not so bad that Defendants
cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what
counts or claims are directed against them.¿ (Khoury, 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 616.)
Accordingly, Defendants’
demurrer on the basis of uncertainty is overruled.¿
 
Conclusion
Defendants’
demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st, 2nd, and 3rd causes of
action are sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s 4th cause of action is
sustained without leave to amend.
