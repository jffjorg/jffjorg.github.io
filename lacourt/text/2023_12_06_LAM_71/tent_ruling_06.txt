Relieved as Counsel is granted.
 
On

action against Defendant Landmark Recovery LLC (“Landmark”) (“Defendant”).  On October 22, 2018, Defendant filed its
Answer.
On

On

Legal
Standard
California Rule of Court rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel)
requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on
the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051));
(2) a declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under
Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service
of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who
have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel
(prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a
motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and
it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)
 
Discussion
Counsel
has submitted completed MC-051, MC-052 and MC-053 forms. Counsel has provided a
declaration stating there has been a breach of the written retainer agreement
and an irreconcilable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, and
Plaintiff has not consented to a voluntary substitution of attorney.  (Decl. of Meyers.)  Counsel has indicated that Groubert was
served with copies of the motion papers filed with the declaration at Groubert’s
last known address and has confirmed within the last 30 days that the address
is current by mail with return receipt requested and by email service.
 
Conclusion
Groubert’s Counsel’s Motion
to Be Relieved as Counsel is granted.
Counsel will be relieved upon
filing proof of service on their client of the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion
to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil (Judicial Council form MC-053).

Moving Party to give notice.
