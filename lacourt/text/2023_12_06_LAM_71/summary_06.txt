And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Mark Groubert's counsel, Jay S. Rothman & Associates/Kenneth R. Meyers, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed on November 2, 2023, and the court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw. The court found that the motion was properly served on the client, Mark Groubert, and that there is no prejudice to him. The court also noted that the attorney-client relationship has broken down irreconcilably and that Groubert has not consented to a voluntary substitution of attorney. The judge ordered that the counsel be relieved upon filing proof of service on their client of the order granting the motion.
