Background
This dispute arises from petitioner’s
purchase of real property located at 702 South Saint Andrews Place, Los
Angeles, CA 90005 (“Property”), from Respondent 702.  (Petition ¶5.) 
The Petition states Respondent 702 failed to disclose material facts
relative to the Property, which affected its value and desirability to Petitioner.  (Petition ¶5.)  Petitioner and Respondent 702 agreed to
binding arbitration on November 13, 2018, pursuant to a purchase and sale
agreement (“PSA”).  (Petition ¶¶4(a),
(c); Attachment 4(b) at ¶31B.) 
Petitioner and Respondents Bernal and BCG agreed to arbitrate pursuant
to a November 20, 2019, letter from their counsel, Jay Stocker.  (Petition ¶4(c); Attachment 4(c).)
The Arbitration hearing occurred for eight
days from July 11, 2022, to July 14, 2022, and from July 19, 2022, to July 22,
2022, before Arbitrator Gordon K. Eng.  (Petition ¶¶6-7; Attachment 8c at pg. 2.)  Arbitrator Eng issued the Arbitration Award
on December 22, 2022, requiring Respondent to pay Petitioner $1,069,918.40.  (Petition ¶8.) 
Petitioner filed the instant petition on
January 4, 2023.  Respondent filed their
opposition on April 6, 2023.  Petitioner
filed its reply on June 15, 2023.
 
Arbitration Award
          The party
seeking judicial enforcement of a private arbitration award has the burden of
proving the award as well as the existence of a valid arbitration
agreement.  (Toal v. Tardif (2009)
178 Cal.App.4th 1208, 1223 [holding burden not met by submitting copy of
contract with arbitration provision signed by party’s attorney rather than by
party personally].)
The specific grounds upon which an arbitrator’s award may
be vacated are
set forth in C.C.P. §1286.2.  Except for such grounds, arbitration awards
are
immune from judicial review.  (See Moncharsh v. Heily & Blase (1992)
3 Cal.4th  1, 10-11 [limiting grounds for
judicial review effectuates the parties’ agreement that the award be final and
also reflects that arbitrators need not follow the law and may base their
decisions on “broad principles of justice and equity . . . paths neither marked
nor traceable by judicial review”].)  Generally,
errors of law committed by the arbitrator are not grounds for challenging the
arbitration award.  (Id. at pg.
11.)  The sufficiency of evidence of the
evidence to support the award is immaterial and courts cannot review the same.  (See Morris v. Zuckerman (1968) 69
Cal.2d. 686, 691.) Courts cannot pass upon the validity of the arbitrator’s
reasoning and cannot substitute its judgment for that of the arbitrator.  (See Moncharsh, 3 Cal.4th at pg. 11.)
          Interpretation
of the underlying contract is ordinarily a question of law for the arbitrator, not
the court: “It is the arbitrator's construction which was bargained for; and so
far as the arbitrator’s decision concerns construction of the contract, the
courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation of the
contract is different from his.”  (United
Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp. (1960) 363 US
593, 599.)
          Petitioner
has met its burden to prove the arbitration award and the existence of the
valid arbitration agreements.  (Petition ¶¶4(a), (c); Attachments 4(b) at
¶31B and Attachment 4(c); Petition ¶8(c), Attachment 8c.)  The PSA specifically contemplates that
brokers can agree to arbitrate (and can thereafter be compelled to arbitrate).  (See Attachment 4(b) at ¶31(C)(3) [“Brokers
shall not be obligated nor compelled to mediate or arbitrate unless they agree
to do so in writing.”].) Respondents Bernal and BCG were included as the
seller’s broker in the PSA,
and then later agreed, in writing, to the
Arbitration.  (See Attachment 4(b)
at pgs. 4(b)-5 at ¶2B, 4(b)-15 at ¶D.) 
Respondents Bernal and BCG agreed, in writing (in a November 20, 2019,
letter from Respondents’ counsel, Jay Stocker, Esq.), to “submit to
arbitration” with “Ginadan Venture 2, LLC.”  (See Decl. of Taran ¶4, Exh. A;
Petition ¶4c, Attachment 4(c)2.)  Further, on December 10, 2019, Respondents’
counsel, on behalf of Respondents, signed a November 26, 2019,
letter from the American Arbitration
Association (“AAA”) specifically agreeing and consenting to arbitrating the
dispute with AAA under its Commercial Arbitration Rules.  (See Decl. of Taran ¶5, Exh. B.)  Thereafter, Respondents’ counsel, on behalf of
all Respondents, filed an answer, and numerous other pleadings, on behalf of
all Respondents.  (See Decl. of Taran
¶5, Exh. C.) 
Respondents’ abovementioned course of
conduct waived their argument that they did not agree to arbitrate.
          Further,
Respondent BCG has been named as a Respondent at all times, including in Petitioner’s
initial arbitration demand.  (See Decl.
of Taran ¶6, Exh. D.)  Respondent BCG was
named as an entity of unknown form and was alleged to be an alter ego of the
other. “A party cannot wait until after an award is made to claim that an issue
expressly presented to the arbitrator for a decision is beyond his [or her]
authority.  (See J.C. Gury Co. v.
Nippon Carbide Industries (USA) Inc. (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1300, 1305.)
Respondents were proper parties to the arbitration,
agreed in writing to arbitration, and participated in the protracted and
aggressively litigated arbitration proceedings. 
Respondents’ contrary positions taken in their opposition are disingenuous,
unavailing, and not supported by the facts or law.  Further, the Arbitration Award is rationally
related to Respondents’ breaches and violations of law and the Arbitration
Award makes specific reference to the evidence and expert testimony presented
and considered. 
 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Petitioner’s petition to confirm
the Arbitration Award is granted.  Petitioner
is to submit a proposed judgment within ten days.
Moving Party to give notice.
