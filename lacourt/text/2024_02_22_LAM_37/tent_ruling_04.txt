The motion is
unopposed. 
 
motion for
charging order of partner’s interest
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
CCP § 708.310 states: “If a money judgment is rendered
against a partner or member but not against the partnership or limited
liability company, the judgment debtor’s interest in the partnership or limited
liability company may be applied toward the satisfaction of the judgment by an
order charging the judgment debtor’s interest pursuant to Section 15907.03,
16504, or 17705.03 of the Corporations Code.” 
Corporations Code § 17705.03(a) states: “On application by
a judgment creditor of a member or transferee, a court may enter a charging
order against the transferable interest of the judgment debtor for the
unsatisfied amount of the judgment. A charging order constitutes a lien on a
judgment debtor’s transferable interest and requires the limited liability
company to pay over to the person to which the charging order was issued any
distribution that would otherwise be paid to the judgment debtor.” 
 
II.        Discussion
 
Judgment
Creditor, Henry G. Wykowski, moves pursuant to CCP §§ 708.310-708.320 and Corp. Code § 16504 for an order (1) charging
the interest of the Judgment Debtor, Frank R. Chimienti, in a partnership known
as the “Frank and Pasqua Chimienti Family, LP” with payment of the unpaid
balance of the judgment entered in this action, which currently totals
$173,249.07; and (2) directing the partnership and all general partners thereof
to pay any money or property due or to become due to the Judgment Debtor
directly to Judgment Creditor, Henry G. Wykowski, until the amount remaining
due on the judgment, plus all accrued interest thereon, is paid in full.

notice of this Motion at the address provided by the California Secretary of
State. 
 
Accordingly, the
