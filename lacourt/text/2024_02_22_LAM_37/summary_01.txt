And here is the English summary:

Tentative Ruling: Special Appearing Defendant Stylenquaza's Motion to Quash Service of Summons is granted. Defendant Stylenquaza LLC has successfully argued that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over it. The court finds that Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate sufficient contacts with the State of California to exercise personal jurisdiction over Stylenquaza LLC. The court notes that Stylenquaza LLC is a limited liability company with its principal place of business in Dallas, Texas, and that it primarily operates in other states, not including California. The court also finds that Plaintiffs failed to provide evidence that any of the 22 stone slabs shipped to California were involved in Angel's injuries.
