Judge's Tentative Ruling: Demurrer to Cross-Complaint

The judge has reviewed the pleadings and has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant Eva Castaneda to the Cross-Complaint filed by Cross-Complainants Hernandez-Fernandez and Aspire General Insurance Company.

The Cross-Complaint alleges that Cross-Complainant Hernandez-Fernandez was negligent in causing a motor vehicle accident, and that Cross-Defendant Eva Castaneda may have been negligent or liable in some manner. The Cross-Complaint seeks declaratory relief, comparative indemnity, apportionment of fault, and subrogation.

The demurrer argues that indemnification and apportionment of fault are inapplicable because Cross-Complainant Hernandez-Fernandez and Cross-Defendant are not joint tortfeasors. However, the judge finds that the demurrer relies on facts outside of the pleadings and does not point to any allegations in the Cross-Complaint or judicially noticeable facts that state Cross-Defendant was the driver of Tercero's vehicle. Therefore, the judge overrules the demurrer and orders Cross-Defendant to file and serve an answer to the Cross-Complaint within 20 days of this ruling.
