And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings against Jaskaran Singh. The Motion is based on admissions made by Jaskaran Singh in response to State Farm's Requests for Admission, which contradict the general denial and affirmative defenses asserted in Jaskaran Singh's Answer. The Judge has taken judicial notice of these facts, which demonstrate that Jaskaran Singh failed to drive with reasonable care, was the sole cause of the accident, and caused State Farm's insured to incur damages. As a result, the Judge has concluded that State Farm is entitled to judgment as a matter of law and has granted the Motion. State Farm is required to file and serve a proposed judgment within 20 days of this order.
