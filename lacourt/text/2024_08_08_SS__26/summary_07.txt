The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion to Vacate Entry of Default filed by Defendant Melanie Orange-Thomas. The Motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), which requires the application for relief to be made within a reasonable time and accompanied by an affidavit of fault and a copy of the moving defendant's proposed pleading. The Judge finds that the Motion was timely filed, but it is not supported by a declaration from Defendant Orange-Thomas explaining their failure to timely file a response. The Judge also notes that the Motion does not provide a copy of Defendant Orange-Thomas' proposed responsive pleading. As a result, the Judge denies the Motion to Vacate Entry of Default.
