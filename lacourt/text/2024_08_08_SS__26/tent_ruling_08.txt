Mashian
Law Group v. Husson, et al.DEMURRER
(CCP § 430.10, et seq.)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Cross-Defendant Mashian Law
Group’s Demurrer to the Cross-Complaint is OVERRULED. CROSS-DEFENDANT IS TO
FILE AND SERVE AN ANSWER TO THE CROSS-COMPLAINT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS RULING.
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 

On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff Mashian
Law Group (“Cross-Defendant”) filed the Complaint in this action against Defendants
Tony Husson and 21 Choices, LLC (“Cross-Complainants”).
On May 10, 2024, Cross-Complainants answered the Complaint and filed the
Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendant for (1) professional negligence; and
(2) breach of contract. 
 
Cross-Defendant filed the instant
Demurrer to the Cross-Complaint on July 11, 2024. Cross-Complainants filed an
opposition on July 26, 2024 and Cross-Defendant replied on August 1, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
The Demurrer is accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41. (Demurrer, Stanton Decl., ¶¶3-5 and Exh.
2.) Cross-Defendant demurs on the grounds that the Cross-Complaint
fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action and is uncertain.
(Citing Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e), (f).) Special demurrers,
however, are not permitted in the limited jurisdiction court. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 92, subd. (c).) Therefore, the Court will not consider the demurrer for
uncertainty. 
 
The Complaint alleges causes of
action for (1) breach of contract; (2) account stated; and (3) quantum meruit.
These claims are based on the allegations that Cross-Complainants retained
Cross-Defendant to perform legal services in connection with Los Angeles
Superior Court case 21 Choices, LLC v. Guinart Construction, Inc. (“Case
No. 20STCV27023”) but failed to pay all the legal fees and costs incurred.
(Compl., ¶¶6-12.) Cross-Complainants allegedly still owe $19,116.54 in legal
fees and costs for the legal services performed by Cross-Defendant. (Ibid.)

 
The Cross-Complaint asserts
causes of action for (1) professional negligence; and (2) breach of contract.
First, it alleges that Cross-Defendant owed Cross-Complainants a duty of care
to: “(i) properly provide attorneys experienced in litigation and trial as
promised at the inception if litigation was not avoided; and/or (ii) use due
diligence to know of the pertinent lease provisions affecting
Cross-Complainants in its issues with their commercial landlord, the reason for
the representation, to avoid litigation.” (Cross-Compl., ¶7.) Cross-Defendant
allegedly breached these duties “by failing to: (i) properly provide attorneys
experienced in litigation and trial as promised at the inception; and/or (ii)
use due diligence to know of the pertinent lease provisions in affecting
Cross-Complainants in its issues with their commercial landlord.” (Id.
at ¶9.) As a result, Cross-Complainants have sustained damages in an amount to
be proven at trial. (Ibid.) Cross-Defendant also allegedly breached the
retainer agreement attached the Complaint, thereby causing Cross-Complainants
business losses and other harm such as payment of fees for work not performed
in accordance with the standard of care. (Id. at ¶¶12-14.) 
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Cross-Defendant requests that the
Court take judicial notice of (1) the Complaint filed in the Los Angeles
Superior Court action 21 Choices, a California limited liability company v.
Guinart Construction, Inc., a California corporation (Case No. 20STCV27023),
filed on July 17, 2020; (2) the Substitution of Attorney filed March 21, 2021
by Mashian Law Group on behalf of the Husson Defendants in Case No. 20STCV27023;
and (3) the Request for Dismissal filed August 31, 2022 by Mashian Law Group on
behalf of the Husson Defendants in Case No. 20STCV27023. 
 
The request for judicial notice is brought pursuant to
Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d). With respect to court records, the
Court cannot take judicial notice of the facts contained therein and may only
take judicial notice of the existence of those records. (See Adams v. Bank
of America, N.A. (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 666, 673 [citing Sosinsky v.
Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1569–1570].) The Court’s judicial notice
of these documents is limited accordingly to the following: (1) Case No.
20STCV27023 was filed on July 17, 2020; (2) Mashian Law Group substituted in as
counsel of record for Cross-Complainants in Case No. 20STCV27023 on March 21,
2021; and (3) Case No. 20STCV27023 was dismissed on August 31, 2022. 
 
Cross-Defendant also filed a supplemental request for
judicial notice of certain documents which are attached but not listed. (Supp.
Request for Judicial Notice, filed 08/01/24.) As noted above, judicial notice
of the content of documents simply because they were filed with the Court is
improper. Therefore, Cross-Defendant’s supplemental request for judicial notice
is denied. 
 
Statute of Limitations
 
Cross-Defendant argues that the
first cause of action for professional negligence is barred by the one-year
statute of limitations set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 340.6. The
statute provides that an action for legal malpractice “shall be commenced
within one year after the plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable
diligence should have discovered, the facts constituting the wrongful act or
omission, or four years from the date of the wrongful act or omission,
whichever occurs first.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 340.6, subd. (a).) To sustain
a demurrer based on a statute of limitations defense “[i]t must appear clearly
and affirmatively that, upon the face of the complaint, the right of action is
necessarily barred.” (Leasequip, Inc. v. Dapeer (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th
394, 400.) 
 
Cross-Defendant argues that the
statute of limitations must have run by February 1, 2024, one year after the
termination of its representation of Cross-Complainants in Case No.
20STCV27023. However, no allegations from the Cross-Complainant or judicially
noticeable facts are cited for the purported date Cross-Defendant’s
representation terminated. Nor are any allegations or judicially noticeable
facts cited regarding when Cross-Complainants discovered, or through the use of
reasonable diligence, should have discovered the wrongful acts or omissions of
Cross-Defendant. The reply concedes that the Cross-Complaint is silent as to
all dates of representation. Nor does the opposition contend that the statute
of limitations is tolled, as argued in the reply. It simply refers to
subdivision (a)(2) of section 340.6 of the Code of Civil Procedure, without any
analysis, for the proposition that continuing representation tolls the statute
of limitations. Even if the opposition were to make a tolling argument, this
does not impose an obligation on Cross-Complainants to allege facts in the
Cross-Complaint showing that tolling applies because, as already discussed,
nothing in the Cross-Complaint demonstrates that the cause of action for legal
malpractice is time-barred. 
 
Cross-Defendant also relies on
the statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section 340.6 to demur to
the second cause of action for breach of contract. For the reasons discussed
above, the Demurrer also does not demonstrate that breach of contract claim is
overcome by the statute of limitations. 
 
Conclusion
 
Cross-Defendant Mashian Law Group’s Demurrer to the
Cross-Complaint is OVERRULED. CROSS-DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND SERVE AN ANSWER TO
THE CROSS-COMPLAINT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS RULING.
