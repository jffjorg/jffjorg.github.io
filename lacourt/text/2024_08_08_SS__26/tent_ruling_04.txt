Lopez v. LKQ Corp., et alMOTION
FOR SANCTIONS
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Filemon R. Lopez’s Motion for Sanctions is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On November 27, 2023, Plaintiff Filemon R. Lopez
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against “LKQ Corporation Pick Your Own Parts
Auto Wrecking” alleging wrongful termination. Defendant LKQ Corporation
(“Defendant LKQ”) filed an Answer to the Complaint on February 13, 2024. 
 
On June 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for
Sanctions. Defendant LKQ filed an opposing declaration on July 29, 2024. 
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s moving papers do
not provide the Court with a sufficient legal basis or relevant authority to sanction
Defendant. Code of Civil Procedure section 1010 specifically provides that the notice
of a motion “must state … the grounds upon which it will be made, and the
papers, if any, upon which it is to be based. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.)
Additionally, Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(a) provides that a notice of
motion, “must state in the opening paragraph the nature of the order being
sought and the grounds for issuance of the order.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1110(a).) Plaintiff’s papers cite no legal authority that gives the Court the
authority to issue sanctions. 
Furthermore, “[t]he memorandum
must contain a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and
arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks
cited in support of the position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1113(b).) Indeed, Plaintiff’s failure to provide a memorandum as required by
the Rule is an “admission that the [request] is without merit and cause for its
denial.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(a), (b); In re Marriage of
Falcone & Fyke (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 964, 976.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Filemon R. Lopez’s Motion for Sanctions is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
