And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case Mashian Law Group v. Husson, et al, where the cross-defendant, Mashian Law Group, filed a demurrer to the cross-complaint alleging causes of action for professional negligence and breach of contract. The court has ruled that the demurrer is overruled, and the cross-defendant is required to file and serve an answer to the cross-complaint within 20 days of the ruling.

The court's analysis notes that the demurrer is accompanied by a meet and confer declaration, but the court will not consider the demurrer for uncertainty. The court also notes that the statute of limitations must have run by February 1, 2024, one year after the termination of Mashian Law Group's representation of Husson and 21 Choices, LLC, but the cross-complainants did not allege any facts about when they discovered or should have discovered the wrongful acts or omissions of Mashian Law Group.

The court has also denied the cross-defendant's request for judicial notice of certain documents, noting that the court cannot take judicial notice of the content of documents simply because they were filed with the court. The court has limited its judicial notice to the existence of the documents, noting that they were filed with the court.

Overall, the court has ruled that the cross-defendant's demurrer is overruled, and the cross-defendant is required to file and serve an answer to the cross-complaint within 20 days of the ruling.
