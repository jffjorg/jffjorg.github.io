ANALYSIS:
 
On July 6, 2022,
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action for automobile subrogation against Defendant
Jaskaran Singh (“Defendant”). Defendant filed an answer on September 12, 2022.
On April 27, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Requests for
Admission Admitted and Request for Monetary Sanctions against Defendant.
(Minute Order, 04/27/23.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings against Defendant on June 11, 2024. No
opposition to the Motion has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
The standard for ruling on a
motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable
to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with
matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.  (Bezirdjian
v. O'Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322, citing Schabarum v.
California Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216.)  Matters which are subject to mandatory
judicial notice may be treated as part of the complaint and may be considered
without notice to the parties. Matters which are subject to permissive judicial
notice must be specified in the notice of motion, the supporting points and
authorities, or as the court otherwise permits. (Id.)  The motion may not be supported by extrinsic
evidence. (Barker v. Hull (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 221, 236.)
 
While a statutory motion for
judgment on the pleadings brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
438, et seq. must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration, there is no
such requirement for a motion for judgment on the pleadings brought pursuant to
the common law. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 439 [moving party must file declaration
demonstrating an attempt to meet and confer in person or by telephone, at least
five days before the date a motion for judgment on the pleadings is filed].) 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion is accompanied
by a request for judicial notice of the matters deemed admitted in Plaintiff’s
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted, and this Court’s April
27, 2024 order deeming the Requests for Admission admitted against Defendant.
The Court takes judicial notice of these facts pursuant to Cal. Evidence Code
section 452, subdivision (d). (Cal. Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d); Cloud v.
Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999; Evans v.
California Trailer Court, Inc. (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 540, 549) [holding
that the court may take judicial notice of matters that cannot be reasonably
controverted, including “admissions and concessions.”].) 
 
The admissions in the Request for
Admissions directly contradict the general denial and affirmative defenses
asserted in Defendant’s Answer. The admissions admit that Defendant failed to
drive with reasonable care. (RJN, Exh. 2, Request for Admission No. 2.) They
also admit that Defendant was the sole cause of the accident with Plaintiff’s
insured and as a result, Defendant caused Plaintiff’s insured to incur damages.
(Id. at Request for Admission Nos. 3-8.) The admissions admit that
Defendant caused Plaintiff to incur damages of at least $11,392.68. (Id.
at Request for Admission Nos. 7-8.) Finally, Defendant admits that the
affirmative defenses asserted in the Answer lack merit and evidentiary support.
(Id. at Request for Admission No. 9.)
 
By this Motion, Plaintiff has demonstrated that it served
Defendant with Requests for Admissions that effectively establish the truth of
the allegations in the Complaint, as detailed above. The admissions establish
the facts upon which Plaintiff based its Complaint and that Defendant has not
alleged a defense to Plaintiff’s Complaint in the Answer. Therefore, judgment
on the pleadings is appropriate against Defendant. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings against
Defendant Jaskaran Singh is
GRANTED. WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED
JUDGMENT.
 
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
