And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge continues the hearing on the Defendant Claremont Unified School District's motion for summary judgment and adjudication to a date to be determined at the hearing. The Judge denies the motion based on the Defendant's failure to properly craft a code-compliant separate statement. The separate statement submitted by the Defendant was overly lengthy and included non-material facts that were not pertinent to the issues at hand. The Judge intends to permit the Defendant an opportunity to file a supplemental separate statement that clearly identifies material facts and supporting evidence, as well as permit the Plaintiff an opportunity to file a response to the supplemental separate statement. The Judge will set a briefing schedule at the hearing.
