As for the English-text summary:

**Summary of Tentative Ruling**

The court has granted Plaintiff Hee Sung Kwon's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) in the case against Defendants Fitness International, LLC and Francesca Levy. The case arises from an incident at an LA Fitness facility in Arcadia, California, where Plaintiff alleges he sustained injuries due to a malfunctioning treadmill.

The court found that Plaintiff's proposed amendments to the complaint are necessary and proper, as they add critical details to support a claim for gross negligence. The amendments allege that Defendants failed to properly inspect and maintain the treadmill's PC boards, demonstrating a "want of even scant care" and "an extreme departure from industry standards."

The court also found that the proposed amendments are based on newly discovered facts not previously known to the Plaintiff, which justifies allowing the amendment. The court ruled that the amendment will not prejudice the opposing party and will allow Plaintiff's claims to be fully litigated on their merits.

The court granted the motion for leave to file the FAC, and Plaintiff is ordered to file the amended complaint within five days of the order.
