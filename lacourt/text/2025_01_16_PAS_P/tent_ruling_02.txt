 Case Number:  23AHCV02478    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2025    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING DEFENDANTS’
DEMURRER TO THE COMPLAINT and DENYING MOTION TO STRIKEI.         INTRODUCTION
This is a civil action between
siblings. Plaintiff Chase Anthony Lotito (“Plaintiff”) is suing Defendant Sena
Blue Sumerlin (“Defendant”) for 1) Undue Influence under Welfare and
Institutions Code section 15610.70, 2) Financial Elder Abuse under
Welfare and Institutions Code section 15610.30, and 3) Intentional Interference
with an Expected Inheritance.
Plaintiff filed this action on
October 25, 2023. On August 16, 2024, Defendant filed a demurrer with a motion
to strike. On December 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On January 7,
2025, Defendant filed a reply.
Meet and Confer
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41, subdivision (a), the demurring party is required to meet and
confer with the party who filed the pleading at least five days before the
responsive pleading is due. This must occur in person, telephone or by video
conference with the aim of resolving any objections raised in the demurrer.
Additionally, the demurring party must file and serve a declaration detailing
the meet and confer efforts. It should be noted, however, that the failure to
meet and confer is not itself grounds for sustaining or overruling a demurrer
or granting or denying a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, subd.
(a)(4), 435.5, subd. (a)(4).)
Here,
Defendant’s counsel declared that on August 12, 2024, she sent a detailed
meet-and-confer letter to Plaintiff’s counsel, Jenny D. Shin, outlining the
objections and arguments raised in the instant demurrer. On August 14,2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel (The Rosenblatt declaration states “Defendant’s counsel,” which this
Court assumes is a typographical error) disagreed with the arguments in the
letter. (Rosenblat Decl., ¶¶ 4-5)

The Court finds that the
meet-and-confer process does not comply with the statutory requirements of Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), which mandates that the
parties meet and confer in person, by telephone, or via video conference.
However, under subdivision (a)(4), the failure to adequately meet and confer is
not grounds for sustaining or overruling a demurrer. Accordingly, the Court
will address the demurrer on its merits.

     Trust, bearing Case No. 22STPB10140.

The court may take judicial notice
of “official acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial departments of
the United States and of any state of the United States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any
court of this state or (2) any court of record of the United States or of any
state of the United States,” and “[f]acts and propositions that are not
reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate
determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid.
Code § 452, subds. (c), (d), and (h).) The Request for Judicial Notice is
GRANTED as to Exhibits 1-10 and A. 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of a complaint. Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. A plaintiff’s allegations
must be accepted as true for purposes of demurrer, no matter how “improbable”
they are. (Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del E. Webb).) Allegations need not be
accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474.) 
Pleadings are to be broadly
construed (Code Civ. Proc., § 452) and demurrers are to be overruled where the
facts are sufficient to state any cause of action. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart
Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.)
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (f) provides for a demurrer where a pleading is uncertain. Demurrers
for uncertainty are disfavored and are only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible
a defendant cannot reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors,
Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) 
CCP § 430.10(c) provides that a
party against whom a complaint is filed may object by demurrer to the pleading
on the ground that “[t]here is another action pending between the same parties
on the same cause of action.”   
This plea in abatement may be made
by demurrer or answer when there is another action pending between the same
parties on the same cause of action.  (Plant Insulation Co. v.
Fibreboard Corp. (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 781, 789.) The later-filed suit is
“abated” (stayed) pending resolution of the earlier action which, if concluded
on the merits, will be res judicata; if not, the later action can
proceed.  (Id. at 788-89.)  The court can take judicial notice
of the court files in determining the basis for this ground. (See Bistawros
v. Greenberg (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 189, 191-192.)
“In order to sustain the plea of
another action pending it is essential that it shall appear: (1) That both
suits are predicated upon the same cause of action; (2) that both suits are
pending in the same jurisdiction; and (3) that both suits are contested by the
same parties. [Citation.] . . . The only relief to which a litigant is entitled
upon the plea, whether by demurrer or answer, is that the second action
abate.”  (Colvig v. RKO General, Inc. (1965) 232 Cal.App.2d 56,
70-71.)   
III.      ANALYSIS
Defendant demurs to Plaintiff’s
entire complaint, arguing that the causes of action are duplicative of pending
probate proceedings and fail to state facts sufficient to constitute valid
claims.
Pending Actions
Defendant argues that the complaint
in this action is improper because there are two other actions currently
pending between the same parties over the same issues in probate court, making
this complaint a duplicative and impermissible attempt to split causes of
action. (Demurrer, p.3) Defendant identifies the two pending matters as the
trust matter and the estate matter.
As to the trust matter, Defendant
asserts that on October 11, 2022, Plaintiff filed a petition to determine the
existence of a trust under Probate Code section 17200, seeking an order finding
that the original Carl John Lotito Living Trust dated April 14, 2021, is
valid. Defendant further notes that on November 21, 2022, Plaintiff filed a
petition to determine the validity of a trust, alleging fraud, undue influence,
lack of capacity, financial elder abuse, and seeking damages. In this petition,
Plaintiff sought an order declaring the original trust valid and the subsequent
restated trust invalid. Additionally, Defendant highlights that on January 24,
2023, Plaintiff filed a petition seeking an order determining certain real
property as assets of the trust, specifically properties located at 1721
Marengo Street, South Pasadena, and Barstow, California, as intended by the
decedent’s pour-over will. 
As to the estate matter, Defendant
states that Plaintiff filed a petition to probate the will, while Defendant
filed a petition to probate a lost will, contesting Plaintiff’s petition.
Defendant argues that these probate matters involve the same parties, facts,
and relief sought, as both involve Plaintiff and Defendant disputing their
claims to the decedent’s estate and addressing allegations of undue influence
and financial elder abuse. (Demurrer, pp. 4-5)
In opposition, Plaintiff contends
that the current civil action is not duplicative of the probate matters because
the probate court addresses trust administration and the validity of
testamentary documents, whereas the civil action seeks tort remedies such as
damages for undue influence, financial elder abuse, and intentional
interference with an expected inheritance. Plaintiff argues that the relief
sought in the civil action is distinct from the equitable relief available in
probate court and denies that the claims in this action constitute
impermissible claim splitting. (Opposition, pp. 3-5) 
The Court finds that the claims
asserted in the present civil action are barred under the principles of
abatement set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (c). The court must determine whether the civil and probate actions
involve the same "cause of action" by analyzing whether they
implicate the same primary right of the plaintiff and a corresponding primary
duty of the defendant. (Pitts v. City of Sacramento (2006) 138
Cal.App.4th 853, 856; Eichman v. Fotomat Corp. (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d
1170, 1174-1175.)
A single cause of action arises
from the plaintiff’s injury and the facts constituting the defendant's wrong.
If two actions involve the same injury to the plaintiff and the same wrong by
the defendant, then the same primary right is at stake, even if the plaintiff
pleads different theories of recovery, seeks different forms of relief, or adds
new facts in the second action. (Eichman v. Fotomat Corp. (1983) 147
Cal.App.3d 1170, 1174-1175.) In this case, the Plaintiff alleges harm stemming
from the deprivation of inheritance rights and the defendant’s alleged undue
influence and elder abuse. These claims are already being litigated in the
pending probate actions, where the same facts and injuries are at issue. (See
Exhs. 2, 3, 4)
Further, the rule against splitting
a cause of action bars the division of a single cause of action into separate
suits. A suit on any part of a cause of action precludes a later suit on the
remaining claims that could have been asserted. This principle protects
defendants from vexatious litigation and preserves judicial efficiency. (Wulfjen
v. Ddolton (1944) 24 Cal.2d 891, 894-95; Lekse v. Municipal Court
(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 188, 193.) Although different evidentiary foci or
reciprocal duties can sometimes distinguish causes of action. In this instance,
the Court finds that these claims arise from the same operative facts as the
probate actions, which are already addressing the validity of testamentary
documents and the distribution of the decedent’s estate. Therefore, the civil
and probate actions involve the same primary right and corresponding primary
duty, with no distinct evidentiary focus or legal duties breached to justify
maintaining this separate action. (Pitts v. City of Sacramento (2006)
138 Cal.App.4th 853, 856.)
Accordingly, the Court sustains the
demurrer pending resolution of the probate matter, as a plea in abatement
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (c).
Sanctions
Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions against Defendant’s attorney in the amounts of $2,450 and $4,314 for
reimbursement of attorney’s fees incurred in preparing the opposition to the
motion to strike. (Shin Decl., ¶¶ 3-5)
The Court notes Defendant’s
reference to attorney’s fees; however, as Defendant did not specifically move
for attorney’s fees, the Court need not rule on this issue.
Given that the demurrer is
sustained, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.
Motion to strike
The court may, upon a motion, or at
any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 436(a)) The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an
order of the court. (Id., § 436(b)) The grounds for a motion to strike
are that the pleading has irrelevant, false, or improper matter, or has not
been drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (Id. § 436) The grounds for
moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial
notice. (Id. § 437)
Given that the Court has sustained
the demurrer to the Complaint, the Court DENIES the motion to strike as MOOT.
IV.       ORDER
             The Court
SUSTAINS the Demurrer.
The Court DENIES the motion to
strike.
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s
request for monetary sanctions.
The Court orders this matter stayed
pending resolution of the probate court matters
Defendant to give notice.
