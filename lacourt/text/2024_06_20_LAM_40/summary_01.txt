And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted Defendant Lubrizol Corporation's application for determination of good faith settlement. However, the judge notes that the application does not meet the statutory requirement for service of the notice, application, and proposed order on all parties. The judge requires Defendant Lubrizol Corporation to file documents confirming service on all parties. The judge is inclined to approve the settlement, but only if service is confirmed. The judge also notes that the settlement appears to be in good faith and that no challenges were filed by non-settling defendants.
