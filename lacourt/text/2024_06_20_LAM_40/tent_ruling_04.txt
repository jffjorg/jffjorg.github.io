  for Attorney’s Fees and Time Actually Expended and Reasonably Incurred [Res
  ID # 6657].



 
I. Background
On February 14, 2023, Plaintiffs
Richard Castro and Jose Castro filed a Complaint suing Defendants Ford Motor
Company (Ford), Norm Reeves Ford Superstore (Norm Reeves), and Does 1 through 50
pursuant to three counts of violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act
(SBA) and a single count of negligent repair.
On January 25, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed a notice of settlement for the entire case.
On March 6, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
a motion for attorney’s fees and costs in this action.
That same day, Plaintiffs filed a
memorandum of costs detailing the costs claimed in Plaintiff’s motion for
attorney’s fees and costs.
On June 6, 2024, Ford filed an
opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion, and on June 13, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a
reply.
Plaintiffs’ motion is now before
the Court.
 
II. Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs
A. Motion
for Attorney’s Fees: GRANTED in part.
1. Legal
Standard
A prevailing party is entitled to
recover costs as a matter of right. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subds. (a)(4),
(b).) Attorney’s fees are also recoverable as costs when authorized by
contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).)
The Court begins this inquiry “with
the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084,
1095 (PLCM Group).) From there, the “lodestar figure may then be
adjusted [according to a multiplier enhancement] based on consideration of
factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value
for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.) Relevant multiplier factors
include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the
skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the
contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132.)
For purposes of determining a
lodestar, absent a contrary showing, both the number of hours that the
prevailing party’s attorney spent litigating the case and his or her regular
hourly rate are presumed to be reasonable. (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32
Cal.3d 621, 633-634, 639 (Serrano) [within context of Lab. Code, §
1021.5 private attorney general theory, absent a showing of “special
circumstances” that would render such an award unjust, litigant was entitled to
all hours actually spent, including those connected to fee-related matters, and
those necessary to establish and defend the fee claim]; Mandel v. Lackner
(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 747, 761 [“The value of an attorney’s time generally is
reflected in his normal billing rate”], disapproved on other grounds in Serrano,
supra, 32 Cal.3d at p. 630, fn. 12 [relating to whether term “antecedent
litigation” was applicable between Mandel I and Mandel II].)
No specific findings reflecting the
court’s calculations for attorney’s fees are required; the record need only
show that the attorney’s fees were awarded according to the “lodestar” or
“touchstone” approach. (Rebney v. Wells Fargo Bank (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d
1344, 1349, disagreed with on other grounds in In re Marriage of Demblewski
(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 232, 236, fn. 7 [disagreement as to statement of decision
requirements]; see Yu v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (2020) 56
Cal.App.5th 636, fn. 6 [disapproving dictum In re Marriage of Demblewski
re: whether motions may be filed before a referee’s decision is entered].) 
Moreover,
the Court is considered “an expert in the matter of attorney fees” since “[t]he
value of attorney’s services is a matter with which a judge must necessarily be
familiar.” (Excelsior Union High Sch. Dist. of L.A. Cnty. v. Lautrup
(1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 434, 448.) Accordingly, “[w]hen the court is informed of
the extent and nature of such services, its own experience furnishes it with
every element necessary to fix their value.” (Ibid.)
It
follows that the Court has broad discretion to determine the amount of a
reasonable attorney’s fee award, which will not be overturned absent a
“manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary
findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of
Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)
B. Analysis
2. Analysis
a. Preliminary
Considerations
i. Whether Ford
Complied with Its SBA Obligations
In
its opposition, Ford argues that because it made an offer to repurchase the
Vehicle shortly after the Complaint was filed, it complied with its SBA
obligations consistent with Dominguez v. American
Suzuki (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 53, 60 (Dominguez), for which reason no fees should be
recoverable. (Opp’n, pp. 4-5.)
The Court disagrees. Dominguez is
distinguishable. Dominguez involved a pre-litigation offer, which does
not exist here. Consequently, the Court finds the Dominguez argument
raised in the opposition unavailing. However, the Court agrees that the offer
may figure into the reasonableness of fees expended.
ii. Whether
Sought Fees are Unreasonable Based on § 998 Offers and Ultimate Success
Obtained
The
Court rejects the opposition argument that fees and costs should be denied
because they were unreasonably incurred following the Code of Civil Procedure
section 998 (§ 998) offers by Ford in this case. (Opp’n, pp. 5-6.)
It
is an error of law for the trial court to reduce or deny an award of attorney
fees in a civil rights or public interest case on the basis of a plaintiff’s
rejection of a section 998 offer when the ultimate recovery has exceeded the
rejected offer. (Reck v. FCA US LLC (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 682, 697.)
Here,
the final settlement was $101,717 plus fees. (Mot., p. 1; Opp’n, Proudfoot
Decl., ¶ 10), which is a greater figure than the initial offer to repurchase ($91,097
(cf. Complaint, ¶ 11 [agreed price for vehicle]) or the second offer to pay
$91,717.75 plus attorney’s fees. (Opp’n, Proudfoot Decl., ¶¶ 6-7, Exs. C-D.)
Ford’s
argument is thus unavailing.
b. Reasonable
Fee Rate
i. Relevant
Law
The lodestar calculation begins
with a determination of the “reasonable hourly rate,” i.e., the rate
“prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM Group, supra,
22 Cal.4th at p. 1095; see, e.g., Stratton v. Beck (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th
483, 496 [finding no abuse of discretion in court setting attorney’s hourly
rate based on comparison of rates from similarly experienced attorneys in same
field and area]; Children’s Hospital & Medical Center v. Bonta
(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 783 (Children’s) [affirming award where “the
hourly rates allowed by the trial court are within the range of reasonable
rates charged by and judicially awarded comparable attorneys for comparable
work”], disapproved in Asanta v. California Dept. of Health Care Servs.
(9th Cir. 2018) 886 F.3d 795, 802, fn. 14 [disapproving Commerce Clause
interpretation in Children’s].)
The general rule is “[t]he relevant
‘community’ is that where the court is located. [Citations.]” (Altavion,
Inc. v. Konica Minolta Systems Laboratory, Inc. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 26,
71; accord Marshall v. Webster (2020) 54 Cal.App.5th 275, 285.) However,
the court may also consider the level of skill necessary, time limitations, the
amount to be obtained in the litigation, the attorney’s reputation, and the
undesirability of the case. (Mountjoy v. Bank of America, N.A. (2016)
245 Cal.App.4th 266, 272.)
ii. Court’s
Determination
The Court determines that the
requested fee rates are reasonable for counsel, i.e., $695 per hour for Michael
Saeedian, Esq., $525 per hour for Christopher Urner, Esq., and $250 per hour
for Jorge L. Acosta (paralegal). (See Mot., Saeedian Decl., ¶ 24.)
The declaration of Michael Saeedian
provides grounds for the Court to determine that counsel’s reputation and 15
years of experience (even if not all in lemon law), as well as the
undesirability of the case (contingency), supports the requested fee rate. A
blended rate of $250 per hour as requested by the opposition is far too low a
fee rate for an experienced practitioner like Michael Saeedian and does not
take into account the contingency nature of the practice. (Mot., Saeedian
Decl., ¶¶ 2-3, 6-8.)
The Court makes the same
determination for Christopher Ulmer, whose fee rate of $525 per hour is
reasonable for an eight-year practitioner taking a case on contingency.
Last, the Court determines that a
paralegal rate of $250 per hour is reasonable in light of the contingency
nature of this case.
The Court notes that this
determination is based on the Court’s experience as an expert on fee
determinations for rates in the Los Angeles area and the declarations of
counsel.
The Court also notes that the
opposition provides no authority to support its argument that a fee rate of
$695 is entirely unreasonable for even the most experienced attorneys in lemon
law. (Opp’n, pp. 7-8.)
b. Reasonable
Hours Expended
i. Relevant
Law
“Under the lodestar method, a party
who qualifies for a fee should recover for all hours reasonably spent unless
special circumstances would render an award unjust.” (Vo v. Las Virgenes
Mun. Water Dist. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 440, 446, citing Serrano, supra,
32 Cal.3d at pp. 632-633.) Time spent relating solely to the fee award is also
compensable. (Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 1133.)
“‘Reasonably spent’ means that time
spent ‘in the form of inefficient or duplicative efforts is not subject to
compensation.’” (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State
University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 394 (Horsford), quoting Ketchum,
supra, 24 Cal.4th at pp. 1132-1133.) In assessing the reasonableness of
the hours spent, “[t]he court can look to how many lawyers the other side
utilized in similar situations as an indication of the effort required.” (Donahue
v. Donahue (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 259, 272, citation omitted.)
“In challenging attorney fees as
excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the
challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient
argument and citations to the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v.
Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488 (Lunada), quoting Premier
Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn (2008) 163
Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)
ii. Court’s
Determination
The Court disagrees that Plaintiffs
should not be able to recover the 2.6 hours of work expended between October 7,
2022, and November 17, 2022. (Opp’n, p. 9.) Attorney’s fees under the
Song-Beverly Act cover the reasonably incurred legal time in connection with
the “commencement and prosecution” of the action on behalf of a California
vehicle purchaser. (Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).) Ford provides no authority
for its interpretation. However, a case does not start at the time of the
signing of an attorney-fee agreement. The prospective client must be
interviewed and the evidence reviewed, in order for an attorney to perform
their ethical obligation to investigate the facts. Under these circumstances,
Ford has not carried its burden as set out in Lunada.
The Court also disagrees that
recovery for clerical tasks is not possible. Necessary overhead support
services that secretaries and paralegals provide to attorneys may be included
in an attorney’s fees award. (City of Oakland v. McCullough (1996) 46
Cal.App.4th 1, 7.) Administrative tasks are recoverable at the trial court’s
discretion. However, charging for purely clerical tasks at an attorney’s hourly
rate is questionable. (See Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 1132
[fees are based, in part, on level of legal skills that justifies the fair
market rate of such services].) Here, Ford’s challenge is vague. Its motion
challenges 9.6 hours spent on this action by paralegal Jorge L. Acosta but does
not specify which of the entries challenged in the verified time entries are at
issue. (Opp’n, p. 9.) The verified time records indicate that paralegal Acosta
spent 28.7 hours on this action. (Mot., Saeedian Decl., Ex. A [summary at final
unnumbered page].) Ford thus appears to have made an across-the-board rather
than line-by-line challenge to paralegal Acosta’s hours. This challenge is not
sufficiently specific because it amounts to the type of general arguments
rejected by the rule in Lunada.
However, the Court agrees that the
hours spent on this action by counsel are excessive to some degree. When a
voluminous fee application is made the court may make across-the-board
percentage cuts either in the number of hours claimed or in the final lodestar
figure. (Morris v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24,
40, citing Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24,
41.) A trial court is not required to state each charge it finds reasonable or
unreasonable. A reduced award might be fully justified by a general observation
that an attorney overlitigated a case. (Karton v. Ari Design &
Construction, Inc. (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 734, 744.) But the court must
clearly explain its reasons for choosing the particular negative multiplier
that it chose; otherwise, the reviewing court is unable to determine that the
court had valid, specific reasons for its across-the-board percentage
reduction. (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24,
41.)
Here, the amount of time spent on
most tasks is excessive in comparison to the nature of the task being
performed. As argued by the opposition, for example, the hours expended on
drafting the Complaint and drafting and reviewing discovery is excessive. A
review of the pleadings shows a garden-variety lemon law case, with the
Defendant almost immediately offering to buy the car back. And the discovery
served in this action by Plaintiff is common to lemon law litigation and should
not have taken as much time as shown in the time records. (Opp’n, Proudfood
Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. E.) Thus, the Court applies a 50% reduction to the requested
lodestar of $40,495, to $20,247.50.
c. Multiplier
Enhancement
Here, no multiplier enhancement
award is requested by Plaintiffs.
d. Disposition
Plaintiffs’ motion is GRANTED in
part as to fees in the amount of $20,247.50.
B. Motion for Costs: GRANTED.
1. Legal
Standard
In general, the “prevailing party”
is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs for suit in any action or
proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b); Santisas v. Goodin
(1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co. Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999)
20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108; see Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).)
2. Analysis
Here, the $5,899.18 in costs sought
by Plaintiffs are unopposed by Ford. The Court thus GRANTS these costs, as
reflected on March 6, 2024, Plaintiffs’ memorandum of costs.
 
III. Conclusion
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Attorney’s
Fees and Time Actually Expended and Reasonably Incurred [Res ID # 6657] is
GRANTED in part in the amount of $20,247.50 in fees and $5,899.18 in costs.
