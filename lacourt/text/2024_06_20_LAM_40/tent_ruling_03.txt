ROBERT GRAY,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO., INC., a California Corporation, and
  DOES 1 through 10, inclusive,
                        Defendants.


 Case No.:          22STCV25367
 Hearing Date:   6/20/24
 Trial Date:        10/22/24
 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Robert
  Gray’s Motion to Compel Deposition Attendance of Defendant’s Person Most
  Knowledgeable and Request for Sanctions.



 
Plaintiff Robert Gray sues Defendants American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (Honda)
and Does 1 through 10 pursuant to an August 5, 2022, Complaint alleging claims
of (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty and (2)
Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty.
On April 23, 2024, Plaintiff Gray
filed a motion to compel the deposition attendance of Honda’s person most
knowledgeable.
On June 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
notice of non-opposition based on Honda’s failure to file a timely opposition
to Plaintiff’s motion, i.e., to file and serve an opposition by Thursday, June
6, 2024, at least nine court days prior to this hearing.
On June 14, 2024, Honda’s counsel
filed a declaration taking responsibility for the failure to file an opposition
on behalf of its client, Honda. Counsel represents that no opposition was filed
due to a calendaring error. (6/14/24 Hancox Decl., ¶ 2.) Counsel represents
that an opposition can be filed in time for a continued hearing two weeks from
this date or any date thereafter that is convenient to the Court. (6/14/24
Hancox Decl., ¶ 4.)
“California courts retain the
ability to manage the litigation before them by means of case-specific orders,
provided that those orders are consistent with California law and afford
litigants due process.” (In re Harley C. (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 494, 501,
citing Rutherford v. Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. (1997) 16
Cal.4th 953, 967 (Rutherford); Rutherford, supra, at p. 967
[Trial courts are “entitle[d] to exercise reasonable control over all
proceedings connected with pending litigation … in order to ensure the orderly
administration of justice”].)
Here, the Court determines that a
continuance of the hearing on Plaintiff Gray’s motion is in the interests of
the Court’s management of this litigation. Honda’s counsel has advanced a
mistake-based ground for relief. A short continuation of the hearing poses no
prejudice in light of the trial being set for October 22, 2024, and the Court has
extended all pre-trial deadlines to conform with the October trial date.
(6/10/24 Order.) Moreover, it would not serve the interests of economy to go
forward with the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion and potentially grant full or
partial relief only for the Court to revisit the motion on a mistake-based
motion to vacate any order made by the Court in relation to the motion to
compel deposition.
The Court nevertheless notes that given the late
hour of Honda’s counsel’s declaration, the Court will consider further argument by Plaintiff in response
to the Hancox declaration and in response to the Court’s tentative to grant a
continuance.
