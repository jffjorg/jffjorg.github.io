I. Background
A. Pleadings
1.
LASC No. 20STCV25497 (Lead Case)
On November 4, 2019,
in LASC No. 20STCV25497 (the Lead Case), Conail Kwok—both as an
individual and as the Successor in Interest of the Estate of Tat Kwok—filed the
operative First Amended Complaint (FAC) suing Defendants Ramon Healthcare
Associates, Inc. (Mission Care Center; originally sued as Riverside Equities,
LLC) and Does 1 through 25.
The FAC alleges claims
of (1) Elder Abuse and Neglect pursuant to Welfare & Institutions Code
sections 15600, et seq., (2) Violation of Resident Rights pursuant to Health
and Safety Code section 1430, subdivision (b), and (3) Wrongful Death.
The claims arise from
allegations that Mission Care failed to provide adequate care for Tat Kwok and
that Mission Care Center’s failure to prevent a wound from developing in Tat
Kwok’s coccyx—the small triangular bone at the base of the spinal column—contributed
to Tat Kwok’s injuries and subsequent death on April 28, 2019.
This action was
assigned to Department 40 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse (the Court) for all
purposes.
2.
LASC No. 21STCV15837 (Brighton Case)
On November 3, 2023, Conail
Kwok—both as an individual and as the Successor in Interest of the Estate of
Tat Kwok—filed the operative FAC in LASC No. 21STCV15837, The Estate of Tat
Kwok, et al. v. Brighton Convalescent, LLC (the Brighton Case), which sues
Brighton Convalescent, LLC dba Brighton Care Center and Does 1 through 25 as
Defendants and Ada Kwok and Melissa Kwok as Nominal Defendants.
The FAC alleges claims
of (1) Elder Abuse and Neglect pursuant to Welfare & Institutions Code
sections 15600, et seq., (2) Violation of Resident Rights pursuant to Health
and Safety Code section 1430, subdivision (b), and (3) Wrongful Death.
The claims arose from
allegations that Brighton Care failed to provide adequate care for Tat Kwok and
that Brighton Care Center’s failure to prevent a wound from developing in Tat
Kwok’s coccyx contributed to Tat Kwok’s subsequent and later death on April 28,
2019.
This action was assigned
to four other Departments in the Los Angeles Superior Court prior to being
assigned to this Court for all purposes on May 28, 2024, through an order on a
notice for related case.
B. Motion Before the Court
On April 26, 2024, in the Lead
Case, Plaintiffs filed a motion to consolidate the Lead Case and the Brighton
Case. The motion attaches a proof of service showing service of the motion on
Mission Care Center’s counsel via electronic transmission. The motion was set
for hearing on June 20, 2024.
On May 21, 2024, in the Brighton
case, Plaintiffs filed a motion to consolidate the Lead Case and the Brighton
Case. The points and authorities filed in relation to this motion are identical
to those filed with the April 26th motion. The motion attached a proof of
service showing service of the motion on Brighton Care Center’s counsel via
electronic transmission. The motion was set for hearing on August 21, 2024.
On May 22, 2024, in relation to a
different motion filed in the Lead Case, the Court advised Plaintiffs that in
order to consolidate the two actions, they must be related.
That same day, Plaintiffs filed a
notice of related case in the Lead Case.
On May 23, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a
notice of related case in the Brighton Case.
On May 28, 2024, in the Lead Case
and in the Brighton case, the Court issued an order relating the two actions,
making the 20STCV25497 action the lead case, assigning both cases to this
Court, and taking all hearings other than those in the Lead Case off calendar.
The record also fails to reflect an
opposition by Mission Care Center or Brighton Care Center and a reply
or notice of non-opposition by Plaintiffs.
Plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate,
as filed in the Lead Case, is now before the Court.
 
II. Motion to Consolidate: GRANTED.
A. Legal Standard
When cases involving a common
question of law or fact are pending in the same superior court, i.e., in the
same county, the cases can be consolidated on a party’s motion or on the
court’s own motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 1048, subdivision (a).
Cases can be consolidated for (1)
all purposes (Hamilton v. Asbestos Corp. (200) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147;
see Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a)), (2) for trial (Stubblefield Constr.
Co. v. City of San Bernardino (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 687, 701; see Code Civ.
Proc., § 1048, subd. (a)), or (3) for limited purposes, e.g., discovery or
pretrial matters (see Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a); see, e.g., State
v. Altus Fin., S.A. (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1284, 1293 [cases consolidated for
discovery and pretrial matters]; Austin B. v. Escondido Un. Sch. Dist.
(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 860, 870 [cases consolidated for discovery and trial]; Frieman
v. San Rafael Rock Quarry, Inc. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 29, 33 [cases
consolidated for discovery and pretrial determinations]).
To prevail on a motion to
consolidate, a movant must establish that (1) the cases are pending before the
same court, (2) the cases share a common question of law or fact, and (3) the
benefits of consolidation outweigh the burdens. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1048,
subd. (a).)
B. Court’s Determination
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s
unopposed motion.
The Lead Case and the Brighton Case
were filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court and are related and pending before
Department 40, meeting the first statutory requirement. (See also Super. Ct.
L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.3, subd. (g)(1) [“Cases may not be
consolidated unless they are in the same department”].)
The cases also share common
questions of law or fact. A comparison of the operative pleading in the Lead
Case and Brighton Case shows that the pleadings are based on virtually
identical factual and legal allegations despite being directed against
different Defendants. (Compare FAC, Lead Case, ¶¶ 19-30 [common allegations],
31-59 [first cause of action], 60-65 [second cause of action], 66-71 [third
cause of action], with FAC, Brighton Case, ¶¶ 21-32 [common allegations,
virtually identical], 33-61 [first cause of action, virtually identical other
than as to introduction headers in Lead Case pleading, omitted from Brighton
Case pleading], 62-67 [second cause of action, virtually identical], 68-73
[third cause of action, virtually identical].) This similarity necessarily extends
to identical liability for failure to provide adequate care for Tat Kwok and failure
to prevent a wound from developing in Tat Kwok’s coccyx that contributed to Tat
Kwok’s injuries and death on April 28, 2019. (Compare, e.g., FAC, Lead Case, ¶¶
26-30 [coccyx], 37-48, 52-55, 56 [care], with FAC, Brighton Case, ¶¶ 28-32,
39-50, 54-57, 58 [virtually identical].) The second statutory requirement for
relief is therefore met.
The last statutory requirement
(balancing of benefits) is also met here through the benefits of:
(1)-(2) Saving time and money on
Plaintiffs’ assertion of liability against distinct Defendants based on the
same factual and legal grounds;
(3) Helping prevent inconsistent
adjudications against Mission Care Center and Brighton Care Center as relates
to liability arising from Tat Kwok’s injuries and death;
(4) Lessening the burden on
judicial resources from having to rehear essentially the same case or from
needing to make orders addressing inconsistences;
(5) Promoting the convenience of
Plaintiff’s witnesses and attorneys, where Plaintiffs’ witnesses will be
largely similar between the two actions as based on common factual allegations
against both Defendants, and where Jorge Ledezma Flores, Esq. represents
Plaintiffs in both actions;
(6) Encouraging settlement as
between the parties in what would otherwise be separate two actions, where
Plaintiffs asserts liability for the same factual and legal grounds against Mission
Care Center and Brighton Care Center; and
(7) Avoiding the prejudice of
inconsistent judgments against Mission Care Center and Brighton Care Center.
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd.
(a) [setting forth these seven grounds for this element of consolidation].)
Having met all three statutory
requirements, and given that it is unopposed, Plaintiffs’ motion is GRANTED.
 
III. Conclusion
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Consolidate
for All Purposes [Res ID # 9182] is GRANTED.
