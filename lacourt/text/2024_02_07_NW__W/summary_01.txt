And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel discovery responses and impose sanctions filed by defendants Kevork Kouyoumjian, Kambiz Kamangar, and World Tech Toys, Inc.

The court has granted each of the defendants' motions to compel discovery responses from plaintiffs Yosef Cohen and Vahe Ter-Galstyan, including responses to written discovery requests, special interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and form interrogatories. The court has also granted the defendants' motions to deem certain requests for admission admitted.

The court has imposed sanctions on the plaintiffs in the amounts of $1,840.00, $1,250.00, $1,387.95, $3,287.95, and $987.95, respectively. The court has also ordered the plaintiffs to pay filing fees of $120.

The court's ruling is based on the failure of the plaintiffs to timely respond to the defendants' discovery requests, despite being granted extensions and having been notified of the potential consequences of not responding. The court has found that the plaintiffs' failure to respond was not justified and has resulted in the need for the court to intervene and compel the production of the requested information.
