And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The plaintiff, Sandra Flores, alleged wrongful termination and wage theft during her employment with Mulholland Security Centers LLC, Abraham Ben David, and Avi 'Coby' Jacoby. The plaintiff and defendants had entered into an arbitration agreement on August 20, 2021, which provided for arbitration of employment disputes. However, the defendants failed to comply with the demand for arbitration made by the plaintiff on April 4, 2023.

The defendants had submitted evidentiary objections to the plaintiff's declaration in support of the motion to compel arbitration, but the judge sustained only objections 1-4. The judge found that the arbitration agreement was enforceable despite the lack of a signature, and that the agreement did not have strong elements of substantive unconscionability. The judge also considered the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,500.00, but denied the request as it was not set forth in the notice of motion.

The judge ordered the plaintiff and defendants to arbitrate the controversy and stay the action until arbitration is completed.
