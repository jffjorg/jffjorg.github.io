 Case Number:  23STCV03474    Hearing Date:   November 9, 2023    Dept:  30 JOSE DIAZ-ROCHA vs BROWN SURDALYER, et al.Motion to Quash Service of SummonsTENTATIVESpecially Appearing Defendant Brown Surdalyer’s motion to quash service of summons and complaint is DENIED as MOOT. Moving party to give notice.DISCUSSIONSpecially Appearing Defendant moves to quash service of summons and complaint, arguing that a process server came to the apartment owned by Defendant but not occupied by Defendant, and attempted to effect service on a blind woman.On September 20, 2023, subsequent to the filing of the motion to quash service of summons, Plaintiff filed a proof of service, indicating that Specially Appearing Defendant was personally served with the summons and complaint on September 18, 2023, at 3712 S Van Ness Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90018, at 7:25 PM. (9/20/23 Proof of Service.)Accordingly, the Court finds that the motion is moot. In reply, Defendant argues Defendant was not physically present at 3712 S. Van Ness Avenue during the alleged time of service because Defendant was attending an Initiate Justice meeting, which took place at the Initiate Justice Office, 742 South Hill Street, Suite 702, Los Angeles, CA 90014 on Monday, September 18, 2023 from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm.Moreover, Defendant argues that Kenneth A. Brown and Brandon K. Brown residents of 3712 S. Van Ness Avenue confirmed that Chapman, the process server, did not personally serve Defendant or them, and the envelope was left in the mailbox on an unknown date, so personal service was not effectuated on Defendant Surdalyer Brown or the residents of said property. (Exhs. A, B.)The general rule of motion practice is that new evidence is not permitted with reply papers. Specifically, points raised for the first time would deprive the respondent an opportunity to counter the argument. (Jay v. Mahaffey (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537.) Here, Plaintiff has not had an opportunity to respond to the new evidence in the reply, and as such, the Court cannot consider this evidence. In any event, none of the evidence in support of the reply is admissible. First, there is no declaration signed under penalty of perjury authenticating the emails attached to the reply. Further, the purported letter from Kenneth Brown and Brandon Brown is not authenticated nor is it a declaration signed under penalty of perjury, and thus is not admissible. Defendant also fails to present evidence in the form of his own declaration to attest that he was not at the address at the time personal service was allegedly effected.
