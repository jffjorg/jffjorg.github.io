And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's unopposed motion to file a cross-complaint against Southern California Edison Company, Kafil Construction, Bruce Johan Kafil, Lotus LA, LLC, and Roes 1 to 50. The cross-complaint seeks equitable contribution, implied indemnity, and declaratory relief. The Judge found that the cross-complaint is compulsory because it arises out of the same occurrence as the main case, a slip and fall incident. The Defendant produced an incident report suggesting potential comparative negligence on the part of the proposed cross-defendants, but the City of Commerce was not provided with the report when it was produced to other parties. Since no party opposed the motion, the Judge did not find any evidence of bad faith to justify denying the motion. The Defendant is ordered to file and serve the proposed cross-complaint within 10 days of the hearing.
