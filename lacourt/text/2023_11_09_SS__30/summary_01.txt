The tentative ruling grants the motion to continue the trial and related dates to May 18, 2024, or the nearest date thereafter. The moving party, Taylor, has requested the continuance because it is in the interest of justice and there are no alternative means to achieve justice. Taylor testifies that they are actively working with the plaintiff's counsel to set a mediation date and move the action towards alternate dispute resolution. Additionally, if mediation is not successful, Taylor will need additional time to complete discovery. The ruling notes that this is the fifth continuance in this matter, and no opposition was filed against the regularly noticed motion. The proposed new trial date is May 21, 2024, and the FSC (Final Status Conference) date is May 7, 2024.
