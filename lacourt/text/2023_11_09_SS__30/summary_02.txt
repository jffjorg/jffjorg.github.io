And here is a summary in English text:

Judge Claude Lavoie's tentative ruling grants Defendant Sandra Sarnoff's motions to compel Plaintiffs Claude Lavoie and Donna Duvall to provide responses to Form Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents. The Defendant's motions were filed after Plaintiffs failed to provide responses to discovery requests propounded on January 18, 2022, despite multiple extensions being provided. The Court finds that the Defendant is entitled to a court order directing the Plaintiffs to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery requests served on them. The Court also denies the Defendant's request for sanctions, finding that the motions were not opposed and that the Defendant has not alleged misuse of discovery. The Plaintiffs are ordered to provide responses without objection within 20 days of the order.
