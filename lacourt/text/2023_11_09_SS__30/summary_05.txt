Here is the English summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's Motion to Compel IME, ordering the Plaintiff to undergo a neuropsychological examination within 30 days at the office of Dr. Mi-Yeoung Jo. The Plaintiff's mother or any third-party nurse is not allowed to attend the examination. The Judge found that the Defendant's expert's opinion that Third Party Observers are a distraction during mental examinations was persuasive, and that the Plaintiff's mother's presence would likely compromise the examination. The Judge also denied the Defendant's request for sanctions, finding that the Plaintiff acted with substantial justification in opposing the motion.
