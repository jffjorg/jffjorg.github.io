And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Amir Daghighi Asli's motion for terminating sanctions, dismissing Plaintiffs Maria Guadalupe Muro and Hector Muro's complaint against him with prejudice. The motion was based on the Plaintiffs' failure to comply with the Court's order to respond to discovery, which was served on August 28, 2023. Despite proper service, the Plaintiffs failed to respond to discovery, failed to comply with the Court's order, and failed to oppose the motion for terminating sanctions. The Court finds that imposing less severe sanctions would not produce compliance and that the Plaintiffs are disinterested in prosecuting the case.
