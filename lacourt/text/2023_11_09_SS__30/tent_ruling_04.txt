 Case Number:  21STCV38633    Hearing Date:   November 9, 2023    Dept:  30 MARIA GUADALUPE MURO AGUIRRE, et al. vs AMIR DAGHIHI ASLIMotion for Terminating SanctionsMotion for Terminating SanctionsTENTATIVE Defendant Amir Daghighi Asli, erroneously sued as Amir Daghihi Asli’s motions for terminating sanctions dismissing Plaintiffs Maria Guadalupe Muro and Hector Muro’s complaint against Defendant are GRANTED. The Court dismisses Plaintiffs Maria Guadalupe Muro and Hector Muro’s complaint against Defendant Amir Daghighi Asli, erroneously sued as Amir Daghihi Asli with prejudice.  Moving party to give notice.DISCUSSIONDefendant Asli moves for terminating sanctions against Plaintiffs Maria Guadalupe Muro and Hector Muro on the ground that Plaintiffs failed to comply with the Court's August 24, 2023, order compelling Plaintiffs to respond to discovery.On August 24, 2023, this Court granted Defendant’s Motions to Compel and ordered Plaintiffs to serve verified responses to Form Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents within 20 days. (8/24/2023 Minute Order.) Notice was given to Plaintiffs on August 28, 2023. (Feldman Decl., Exh. A.) Despite the Court’s Order, Plaintiffs failed to respond to discovery. (Id., ¶ 6.)The Court finds terminating sanctions action against Plaintiffs is appropriate. Plaintiffs have failed to respond to discovery, failed to comply with the Court's order to respond to discovery, and failed to oppose this motion for terminating sanctions, despite proper service of this motion. Thus, it appears imposing less severe sanctions against Plaintiffs would not produce compliance, and that Plaintiffs are disinterested in prosecuting this case.
