And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and complaint as moot. The defendant argued that the process server came to an apartment owned by the defendant but not occupied by the defendant, and attempted to serve a blind woman. However, subsequent to the filing of the motion, the plaintiff filed a proof of service indicating that the defendant was personally served with the summons and complaint on September 18, 2023. The defendant claims they were not physically present at the time of service, but the court finds that the motion is moot and cannot consider the new evidence presented in the reply. The court also notes that the evidence presented in the reply is not admissible.
