 Case Number:  20STCV22904    Hearing Date:   November 9, 2023    Dept:  30 CLAUDE LAVOIE, et al. vs SANDRA SARNOFF, et al.Motion to Compel Responses to Form InterrogatoriesMotion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of DocumentsTENTATIVEDefendant’s motions to compel Plaintiffs to provide responses to form interrogatories and requests for production for documents are GRANTED. Plaintiffs Claude Lavoie and Donna Duvall are ordered to provide responses without objection to Defendant’s request for form interrogatories and request for production within 20 days of this order. Defendant’s request for sanctions is DENIED.  Moving party to give notice.DISCUSSIONOn January 18, 2022, Defendant propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production of Documents, Set One on Plaintiffs. (Rabbani Decl., ¶ 3; Exhs A.) Plaintiffs’ responses to defendant’s discovery were due on or by February 18, 2022. Responses were never received. Thereafter, on July 8, 2022, counsel for defendant sent an email to counsel for plaintiff indicating that responses to the discovery were overdue. (Id., ¶ 4; Exh. B.) Multiple extensions to respond were provided. As of the date of the filing of this Motion, defendant has still not received any discovery responses from plaintiffs. (Id., ¶ 8.)As Defendant properly served discovery requests and Plaintiffs failed to serve responses, the Court finds Defendant is entitled to a court order directing Plaintiff to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery requests served on Plaintiff. Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(a).) Thus, unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. Therefore, the motions are granted.Defendant also requests sanctions. Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2030.290(c) and 2031.300(c) allow for sanctions when the motion was unsuccessfully opposed. Here, as the motions were not opposed, the request for sanctions is denied.Defendant’s request for sanctions under CCP sections 2023.030 for the alleged misuse of discovery is also denied, as "sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.” (City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)
