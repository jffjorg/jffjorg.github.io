[1] The Court notes that the Opposition brief contains 26
pages, in violation of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(d) which
states:  “Except in a summary judgment or
summary adjudication motion, no opening or responding memorandum may exceed 15 pages.”  Therefore, it is within the authority of the
Court to disregard all pages of the Opposition in excess of the fifteenth
page.  Nonetheless, the Court exercises
its discretion and considers the excess pages although Respondent did not
obtain the Court’s permission to file a longer memorandum.  (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(e).)
