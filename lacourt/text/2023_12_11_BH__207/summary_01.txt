Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action pending the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding. The respondent, Tiera Terry, had filed a complaint against the defendant, Safa Elizabeth Sharabi, M.D., and Kaiser Permanente West Los Angeles Medical Center, alleging causes of action for medical malpractice, battery, and others. The defendant had presented evidence that the respondent had signed an arbitration agreement as part of the enrollment process for Kaiser's Inland Empire Health Plan (IEHP). The judge found that the arbitration provision was not procedurally unconscionable because it was the product of negotiation between IEHP and Kaiser, and Medi-Cal beneficiaries have the option to enroll in other plans. The judge also found that the provision was not substantively unconscionable because it did not impose unreasonable costs or fees on the parties. The judge ordered that the action be stayed pending the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding and set a status conference regarding the arbitration on June 5, 2024.
