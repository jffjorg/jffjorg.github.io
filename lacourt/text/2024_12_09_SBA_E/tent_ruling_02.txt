Motion To Quash The Subpoenas for Plaintiff's Employment Records
 
           
The Court considered the moving papers and opposition papers.
 
RULING
 
The Court grants Plaintiff's request to limit the subpoenas to
only documents relating to Plaintiff’s wages, hours worked, job description and
duties, and leave of absence records from 2016 to the present.
 
           

BACKGROUND
 
           
On June 6, 2023,
Plaintiff Ragini Gupt filed the Complaint against Defendants Manuel Madrigal,
David Rojas, and Y3D Trucking, alleging a single action of negligence arising
from a car collision. 
 
           
On May 8, 2024, Defendants served two subpoenas for Plaintiff’s employment
records from American Technology Consulting and Insight Global. Plaintiff
objected to these subpoenas as overbroad and argued they violated Plaintiff’s
and the third parties' constitutional privacy rights.
 
           
On June 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Quash Defendants’
Subpoenas
for
Plaintiff’s Employment Records.
 
           
On September 16, 2024, Defendants filed the Opposition.
 
           
No reply has been filed.
 
           

LEGAL
STANDARD
 
           
California Code of
Civil Procedure section 1987.1, subdivision (a) provides:¿ 
¿ 
If
a subpoena requires the attendance of a witness or the production of books,
documents, or other things before a court, or at the trial of an issue therein,
or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably made by any
person described in subdivision (b), or upon the court's own motion after
giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make an order
quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it
upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective
orders. In addition, the court may make any other order as may be appropriate
to protect the person from unreasonable or oppressive demands, including
unreasonable violations of the right of privacy of the person.¿ 
¿ 
(Code of
Civ. Proc., § 1987.1 subd. (a).)  
 
There
is no requirement that the motion contain a meet and confer declaration. (See
Code of Civ. Proc., § 1987.1.) A motion to quash the production of documents or
tangible things at deposition must be accompanied by a separate statement. (CRC
Rule 3.1345(a)(5).)¿ 
 
The
right of privacy of individuals is protected by the California Constitution.
(Cal. Const., Art. I, § 1.) In ruling on discovery motions, the Court must
balance the privacy claims of the responding party with the requesting party’s
need for the information. (Schnabel v. Superior Court (1993) 5 Cal.4th
704, 718-722.)¿ 
 ¿ 
“[P]laintiffs
are ‘not obligated to sacrifice all privacy to seek redress for a specific
[physical,] mental or emotional injury’; while they may not withhold
information which relates to any physical or mental condition which they have
put in issue by bringing [a] lawsuit, . . . they are entitled to retain the
confidentiality of all unrelated medical or psychotherapeutic treatment they
may have undergone in the past.” (Britt, supra, 20 Cal.3d at 864,
citation and footnote omitted.)¿However, “. . . privacy interests may have to
give way to [an] opponent’s right to a fair trial.¿Thus, courts must balance
the right of civil litigants to discover relevant facts against the privacy
interests of persons subject to discovery.” (Vinson v. Superior Court (1987)
43 Cal.3d 833, 842.)¿ 
 
DISCUSSION

 
On September 10, 2021, Plaintiff Ragini Gupt was stopped at a red
light at the intersection of Rosecrans Ave. and Isis Ave. in Hawthorne,
California. Defendant Manuel Madriged, driving a 2014 Freightliner Box Truck,
allegedly failed to stop at the red light and rear-ended Plaintiff’s vehicle,
causing severe damage to the vehicle and physical and psychological injuries to
Plaintiff. Defendant Y3D Trucking owned the box truck. Defendant David Rojas
was Defendant Madriged’s employer and the named insured on the truck’s
insurance policy at the time of the collision. Plaintiff claims that she has
never fully recovered from the accident, and that her future income may be
impacted. (Fiore Decl. ¶ 4, Exhibit B.)
 
The subpoenas at issue request “any and all employment, personnel,
and/or independent contractor records including, but not limited to,
wage/payroll, to include W-2s, W-41099s, salary increase/decrease records,
performance evaluations, pre-employment physical records, questionnaires, job
descriptions, job duties, job applications, termination notices, exit interview
records, disability payments, disability claims, disciplinary notices, leave of
absence records, attendance records, hours worked, time cards, supervisor
review notes, work-related injury records, workers compensation claims,
insurance benefits, and all other records pertaining to Ragini Gupt for
9/10/2016 to present.” (Motion to Quash p. 7.)
 
Plaintiff requests that the Court limit the subpoenas to “Records
related to Ms. Gupt’s wage/payroll, salary increase/decrease, leave of absence,
attendance, hours worked, and timecards between May and June of 2021; and
records related to Ms. Gupt’s job descriptions, job duties, job applications,
and resumes between the time of the incident on September 10, 2021 to the
present.” (Motion to Quash p. 15.)
 
Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s subpoenas seeking all employment
records related to Plaintiff are overly broad, intrusive, and violate her
constitutional right to privacy. Employment records are protected by privacy
rights under California law, and disclosure is limited to information directly
relevant to the claims in the lawsuit. (Board of Trustees v. Superior Court (1981)
119 Cal. App. 3d 516, 528-530.) Plaintiff emphasizes that privacy rights are
only waived to the extent necessary for resolving the litigation. (Vinson,
supra, 43 Cal.3d 833, 841-842.) Defendants must show a compelling need for
the information, and their subpoenas must be narrowly tailored to avoid
unnecessary intrusion. (Id.)
 
Here, Defendants have broadly requested “all other records”
without demonstrating how the information sought is directly relevant or
essential to the fair resolution of the case. Plaintiff contends that such
requests are not narrowly tailored and are not the least intrusive means to
obtain the desired information. 
 
Furthermore, Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s request for tax
records, including W-2s, W-4s, and 1099s, constitutes an unjustified and
excessive invasion of privacy, particularly given the minimal nature of
Plaintiff’s loss of income claim. Tax documents are privileged under California
law to encourage truthful tax reporting without fear of disclosure. (Brown
v. Superior Court (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 141, 143-44.) 
 
Plaintiff’s loss of income claim is limited to three specific days
in 2021, and Plaintiff has already provided sufficient evidence to substantiate
this claim, including verified responses to interrogatories, wage verification
from her employer, and other relevant documents. Defendants’ subpoenas,
however, seek years of tax records unrelated to the time period in question,
including records from a time after the alleged income loss. These requests are
overly broad, irrelevant, and unnecessary to evaluate the claim.
 
Given the minimal nature of the claim, Plaintiff argues that less
intrusive means, such as the already-provided wage verification, paystubs for
the relevant months, or deposition testimony, are sufficient. Courts require
discovery involving private information to be narrowly tailored, and Plaintiff
asserts that Defendants have failed to meet this standard, making their request
an unwarranted invasion of privacy. (Davis v. Superior Court, (1992) 7
Cal. App. 4th 1011, 1017-1018.) 
 
In opposition, Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s employment
records are directly relevant and necessary to evaluate her claims of
diminished earning capacity, job performance impact, and potential future
income loss due to injuries from the accident. By asserting that she is unable
to perform certain functions of her job and that her injuries may have lasting
effects on her earning potential, Plaintiff has placed her job performance and
lifetime earning capacity at issue. (Fiore Decl. ¶
4, Exhibit B.)
 
Defendants emphasize that relevance is broadly construed in favor
of permitting discovery when it might assist in evaluating the case, preparing
for trial, or facilitating settlement. (Code
of Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.) Information should be
seen as to the subject matter if it might reasonably assist in evaluating the
case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement thereof. (Gonzalez v.
Sup. Ct. (1995) 33 CA4th 1539, 1546.)
 
Defendant contends that the Court has held the employment records
are discoverable when a plaintiff asserts loss of earnings or impaired earning
capacity. (Pell v. Davis (1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 1196.) Plaintiff is
claiming lost earnings and potential lifetime diminished future income
capacity. Plaintiff also claims inability to complete certain work tasks while
also claiming a 100% increase in earnings in the last nine months. Thus,
employment records are relevant to Plaintiff’s claims.
 
Furthermore, Defendants argue that their subpoenas are not
overbroad but are reasonably limited to a five-year period before the accident,
targeting only records relevant to Plaintiff. The scope is necessary to address
discrepancies in Plaintiff’s income reports, pre-existing or post-accident
injuries, job performance, and overall earning capacity, which are central to
her claims of lost earnings and diminished earning capacity.
 
Defendants emphasize that the subpoenas are narrowly focused on
Plaintiff, eliminating privacy concerns for third parties. (Kirkland v.
Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92.) The inclusion of “any and all” in
the subpoenas is standard practice to ensure the complete production of
requested documents and does not make the request overly broad, especially when
the scope is confined to a specific timeframe, categories of records, and the
individual involved. (Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Superior Court (1988) 201
Cal.App.3d 591.) Since Plaintiff has alleged that her ability to perform her
job and future earning capacity has been harmed, Defendants argue they are
entitled to discover records related to her claims and potential defenses. 
 
While privacy is constitutionally protected, it must yield when
evidence essential to resolving a case is required. (Harris v. Superior
Court (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 661.) Plaintiff has placed her employment,
earnings, and job performance directly at issue by seeking damages for lost
wages, work impairment, and diminished future earning capacity. (Davis v.
Superior Court (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1008.) Consequently, Defendants contend
that their subpoenas are appropriately limited in time and scope to records
relevant to these claims and do not unnecessarily invade Plaintiff's privacy.
 
Plaintiff,
as the party asserting the right of privacy, bears the initial burden of
demonstrating (1) a “legally protected privacy interest”; (2) an “objectively
reasonable expectation of privacy in the given circumstances”; and (3) a
“threatened intrusion that is serious.” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017)
3 Cal.5th 531, 552.)  If Plaintiff meets this standard, Defendant must
then show that the requested documents are “directly relevant” to the
litigation. (Tylo v. Superior Court (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1387,
citing Britt v. Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 858-859.)¿ 
 
Plaintiff has shown that a legally protected privacy interest
exists in her employment records, that there is a reasonable expectation of
privacy in her employment records, and that subpoenas would be a serious
intrusion. (See, Board of Trustees, supra, 119 Cal. App. 3d 516,
528-530.) However, Defendant has also shown that some of the requested
documents are directly relevant to the litigation and cannot be attained
through other means. (See, Tylo, supra, 55 Cal.App.4th
1379, 1387.) 
 
Plaintiff
has placed her job performance and lifetime earning
capacity at issue by asserting that she may never recover from her injuries and
that her future income may be impacted. (Fiore Decl. ¶ 4, Exhibit B.) Furthermore, Defendants attempts at discovery regarding
these issues have not been fruitful. Plaintiff has not provided an estimate of
future income losses or how they plan to calculate lost income. Plaintiff has
produced a “Verification
of Incident–Related Wage Loss” form, but the dates that Plaintiff was absent
from work are ambiguous because there is a conflict between the year listed on
the form (2023) and the year described by Plaintiff’s responses (2021). (Fiore
Decl. ¶ 4, Exhibit B.) 
 
Thus, the Court finds that documents related to Plaintiff’s wages,
hours worked, job description and duties, and leave of absence records from
2016 to the present are directly related to Plaintiff's claims for damages
regarding future lost income. However, the Court finds that the requests
outside of those listed by the Court are not directly related to the damages in
the instant case.
 
Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiff's request to limit the
subpoenas to only documents relating to Plaintiff’s wages, hours worked, job
description and duties, and leave of absence records from 2016 to the present.
