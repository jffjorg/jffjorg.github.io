And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where Plaintiff Soleiman Hakakian is seeking a default judgment against Defendant Carson Ingle. However, the judge finds that Plaintiff's request for default judgment has three defects. First, Plaintiff did not request the dismissal of defendants Does 1-10, which is required by law. Second, Plaintiff used inapplicable Judicial Council forms, which are intended for unlawful detainer cases and not general civil actions like this one. Third, Plaintiff did not submit adequate evidence of his damages, which he is seeking in the amount of $105,000.

The judge orders Plaintiff to submit a revised application for default judgment by January 21, 2025, and sets an order to show cause re: entry of default judgment for January 30, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.
