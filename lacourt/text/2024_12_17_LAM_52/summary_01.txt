And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Plaintiff Lois Meehan's motion for $234,190 in attorney fees is denied. The court found that the lawsuit was not an "action to enforce" the governing documents under Civil Code section 5975, subdivision (c), as the plaintiff's claims were based on trespass and nuisance actions related to property rights, rather than enforcing specific provisions of the CC&Rs. The court noted that the plaintiff's rights as a property owner pre-existed the CC&Rs and would continue even if the CC&Rs were revoked or the easement contained in the CC&Rs was abolished. The judge also cited several prior cases that support the conclusion that attorney fees cannot be awarded in this situation.
