The court has issued a tentative ruling on a petition for approval of a compromise of a claim or action brought by Shakiesha Cleveland, the Guardian ad Litem and Petitioner, on behalf of minor claimant Rayshaun Young. The petition seeks approval of a settlement made by named defendant Alexis Nolan, who has agreed to pay a total of $15,000 to the minor claimant. The settlement amount is to be allocated as follows: $3,736.75 for medical expenses, $3,750 for attorney's fees, and $720.82 for costs, with the remaining $6,792.43 to be deposited in an insured account subject to withdrawal only with the court's authorization. The court has reviewed the petition and finds the settlement to be fair and reasonable, and in the best interest of the minor claimant. The court therefore grants the petition and orders the Petitioner to give notice of this ruling.
