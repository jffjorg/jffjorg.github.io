And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has tentatively ruled that a settlement between California Reflections, Inc. (CR) and Terry J. Horist was made in good faith. CR had sought to have the court determine that the settlement was legitimate, and since no one opposed the request, the judge did not need to consider all of the factors that normally come into play when evaluating the fairness of a settlement. The settlement required CR to pay Horist $21,750 in exchange for releasing Horist from claims related to a construction project. The judge found that the settlement was reasonable and did not conflict with the goals of the relevant law. As a result, the judge has granted CR's motion and declared that the settlement was made in good faith.
