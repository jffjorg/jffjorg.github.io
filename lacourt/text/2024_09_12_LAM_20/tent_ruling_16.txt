 On December 22, 2023, Plaintiffs Evelin Liseth Gonzalez Rodriguez, individually and as successor-in-interest of her deceased husband, Wilmer Ruben Martinez Paredes, Brianna Magali Martinez Gonzalez, Andy Ruben Martinez, and Aliyah Liseth Martinez Gonzalez filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) for (1) negligence, (2) strict liability—warning defect, (3) strict liability—design defect, (4) fraudulent concealment, and (5) breach of implied warranties.  The primary allegations of the FAC are as follows.  “From about 2004 to 2021, Decedent, WILMER RUBEN MARTINEZ PAREDES, cut, ground, drilled, edged, polished, fabricated and installed artificial stone and natural stone countertops for kitchens and bathrooms.”  “Decedent, WILMER RUBEN MARTINEZ PAREDES, was thereby exposed to and inhaled respirable crystalline silica, metals and other toxins from said products. As a direct and proximate result of WILMER RUBEN MARTINEZPAREDES’ exposure to silica, metals and other toxins within said products manufactured, distributed and/or supplied by Defendants, Decedent, WILMER RUBEN MARTINEZ PAREDES, developed and suffered from silicosis, pulmonary fibrosis, progressive massive fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, and other medical conditions that required medical treatment and hospitalizations, from which he died.”Plaintiffs now seek leave to file a second amended complaint.  They “wish to plead allegations of product liability against five recently identified defendants: COLORQUARTZ USA INC.; DAL-TILE TENNESSEE, LLC; LX HAUSYS AMERICA, INC.; O M G STONE WORKS INC. (DBA OLYMPIA MARBLE & GRANITE); and WILSONART LLC; to update Decedent’s work history (¶70-74, 32:6-25); and to update the Product Identification section paragraph 69 (26:24- 32:2).”The Court may, in the furtherance of justice, and upon any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 473, 576.)  In general, California courts liberally exercise discretion to permit amendment of pleadings in light of a strong policy favoring resolution of all disputes between parties in the same action.  (Nestle v. Santa Monica (1972) 6 Cal.3d 920, 939; Morgan v. Superior Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.)  “[T]here is a strong policy in favor of liberal allowance of amendments.”  (Mesler v. Bragg Management Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 296.)  Pursuant to this policy, requests for leave to amend generally will be granted unless the party seeking to amend has been dilatory in bringing the proposed amendment before the Court, and the delay in seeking leave to amend will cause prejudice to the opposing party if leave to amend is granted.  (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490; Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 558, 564-565.)  The decision on a motion for leave is directed to the sound discretion of the trial court.  (See generally Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2014) ¶¶ 6:637 et seq.)Because the Motion is unopposed and it is not apparent what prejudice there would be, the Motion is granted.  (See Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  The SAC is to be filed within 10 days.Moving party to give notice to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
