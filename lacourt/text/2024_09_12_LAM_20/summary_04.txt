And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, Associated Health Professionals, Inc. The plaintiff, Nicole Dickson, filed a complaint alleging FEHA discrimination, failure to provide accommodations, failure to engage in the interactive process, retaliation, and wrongful termination. The defendant seeks summary judgment or summary adjudication on all claims, including punitive damages.

The judge finds that there are triable issues of fact as to whether the defendant failed to provide reasonable accommodations and engaged in discrimination and retaliation against the plaintiff. Specifically, the judge notes that the defendant failed to respond to the plaintiff's accommodation requests and that the plaintiff's termination may have been due to her disability.

The judge grants summary adjudication as to the second and third causes of action (reasonable accommodations and interactive process) in favor of the defendant. However, the judge denies summary judgment on the remaining claims, including discrimination, retaliation, failure to prevent misconduct, and wrongful termination.

The judge also notes that there are triable issues as to whether the defendant acted with malice, oppression, or fraud, which would entitle the plaintiff to punitive damages. The case will proceed to trial on these issues.
