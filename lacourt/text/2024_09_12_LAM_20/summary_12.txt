And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in an employment action involving Alberto Moncada, the plaintiff, and Chubb Group of Insurance Companies, the defendant. On February 9, 2024, the court granted Moncada's motion to compel Chubb Group to comply with a subpoena issued to it. The subpoena sought workers' compensation claims and diary notes related to Moncada's workers' compensation claim. The court ordered Chubb Group to produce the documents within 30 days. However, Chubb Group failed to comply with the court's order, prompting Moncada to seek to hold the company in contempt and impose a monetary fine and sanctions. Since there is no opposition and it appears that Chubb Group has not complied with the court's order, the judge has granted Moncada's motion. The judge has ordered Chubb Group to pay a $1,000 fine to the court and $3,000 in sanctions to Moncada as his reasonable attorney fees.
