Striking of the Answer is scheduled for 12/04/2024 at 09:00 AM in Department O
at Pomona Courthouse South.”
 
On October 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
Plaintiff
brings forth the motion pursuant to CCP sections 435 and 436. 
 
In
turn, CCP section 435 provides the authority for a party seeking to strike an answer
by, in relevant part, stating that “[t]he filing of a notice of motion to strike an answer or
complaint, or portion thereof, shall not extend the time within which to
demur.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (d), emphasis added.) Where the plaintiff moves to strike the defendant's answer, the motion must be filed within the same time limit as
that allowed in responding to a pleading, which in the case of an answer, is ten (10) days after service, unless extended by stipulation or court order. (Code.
Civ. Proc. § 430.40(b).) As for CCP section 436, that provides that “[t]he court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to Section 435, or
at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper . . .
Strike out all or any part of
any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of this state….” (emphasis added.) 
 
 
 
Discussion
 
Here, Plaintiff seeks to strike Defendant’s answer
because as a corporation, it needs to be represented by counsel. It is well
settled that corporations may not appear in propria persona in adversary legal
proceedings. (Motion p. 4, citing Merco Constr. Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal
Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724.) According to the motion, Plaintiff’s Counsel
has made various attempts to contact Mr. Qiu at the number listed on the
Substitution of Attorney to meet and confer regarding Plaintiff’s intention to
file a Motion to Strike Blackseries’ Answer and Enter Default, but nobody has
answered. Of note, Defendant’s improper representation has been an issue
since September 25, 2024. Accordingly, pursuant to CCP section 436, by
exercising its discretion, the court strikes Defendant’s answer for the failure
to retain corporate counsel. 
 
Notwithstanding, as Plaintiff’s motion is untimely, the
court does not automatically enter default such that Plaintiff may proceed with
the necessary steps to secure a default and respective default judgment. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is granted insofar as
Defendant’s answer is stricken.
