[1] For this reason, Plaintiff’s evidentiary objection to
the declaration of Vija Rao regarding CAS is inapposite but would otherwise be
overruled. 


[2] For this reason—in that the Warranty is easy to read as
it has a table of contents and use boldface at times—the arbitration provision
is not “buried.” To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the Warranty is 41
pages long to suggest it is lengthy, the pages do not contain small font text
that take up an entire page single space to again suggest that the arbitration
provision is difficult to find or “buried” in the text. 


[3] The warranty explicitly states, “This Binding
Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted under the Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sections 1-16.” (Ameripour Decl., p. 19 of 33 of
PDF.) To the extent that the FAA may not apply, Plaintiff makes such argument
as to the CSA (Opp. p. 10:22-25), which is not at issue in the court’s
analysis. 
 


[4]
Plaintiff cites to a Whaley case but does not provide the entire case
citation for the court to review. (Opp. p. 12.) 
 


[5] And Plaintiff relies upon subsection (b), but that
provides that a court need not compel arbitration if it determines that
“[g]rounds exist for rescission of the agreement,” which is not at issue here. 
 


[6] The case was cited and heavily relied upon by
Plaintiff. The Reply does not address this argument nor the cases.

Reinsurance Corporation (1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 1637 (CV Starr) [conflicting
rules of fact in case wherein the controversy concerns the proper allocation of
a near $30 million settlement among 11 reinsurance carriers, one of 1 of which
was subject to the arbitration].)
