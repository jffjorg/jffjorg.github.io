And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a dispute concerning the arbitrability of a warranty. The plaintiff has objected to the declaration of Vija Rao regarding the warranty, but the judge finds that the objection is inapposite. The judge also rejects the plaintiff's argument that the arbitration provision in the warranty is "buried" due to its length and formatting. The warranty explicitly states that it is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, and the judge finds that the plaintiff's argument that the provision is difficult to find is not persuasive. The judge notes that the plaintiff relies on a statute that is not applicable to the case, and that the plaintiff's reliance on a Whaley case without providing the full citation is problematic. Finally, the judge references a California Appellate Court decision (C.V. Starr) to support its finding that the arbitration provision is not "buried".
