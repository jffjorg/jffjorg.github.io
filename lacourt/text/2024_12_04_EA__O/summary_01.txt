And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The motion of Plaintiff Apex Logistics International, Inc. to vacate and strike the answer and enter default of Defendant Blackseries Campers, Inc. is granted insofar as the court exercises its discretion to strike the answer. The court finds that Defendant has failed to retain corporate counsel, which is required for a corporation to appear in court. Despite this, the court does not automatically enter default and instead allows the parties to continue with the case. The court's ruling is based on CCP sections 435 and 436, which provide the authority for the court to strike an answer that is not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of the state. The court also notes that Defendant's improper representation has been an issue since September 25, 2024, and that the court will not tolerate such behavior.
