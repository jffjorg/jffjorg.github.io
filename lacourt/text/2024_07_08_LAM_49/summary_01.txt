And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling was issued by Judge Randolph M. Hammock on July 8, 2024, regarding a demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed by Defendant John Richette. The case involves a dispute between Plaintiff Yvonne Lan and several real estate brokers or agents who represented her in the sale of her property. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants convinced her to make various improvements to the property, but that they failed to exercise care in making the improvements, resulting in additional expenses for the plaintiff. The defendants demurred to the First Amended Complaint, arguing that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action against them. The court found that the plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to support her claims against the moving defendant, and therefore sustained the demurrer with 30 days' leave to amend.
