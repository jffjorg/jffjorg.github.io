 Case Number:  21STCV30629    Hearing Date:   March 25, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  A.   Case number 21STCV30629  On  August 19, 2021, Plaintiff Everilda Ruano (“Ruano”) filed an action against  Defendants Juan De La Cruz Gutierrez and Does 1-100 for motor vehicle tort and  general negligence. (Case number 21STCV30629.)  On  October 19, 2021, Defendant Juan De La Cruz Gutierrez filed an answer.  On  February 2, 2023, counsel informed the Court that Defendant Juan De La Cruz  Gutierrez had passed away.  On  September 11, 2023, Defendant Juan De La Cruz Gutierrez filed a motion to  consolidate this case with case number 21STCV34221, titled Manuel Cardenas v.  Juan De La Cruz Gutierrez and Does 1 to 30. The motion stated that Defendant  Juan De La Cruz Gutierrez had passed away on January 1, 2022.   On  November 7, 2023, the Court continued the motion to consolidate to November 20,  2023, noting that (1) the cases had not been related and (2) Plaintiff had not  filed an amendment naming a new defendant.  On  November 8, 2023, the Court found that case numbers 21STCV30629 and 21STCV34221  are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).  Case number 21STCV30629 became the lead case.  The cases were assigned to Department 28 at the Spring Street Courthouse for all  purposes.  On  November 13, 2023, Ruano amended the complaint to include Defendant Estate of Juan De La Cruz Gutierrez as Doe 1.  On  November 20, 2023, the Court denied the September 11, 2023 motion to consolidate without prejudice  because (1) no successor-in-interest had been named for Defendant Juan De La  Cruz Gutierrez and the complaint had not been amended to replace him with  another defendant, (2) although Plaintiff named the Estate of Juan De La Cruz  Gutierrez as a Doe defendant, the Estate of Juan De La Cruz Gutierrez did not  file the motion to consolidate and did not stand in the shoes of Defendant Juan  De La Cruz Gutierrez for purposes of the motion.  On  January 29, 2024, Defendant Estate of  Juan De La Cruz Gutierrez, deceased (erroneously sued as “Estate of Juan De La  Cruz Gutierrez”) filed an answer to Ruano’s complaint.  On  February 22, 2024, Defendant Estate of  Juan De La Cruz Gutierrez, deceased (erroneously sued as “Estate of Juan De La  Cruz Gutierrez”) filed a motion to consolidate case numbers 21STCV30629 and  21STCV34221.  No  trial is currently scheduled.  B.   Case number 21STCV34221  On  September 16, 2021, Plaintiff Manuel Cardenas (“Cardenas”) filed an action  against Defendant Juan Gutierrez and Does 1-10 for motor vehicle tort and  general negligence. (Case number 21STCV34221.)  On  November 4, 2021, Defendant Juan De La Cruz Gutierrez filed an answer.  On  January 3, 2023, Cardenas amended the complaint to add Defendant Estate of Juan  De La Cruz Gutierrez, deceased, as Doe 1.  On  November 8, 2023, the Court found that case numbers 21STCV30629 and 21STCV34221  are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule  3.300(a).  Case number 21STCV30629 became  the lead case. The cases were assigned to Department 28 at the Spring Street  Courthouse for all purposes.  Trial  is currently scheduled for September 3, 2024.   PARTY’S REQUEST            Defendant Estate of Juan De La Cruz Gutierrez, deceased  (erroneously sued as “Estate of Juan De La Cruz Gutierrez”) asks the Court to consolidate case numbers 21STCV30629 and 21STCV34221.  LEGAL STANDARD            Code of Civil Procedure section 1048, subdivision (a),  provides:  “(a) When actions involving a common question of law  or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of  any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions  consolidated and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may  tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048,  subd. (a).)  California  Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a), provides:  “(a) Requirements of motion  “(1)  A notice  of motion to consolidate must:  “(A)  List all  named parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names  of their respective attorneys of record;  “(B)  Contain  the captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest  numbered case shown first; and  “(C)  Be filed  in each case sought to be consolidated.  “(2)  The motion  to consolidate:  “(A)  Is deemed  a single motion for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but  memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in  the lowest numbered case;  “(B)  Must be  served on all attorneys of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the  cases sought to be consolidated; and  “(C)  Must have  a proof of service filed as part of the motion.”  (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a).)  Los  Angeles County Superior Court Local Rule 3.3(g) provides: “(1) Cases may not be  consolidated unless they are in the same department. A motion to consolidate  two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in  different departments, have been related into a single department, or if the  cases were already assigned to that department. (2) Upon consolidation of  cases, the first filed case will be the lead case, unless otherwise ordered by  the court. After consolidation, all future papers to be filed in the consolidated  case must be filed only in the case designated as the lead case. (3) Before  consolidation of a limited case with an unlimited case, the limited case must  be reclassified as an unlimited case and the reclassification fee paid.”  DISCUSSION            Defendant Estate of Juan De La Cruz Gutierrez, deceased  (erroneously sued as “Estate of Juan De La Cruz Gutierrez”) (“Moving Party”) has filed  a motion to consolidate case numbers 21STCV30629 and 21STCV34221.  Moving Party filed the motion in case number  21STCV30629.  However, Moving Party did  not file a notice of motion in case number 21STCV34221 as the rules of court require.  (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a)(1)(C).)  As a result, the motion was defective. At the March 25, 2024 hearing on the motion, counsel for the parties waived the defect by stipulating to consolidate case numbers 21STCV30629 and 21STCV34221.  Therefore, the Court grants the motion and orders the cases consolidated for all purposes.   CONCLUSION  The  Court GRANTS the motion to consolidate filed by Defendant Estate of Juan De La  Cruz Gutierrez, deceased (erroneously sued as “Estate of Juan De La Cruz  Gutierrez”) on February 22, 2024.  The Court consolidates case numbers 21STCV30629 and 21STCV34221 for all purposes.   Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
