And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled in favor of the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), in their motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs, Arsen Mesropyan and Emiliya Davtyan, alleged that MTA's bus was involved in a motor vehicle accident with their vehicle, causing their injuries. MTA argued that Davtyan did not substantially comply with the claim presentation requirement, as her claim did not identify her as a claimant and did not provide sufficient information to investigate her claim. The judge agreed with MTA, finding that Davtyan's failure to file a separate claim was not merely a defect in form, and that Mesropyan's claim did not sufficiently inform MTA that Davtyan wished to seek separate damages. As a result, Davtyan did not substantially comply with the claim presentation requirement, and MTA's motion for summary judgment was granted.
