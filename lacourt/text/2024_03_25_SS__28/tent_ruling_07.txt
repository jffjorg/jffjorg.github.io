BACKGROUND 
On
August 9, 2022, Plaintiff United Financial Casualty
Company (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Carlos Cortez
Cruz (“Defendant”), Carlos Diaz (“Diaz”), and Does 1-20 for motor vehicle tort.  The complaint demanded $40,988.76.  Plaintiff also
filed a statement of damage seeking $11,008.76 for property damage and $29,980.00
for uninsured motorist bodily injury payments, for a total of $40,988.76. 
On September
28, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing personal service of the
summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents on Defendant on September
1, 2022. 
On
October 3, 2022, the Court dismissed Diaz without prejudice at Plaintiff’s
request. 
On
January 22, 2024, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. On January 31, 2024, the Court dismissed the Doe
defendants without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On
January 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment to be heard on
March 25, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
United Financial Casualty Company asks the Court
to enter a default judgment against Defendant Carlos Cortez Cruz and award
Plaintiff $41,517.76, consisting of $40,988.76 as the demand of the complaint,
and $529.00 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default
judgment 
“[With
exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party seeking a default judgment on
declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry of Default (Application to Enter
Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following must be included in the documents
filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in unlawful detainer cases, a brief
summary of the case identifying the parties and the nature of plaintiff's
claim; 
“(2)  Declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A declaration of nonmilitary status for each
defendant against whom judgment is sought; 
“(6)  A proposed form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is
not sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties
under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request for attorney fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a cause
of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56, citing Johnson
v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
seeks reimbursement of the amount it paid its insureds in property damage and
uninsured motorist bodily injury benefits as the result of Defendant’s
negligence.  Plaintiff has provided
evidence supporting its payment of $10,271.24 to insured Rudy Zendejas for
property damage. 
However,
Plaintiff has provided no evidence showing that its payments of $15,000.00 to
insured Rudy Zendejas and $15,000.00 to insured Margarita Ochoa were based on
the insureds’ reasonably incurred medical expenses.  (Together, these amounts are also slightly larger than the $29,980.00 for uninsured motorist bodily injury payments listed in the statement of damages.)  Similarly, Plaintiff has provided no evidence
that its payment of $737.52 to insured Rudy Zendejas for “loss of use/rental”
was based on reasonably incurred expenses.  Plaintiff should provide records showing that the
insureds incurred these expenses. 
The
Court denies the application without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff United Financial
Casualty Company’s application for default judgment filed
on January 30, 2024 without prejudice. 
The
Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to Resubmit Default
Judgment Packet on May 16, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28 of the Spring
Street Courthouse. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
