And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion filed by the Defendant, County of Los Angeles, to take the depositions of two state prisoners, George Almaraz-Flores and Jessica Grajeda, who are currently incarcerated at Wasco State Prison and California State Prison, Chowchilla, respectively. The motion is granted, allowing the depositions to take place within 70 days of the ruling. The depositions will be conducted either virtually by Zoom or in person at the prisons. The Court finds that the motion complies with the statutory requirements and that the testimony of Almaraz-Flores and Grajeda is relevant to the Plaintiff's contention that the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services negligently failed to investigate and stop the abuse of a minor.
