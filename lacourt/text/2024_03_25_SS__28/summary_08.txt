And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint. The defendant had argued that the service was improper because they did not live at the address where the papers were left, and the proof of service did not identify a person authorized to accept service for a business. The judge found that the service was not effective and that the court did not acquire jurisdiction over the defendant. As a result, the judge quashed the service and set a hearing to consider dismissing the case for failure to file proof of service.
