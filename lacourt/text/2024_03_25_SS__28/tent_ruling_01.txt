LEGAL STANDARD 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.220 provides: 
“(a) In any case in which a plaintiff is seeking
recovery for personal injuries, any defendant may demand one physical
examination of the plaintiff, if both of the following conditions are
satisfied: 
“(1) The examination does not include any diagnostic
test or procedure that is painful, protracted, or intrusive. 
“(2) The examination is conducted at a location within
75 miles of the residence of the examinee. 
“(b) A defendant may make a demand under this article
without leave of court after that defendant has been served or has appeared in
the action, whichever occurs first. 
“(c) A demand under subdivision (a) shall specify the
time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, as well
as the identity and the specialty, if any, of the physician who will perform
the examination. 
“(d) A physical examination demanded under subdivision
(a) shall be scheduled for a date that is at least 30 days after service of the
demand. On motion of the party demanding the examination, the court may shorten
this time. 
“(e) The defendant shall serve a copy of the demand
under subdivision (a) on the plaintiff and on all other parties who have
appeared in the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2032.220.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2032.230 provides: 
“(a) The plaintiff to whom a demand for a physical
examination under this article is directed shall respond to the demand by a
written statement that the examinee will comply with the demand as stated, will
comply with the demand as specifically modified by the plaintiff, or will
refuse, for reasons specified in the response, to submit to the demanded
physical examination. 
“(b) Within 20 days after service of the demand the
plaintiff to whom the demand is directed shall serve the original of the
response to it on the defendant making the demand, and a copy of the response
on all other parties who have appeared in the action. On motion of the
defendant making the demand, the court may shorten the time for response. On
motion of the plaintiff to whom the demand is directed, the court may extend
the time for response.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2032.230.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.240 provides: 
“(a) If a plaintiff to whom a demand for a physical
examination under this article is directed fails to serve a timely response to
it, that plaintiff waives any objection to the demand. The court, on motion,
may relieve that plaintiff from this waiver on its determination that both of
the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The plaintiff has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Section 2032.230. 
“(2) The plaintiff’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The defendant may move for an order compelling
response and compliance with a demand for a physical examination. 
“(c) The court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
response and compliance with a demand for a physical examination, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
“(d) If a plaintiff then fails to obey the order
compelling response and compliance, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to that sanction the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2032.240.) 

DISCUSSION 
On
August 9, 2023, Defendant served a demand to have Brian Grossman, M.D., conduct
Plaintiff’s physical examination on September 13, 2023 at 11:00 a.m. at 6815
Noble Avenue, 2nd Floor, Van Nuys, CA 91405. 
Plaintiff did not serve an objection to the demand. 
On September 13, 2023, Plaintiff did not appear for the examination.  As a result, Brian Grossman, M.D. sent a no-show bill for $2,495.00. 
On September
25, 2023, Defendant’s counsel sent Plaintiff’s counsel an email asking why
Plaintiff did not appear for the September 13, 2023 physical examination.  Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond. 
On November
29, 2023, Defendants served a second demand to have Brian Grossman, M.D.,
conduct Plaintiff’s physical examination. The examination was scheduled for
December 20, 2023 at 11:00 a.m. 
Plaintiff did not serve an objection.  On December 18, 2023, Defendant’s counsel
asked Plaintiff’s counsel to confirm that Plaintiff would appear for the
examination.  Plaintiff’s counsel
responded, “Our client has confirmed.” 
Nonetheless,
Plaintiff did not appear for the examination on December 20, 2023.  Brian Grossman, M.D. sent a no-show bill for $2,495.00. 
The
Court grants Defendant’s motion under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2032.240, subdivision (b). 
Defendant
requests $5,801.65 in sanctions based on the no-show fees, three hours of
attorney time, and one filing fee.  Code of Civil
Procedure section 2032.240, subdivision (c), authorizes the Court to impose
sanctions against “any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel response and compliance with a demand for a physical
examination, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2032.240, subd. (c).)  Although Plaintiff’s
failure to appear at two scheduled physical examinations caused Defendant to
incur nearly $5,000.00 in no-show fees and required Defendant to file this motion, Plaintiff did
not make or oppose a motion to compel compliance with a demand for a physical examination.  Therefore, the Court lacks statutory authorization
to grant Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Defendant Daryl Owens’s motion to compel Plaintiff Amged Wilson Rizkalla’s appearance at a physical examination.  Defendant Daryl Owens is ordered to appear
for a physical examination by Brian Grossman, M.D., within 15 days of the hearing on this motion. 
The Court reopens discovery for the purpose of
completing Plaintiff Amged Wilson Rizkalla’s physical examination and any
related motions. 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Daryl Owens’s request for sanctions. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
