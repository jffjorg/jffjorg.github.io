LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part: 
“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party
to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party,
or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored

 “(g) (1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
“(2) On motion of any other party who, in person or by
attorney, attended at the time and place specified in the deposition notice in
the expectation that the deponent’s testimony would be taken, the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
in favor of that party and against the deponent or the party with whom the
deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (a), (b), (g).) 
DISCUSSION 
On
November 28, 2023, Defendants noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for December 11,
2023.  Plaintiff was not available on December
11, 2023, so Defendants re-noticed the deposition for December 12, 2023.  
Plaintiff’s
counsel informed Defendants’ counsel that Plaintiff was not available for
deposition until February 2024.  On
January 2, 2024, Defendants’ responded that if Plaintiff’s counsel did not
provide available deposition dates within 7 days, Defendants’ counsel would
unilaterally notice the deposition and, if Plaintiff did not attend, Defendants
would take a non-appearance and file a motion to compel. 
On
January 10, 2024, Defendants unilaterally noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for
January 25, 2024.  Plaintiff did not
appear on January 25.  Defendants took a certificate of non-appearance and filed this motion. 
The
Court grants Defendants’ motion and orders Plaintiff to appear for a deposition
within 30 days. 
“If
a motion under [Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450] subdivision (a) is
granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and
against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless
the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” 
Defendants
request $1,766.95 in sanctions based on five hours of attorney time at a rate
of $140.00 per hour, a $60.00 filing fee, and a $1,006.95 non-appearance fee.  The Court awards $1,346.95 based on two hours
of attorney time, one filing fee, and the non-appearance fee. 
  The
Court finds good cause and grants Defendants’ motion to continue the
trial.  The Court continues the trial to August
29, 2024.  The Court construes Defendants’
request to continue discovery as a motion to reopen discovery and grants the motion.  Discovery and related dates will be based on
the new trial date. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS the motion of Defendants The Hertz Corporation and
Jason Tanner to compel Plaintiff Yader Pedrosa’s
deposition.  The Court orders Plaintiff
Yader Pedrosa to appear for a deposition within 30 days. 
The Court GRANTS the request for sanctions of
Defendants The Hertz Corporation and Jason Tanner.  The Court orders Plaintiff Yader Pedrosa and
his counsel to pay Defendants The Hertz Corporation and Jason Tanner $1,346.95
within 30 days. 
The Court GRANTS the motion of Defendants The Hertz
Corporation and Jason Tanner to continue the trial.  The Court continues the trial to August 29,
