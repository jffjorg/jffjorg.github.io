II.
ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard for Petition to Confirm Arbitration
 
Once arbitration is concluded, “any arbitrator’s
award is enforceable only when confirmed as a judgment of the superior
court.”  (O’Hare v. Municipal Resource Consultants (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th
267, 278.).  Any of the parties may file
a petition with the court, which must then “confirm the award, correct and
confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1285, 1286; EHM Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of
Hollywood, Inc. (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.)  “It is well settled that the scope of judicial review of arbitration
awards is extremely narrow.”  (California Faculty Assn. v. Superior Court
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.)  “Neither the trial court, nor the appellate court, may
‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the evidence, or the
arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an award because of an
arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on the award’s face.”  (EHM
Productions, supra, at p. 1063-64.)
 
Code of Civil Procedure, section
1285.4 states: “A petition under this chapter shall:
 
(a)   
Set forth the substance of or
have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies
the existence of such an agreement.
(b)  
Set forth the names of the
arbitrators.
(c)   
Set forth or have attached a copy
of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.
 
Moreover, Code of Civil
Procedure, section 1283.6 provides that: “The neutral arbitrator shall serve
a signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by
registered or certified mail or as provided in the agreement.”  (Emphasis added.)  In addition, a party may seek a court
judgment confirming an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition no
more than four years, but not less than 10 days, after the award is served.  (Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 1288, 1288.4.)
 
Code of Civil Procedure, section 1290.4, the
statute governing proper service of this Petition states, in pertinent part: 
 
“(a) A copy of the petition and a written notice of the
time and place of the hearing thereof and any other papers upon which the
petition is based shall be served in the
manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the service of such petition
and notice.
(b) If the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner in which such
service shall be made and the person upon whom service is to be made has not
previously appeared in the proceeding and has not previously been served in
accordance with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service within this State shall be made
in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.
 
B.      Petition
 
Petitioner
and Respondents entered into a Collective Bargaining Agreement (“CBA”)
containing an arbitration provision governing certain disputes between the
parties arising out of the CBA.  (Pet. ¶ 4, Attach. 4(b).) 
A copy of the agreement is filed as Attachment 4(b) and presents a list
of authorized arbitrators approved by the parties, including Paul E.
Crost.  (Attach. 4(b) – Art. 11.C.2.e.3.)  Following a dispute between the parties
regarding a breach of the CBA, on December 1, 2020, arbitrator Paul E. Crost issued an Opinion and Award in
favor of Petitioner and against Respondents as follows: (1) payment of “residuals
compensation…in the principal amount of $17,270.85;” (2) payment of “interest
on the unpaid residuals compensation…in the amount of $17,880.81 which amount
shall continue to accrue at the MBA rate of 1.5% per months until the unpaid
residuals compensation is paid in full;” and (3) payment of “$15,000 as damages
for their failure to comply with the financial reporting requirements and for
their failure to provide a valid assumption agreement as required by the MBA,”
for a total of $50,151.66.  (Attach.
8(c), p. 49.)  Arbitrator Crost served
Respondents with the Opinion and Award by first class mail, postage prepaid on
December 3, 2020.  (Pet. pp. 50-51.)
 
Petitioner
requests that the Court confirm the arbitration award and grant additional interest
on the unpaid residuals compensation at a rate of 18% per year or 1.5% per
month from December 1, 2020, to January 8, 2025, for a total of $12,944.50.  (Pet. ¶ 10; Proposed Order; Holmes Decl.)
 
The
Court finds that the Petition was timely filed. 
Respondents were served with the Petition and Notice of Hearing by
personal service on December 5, 2024, in accordance with Article 11.A.6 of the
CBA.  (12-16-24 Proof of Personal
Service.)  Additional papers were served
on Respondents by certified or registered mail on December 16, 2024.  (12-16-24 Proof of Service by Mail.)  Moreover, Petitioner’s counsel Dylan R.
Holmes has presented a calculation of the interest requested in his declaration
filed on December 16, 2024.
 
Given
that Petitioner has complied with all of the requirements for the instant
Petition, the Court grants the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award for a
total judgment of $63,096.16, to be paid by Respondents.
