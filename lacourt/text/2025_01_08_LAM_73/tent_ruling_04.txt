REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT (filed 11/26/2024) 
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
Plaintiffs’ request for default judgment is GRANTED in the total
amount of $52,667.45.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff’s
Complaint alleges that Defendants contracted for Plaintiff’s accounting
services. (Complaint, ¶¶ 9-16.) Defendants and Plaintiff entered into a written
promissory note on February 5, 2024, whereby Defendants would pay $45,965.00 to
Plaintiff upon receiving funding and working capital for Defendants’ business.
(Id., ¶¶ 17-18; Khalawafi Decl., Exh. A.) Although Defendants received
such capital and were able to pay the Note, Defendants refused to pay the
promised sum to Plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 22.)
 
On
July 18, 2024, Plaintiff Moskowitz and Company Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed its
Complaint against Defendants Sync Brokerage, Inc. (“Sync”), Andres Hoyos
(“Hoyos”) (collectively, “Defendants”), and Does 1 through 20, inclusive,
alleging the following causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Fraud, and
(3) Quantum Meruit. Plaintiff’s Complaint prays for damages on breach of the
promissory note totaling $45,965.00, punitive damages on the fraud claim,
reasonable litigation costs, pre-judgment interest at the legal rate, and
attorneys’ fees as permitted by the promissory note. 
 
On
August 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed its Proof of Service of Summons as to both
Defendants, indicating that a registered California process server served both
Defendants by personal service at the corporate address for Sync located at
17404 Ventura Blvd, #110, Los Angeles, CA 91316. The proof of service further
indicates that the summons package for each defendant was left in the care of
named defendant Hoyos.
 
On
September 5, 2024, the Court Clerk entered default as to both Defendants.
 
On
November 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed its Request for Entry of Default Judgment as
to both Defendants, including its default prove-up package, requesting the
following damages, including: (1) damages on Defendants’ breach of the
promissory note, totaling $45,965.00; (2) pre-judgment interest on Defendants’
breach of contract since February 5, 2024; (3) Plaintiff’s costs of litigation
totaling $675.08; and (4) Plaintiff’s statutory attorneys’ fees, as permitted
through the promissory note, totaling $1,7698.95.
 
II.DISCUSSION

Plaintiff’s
exhibits presented in support of its request for default judgment indicates
that Plaintiff and Defendants entered into a promissory note for “the sum of $45,965.00
upon [Defendants] receiving funding and working capital for [Sync].” (Khalawafi
Decl., ¶ 1; Exh. A, p. 1.)
Plaintiff is
also entitled to pre-judgement interest in its breach of contract claim because
the damages can be calculated with certainty. (CCP § 3287; National Farm
Workers Service Ctr., Inc. v. M. Caratan, Inc. (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 796,
808.) Although the contract does not stipulate a rate of interest, the
statutory interest at 10 percent per annum after the breach applies since the
date of the breach. (Civ. Code § 3289(b).) Plaintiff requested pre-judgment
interest in its prayer for relief. (Complaint, at Prayer, ¶ 5.) Therefore,
Plaintiff is entitled to pre-judgment interest on the total amount demanded,
$45,965.00, at the rate of 10 percent per year, or $4,596.50, and equaling
$12.59 per day ($4,596.50 divided by 365). Plaintiff’s allegations of the
Complaint indicate that Defendants breached the promissory note on the day it
was entered, February 5, 2024, because they never intended to perform their
obligations and simply intended to induce Plaintiff to perform for free.
(Complaint, ¶¶ 11-22.) Because this judgment is entered on January 8, 2025, Plaintiff
is entitled to 338 days of pre-judgment interest accrual, totaling 4,255.42
(338 days multiplied by $12.59.)
 
As the
prevailing party, and per the express terms of the promissory note, Plaintiff
is also entitled to recover its reasonable litigation costs as permitted by
statute. (CCP § 1032(b); Complaint, ¶ 28; Khalawafi Decl., Exh. A, p. 1 at ¶
IV, “Collection Costs.”) Plaintiff incurred a total of $675.08 in recoverable
litigation costs, including $435 in initial filing fees, $87.51 in process
server fees, and $152.57 in electronic filing fees through One Legal to file
each of the documents in this action. (Federici Decl., ¶ 3.)
 
Per the
express terms of the written promissory note, Plaintiff is also entitled to recover
his attorney’s fees. (Complaint, ¶ 28; Khalawafi Decl., Exh. A, p. 1 at ¶ IV,
“Collection Costs.”) As an uncontested default case, Plaintiff’s attorneys’
fees are governed by L.A. Superior Court Local Rule 3.214(a). The damages
sought are $45,965.00, so Plaintiff is therefore entitled to $690 plus 3
percent of the excess over $10,000.00. The excess over $10,000.00 is
$35,695.00. 3 percent of $35,965.00 is $1,078.95. Therefore, Plaintiff is
entitled to $1,768.95 in recoverable attorneys’ fees ($690.00 + $1,078.95).
(Federici Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
III.
CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiffs’ request for default judgment is GRANTED in the total
amount of $52,667.45.
