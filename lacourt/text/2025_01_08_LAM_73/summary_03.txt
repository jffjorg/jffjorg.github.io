And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Rolf M. Treu, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Brittany Powell v. God's Pantry, et al. (Case No. 24STCV12497). The case involves claims of retaliatory termination and labor code violations by God's Pantry against Plaintiff Brittany Powell.

The Judge has granted God's Pantry's motion to compel Plaintiff's deposition, setting the date for January 16, 2024. The Judge has also granted God's Pantry's request for sanctions in the amount of $2,440.00, payable within 30 days. The sanctions are based on God's Pantry's counsel's claim of excessive time spent on the motion and reply.

The Judge found that God's Pantry has sought to take Plaintiff's deposition since July 16, 2024, and that Plaintiff's counsel has objected to deposition dates without providing alternative dates. The Judge also found that God's Pantry's counsel spent excessive time on the motion and reply, but reduced the amount of time spent on the motion and reply based on the simplicity and brevity of the issues.
