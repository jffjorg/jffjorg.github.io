I. BACKGROUND
 
This case arises from Defendant God’s Pantry’s (God’s Pantry),
South Bay Workforce Investment Board, Inc.’s (South Bay), and Augusto Dolce’s
(Dolce) (collectively, Defendants) alleged retaliatory termination of Plaintiff
Brittany Powell (Plaintiff). Plaintiff alleges that Defendants refused to
properly compensate her for overtime hours and failed to provide her with
required meal and rest breaks in violation of the Labor Code. (Compl., ¶¶
24-28.) Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants were requiring her, as a
paralegal, to engage in the unauthorized practice of law. (Id. ¶¶
32-33.) 
 
On May 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants
alleging causes of action for: (1) Failure to Pay Minimum Wages, (2) Failure to
Furnish Wage and Hour Statements, (3) Failure to Maintain Payroll Records, (4)
Failure to Provide Meal and Rest Period Compensation, (5) Failure to Pay
Overtime Compensation, (6) Failure to Pay Wages in a Timely Manner, (7) Waiting
Time Penalties, (8) Failure to Indemnify/Reimburse Necessary Expenditures
Incurred During Discharge Work Duties, (9) Unfair Competition, (10),
Whistleblower Retaliation, and (11) Wrongful Termination. 
 
On October 17, 2024, Defendant God’s Pantry filed the instant motion to
compel Plaintiff’s deposition. On December 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition. On December 31, 2024, God’s Pantry filed a reply. 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
Any party may obtain discovery, subject to
restrictions, by taking the oral deposition of any person, including any party
to the action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.)  A properly served
deposition notice is effective to require a party or party-affiliated deponent
to attend and to testify, as well as to produce documents for inspection and
copying.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).) 
 
California Code of Civil Procedure section¿2025.450,
subdivision (a) provides:¿“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to
the action . . . , without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for¿inspection any document . . . described in the deposition notice, the party
giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance
and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document . . .
described in the deposition notice.”¿ 
 
California Code of Civil Procedure section¿2025.450,
subdivision (b) provides:¿“A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following:¿ 
 

The motion shall
     set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
     inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
     thing described in the deposition notice.¿ 

 

The motion shall
     be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040,
     or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the
     documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the
     deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has
     contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”

 
B.      Discussion
 
God’s Pantry argue that Plaintiff’s deposition should be compelled
because God’s Pantry has
sought to take Plaintiff’s deposition since around July 16, 2024 when the
first notice of deposition was served upon Plaintiff. (Vasquez Decl., ¶ 3,
Exhibit A.) The noticed deposition was set for August 22, 2024. (Id. ¶
3, Exhibit A.) On August 15, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel then objected to the
August 22, 2024 date, and according to God’s Pantry, the objection failed to
provide any alternative dates. (Id. ¶ 5, Exhibit B.) 
 
According to God’s Pantry, on September 25, 2024, God’s Pantry served
another notice of deposition for October 14, 2024, and informed Plaintiff’s
counsel that Plaintiff would have until September 27, 2024 to object to the new
date. (Id. ¶ 10, Exhibit E.) On October 7, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel
objected to the October 14, 2024 date, and provided no alternative dates. (Id.
¶ 11, Exhibit F.) On October 7, 2024, God’s Pantry’s counsel emailed Plaintiff
stating that God’s Pantry had been trying to find dates for Plaintiff’s
deposition and then provided alternative dates for the deposition for dates in
October. (Id. ¶ 13, Exhibit G.) 
According to God’s Pantry, from the date of filing the instant motion,
Plaintiff’s counsel has not responded nor provided alternative dates. (Id.
¶ 15.) 
 
Plaintiff argues that on the date of filing the instant motion,
Plaintiff’s counsel provided God’s Pantry with alternative dates for
Plaintiff’s deposition to be completed in early December. (LaCour Decl., ¶ 5,
Exhibit B.) God’s Pantry’s counsel rejected the alternative dates, and asked
for additional dates after January 7, 2025, to which Plaintiff’s counsel
complied. (Id., Exhibit A.) The parties agreed that January 16, 2024
would be a workable date for taking Plaintiff’s deposition. (Id.,
Exhibit C.) 
 
The Court finds that compelling Plaintiff’s deposition to be proper.
God’s Pantry has served two notices for Plaintiff’s deposition, and Plaintiff’s
counsel has objected to both without provided alternative dates. When God’s
Pantry emailed Plaintiff on October 7, 2024 and provided further dates,
Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond until October 17, 2024, the date the
instant motion was filed. It was not until the threat of the motion that
Plaintiff’s counsel cooperated and finally provided God’s Pantry with
alternative dates in October. Once Plaintiff’s counsel provided these
alternative October dates did that process begin to reach a consensus on when Plaintiff’s
deposition can be taken. Thus, the Court will hold Plaintiff to the agreed upon
date of January 16, 2024.
 
God’s Pantry’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition is GRANTED for the
date of January 16, 2024. 
 
C.      Sanctions
 
The
Court finds that sanctions against Plaintiff’s counsel is proper. 
 
As
explained above, Plaintiff refused to provide God’s Pantry’s counsel with
alternative dates to take Plaintiff’s deposition that worked with Plaintiff’s
counsel, when God’s Pantry’s counsel served two notices to take Plaintiff’s
deposition. It was when the instant motion was filed that Plaintiff’s counsel
began adequately participating in the discovery process and provided God’s
Pantry’s counsel with alternative dates, which ultimately resulted in the
agreed upon date of January 16, 2024.
 
God’s
Pantry is seeking $4,522.50 in sanctions.
 
Counsel
declares that his hourly rate $595.00. (Vasquez Decl., ¶ 16.) The Court finds
this hourly rate to be reasonable, given the experience of counsel. Counsel
further declares that he spent 3.5 hours researching and preparing the instant
motion, with an anticipated 2 hours preparing the reply, and an anticipated two
hours for attending the hearing. (Ibid.) 
 
The
Court finds this excessive. The Court will decrease the amount of time spent on
the motion to 1.5 hours, given the simplicity and brevity of the issues. The
Court will decrease the amount of time drafting a reply to 1.5 hours. The Court
will also decrease the amount spent for attending the hearing to 1.0 hour,
given the option for remote appearances. Thus, the Court will aware 4.0 hours
at $595.00 an hour, plus the $60.00 filing fee, which equals $2,440.00.
 

III. DISPOSITION
 
 Based on the foregoing, God’s Pantry’s
motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition is GRANTED for the date of January 16,
2024. God’s Pantry’s request for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of
$2,440.00 payable within 30 days.
