And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to stay the action by defendants Dalya Eilat, Veetahl Eilat Rachel, and Aaron Eilat, who argue that the case should be tried in Israel instead of California. The court has already found that Israel is a suitable place for trial and that private and public interests weigh substantially in favor of litigating the case there. However, the court is concerned that one of the defendants, 439 Bonnie Brae LLC, may be a "nominal defendant" who is not really important to the outcome of the case.

The court has ordered the parties to brief the issue of whether the presence of Bonnie Brae precludes staying or dismissing the action as to the moving defendants for forum non conveniens. The court has also ordered plaintiff to show cause why the court should not dismiss the action against Bonnie Brae for delay in prosecution.

The court has stayed the entire action as to defendants Dalya Eilat, Veetahl Eilat Rachel, and Aaron Eilat, and has ordered plaintiff to proceed with seeking default judgment against Bonnie Brae. The court will continue to consider the motion to stay for forum non conveniens on March 25, 2023.
