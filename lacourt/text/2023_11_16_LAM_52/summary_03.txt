And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Michal Ben-Shoshan, moves to strike or tax the defendant, Zohar Tsfira's, memorandum of costs. The defendant claims $21,685 in court reporter fees, which the plaintiff disputes as unreasonable. The court finds that the defendant is entitled to recover these costs because the plaintiff was entitled to an official court reporter at no cost, but the court did not provide one. The court also taxes the court reporter fees as "merely convenient or beneficial" to litigating the action rather than "reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation."

The court also allows the defendant to recover all other expenses stated in the memorandum of costs, including filing, motion, and jury fees, taking, video recording, and transcribing necessary depositions, and fees for the electronic filing or service of documents. However, the court denies the defendant's claim for $1,172 in Westlake investigation costs as it was incurred for an investigation that was not necessary to the conduct of the litigation.

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to strike or tax the defendant's memorandum of costs in part, taxing the defendant's court reporter fees of $21,685 and allowing the defendant to recover $10,218 in costs from the plaintiff.
