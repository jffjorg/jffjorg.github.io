Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the pleadings and motions in this case, which arises from the plaintiff's purchase of a 2020 Ford F-150 with defects covered by warranty. Ford has moved for judgment on the pleadings against Ayala, arguing that her complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

The court agrees with Ford that Ayala's complaint does not allege facts indicating that the vehicle was new, which is a requirement for certain claims under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The court also finds that Ayala's failure to allege the source of the vehicle and her failure to state facts sufficient to support a claim for breach of express warranty under the Act also supports Ford's motion.

The court notes that there is a split of authority among the Courts of Appeal regarding whether the sale of a previously owned vehicle with a remaining warranty is a "new motor vehicle" within the meaning of the Song-Beverly Act. However, the court finds the reasoning of Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 209 more persuasive than Jensen v. BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112 on this point.

The court denies Ford's motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to Ayala's third and fourth causes of action, which are based on the Commercial Code and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, as Ford failed to make a cogent legal argument or cite any legal authority in support of its motion. The court also denies Ford's motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to Ayala's fifth cause of action, which is based on the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, as Ayala's complaint fails to state facts sufficient to support a claim under this act.

The court grants Ford's motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to Ayala's first, second, and fifth causes of action, and gives Ayala 20 days to amend her complaint.
