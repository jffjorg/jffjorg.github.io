Background
On July 20, 2020,
Stephanie E. Wantuch (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Walmart, Inc.
(“Defendant”) for negligence arising out of an alleged slip and fall on
September 25, 2018.  Walmart filed an
answer on May 10, 2021 and an amended answer on May 19, 2021.
 
On December 16, 2022, Plaintiff’s
counsel was relieved as counsel.
 
On March 23, 2023, Defendant served
Plaintiff with discovery, including Special Interrogatories (Set Three), Requests
for Production of Documents (Set Three), and Requests for Admission (Set
Three). (Smith Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A.) 
Plaintiff did not respond.  (Id.,
¶ 4.)
 
On June 22, 2023, Defendant filed the
three motions that are set for hearing on May 15: two motions to compel and one
motion for a deemed-admitted order. 
Defendant also seeks sanctions.
 
Plaintiff has not filed any opposition
to these motions.
 
Legal
Standard
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall impose
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion],
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7
of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
 
Defendant served Plaintiff in March
2023 with Special Interrogatories (Set Three), Requests for Production of
Documents (Set Three), and Requests for Admission (Set Three). (Smith Decls., ¶
3 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff has never
responded.  (See Id., ¶ 4.)
 
Defendant need not show anything
more.  The motions to compel responses to
the special interrogatories and requests for production are granted.  The motion for a deemed-admitted order is
granted.
 
Defendant’s requests for sanctions are
denied.
As to the two motions to compel
initial responses, the Legislature has authorized sanctions only against a
party or attorney “who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion to
compel.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) & 2031.300,
subd. (c).)  Here, no opposition was
filed, and so Plaintiff has not unsuccessfully opposed the motion.
As to the motion for a
deemed-admitted order, sanctions are mandatory. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)  But monetary sanctions are
not properly requested in the notice of motion and motion, and there is not adequate
evidence in the attorney declaration to support any sanctions request
