And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to reopen discovery for limited purposes, allowing them to issue and serve two subpoenas for medical records related to the plaintiffs' treatments and diagnoses. The court considered the four factors set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050, including the necessity and reasons for the discovery, the diligence or lack of diligence of the party seeking the discovery, any likelihood of preventing the case from going to trial, and the length of time elapsed between trial dates. The court found that while some factors favor the defendants, the court grants the motion due to the defendants' showing of good cause.
