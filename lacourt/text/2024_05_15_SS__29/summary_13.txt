```

And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied without prejudice DoorDash's motion to strike punitive damages from the First Amended Complaint. The motion is denied because the First Amended Complaint has not been filed with the Court, and it is not the operative pleading. The Judge also notes that DoorDash should have met and conferred with the parties before filing the motion to strike. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that DoorDash can refile the motion if it is necessary.
