 Case Number:  22STCV27541    Hearing Date:   May 15, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Deem the Truth of the Matters Asserted in Request for Admissions (Set One) filed by Defendant LAUSD TentativeThe motion is granted.BackgroundThis case arises out of an incident that occurred on August 16, 2021, in which Plaintiff Roy A. Hemsley (“Plaintiff”), at the time a 13-year-old autistic minor and middle school student, was allegedly left unattended and allowed to run or wander five miles from his school campus before being discovered later that day. (Complaint, ¶¶ 20-30.) On August 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed the Complaint in this action, asserting causes of action for negligent hiring, retention, and supervision; negligence; negligent infliction of emotional distress; and intentional infliction of emotional distress against Defendants Los Angeles Unified School District (“LAUSD”), County of Los Angeles (“County”), Inclusive Education and Community Partnership, Inc. (“IECP”), Lara Ruby, Wendy De La O, Alvin Walker, Daryl Davis, and Does 1 through 100. On October 21, 2022, the Court, at the request of Plaintiff, dismissed all claims against County without prejudice. On February 8, 2023, the Court sustained in part (with leave to amend in part) and overruled in part a demurrer and granted (with leave to amend in part) a motion to strike. On March 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint (the “FAC”), asserting causes of action for negligent hiring, retention, and supervision; negligence; and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the same defendants (except for County). On May 15, 2023, the Court sustained (with leave to amend) a demurrer to the negligent hiring, retention, and supervision and the intentional infliction of emotional distress causes of action and granted (with leave to amend in part) a motion to strike. Plaintiff did not amend further. On July 24, 2023, Defendants LAUSD, Walker, and Davis filed their Answer to the FAC. Onthe same day, LAUSD filed a Cross-Complaint against IECP and Roes 1 through 50. On July 26, 2023, Defendants IECP and De La O filed their Answer to the FAC. On the sameday, IECP also filed a Cross-Complaint against LAUSD and Moes 1 through 50, and an Answer to LAUSD’s Cross-Complaint. On August 4, 2023, LAUSD filed an answer to IECP’s Cross-Complaint. On February 20, 2024, LAUSD served Plaintiff with Requests for Admission (Set One). (Mullane Decl., ¶ 3; Exh. A.) On April 2, 2024, LAUSD filed this motion to deem the truth of the matters asserted in Requests for Admission (Set One). LAUSD also seeks sanctions.  No opposition has been filed. Legal Standard A party must respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)The court “shall” make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)Discussion On February 20, 2024, LAUSD served Plaintiff with Requests for Admission (Set One). (Mullane Decl., ¶ 3; Exh. A.) Plaintiff has not responded. (Id., ¶ 4.) No opposition has been filed. LAUSD need show nothing more. The Court GRANTS LAUSD’s Motion to Deem the Truth of the Matters Asserted in Requests for Admission (Set One). Sanctions are mandatory.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Given the relatively straightforward nature of the motion, the Court sets sanctions in the amount of $540, calculated based on 3 hours of attorney work, multiplied by reasonable billing rate of $180.00 per hour.  (Mullane Decl., ¶ 6.)Conclusion The Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion. The Court ORDERS that Plaintiff is deemed to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in LAUSD’s Requests for Admissions (Set One). The Court GRANTS Defendant’s request for sanctions. The Court ORDERS Plaintiff and DRE Law, APC, jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions to LAUSD under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of $540 within 30 days of notice. Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
