Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Attend Deposition and Produce DocumentsTENTATIVE 
 
Defendant’s motion to compel the deposition of

Legal
Standard 
 
Any party may obtain discovery …
by taking the oral deposition of any person, including any party to the action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.)
 
CCP section¿2025.450(a)
provides:¿“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . .
. , without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any
document . . . described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document . . . described in the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.450(a).) 
Where a party objects to the deposition, the
proper remedy is an objection under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410.
If such an objection is made within three calendar days before the deposition
date, the objecting party must make personal service of that objection. (Code
Civ. Proc. 2025.410, subd. (b).) 
CCP section¿2025.450(b) provides:¿“A
motion under subdivision (a)… shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the
deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or
things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”¿ (Id.,
§ 2025.450(b).) 
Discussion 
On August 15, 2023, Defendant
noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for September 7, 2023. (Shirinian Decl., ¶ 6.)
On September 6, 2023, the day before the deposition, Plaintiff’s counsel
advised that the deposition would need to be rescheduled. (Id., ¶ 7.) 
On February 12, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel was served with Defendants’ Amended Notice of Taking Plaintiff’s
Deposition and for Production of Documents, set for March 8, 2024. (Shirinian
Decl., ¶ 8.)  On February 23, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel served an
Objection on the grounds that the date was unilaterally set. (Id., ¶ 9.) 
On February 29, 2024, defense
counsel sent an email to Plaintiff’s counsel seeking Plaintiff’s available
dates. Defense counsel did not receive a response. (Shirinian Decl., ¶ 10.) On
March 25, 2024, Defense counsel spoke with Plaintiff’s counsel, where
Plaintiff’s counsel indicated that he was not in contact with his client.
(Id., ¶ 11.)
On April 1, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel was served with Defendant’s Third Amended Notice of Taking Deposition
of Plaintiff and for Production of Documents, set for April 17, 2024.
(Shirinian Decl., ¶ 12; Exh. A.) On April 17, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel appeared
and confirmed his client would not be appearing, stating that his still
does not have contact with her. Defense counsel met and conferred with
Plaintiff’s counsel. (Id., ¶ 16.)
As Plaintiff was properly served with the third notice of
deposition, did not object under CCP section 2025.410,
failed to appear, and failed to produce the requested documents, the motion to
compel Plaintiff to appear for deposition and produce documents is
GRANTED.  
In light of the June 4 trial date, the
Court orders Plaintiff to appear for deposition and produce documents on May
29, 2024.
            Sanctions
 
If a motion under CCP section¿2025.450(a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction in favor of the
party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with
whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (CCP section¿2025.450(g)(1).)
 
Defendant seek sanctions against
Plaintiff. However, the request for
sanctions cannot be granted. Code of Civil Procedure 2023.040 states: “A request for a sanction shall, in the
notice of motion, identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the
sanction is sought.” Defendant fails to identify who it seeks sanctions against
in the notice of motion. Thus, the request for sanctions is denied for
inadequate notice.
 
Conclusion 
 
The Court GRANTS the motion to
compel.
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to
appear for deposition, give testimony under oath, and produce the documents
requested in the deposition notice on May 29, 2024, at 10:00 am, by remote audio-video
conference, through a link to be provided by Defendant’s counsel by no later
than 4:30 pm on May 24, 2024. 
 
The Court
DENIES the request for sanctions.
 
Moving party is
ordered to give notice.
