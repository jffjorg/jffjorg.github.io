And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Sylvia Kizer, moves to compel the deposition of Christina Neria, a non-party witness. The plaintiff served Christina Neria with a deposition subpoena and personally served her with the subpoena. However, Christina Neria failed to appear for the deposition. The plaintiff then filed a motion to compel the deposition, which was initially set to be heard on June 28, 2024. However, the court advanced the hearing to May 15, 2024. Although Christina Neria was personally served with the deposition subpoena, there is no proof of service showing that she was given notice of the new hearing date. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Christina Neria without prejudice.
