And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the motion filed by John Harris, the spouse of Deborah Harris, to substitute as the successor in interest to his wife's causes of action. Deborah Harris had filed a complaint against the City of Los Angeles, Regency Plastering, Inc., and Oklahoma Court, LLC, alleging negligence and premise liability. After her death on February 15, 2024, John Harris filed a motion to substitute as the successor in interest, including an affidavit and declaration that meets the requirements under Code of Civil Procedure section 377.32. The defendants objected only to the possible reopening of discovery, but since no one has asked to reopen discovery, the court makes no ruling on this issue. The court finds that John Harris has met the requirements under the code and grants his motion to substitute as the successor in interest.
