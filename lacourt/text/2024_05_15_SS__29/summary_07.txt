Here is the English text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call. The Court reviewed the petitions for approval of minor's compromise filed on April 29, 2024, and identified issues that needed to be addressed. After reviewing new petitions submitted on May 7, 2024, the Court found that while some issues were resolved, there remain outstanding issues that must be addressed before the Court can approve the petitions. The Court ordered the petitioner to revise the petitions to address these issues and to submit Proposed Orders (Form MC-351) and Proposed Orders (Form MC-355). The petitions for approval of minor's compromise are continued to a future date to allow the petitioner to address these remaining issues.
