```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further discovery responses from the defendants. The plaintiff served requests for production of documents, requests for admissions, form interrogatories, and special interrogatories on the defendants, who served their responses on January 19, 2024. The plaintiff argues that the defendants' responses were incomplete and improper, and seeks sanctions in the amount of $3,310.00. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's motion is untimely and improper because it was filed more than 45 days after responses were served. The court finds that the plaintiff did not file a separate statement as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, and therefore denies the motion. The court also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions.
