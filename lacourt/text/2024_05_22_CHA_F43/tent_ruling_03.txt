SUMMARY OF
ACTION
Plaintiff
Wvistano Daniel Perez (Plaintiff) served requests for production of documents,
requests for admissions, form interrogatories, and special interrogatories on
Defendants FCI Lender Services, Inc., Puerto Loreto, LLC, and California TD
Specialists. Defendants served their responses on January 19, 2024. Plaintiff
argues that Defendants responses were incomplete and improper. Plaintiff’s
counsel met and conferred with Defendants’ counsel on February 22, 2024. Plaintiff’s
counsel was told that supplemental discovery would be provided by Loreto on
February 29, 2024, by FCI on March 7, 2024, and California TD on March 14,
2024. Plaintiff did not receive the supplemental discovery.
 
Plaintiff filed
his motion to compel discovery responses on March 26, 2024. Rather than filing
separate motions for each discovery set for each Defendant, Plaintiff filed
them all in one motion. Plaintiff did not include a separate statement with the
motion to compel further responses. Plaintiff also seeks sanctions in the
amount of $3,310.00 for the motion.
 
Defendants
argue in their opposition that Plaintiff’s motion, if it is a motion to compel
further responses, was untimely because it was filed more than 45 days after
responses were served. Next, Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s motion is
improper because Plaintiff failed to file a separate statement. Finally,
Defendants argue that monetary sanctions should be awarded against Plaintiff
for bringing this motion.
 
Plaintiff
argues in her reply that Defendants’ responses were unverified so the 45-day
limit does not apply. Plaintiff also argues that monetary sanctions would be
unwarranted.
 
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff has
labeled this as a motion to compel further responses. Plaintiff did not file a
separate statement pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345, which is
required for motions to compel further responses. “Any motion involving the
content of a discovery request or the responses to such a request must be
accompanied by a separate statement.” (CRC Rule 3.1345(a); see Miller v.
U.S. Bank (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 871, 892-893.) Individual separate
statements are especially needed where the moving party combines multiple
discovery motions into one motion, as Plaintiff did here. (See Miller,
166 Cal.App.4th at 893.)
 
Because
Plaintiff did not filed a separate statement, Plaintiff’s motion to compel
further discovery responses is denied.
 
Sanctions
No sanctions
will be awarded at this time.
 
ORDER
1.      Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further discovery responses is denied.
