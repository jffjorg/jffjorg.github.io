And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion by Canary Avenue, LLC to advance the hearing on their motion for leave to amend their complaint. The motion was originally scheduled for October 23, 2024, but the judge agrees that this date does not give the plaintiff enough time to serve discovery and move for summary judgment before trial. As a result, the hearing is advanced to June 26, 2024, and continued to July 24, 2024, at 10:30 A.M. in Department SE-C. The judge's decision is based on California Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c), which allows for ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or other statutory basis.
