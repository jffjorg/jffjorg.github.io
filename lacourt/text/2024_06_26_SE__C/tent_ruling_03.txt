TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff Peter Oun’s motion for final approval of class and
representative action settlement is GRANTED. 
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
The motion is unopposed as of June 21, 2024. 
 

Background
 
Plaintiff Peter Oun (“Plaintiff” or
“Named Plaintiff”) moves for an order granting final approval of the proposed
settlement with Defendants Duncan Industries, Inc. (“Defendant”) on the terms
and conditions set forth in the Parties’ Settlement Agreement and Release of
Claims (“Settlement Agreement” or “Settlement”) between Plaintiff and
Defendant. (Decl. Gaines, ¶ 17, Ex. B.) 
 
On March 13, 2024, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement.
The
parties had agreed to a proposed distribution of the $300,000.00 settlement as
follows: (1) attorney’s fees up to $105,000.00; (2) litigation costs up to
$15,000.00; (3) class representative incentive award up to $10,000.00; (4)
settlement administration costs up to $9,000.00; (5) PAGA penalties in the
amount of $20,000.00 (75% to be paid to the Labor and Workforce Development
Agency and 25% to be paid to aggrieved employees/class members); and (6) the
net settlement—i.e., the amount remaining from the gross settlement after
deducting attorney’s fees, litigation costs, settlement administration costs,
the class representative incentive award, and PAGA penalties—to be distributed
to class members. (Min. Order, 3/13/24.) The Court also found a presumption of
fairness. (Min. Order, 3/13/24.) In addition, the Court approved the proposed
notice to class members. (Min. Order, 3/13/24.)
 
Now, the parties propose to distribute the
$300,000.00 as follows: (1) attorney’s fees of $105,000.00; (2) litigation
costs of $12,835.55; (3) class representative incentive of $10,000.00; (4)
settlement administration costs of $5,950.00; (5) PAGA penalties in the amount
of $20,000.00 (75% to be paid to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and
25% to be paid to aggrieved employees/class members); and (6) the net
settlement of $146,214.45 to be distributed to class members.
 
Discussion
 
          As a “fiduciary” of the absent class
members, the trial court’s duty is to have sufficient information to determine
if the settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable.  (7-Eleven
Owners for Fair Franchising v. The Southland Corp. (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 1135,
1151.)
 
          In determining whether to approve a
class settlement, the court’s responsibility is to “prevent fraud, collusion or
unfairness to the class” through settlement and dismissal of the class action
because the rights of the class members, and even named plaintiffs, “may not
have been given due regard by the negotiating parties.”  (Consumer
Advocacy Group, Inc. v. Kintetsu Enterprises of America (2006) 141
Cal.App.4th 46, 60.)
 
          To aid the Court in the determination
of the fairness of the settlement, Wershba
v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224, 244-45
discusses factors that the Court should consider when testing the
reasonableness of the settlement.
 
          A presumption of fairness exists
where: (1) the settlement is reached through arm’s length bargaining; (2)
investigation and discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and the Court to
act intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced in similar litigation; and (4)
the percentage of objectors is small.  (Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc., supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at p. 245.)  The test is not the maximum amount plaintiff
might have obtained at trial on the complaint but, rather, whether the
settlement is reasonable under all the circumstances. (Id. at 250.)
 
          In making this determination, the
Court considers all relevant factors including “the strength of [the]
plaintiffs’ case, the risk, expense, complexity and likely duration of further
litigation, the risk of maintaining class action status through trial, the
amount offered in settlement, the extent of discovery completed and the stage
of the proceedings, the experience and views of counsel, the presence of a
governmental participant, and the reaction of the class members to the proposed
settlement.’”  (Kullar v. Foot Locker Retail, Inc. (2008)
168 Cal.App.4th 116, 128.)
 
A.  
Analysis of Settlement Agreement
 
     1.       Presumption
of Fairness
 
          The Court incorporates by reference its discussion of the
factors and evidence it considered in determining the settlement is entitled to
a presumption of fairness. (3/13/24 Ruling, pgs. 5-6.)  
 
          The only factor the Court did not reach in its ruling on
the motion for preliminary approval was the percentage of the class that has
objected, which could not be determined until the instant hearing.  (See Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice
Guide:  Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2011) ¶14:139.18.) Plaintiff submitted evidence the Administrator
has not received any Requests for Exclusion from Class Members and has received
no objections to the Settlement.  (Decl. Salinas,
¶¶9, 13.)  
 
          Based on the foregoing, the Settlement is entitled to a
presumption of fairness. 
 

          2.       Is the settlement fair, adequate, and
reasonable?
 
The proposed
settlement does not change the total amount offered in the settlement and
nearly all factors contributing to the Court’s determination of whether the settlement
is fair, adequate, and reasonable remain unchanged.  Thus, the Court incorporates by reference its
discussion of the factors contributing to whether the settlement is fair,
adequate, and reasonable. (3/13/24 Ruling, pgs. 5-6.) The Court can now
consider the factor of reaction of class members to the settlement, given that
the notice requirements have been fulfilled. 
 
Reaction of the class members to the proposed
settlement.  
 
As of May 29, 2024, there are no outstanding
disputes, given that Phoenix Settlement Administrators has received no requests
for exclusion, no objections, and no disputes of work weeks from the class members.
(Decl. Salinas, ¶¶ 9-11, 13.)  Given the
non-opposition from the class members, the proposed settlement appears to be
well-received.  
 
B.  
Attorney Fees and Costs
 
Class Counsel requests an award of $105,000 (35%
of the gross Maximum Settlement Amount) in fees and $12,835.55 in costs. (Decl.
Gaines, ¶¶ 76, 77.) 
 
“Courts recognize two methods for calculating
attorney fees in civil class actions: the lodestar/multiplier method and the
percentage of recovery method.”  (Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc., supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at p. 254.) 
Here, class counsel requests attorney fees using the percentage method
but also provides sufficient information for the Court to assess whether the
requested fees are reasonable pursuant to the lodestar method. (Decl. Gaines,
¶¶ 62-72.)  
 
In common fund cases, the Court may employ a
percentage of the benefit method, as cross-checked against the lodestar. (Laffitte v. Robert Half Int’l, Inc.
(2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 503.) The fee
request represents 35 percent of the gross settlement amount, which is
the average generally awarded in class actions. 
(See In re Consumer Privacy Cases
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 545, 558, fn. 13 [“Empirical studies show that, regardless
of whether the percentage method or the lodestar method is used, fee awards in
class actions average around one-third of the recovery.”].) 
 
The lodestar amount for Class Counsel is $53,120.00,
based on 37 hours of work at a rate of $750.00 per hour for Alex Katofsky; 24.7
hours of work at a rate of $700.00 per hour for Daniel Gaines; 9.6 hours of
work at a rate of $625.00 per hour for Evan Gaines; and 10.40 hours of work at $200.00
per hour for Amelia Booth. (Decl. Gaines, ¶
65, Ex. E.) Class Counsel requests a multiplier of 1.98 given the
contingent nature of the case; the experience, reputation, ability of counsel,
skill displayed in litigation; results achieved; and preclusion of other
employment. (Decl. Gaines, ¶¶ 62, 64,
66, 67, 68, 69, 71, 72.) The Court grants the multiplier figure.   
 
Class Counsel requests $12,835.55 in costs,
which is less than the $15,000 cap preliminarily
approved for which Class Members were given notice and deemed unobjectionable. (Decl.
Gaines, ¶ 77, Ex. F.) The costs include court fees, mediation fees, research
fees, postage, service of process, expenses associated with mediation, travel
expenses, and photocopy charges. (Decl. Gaines, ¶ 77, Ex. F.)  The costs appear to
be reasonable in amount and reasonably necessary to this litigation. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court awards $105,000
in attorneys’ fees and $12,835.55 in attorneys’ costs. 
 
C.  
Incentive Award to Class Representative
 
Plaintiff requests a class representative payment
of $10,000. (Motion, pg. 16; Decl. Gaines, ¶ 58.)   
 
When determining whether incentive awards are appropriate, courts
consider a variety of factors, which
include the actions the plaintiff has taken to protect the interests of the
class, the degree to which the class has benefitted from those actions, and the
amount of time and effort the plaintiff expended in pursuing the litigation. (Clark v. Am. Residential Servs. LLC (2009) 175 Cal. App. 4th 785, 804.)
 
Plaintiff’s contributions to this litigation
included the following: (1) assisted Counsel in investigating and
substantiating the claims alleged in this action, including multiple interviews
with counsel to review facts, documents, and Defendant’s policies; (2) assisted
in the preparation of the complaint; (3) produced evidentiary documents to
Counsel; and (4) assisted in the settlement of this litigation. (Decl. Gaines,
¶¶ 58-61.) 
 
Based on
the above, as well as the benefits obtained on behalf of the class, the Court
grants the Class Representative Payment in the requested amounts of $10,000.   
 
D.  
Claims Administration Costs
 
The claims
administrator, Phoenix Claims Administrator, requests $5,950 for the costs of
settlement administration. (Decl. Salinas, ¶18.) This is less than the $9,000 requested in
the preliminary approval. 
 
Based on the above, the Court awards settlement
administration costs in the requested amount of $5,950. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court grants final approval of
the class action settlement as follows: 
 
(1)  The Court grants final approval of the
Settlement;
 
(2)  The Court certifies the class for purposes of
settlement;
 
(3)  The Court appoints Plaintiff as Class
representative for settlement purposes;
 
(4)  The Court appoints Class Counsel as class
counsel for settlement purposes;
 
(5)  The Court finds that the settlement is fair,
adequate, and reasonable;
 
(6)  Class Counsel is awarded $105,000 in
attorneys’ fees and $12,835.55 in attorneys’ costs; 
 
(7)  Class Representative Plaintiff is awarded an
enhancement payment of $10,000; 
 
(8)  The claims administrator, Simpluris, is
awarded $5,950 in costs.
