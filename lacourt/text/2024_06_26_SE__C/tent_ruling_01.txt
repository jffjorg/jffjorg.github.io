TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant Cerritos Ford, Inc. and Ford Motor
Company’s demurrer to plaintiff’s complaint is OVERRULED in part and SUSTAINED
in part with no leave to amend. 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
The motion is unopposed as of June 24, 2024. 
 
 
This is a Song-Beverly
action. On November 7, 2022, Plaintiff Maria Ramirez filed a complaint against Defendants
Cerritos Ford Inc. and Ford Motor Company for the following causes of action:
(1) violation of Song-Beverly Act; and (2) negligent repair. 
 
On April 4, 2023, Defendants
filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings for both causes of action. On May
18, 2023, the Court granted it with leave to amend.  
 
On June 16, 2023, Plaintiff
filed her first amended complaint. 
 
On July 25, 2023, Defendants
demurred to the first amended complaint. On November 9, 2023, the Court
sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. 
 
On January 23, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint. 
 
Defendants
Ford Motor Company and Norm Reeves Ford Superstore demur to the second amended
complaint on the grounds that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute
a cause of action. 
Legal
Standard
The party against whom
a complaint has been filed may object to the pleading, by demurrer, on several
grounds, including that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A party
may demur to an entire complaint, or to any causes of action stated therein. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.50, subd. (a).)
Meet-and-Confer
The
parties have sufficiently met and conferred. (Decl. Lally, ¶ 3, Ex C.) (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)   
Breach of Express
Warranty

 
Defendants object
to the breach of express warranty cause of action because the Song-Beverly Act
does not extend the manufacturer’s warranty to used vehicles. 
          
According
to Stiles v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2024) 101 Cal.App.5th 913, a
previously owned motor vehicle bought with the manufacturer’s new car warranty
still in effect is a “new motor vehicle” as defined by Civil Code section
1793.22, subdivision (e)(2). Thus, the replace or refund remedy of Civil Code
section 1793.2, subdivision (d)(2) applies. (Id.) Because the second
district of the appeals court issued the decision, the Court applies it even
though it appears to conflict with Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC (2022) 77
Cal.App.5th 209, which the fourth district of the appeals court issued. 
 
Plaintiff
alleges that on August 11, 2022, she entered into a warranty contract with
Defendant Ford Motor Company and the vehicle included a new vehicle limited
warranty. (SAC, ¶ 15.) 
 
Thus,
the complaint contains adequate allegations on this ground. The demurrer is
OVERRULED as to the breach of express warranty cause of action.
 
Negligent
Repair
 
Defendants
object to the negligent repair cause of action because the economic loss rule
bars it. 
The Court
notes that Plaintiff made the same allegations as in the first amended
complaint. 
Thus, the
Court sustains the negligent repair cause of action with no leave to amend. (Lawrence
v. Bank of America (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 431, 436.)
