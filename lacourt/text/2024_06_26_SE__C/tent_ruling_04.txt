TENTATIVE RULING
 
I.            
Plaintiff Laura Karina Lopez’s motion to compel further responses from
Defendant Kulpati Chodha’s Form Interrogatories, Set One is CONTINUED.  
 
II.           
Plaintiff Laura Karina Lopez’s motion to compel further responses from
Defendant Kulpati Chodha’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One is
CONTINUED.  
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE. 
 
 
This is about a car accident that occurred on
December 11, 2021. Defendant Jacqueline Rivera was driving an ice cream truck
that belonged to defendant Kulpati Chodha, who had entered into a business
asset sales agreement with defendant Eduardo Rivera, for the purchase and sale
of the truck. Defendant Jacqueline Rivera and plaintiff Laura Karina Lopez
collided. 
 
Form Interrogatories, Set One
 
Plaintiff Laura Karina Lopez moves to compel
further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.300.    
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 allows a party to file a motion
compelling further responses to form interrogatories if it finds that the
response is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or an objection in the response
is without merit or too general.  
 
Timeliness

 
Notice of the motion to compel further must be
provided within 45 days of service of the response or on or before any specific
later date to which the parties have agreed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (c).) This 45-day deadline runs from the date the verified response is
served and is extended for service by mail in accordance with Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1010.6, subdivision (a)(4) and 1013, subdivision (a). Failure
to timely move to compel within the specified period constitutes a waiver of
any right to compel a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)

 
The 45-day rule to bring a motion to compel is
mandatory and jurisdictional “in the sense that it renders court without
authority to rule on motions to compel other than to deny them.” (Sexton v.
Super. Ct. (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) 
 
Counsel agreed to extend Plaintiff’s
time to move to compel further responses to all discovery to February 28, 2024.
(Decl. Malek, ¶ 25, Ex. HH.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on
February 28, 2024. Thus, the motion is timely. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)  A meet and
confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a
reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.) 
 
For purposes of
determining whether a motion to compel discovery was preceded by a reasonable
and good faith effort to meet and confer, such a reasonable and good faith
attempt at informal resolution entails something more than bickering with
opposing counsel; rather, the law requires that counsel attempt to talk the
matter over, compare their views, consult, and deliberate. (Clement v.
Alegre (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1294.) 
 
The
Court finds that the parties did not meet and confer in good faith. Plaintiff’s
counsel states that on January 26, 2024, she sent defense counsel a detailed
meet and confer letter. (Decl. Arya, ¶ 23, Ex. FF.) Defense counsel stated that
they would respond by February 16, 2024, but never responded. (Decl. Arya, ¶
25, Ex. HH.)  
 
Based
on the above, the Court continues the hearing to Wednesday, September 4, 2024
at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C. The parties must submit a joint statement within 30
days and if discovery issues have not been resolved, the Court will hear
arguments at the hearing. 
                                       
Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One
 
Plaintiff Laura Karina Lopez moves to compel
further responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.310.    
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 allows a party to file a motion
compelling further responses to document requests if it finds that the response
is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or an objection in the response is
without merit or too general.
