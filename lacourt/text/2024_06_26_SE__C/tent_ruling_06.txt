Property Casualty Company of America v. Joslevin Realty Corp. of L.A., et al.,
Case No. 23NWCV01813
 
This
is an interpleader action concerning money payable under an insurance policy
issued by Travelers Property Casualty Company of America to Defendant Joseph
Levin Realty Corp. of Los Angeles. The money is payable because of a fire loss
that occurred on or about November 22, 2022, at a commercial building insured
by the policy located at 5830 Soto Street, Huntington Park, California 90255,
and totals $1,772,547.92 for damage to the Property and loss of rent for twelve
(12) months following the fire loss. Plaintiff Travelers Property Casualty
Company of America moves ex parte to advance the hearing on the motion for
order discharging Plaintiff from liability for interpleaded funds, which is
currently set for March 19, 2025, the earliest date Plaintiff could reserve.
Trial is set for January 9, 2025.  
 
A
party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing
"irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)
 
Plaintiff
argues that it will lose its right to be discharged from liability for the
interpleaded funds upon deposit of the same with the court and dismissed as a
party to this suit prior to trial.
 
Based
on the above, the Court grants the motion. The Court ADVANCES the hearing to
today and CONTINUES it to Thursday, September 12, 2024, at 10:30 A.M. in Dept.
SE-C.
