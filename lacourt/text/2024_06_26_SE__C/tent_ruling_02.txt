TENTATIVE RULING
 
I.            
Plaintiff Mariano Cuellar and Martin Cuellar’s motion to compel Defendant
Ford Motor Company’s further responses to special interrogatories is GRANTED IN
PART. No sanctions. 
 
II.           
Plaintiff Mariano Cuellar and Martin Cuellar’s motion to compel Defendant
Ford Motor Company’s further responses to request for production of documents is
GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART, MOOT IN PART, and CONTINUED IN PART. No
sanctions. 
 
Opposing Party to give NOTICE. 
 
 
This is a Song-Beverly action. Plaintiffs
Mariano Cuellar and Martin Cuellar sue defendants York Enterprises South, Inc.,
and Ford Motor Company for breach of express warranty, violation of Civil Code
section 1793.2, and negligent repair. Plaintiffs seek further responses from
Defendant Ford Motor Company to special interrogatories, set one and request
for production of documents, set one. 
 
Special
Interrogatories, Set One
 
          Timeliness 
 
Notice of the motion to compel further must be
provided within 45 days of service of the verified response or on or before any
specific later date to which the parties have agreed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (c).) This 45-day deadline runs from the date the verified response is
served and is extended for service by mail in accordance with Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1010.6, subdivision (a)(4) and 1013, subdivision (a). Failure
to timely move to compel within the specified period constitutes a waiver of
any right to compel a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)

 
On June 2, 2023, the defendant
served unverified amended responses to Plaintiff’s first set of special
interrogatories. (Decl. Powell, ¶ 4, Ex. B.) On February 20, 2024, Defendant
served verifications by U.S. mail and electronic mail. (Decl. Powell, ¶ 6, Ex. C.)
Plaintiffs filed the instant motion on April 8, 2024. 
 
Considering February 20, 2024, as
the response date and adding two days for service by electronic mail, the
motion is timely. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion
shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal
resolution of each issue presented by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2016.040.) 
 
For purposes of
determining whether a motion to compel discovery was preceded by a reasonable
and good faith effort to meet and confer, such an attempt at informal
resolution requires something more than bickering with opposing counsel;
rather, the law requires that counsel attempt to talk the matter over, compare
their views, consult, and deliberate. (Clement v. Alegre (2009) 177
Cal.App.4th 1277, 1294.) 
 
Based on Plaintiffs’ counsel’s
declaration, the Court finds that the parties sufficiently met and conferred.
(Decl. Powell, ¶¶ 5, 7, Ex. C, E.) 
 
          Discussion
 
Plaintiff
seeks further responses to special interrogatories numbers 45, 46, 47, and 48. Request
number 45 asks about repair rates at the time of release of the 2016 Ford Focus;
request number 46 asks about repairs performed for the 2016 2016 Ford Focus;
request number 47 asks about the top five symptoms with the highest repairs for
the 2016 Ford Focus; and request number 48 asks about the five components with
the highest repairs for the 2016 Ford Focus. 
 
“‘An order compelling
discovery must rest on a showing that the discovery is reasonably calculated to
lead to admissible evidence….’"  (Cadiz
Land Co. v. Rail Cycle (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 74, 117.) The burden rests
upon the party seeking the discovery to provide evidence from which the court
may determine these conditions are met. (Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v.
Super. Ct. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223-224.) 
 
Plaintiff
argues that the interrogatories seek repair rates for 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee
vehicles and that this is relevant because Plaintiff must prove that his
vehicle contained a defect covered by Defendant’s warranty which substantially
impaired its use, value, or safety and which Defendant could not repair after a
reasonable number of repair attempts. Further, the information sought would
tend to show whether a widespread defect or nonconformity exists in these types
of vehicles. Also, the information could refute Defendant’s affirmative
defenses that Plaintiff or others misused or abused the vehicle or engaged in
unauthorized or unreasonable use. In addition, evidence regarding Defendant’s
practices in handling consumer complaints is relevant to showing whether
Defendant willfully violated the Song-Beverly Act, which awards civil penalties
if Defendant’s violation was willful. 
 
If a timely
motion to compel has been filed, the burden is on the responding party to
justify any objection or failure to fully answer the interrogatories. (Coy
v. Super. Ct. (Wolcher) (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.) 
 
Defendant
objected to special interrogatory numbers 45 to 48 as overly broad and seeking
irrelevant documents because they are not limited to a relevant timeframe, any
specific claim or repair, to Plaintiffs, to the allegations in Plaintiffs’
complaint, to any specific or alleged malfunction, problem, or concern, or to
the allegations in this case. 
 
The Court
agrees with Defendant’s reasoning. Further, Plaintiffs do not state why they to
know about other defects and why they have not set a time parameter. 
 
The Court
grants the motion in part and denies it in part. The Court denies the motion
with respect to interrogatory numbers 47 and 48 because they are too broad and
not relevant to the defects that Plaintiff’s vehicle experienced. The Court
grants the motion with respect to interrogatory numbers 45 and 46 on condition
that further responses will be limited to the same defect Plaintiff allegedly
experienced, in vehicles sold in California for the past five years. 
 
Sanctions
 
In a
motion to compel further discovery responses, the court shall impose a monetary sanction
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).) 
 
Because the motion was
granted in part and denied in part, the Court does not award sanctions to
either party.

for Production of Documents, Set One

provided within 45 days of service of the verified response or on or before any
specific later date to which the parties have agreed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,

(Decl. Powell, ¶¶ 5, 7, Ex. C, E.) 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiffs
seek further responses to requests for production of documents numbers 16, 19-31,
and 45-46. 
 
Request number
16 seeks Defendant’s warranty claims policy and procedure manuals from 2021 to
the present. 
 
Request numbers
19 to 21 seek Defendant’s policies and procedures for evaluating a consumer’s
complaint or request for a refund of money paid toward a vehicle or determining
whether a vehicle is eligible for repurchase. Request numbers 22 and 23 seek
training materials regarding the handling of consumer requests for a vehicle
repurchase or determining whether a vehicle is eligible for repurchase. Request
number 24 seeks all scripts and flow charts used by Defendant in handling
consumer requests for repurchase or replacement. Request numbers 45 and
46 seek documents evidencing complaints by owners of 2016 Ford Focus vehicles
for the same complaints made by Plaintiffs regarding their vehicle and warranty
repairs.
 
Request
numbers 25 to 29 seek Defendant’s policies, procedures, and parameters for
defining certain terms to determine a vehicle’s eligibility for repurchase. 
 
Request number
30 seeks documents used by Defendant to determine whether a vehicle is eligible
for a repurchase pursuant to the Song-Beverly Act since 2021. Request number 31
seeks documents regarding Ford’s policies and procedures that its authorized
repair facilities should follow regarding customer requests for a refund of the
purchase price paid for a vehicle. 
 
Moving
parties must file evidence showing good cause based on specific facts that the
requested matter is admissible evidence or appears reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of such evidence. (Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v.
Super. Ct. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223-24.) Good cause generally calls for a
factual exposition of a reasonable ground for the discovery order sought. (Waters v. Super. Ct. of L.A. County (1962) 58 Cal.2d 885, 893.) "[E]ven when no . .
. supporting affidavits are filed . . .good cause may be found in the pleadings
theretofore filed in the action." (Greyhound Corp. v. Super. Ct.  (1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 389.)
 
Plaintiffs
argue that the documents evidencing Defendant’s policies, procedures, and
instructions are relevant because they would show whether Defendant’s policies
are meant to hinder consumers from seeking their statutory remedies; whether
they comport with Defendant’s duties under the Song-Beverly Act, including
whether they seek to provide an inferior remedy than Defendant is required to
provide; what criteria Defendant uses for determining whether a vehicle
qualifies for repurchase or replacement; or whether Defendant has even enacted
any policies or procedures for dealing with its affirmative obligations under
the Act. This information would also tend to prove whether Defendant has
committed a willful violation.
 
Based
on the above, the Court finds good cause. 
 
If
“good cause” is shown by the moving party, the burden is then on the responding
party to justify any objections made to document disclosure. (Kirkland v.
Super. Ct. (Guess?, Inc.) (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.) 
 
                   Request number 16
 
As
to request number 16, Defendant objects on the grounds that the requests are
not relevant because they are not limited to a reasonable or relevant
timeframe, to any warranty claim at issue, to Plaintiffs, to the subject
vehicle, to any vehicle, and because there is no allegation regarding the
warranty policy and procedure manuals in this case. Nonetheless, Defendant
argues that it provided Ford’s Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual applicable
to 2023 subject to a protective order. 
 
In
reply, Plaintiffs argue that policies and procedures for previous years are
relevant to show changes in Defendant’s practices. But Plaintiffs do not know
why they need to know about changes in Defendant’s practices. 
 
The
request is moot in part and denied as to the years 2021 and 2022. 
 
When
asserting claims of privilege or attorney work product protection, the
objecting party must provide “sufficient factual information” to enable other
parties to evaluate the merits of the claim, “including, if necessary, a
privilege log.” (Code Civ. Proc, § 2031.240, subd. (c)(1); Lopez v.
Watchtower Bible & Tract. Soc. of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 596-597.) 
 
                   Request numbers 19 to 21, 22
to 23, 25 to 29, and 30 to 31
 
Defendant
refers Plaintiffs to the following documents: Owner’s Guide, Scheduled
Maintenance Guide, and Warranty Guide for the 2016 Ford Focus vehicle,
available at owner.ford.com/tools/account/how-tos/owner-manuals.html;
California law, available at www.bbb.org/autoline/bbb-auto-line-state-laws/california-lemon-law-information;
Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual applicable to 2023; RAV Policy &
Procedure Manual applicable to 2023; and policies and procedures for Ford’s
Customer Relationship Center. Defendant states it will produce the last three
subject to a protective order. 
 
It
appears that the parties did not sufficiently meet and confer regarding these
requests. Further, the last three will be produced subject to a protective
order. The Court orders the parties to meet and confer again, file a joint
statement within 20 days, and if there are still outstanding issues, the Court
will hear them. Thus, the Court continues the motion as to these requests to
Wednesday, September 4, 2024 at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C. 
 
Request number 24
 
Defendant
states that it could not locate the scripts requested. 
Thus,
the motion is denied as to this request. 
 
Request numbers 45 and
46
 
Defendant
stated that it agreed to produce the documents that Plaintiffs requested. 
 
Thus,
the motion is denied as to this request. 
 
Sanctions
 
In a
motion to compel further discovery responses, the court shall impose a monetary sanction
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).) 
 
Because the motions was
granted in part, denied in part, moot in part, and continued in part, the Court
does not award sanctions to either party.
