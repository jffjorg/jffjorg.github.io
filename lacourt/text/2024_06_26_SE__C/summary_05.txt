And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on the motions to compel responses to form interrogatories from defendants Gerardo Montalvo Flores and Jorge Alexander Morales. The plaintiff, Imelda Gutierrez, served the form interrogatories on January 17, 2024, but did not receive responses despite extensions granted to March 15, 2024. The judge grants the motions, ordering the defendants to serve responses without objections within 30 days. The judge also denies sanctions, as the motions are unopposed. The underlying dispute concerns a motor vehicle collision that occurred on May 20, 2021, in which the defendants allegedly operated their vehicles without caution and caused the collision.
