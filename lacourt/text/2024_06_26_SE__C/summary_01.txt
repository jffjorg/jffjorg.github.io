And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by defendants Cerritos Ford, Inc. and Ford Motor Company to the second amended complaint filed by plaintiff Maria Ramirez. The demurrer is OVERRULED in part and SUSTAINED in part with no leave to amend.

The plaintiff is seeking relief under the Song-Beverly Act for breaches of express warranty and negligent repair of a used vehicle purchased from the defendants. The defendants argued that the Song-Beverly Act does not extend the manufacturer's warranty to used vehicles, but the court has determined that this is not a valid argument.

The court also sustained the negligent repair cause of action with no leave to amend, as the plaintiff's allegations are similar to those in the first amended complaint, which were previously dismissed.

The court has overruled the demurrer to the breach of express warranty cause of action, finding that the complaint contains adequate allegations on this ground. The court has applied the decision in Stiles v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2024) 101 Cal.App.5th 913, which holds that a previously owned motor vehicle bought with the manufacturer's new car warranty still in effect is a "new motor vehicle" as defined by Civil Code section 1793.22, subdivision (e)(2).
