Melika, et al. v. Downey Unified School District, et al., Case No. 23NWCV02897
 
This
is a personal injury action arising from a motor vehicle accident which
occurred on November 1, 2021.
Defendants
Downey Unified School District and Ernest Vasquez move ex parte to advance and
consolidate their seven motions to compel, currently scheduled for April 1 and
2, 2025.  
 
A
party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing
"irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)
 
Defendants
argue that they are unable to obtain a hearing for over nine months, which
results in an undue delay and prejudice in their ability to defend themselves. 
 
Based
on the above, the motion is GRANTED. The motions are ADVANCED from Tuesday,
April 1, 2025 and Wednesday, April 2, 2025 to today and CONTINUED to Wednesday,
September 18, 2024 at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C.
