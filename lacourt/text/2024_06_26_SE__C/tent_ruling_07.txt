 Case Number:  23NWCV02234    Hearing Date:   June 26, 2024    Dept:  C Canary
Avenue, LLC v. Capital Logistics & Warehousing Group, Inc., Case No.
23NWCV02234
 
This
is about a breach of a commercial lease. Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Canary
Avenue, LLC moves ex parte to advance the hearing on the motion for leave to
amend the complaint.  
 
A
party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing
"irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)
 
Plaintiff
argues that it intends to serve discovery and file a motion for summary
judgment before trial. The motion for leave to amend the complaint is scheduled
to be heard on October 23, 2024, which does not leave Plaintiff enough time to
serve discovery and move for summary judgment. 
 
Based
on the above, the Court grants the motion. The motion is ADVANCED to today and
CONTINUED to Wednesday, July 24, 2024, at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C.
