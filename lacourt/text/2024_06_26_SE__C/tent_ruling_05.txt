Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
The
motions are unopposed as of June 24, 2024. 
 
 
This
is a motor vehicle collision. Plaintiff alleges that on or about May 20, 2021,
Plaintiff was lawfully operating her vehicle westbound on Lambert Road near
Cole Road. Defendant Jorge Alexander Morales was operating his vehicle directly
behind Plaintiff’s vehicle and Defendant Martin Quan Tran was operating his
vehicle in front of Plaintiff’s vehicle. Defendants operated their vehicles
without caution and caused Defendant Jorge Alexander Morales’s vehicle to
collide into Plaintiff’s vehicle.
 
Defendants move to compel the initial
discovery of Form Interrogatories, Set One from Defendant Gerardo Montalvo
Flores and Defendant Jorge Alexander Morales. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (b) allows the propounding
party to file a motion to compel responses to interrogatories if a response has
not been received.  If responses are
untimely, the responding party waives objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (a).)  
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff served each defendant with form
interrogatories, set one on January 17, 2024, by U.S. mail. (Decl. Landau, ¶ 2,
Ex. A.) Responses
were due on or before February 23, 2024. (Id., ¶ 3.) Defendant granted an extension to March 15,
2024. (Id., ¶ 4, Ex. B.) Despite these extensions, Defendant has not
received responses. (Id., ¶ 5.)   
 
Accordingly, the motions are GRANTED.  Plaintiffs are ordered to serve responses
without objections within 30 days.  
 
Sanctions  
 
Discovery
sanctions may not be imposed under Section 2023.030, even together with Section
2023.010, absent another provision of the Discovery Act that authorizes the
imposition of sanctions. (City of L. A. v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC
(2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 500.) Sanctions with respect to interrogatories
are only authorized against a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel responses. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c).) 
 
Here, sanctions
are denied because the motions are unopposed.
