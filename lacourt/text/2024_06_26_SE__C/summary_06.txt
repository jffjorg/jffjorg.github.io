And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's ex parte motion to advance the hearing on the motion for order discharging the plaintiff from liability for interpleaded funds. The plaintiff, Travelers Property Casualty Company of America, seeks to accelerate the hearing on this motion, which is currently set for March 19, 2025, to today. The hearing is continued to Thursday, September 12, 2024, at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C. The plaintiff argues that it will lose its right to be discharged from liability for the interpleaded funds if it is not discharged before trial, which is set for January 9, 2025. The judge agrees that this is a valid reason for granting ex parte relief, as the plaintiff may suffer irreparable harm if the hearing is not advanced.
