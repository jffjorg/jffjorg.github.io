I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
On November 28, 2022, Plaintiff,
Cypress Airiel Jones (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant, Food
For Less of Southern California, Inc., Manager Anthony, and DOES 1 through 50.
The Complaint alleges causes of action for: (1) General Negligence; and (2)
Premises Liability. 
 
On May 17, 2023, Ralphs notes
that it initiated discovery by serving Plaintiff with Form Interrogatories,
Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. The
moving papers assert that Plaintiff failed to serve any responses by the
deadline of June 23, 2023.Ralphs notes that its counsel attempted to contact
Plaintiff’s counsel, and forwarded meet and confer correspondence in an effort
to obtain responses, indicating it would permit last service of verified
responses on or before July 21, 2023. That same day, Ralphs indicates that
Plaintiff served verified responses, but that the responses contained general
objections and objections to specific requests despite the waiver by Plaintiff
and the explicit instructions of counsel. 
 
On August 21, 2023, Ralphs notes
that its counsel wrote to Plaintiff’s counsel, advising many of the answers
contained objections and were nonresponsive and addressing the issues with
Plaintiff’s inadequate answers. Ralphs’ meet and confer letter requested full
and complete further responses on or before September 1, 2023. Counsel
contended that if verified objection-less responses were not received within
the extended period, Ralphs would file a Motion to Compel. On August 21, 2023,
Ralphs notes that Plaintiff’s counsel responded to the meet and confer letter
and was granted an extension to provide verified responses without objections
on or before October 1, 2023. However, Ralphs notes that Plaintiff failed to
serve any supplemental responses. As such, Ralphs has brought these motions. 
 
B. Procedural¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
On October 12, 2023, Ralphs filed three motions to compel
further responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Requests
for Production of Documents. To date, no opposition briefs have been filed. On
November 30, 2023, Ralphs filed a statement of non-opposition.
 
¿II. ANALYSIS¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A.   
Motions to
Compel Responses 
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting
party may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The party also waives the right to make any
objections, including one based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for a motion to
compel responses to interrogatories other than the cut-off on hearing discovery
motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a); Code
Civ. Proc., 2030.290.) No meet and confer efforts are required before filing a
motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411
            Further, where there has
been no timely response to a Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.010 demand, the
demanding party must seek an order compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300.)
Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work
product. Thus, unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from
waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There is
no deadline for a motion to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to respond,
the moving party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before
filing the motion. Where the motion seeks only a response to the inspection
demand, no showing of "good cause" is required. 
 
Additionally, Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.290, subdivision (a), provides that “[o]n receipt of a particular response
to requests for admissions, the party requesting admissions may move for an
order compelling a further response if that party deems that either or both of
the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular request is evasive or
incomplete[;] (2) An objection to a particular request is without merit or too
general.”  Notice of the motion must be
given within 45 days of service of the verified response, otherwise the
propounding party waives the right to compel a further response. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (c).) The motions must also be accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (b).)    
 
Here, this Court understands that the July
17, 2023, meet and confer letter notes that although an extension was given to
provide the responses, the responses were to be provided without objection as
Plaintiff was late and did not request an extension of time. (Declaration of
William E. Johnson (“Johnson Decl.”), Exhibit B.) However, Plaintiff still
subsequently provided responses with objections. As such, pursuant to the
granted extension of Ralphs, Plaintiff is ordered to provide further responses,
without objection to each of Ralphs’ requests. Plaintiff is ordered to provide
these responses by January 12, 2024.
 
B.    
Sanctions
Sanctions are mandatory in
connection with motions to compel responses to interrogatories and requests for
production of documents against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel.¿¿(CCP. §§ 2030.290(c),¿2030.300(d),¿2031.300(c),¿and
2031.310(h).) However, sanctions are not mandatory if the court “finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿¿(Id.) 
Ralphs has also requested sanctions in the
amount of $1,310 per motion ($3,930 total) against Plaintiff Jones and/or her
attorney of record, Law Offices of Jacob Emrani. This request is based on the
Declaration of William E. Johnson who notes that he has spent 2.4 hours in
preparation of each motion, anticipates an additional 2.5 hours preparing the
reply motions and attending the heating, and that his rate is $250 an hour.
Further, Johnson nots that he has spent $60 on the filing fee. Here, the Court
notes that Plaintiff did not file an opposition brief, making the time claimed
for the reply papers excessive.  As such,
this Court GRANTS Ralphs’ Request for discovery sanctions in the lowered amount
of $2,500 against Plaintiff and her attorney of record, Law Offices of Jacob
Emrani, jointly and severally, to be paid to counsel for Ralphs. Sanctions are
ordered to be paid by January 12, 2024. 
 
Ralphs is ordered to give notice.
