And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is seeking clarification on several issues related to a motion for a protective order filed by the defendant, Mason Swan Lewis. The defendant was granted mental health diversion on October 12, 2023, and is now seeking to seal all records related to the diversion, including police reports, medical records, and other documents.

The judge is inclined to grant a protective order as to the defendant's statements in the diversion hearing, but is not willing to retroactively bar the plaintiff's use of the already-produced police report in this civil case. The judge is seeking guidance on how an already stipulated police report, where the defendant previously stated that there was no objection to its production, applies to Penal Code § 1001.36 when consent was already given and the document had already been produced.

The judge has questions about the content of the defendant's moving papers, including whether the police report was included among the exhibits filed under seal, and whether the defendant's mental health diversion order retroactively seals previously produced records. The judge is also seeking guidance on how to apply the laws and regulations related to the mental health diversion program and the sealing of records.
