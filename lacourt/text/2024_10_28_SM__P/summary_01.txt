Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the case and is issuing a tentative ruling. The case involves a dispute between Galleon Technology, Inc. (dba Shippabo) and Electronics Design, LLC (E-Design) and Arash Shamoeil over a breach of contract. Galleon seeks terminating, issue, evidentiary, and monetary sanctions against the defendants, while the defendants argue that the sanctions are not warranted.

The judge finds that the defendants have willfully failed to comply with discovery requests and orders, and have engaged in repeated misconduct. However, the judge also notes that terminating sanctions are only appropriate in the most extreme cases of misconduct, and that other sanctions may be sufficient to protect Galleon's rights.

The judge grants Galleon's alternative motion for evidentiary sanctions, which prevents the defendants from opposing Galleon's asserted facts and precluding any additional evidence from the defendants. The judge also grants Galleon's motion for monetary sanctions, awarding 15 hours of counsel fees at a rate of $450 per hour, plus costs and previously deferred sanctions of $5,516.75.

The judge denies Galleon's motion for terminating sanctions, finding that terminating sanctions are not warranted in this case. The judge's tentative ruling is subject to revision based on any comments or objections received.
