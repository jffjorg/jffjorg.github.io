Galleon Technology, Inc. v. Electronics
Design, LLC, Case no. 22SMCV00164
Hearing date October 28, 2024
Plaintiff’s
Motion for Terminating or Issues, Evidentiary and Monetary Sanctions 
Plaintiff
Galleon Technology, Inc. dba Shippabo (“Galleon”) sues defendants Electronics
Design, LLC (“E-Design”) and Arash Shamoeil for breach of quasi- and
implied-in-fact contract. Defendant E-Design cross-complained for conversion
and interference with economic advantage against Galleon. Galleon moves for
terminating sanctions, striking defendants’ answer to the SAC, entering default
against defendants as to the SAC, and dismissing E-Design’s cross-complaint. In
the alternative, Galleon moves for issue, evidentiary and monetary sanctions. The
court held IDCs and has discussed discovery issues with the parties on multiple
occasions. see, e.g., Min. Order 9/4/2024. 
Where
a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts have discretion to impose
terminating, issue, evidence or monetary sanctions. E.g., Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subd. (g), 2030.290,
subd. (c); R.S. Creative, Inc. v.
Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495. Terminating sanctions
are authorized where the evidence shows less severe sanctions will not be
successful in compelling responses. Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280. Courts may
require financial reimbursement for expenses incurred as to misuse of the
discovery process. Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030; Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 789, superseded by statute on another ground as
stated in Guzman v. General Motors Corp. (1984) 154
Cal.App.3d 438, 444; In re Marriage of
Niklas (1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 28, 37. 
Terminating Sanctions
Plaintiff
seeks terminating sanctions, which are only appropriate in the most extreme
cases of misconduct. The declaration of counsel Suh and moving papers argues
defendants willfully failed to comply with discovery requests and orders over
the last 2 years. Decl. Suh paras. 2-6. Plaintiff notes defendant Shamoeil
failed to provide a meaningful deposition, despite intervention from the court,
including having discussions with Shamoeil present in open court, and warnings
that sanctions would be considered, most recently on 9/4/2024.
Plaintiff
asserts defendants failed to provide meaningful response to written discovery. Id.
at paras. 2-5. Plaintiff notes defendant Shamoeil appeared at deposition on 6/20/2023
but was rude and evasive before unilaterally ending the deposition. Id.
at paras. 7-10; Id. at ex. C. Defendant Shamoeil appeared 7/12/2023
under the influence of prescription medication that impacted his memory and
ability to testify. Id. at para. 11; Id. at ex. D. Defendant
Shamoeil appeared 7/17/2023 but failed to answer questions and behaved
inappropriately. Id. at paras. 12-15; Id. at ex. E. Plaintiff
filed for appointment of a discovery referee. Id. at paras. 16-18; Id.
at ex. B. The court denied the appointment but required future depositions to
occur at the courthouse and awarded sanctions of $5,516.75. Id. at para.
17; Min. Order 9/27/2023. 
Defendants
canceled depositions scheduled 11/7/2023, 11/20/2023 and 12/12/2023. Decl. Suh
paras. 18-23. Defendant Shamoeil appeared 5/13/2024, again under the influence
of prescription medication. Id. at paras. 25, 28; Id. at ex. G.
Defendant Shamoeil appeared 7/30/2024 but refused to cooperate and engaged in
rude behavior and evasive answers. Id. at paras. 32-33; Id. at
ex. H. Defendant Shamoeil repeated this behavior on 8/6/2024. Id. at
paras. 34-35; Id. at ex. I.
After
repeated requests, the court appointed a discovery referee, the Hon. Wendell
Mortimer (ret.) and ordered defendants to bear costs up to $5,000. Id.
at para. 37; Id. at ex. K. Defendants refused to agree to a deposition
before 10/15/2024. Id. at paras. 40-44; Id. at ex. L. Plaintiff
requested an IDC, scheduled 9/4/2024. Id. 
The
court ordered Shamoeil to appear at deposition within 14 days, by 9/18/2024. Id.
at para. 45; Min. Order 9/4/2024. Defendants requested to appear at deposition
9/27/2024 and subsequently informed plaintiff that Shamoeil would not appear that
date, nor would defendants pay their court-ordered share of the discovery
referee’s fees. Id. at paras. 55-56; Id. at ex. P.
Plaintiff
argues it has been prejudiced by ongoing willful discovery abuses, and defendants
consistently and willfully disregarded the discovery process and the court’s orders
and warnings, preventing plaintiff from preparing for trial.
Defendants
argue terminating sanctions are only warranted in the most severe cases, they
have complied with discovery, and plaintiff is discontent with what it
discovered. 
Defendants
offered little more than boilerplate responses to written discovery and
document requests, and Shamoeil failed to substantively provide deposition testimony.
Nevertheless, the court is bound to balance the rights of all parties.
Defendants are correct that where other sanctions will suffice, terminating
sanctions are inappropriate. Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280. Here,
plaintiff’s requested alternative sanctions are sufficient to protect its
rights. Terminating sanctions are not the only remedy available, so it would be
inappropriate for the court to grant such.
Issue and Evidentiary Sanctions
In
the alternative plaintiff requests the following issue sanctions:
       
I.           
A
finding of fact that E-Design failed to pay all amounts due and owing as set
forth in the Statement of Account attached as Exhibit B to the SAC;
    
II.           
A
finding of fact that E-Design failed to pay all amounts due and owing as set
forth in the 179 invoices attached as Exhibit C to the SAC;
  III.           
A
finding of fact that the reasonable value of services provided by plaintiff to E-Design
is $259,063.74;
  IV.           
A
finding of fact that by and through the Guaranty Agreement attached as Exhibit
D to the SAC, Shamoeil personally and unconditionally guaranteed to plaintiff
the full, prompt, and faithful performance of E-Design, including the payment
of all fees and sums required to be paid for services rendered by plaintiff to
E-Design;
   
V.           
A
finding of fact that defendants consented to the withholding of goods in plaintiff’s
possession based on plaintiff’s general, possessory lien rights;
  VI.           
A
finding of fact that E-Design was not damaged in any amount as to the
allegations set forth in its 1st COA for conversion;
VII.           
A
finding of fact that plaintiff did not fraudulently induce E-Design to enter
into any arrangement as alleged in its 2nd COA;
VIII.           
A
finding of fact that E-Design did not have any existing contract or economic
relationship whatsoever with Walmart as it relates to E-Design’s 3rd, 4th, and
5th COAs;
  IX.           
A
finding of fact that plaintiff had no knowledge of any existing contract or
economic relationship whatsoever between E-Design and Walmart as it relates to
E-Design’s 3rd, 4th, and 5th COAs; and
   
X.           
A
finding of fact that E-Design was not damaged in any amount in connection with
its 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes of action.
Plaintiff
additionally requests the following evidentiary sanctions in the alternative:
       
I.           
Shamoeil
is precluded from submitting any affidavit/declaration in opposition to
Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment/adjudication that contradicts the
aforementioned findings of fact;
    
II.           
Defendants
are precluded from testifying at trial in contradiction to the aforementioned
findings of fact;
  III.           
Defendants
are precluded from introducing any evidence contradicting the findings of fact
set forth above as issue sanctions; and
  IV.           
Defendants
are precluded from introducing any evidence at trial or in response to any
dispositive motion that was not previously produced in discovery.
The
court finds the requested issue and evidentiary sanctions to be duplicative.
There is no compelling need for both the requested issue and evidentiary
sanctions to issue. The court grants plaintiff’s requested evidentiary
sanctions. Preventing defendants from opposing plaintiff’s asserted facts and
precluding any additional evidence from defendants is sufficient for plaintiff
to prepare for trial and raise defenses to the cross-complaint, and is
appropriate based on the years-long willful failures to comply with the
discovery process and numerous court orders, despite repeated warnings from the
court.
Monetary Sanctions
Plaintiff
seeks sanctions of $16,839.80. Courts may require financial reimbursement for
expenses incurred due to misuse of the discovery process. Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030; Deyo, supra. Defendants failed to comply with court
orders. The court cautioned defendants that sanctions would be appropriate if
defendants continued to fail to substantively comply with discovery. Min. Order
9/4/2024. The court previously issued sanctions, but defendants failed to
comply. Min. Order 9/27/2023.
Additional sanctions are appropriate.
Plaintiff’s
counsel billed at $450/hour and requests 4 hours for preparation and appearance
at the ex parte application to file the motion and for filing fees and
costs of $191.70. Id. at paras. 68-70. Plaintiff requests 14.3 hours for
moving papers, 5 hours to review opposition and prepare a reply, plus 1 hour for
the hearing. Plaintiff requests $276.35 for hearing reservation costs, filing
fees, and courtesy copy fees. Id. Plaintiff also requests the previously
deferred 9/27/2023 sanctions of $5,516.75 be imposed against defendants. Id.
at para. 71; Min. Order 9/27/2023.
The
court finds 24.3 hours is excessive, but awards 15 hours total time at a
reasonable hourly rate of $450/hour, plus the requested costs of $191.70 and $276.35.
The court further orders payment of the previously deferred $5,516.75.  
Plaintiff’s
motion for terminating sanctions is DENIED. Plaintiff’s alternative motion for evidentiary
sanctions is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s motion for monetary sanctions is GRANTED as
above, along with imposition of the previously deferred $5,516.75, payable
within 30 days.
