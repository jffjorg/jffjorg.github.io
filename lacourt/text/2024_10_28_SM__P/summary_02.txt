And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ramirez v. Velazquez, granting the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Mark David Ruszecki, the attorney representing the plaintiffs. The motion was filed on September 17, 2024, and the court notes that the plaintiffs did not receive notice of the motion. The court vacated the previously set trial date of September 30, 2024, and ordered Ruszecki to serve the motion on the plaintiffs. The court found that Ruszecki has met all the requirements for filing a motion to be relieved as counsel, and that there is no risk of prejudice to the plaintiffs.
