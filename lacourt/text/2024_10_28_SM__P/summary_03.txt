And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in a professional negligence lawsuit brought by Amin against Law Offices of Ramin Azadegan, APC and Fischer, Zisblatt & Kiss, LLP. Azadegan and FZK have moved to compel arbitration and stay proceedings, while Amin has moved to stay proceedings until the underlying and adversary actions are resolved. The judge has ruled that Azadegan and Amin's binding arbitration agreement controls, and that the court may order arbitration between the two parties while staying the superior court matter pending the outcome of that arbitration. The judge has also denied Amin's motion to stay proceedings, finding that the existence of a binding arbitration agreement between Azadegan and Amin controls, and that the court is not barred from considering the matter by bankruptcy.
