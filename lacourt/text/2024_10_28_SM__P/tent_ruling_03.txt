Amin v. Law Offices of Ramin
Azadegan, Case no. 24SMCV01109
Hearing date October 28, 2024
Defendant Azadegan’s Motion to
Compel Arbitration and for Stay of Proceedings
Plaintiff
Amin’s Motion for Stay of Proceedings
Plaintiff
Amin sues defendants Law Offices of Ramin Azadegan, APC (“Azadegan”) and
Fischer, Zisblatt & Kiss, LLP (“FZK”) for professional negligence; FZK
cross-complains against Azadegan. Azadegan and FZK represented plaintiff at
different times in Mirae Bank v. Amin, et al. and related
cross-complaint, Amin v. Emein, et al. (LASC Case no. BC401794). Amin
settled with Mirae Bank and obtained a $2,624,084.00 default judgment against
Emein, his former business partner. 
Amin
now alleges Azadegan and FZK committed legal malpractice, leaving the default
open to being overturned. The underlying action was remanded for further
proceedings 12/5/2023 by the Second Appellate District Court. On 5/17/2018 Emein
filed a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Petition, Case #2:18-bk-185643-WB, which was
discharged on 8/20/2018. Amin initiated an adversary action against Emein, objecting
to a discharge in the bankruptcy, pursuant to U.S.C. §523(a)(2)(A) and (B) and
(4) (Adversary Case No: 2:18-AP-01260-JW), which is still pending. Amin seeks
the same damages from Emein in the adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court that
he seeks from Azadegan and FZK in this case.
Azadegan
moves to compel arbitration and for a stay of proceedings until completion of the
arbitration, with supporting declarations of counsel Bucknell and Azadegan. Amin
moves to stay proceedings until the underlying adversary actions against Emein are
resolved.
Plaintiff Amin’s Objections to
Defendant Azadegan’s Declarations
As

Defendant’s Motion to Compel
Arbitration
California
public policy favors arbitration as an efficient alternative to litigation.
Code Civ. Proc. §1280 et seq., Madden v. Kaiser Found. Hosps. (1976) 17
Cal.3d 699, 706. A party waives its right to arbitrate when it “substantially
invokes” the litigation machinery before moving to arbitrate, resulting in
prejudice to the opposing party. Hoover v. American Income Life Ins. Co.
(2012) 20 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1204. Filing an answer does not waive the right to
seek arbitration. Christensen v. Dewor Developments (1983) 33 Cal.3d
778, 782. Responding to discovery, rather than propounding it, does not
constitute invocation of the litigation machinery. Davis v. Continental
Airlines, Inc. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 205, 217. Unreasonable delay in moving
to compel arbitration can lead to a waiver of arbitration rights. Spear v.
California State Auto Ass’n. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1035, 1043.
The
engagement agreement between Amin and Azadegan includes a binding arbitration
provision. Decl. Azadegan para. 2; ex. A. Amin filed the current action
3/11/2024. Azadegan and FZK’s demurrers of 4/29/2024 and 5/14/2024 asserting
SOL defenses, were overruled. Min. Order 6/25/2024.
Amin
and FZK argue Azadegan waived the right to compel arbitration, and the matter should
be stayed until resolution of the adversary and underlying action. Amin also argues
since litigation is pending against third party FZK, arbitration is barred per
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1281.2. They also argue Azadegan substantially invoked
the litigation process by demurring to the complaint and responding to
discovery. Filing a demurrer prior to answering and responding to discovery do
not waive the right to compel arbitration. See Davis, supra; see Christensen,
supra; Groom v. Health Net (2000) 98 Cal.Rptr.2d 836.
Code
Civ. Proc. §1281.2 requires a showing that there is a possibility of
conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact. Amin failed to make this
showing. Arbitration between Amin and Azadegan would resolve claims between
Amin and Azadegan; Amin would retain claims against FZK, and FZK would retain
its claims against Azadegan. 
Per
Code Civ. Proc. §1281.2, the court may order arbitration among the parties who
agreed to such, while staying the superior court matter pending outcome of that
arbitration. Amin and FZK indicated a desire to stay the action between them,
pending resolution of the underlying and adversary actions. The court orders
arbitration between Azadegan and Amin pursuant to the binding agreement and
stays the action between Amin and FZK. GRANTED.
Plaintiff’s Motion for Stay of
Proceedings
“Trial
courts have an inherent authority to stay malpractice suits, holding them in
abeyance pending resolution of underlying litigation.” Adams vs. Paul
(1995) 11 Cal.4th 583, 593. The moving party bears the burden of showing a stay
is warranted. See, e.g., Great American Ins. Co. v. Super. Ct. (2009)
178 Cal.App.4th 221, 240.
Amin
argues the underlying action has been remanded for further proceedings, the
issue of damages is being litigated, and the court should stay the matter until
the underlying action has been resolved. FZK joins, arguing the issues being
litigated in the underlying action, adversary action and instant action are the
same. 
Azadegan
argues Amin’s motion to stay cannot be heard by the court, as the issue is
subject to arbitration. Azadegan further argues Amin failed to demonstrate
resolution of the underlying action is necessary to establish his case against
defendants. Azadegan is correct.
The
existence of a binding arbitration agreement between Azadegan and Amin
controls. No party asserted the court is barred from considering the matter by
bankruptcy, merely that the court ought to stay the matter. Amin’s position is that
the underlying action has been stayed pending resolution of the adversary
action. FZK RJN 2; Decl. Berk para. 9. That position is not advanced as a
binding legal theory, and absent a bankruptcy stay, the court is compelled to
grant Azadegan’s motion to compel. DENIED.
