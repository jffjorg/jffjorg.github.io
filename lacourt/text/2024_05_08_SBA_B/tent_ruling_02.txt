LEGAL AUTHORITY
When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context. 
Taylor v. City of Los Angeles
Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. 
Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.”  SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.  “The only issue
involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747. 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case “with reasonable
precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to acquaint the
defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of action.” Gressley
v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal. App. 2d 636, 643-44.
DISCUSSION
Defendant Vortex Alliance, Inc.
demurs to the FAC on the grounds that the FAC fails to state sufficient facts
to constitute a cause of action for unlawful detainer.
Defendant contends that the FAC is
based on a “fatally flawed notice of termination of tenancy” and thus it fails
to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer.  Defendant asserts that the lease agreement
attached to the FAC contains a provision at para. 14, which requires a five day
notice to perform covenants or quit, but that the notice provided only three
days to perform.
The Court rules as follows:  “In commercial leases the landlord and
commercial tenant may lawfully agree to notice procedures that differ from
those provided in the statutory provisions governing unlawful detainer.  Thus, if the lease contains service
requirements for the notice to quit at variance with the requirements in the
unlawful detainer statutes, the lease provisions control.”  Culver City Partners East #1, L.P. v. Baja
Fresh Westlake Village, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal. App. 4th 744,
749-50 (citations omitted).
The commercial lease at paragraph
14 states:  “If Lessee . . . defaults in
the performance of any of the other covenants or conditions thereof, Lessor may
give Lessee notice of such default and if Lessee does not cure any such default
within 05 days, after the giving of such notice . . . then Lessee may terminate
this lease on not less than 05 days’ notice to Lessee.  On the date specified in such notice the term
of this lease shall terminate, and Lessee shall then quit and surrender the
premises to Lessor, without extinguishing Lessee’s liability. . . .”  FAC, at Exh. A.  The notice provided for three days to perform
covenant or quit, not the required five under the commercial lease.  Id., at Exh. B.   As the lease provisions control, the
three-day notice did not comply with the commercial lease and is thus
improper.  The allegations are
insufficient to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer.
There is no opposition.  Plaintiff has not shown how he can amend to
correct the defect.
            Thus, the demurrer is SUSTAINED WITHOUT
LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
ORDER
The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITHOUT
LEAVE TO AMEND as to the FAC. 
Defendant is ordered to give notice
of ruling.
