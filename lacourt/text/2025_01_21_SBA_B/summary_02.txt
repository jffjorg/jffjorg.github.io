And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of SRI Panchamukha Hanuman Temple and Religious Academy against CHARLES THACKER and others. The plaintiff had filed a motion to vacate a dismissal that was entered on December 17, 2024, due to the mistake and neglect of its attorney. The judge has granted the motion, finding that the attorney's mistake and neglect warrant relief from the dismissal. As a result, the dismissal is vacated and the case is reinstated. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff's attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees to the defendant's attorney in the amount of $1200.

The judge has also considered the defendant's motion for attorney's fees and costs, but has found that the motion is moot given the reinstatement of the case. The defendant had sought $13,159.61 in fees and costs, but the judge has denied this request.

The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), which allows the court to relieve a party from a dismissal taken against them through their mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The judge has also cited a previous court case, Fasuyi v. Permatex, Inc., which states that the policy of the law is to have every litigated case tried upon its merits, and that the court looks with disfavor upon a party who attempts to take advantage of the mistake, surprise, inadvertence, or neglect of their adversary.
