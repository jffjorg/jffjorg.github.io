BACKGROUND
            On April 13, 2023, plaintiff
Kimberly Lewis filed a complaint against The TJX Company, Inc. for general
negligence and premises liability. 
Plaintiff alleges that on April 21, 2021, defendant negligently
maintained, owned, leased, occupied, and controlled the premises such that
store items were not properly secured on the shelves and cascaded on top of
plaintiff’s head.
            On April 18, 2023, plaintiff filed
an amended complaint.
            On November 7, 2023, defendant filed
an answer.
            On November 20, 2023, at the CMC,
the Court set a trial date for October 2, 2024.
            On January 3, 2024, plaintiff filed
a substitution of attorney.
            On May 1, 2024, plaintiff filed a
substitution of attorney.
            On July 2, 2024, the parties
stipulated to continue the trial date. 
The Court ordered that the parties were to meet and confer to establish
a detailed written discovery schedule, discuss mediation and other alternative
dispute resolution options, and lead trial counsel attend the August 23, 2024
hearing.  The Court noted that it
expected “to move this matter to trial quickly.” 
            On August 23, 2024, the Court set a
trial date for September 8, 2025.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
            CCP §2025.450(a) provides:  “If, after service of a deposition notice, a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party, . . , without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410,
fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for
inspection any document . . . described in the deposition notice, the party
giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance
and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document . . .
described in the deposition notice.” 
CCP §2025.450(b) provides, “A
motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of the following:
(1)        The
motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
(2)        The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the
documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the
deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted
the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”
DISCUSSION
Defendant
requests that the Court compel plaintiff Kimberly Lewis to appear for a deposition.
Defendant
explains that on March 14, 2024, plaintiff was served with a notice of
deposition for May 8, 2024.  On March 14,
plaintiff’s prior attorney objected based on not being available.  On March 15 and 19, defense counsel requested
a mutually agreeable date.  On March 28,
defendant served a notice of continuance of deposition for May 22.  On May 1, plaintiff filed a substitution of
attorney.  On June 5 and 10, defense
counsel requested a new date for plaintiff’s deposition.  On June 11, defendant served a notice of
taking deposition for July 11.  On July
3, defense counsel emailed plaintiff’s counsel to confirm July 11.  On July 5, plaintiff’s counsel confirmed he
was unavailable for July 11 and that he would provide alternative dates the
following week.  On July 25, defense
counsel emailed plaintiff’s counsel for an available date.  On August 1, defendant served a notice of
taking deposition for September 11.  On
August 9, counsel met and conferred to prepare a joint discovery schedule,
which was filed, noting that plaintiff’s deposition was scheduled for September
11.  
On
September 3, plaintiff objected to the deposition notice on the grounds that it
was unilaterally noticed and that she and her counsel were unavailable.  On September 6 and 11, defense counsel
emailed plaintiff’s counsel proposing five alternative deposition dates.  On September 11, plaintiff’s counsel
responded that he was working on getting a date and would confirm a date before
the end of the week.  On September 24,
defense counsel emailed plaintiff’s counsel requesting an available date.  On September 25 and October 7, plaintiff’s
counsel stated that he was still working on securing a deposition date.  On October 10, defense counsel followed up
with plaintiff’s counsel.  On October 11,
defendant served a notice of taking deposition for October 31.  On October 23, plaintiff objected on the
grounds that it was unilaterally noticed and that she and counsel were
unavailable.  On October 30, defense
counsel requested a firm date by the end of the week.  On October 31, counsel met and conferred by
phone.  
On
November 11, defense counsel sent an email to plaintiff’s counsel to follow
up.  On November 13, plaintiff’s counsel
provided December 18 as an available date. 
On November 15, defendant served a deposition notice for December
18.  On December 17, plaintiff’s counsel
responded that plaintiff would not be available for her deposition. 
There is
no opposition.
The Court
finds that defendant properly noticed plaintiff’s deposition on numerous
occasions, and that she had agreed to appear on certain dates and did not file
valid objections.  The motion is thus
GRANTED.
Sanctions
Under CCP §2025.450(g)(1), “If a
motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the
party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with
whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”
Defendant
requests sanctions against plaintiff and her attorney in the amount of $920 (at
$215/hr.).  The Court finds that $705
($215/hr. x 3 hrs., filing fee) is a reasonable amount to be imposed against
plaintiff only.
ORDER
            The motion is GRANTED.
            Plaintiff Kimberly Lewis is ordered
to appear for her deposition within fifteen days at a mutually agreeable place
and time.
Plaintiff is ordered to pay
monetary sanctions to defendant T.J. MAXX OF CA, LLC in the amount of $705.00 within
thirty days.
            Defendant is ordered to give notice
of ruling.
