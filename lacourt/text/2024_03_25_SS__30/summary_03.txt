Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Defendant Ronald Smothers' motion for terminating sanctions to dismiss Plaintiff Jason Mota's complaint. However, the judge has granted Defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $660, payable within 20 days. The judge found that Plaintiff failed to respond to discovery and pay sanctions, despite being ordered to do so. The judge noted that Plaintiff's counsel withdrew from the case due to Plaintiff's non-response, but Plaintiff later re-established contact with former counsel and provided verified discovery responses and paid partial sanctions. The judge concluded that terminating sanctions were not appropriate, as Plaintiff has now responded to discovery, but monetary sanctions were warranted due to Plaintiff's inaction and failure to timely provide responses.
