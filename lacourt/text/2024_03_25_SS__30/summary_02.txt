And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling grants Defendant Chong Xu's motion to compel Plaintiff Navid Ganjian's deposition. The Plaintiff is ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days of this order. Additionally, Defendant's request for sanctions is granted, and Plaintiff is ordered to pay Defendant monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,092 within 30 days of this order.

The Court's reasoning is based on the following facts: Defendant served a notice of taking Plaintiff's deposition and demand for production of documents at deposition, and Plaintiff failed to appear for the deposition after being properly served. The Court also notes that Plaintiff's counsel failed to object to the deposition notice and did not provide a valid objection under CCP section 2025.410.

The Court cites various California Code of Civil Procedure sections, including sections 2025.010, 2025.450(a), and 2025.450(b), to support its decision. The Court also notes that Plaintiff's failure to appear for deposition and failure to pay sanctions is a violation of the rules of civil procedure and is subject to sanctions.
