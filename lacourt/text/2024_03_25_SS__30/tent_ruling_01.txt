  Case Number:  20STCV15480    Hearing Date:   March 25, 2024    Dept:  30 CHRISTINA GUTIERREZ vs CITY OF LOS ANGELESTENTATIVEDefendant ABM Industry Groups, LLC’s motion to enforce the December 29, 2023 Order, and for Terminating Sanctions and Monetary Sanctions is DENIED.  Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.Legal StandardCCP section 2023.030 provides that, "[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method..., the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose... [monetary, evidence, and terminating] sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process...." CCP section 2023.010 provides that "[m]issues of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following:... (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.... (g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery....""The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse 'after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.'" (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390 (quoting Lang v. Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246).) "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'" (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 (citation omitted).)"Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders." (Id. (citing Lang, supra, 77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244- 1246); see, e.g., Collisson X Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 (terminating sanctions imposed after defendants failed to comply with one court order to produce discovery); Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal App 3d 481, 491 (disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCucchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4) (terminating sanctions imposed against plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various discovery statutes).)DiscussionThis is Defendant’s second motion for terminating and monetary sanctions. However, this motion is without merit. Defendant argues Plaintiff has failed to disobey the Court’s December 29, 2023 order imposing sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $590 to be paid within 30 days. (See 12/29/2023 Minute Order.) Thus, Defendant seeks terminating and monetary sanctions based on the failure to pay monetary sanctions.In opposition, Plaintiff argues she is not in a position to pay monetary sanctions at this time, due to being injured. Plaintiff argues Defendant can seek reconciliation of the $590.00 sanction order without seeking court enforcement or additional sanctions in their effort to continue racking up secondary violations sanctions or justify terminating sanctions. Indeed, Plaintiff continues, Defendant AEG Management’s only focus seems to be to run to court with discovery motion after discovery motion, often on questionable grounds, to precondition the court to escalate the imposition of monetary sanctions.The Court agrees with Plaintiff. A court may not issue a terminating sanction for failure to pay a monetary discovery sanction. (Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 610, 615.) A monetary sanction order is enforceable as a money judgment under the Enforcement of Judgments Law, CCP §§680.010, et seq. (Id. at 615.) As a result, Defendant should have enforced the monetary sanction as a money judgment, instead of filing this motion.Accordingly, Defendant ABM Industry Groups, LLC’s motion to enforce the December 29, 2023 Order, and for Terminating Sanctions and Monetary Sanctions is DENIED.
