And here is the English-text summary:

The court has denied Defendant ABM Industry Groups, LLC's motion to enforce the December 29, 2023 Order and for terminating and monetary sanctions. The motion was based on Plaintiff CHRISTINA GUTIERREZ's failure to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $590. However, the court found that a court may not issue a terminating sanction for failure to pay a monetary discovery sanction and that Defendant should have enforced the monetary sanction as a money judgment instead of filing this motion. The court also found that Plaintiff's inability to pay was due to being injured and that Defendant's focus seemed to be on filing discovery motions to precondition the court to escalate the imposition of monetary sanctions.
