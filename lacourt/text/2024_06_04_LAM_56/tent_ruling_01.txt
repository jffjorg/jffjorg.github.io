AND RELATED CROSS-ACTIONS
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Centaurus
Financial, Inc. (“Defendant”)
RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
This action arises
out of alleged mishandling of Plaintiffs’ investment property.  The currently operative second amended
complaint (the “SAC”) alleges: (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) California
financial elder abuse; (3) Illinois financial elder abuse; (4) breach of
contract; (5) breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing; (6) aiding
and abetting breach of fiduciary duty; (7) negligence; (8) violation of
Business & Professions Code sections 17200 and 17500; (9) common law fraud;
and (10) negligent misrepresentation.  
 
On March 29, 2024,
Defendant filed a motion for leave to file compulsory cross-complaint against
Plaintiff Joachim Reich. No opposition has been filed. 
            In fact,
there are two motions for leave to file cross complaint on file in this case:
(1) One set for hearing on 6/4/24 CRS # 910690136906; and (2) One set for
hearing on 6/20/24 CRS # 989818478476. 
Defendant has only filed moving papers for the motion for leave set for
hearing on June 20, 2024 (CRS # 989818478476). 
There are no papers for CRS # 910690136906, set for hearing on June 4,
2024.  The Court has requested that the parties
meet and confer regarding any such motions for leave to file
cross-complaints.  Thus, the Court continues
the hearing set for June 4, 2024 to June 20, 2024. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice
of this ruling.
 
     Dated this 4th
day of June 2024
