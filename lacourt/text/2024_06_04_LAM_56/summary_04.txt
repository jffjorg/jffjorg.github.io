```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's default judgment application without prejudice. The plaintiff failed to submit certain required documents, including a signed memorandum of costs and disbursements, a signed declaration of non-military status for each defendant, and a dismissal of certain defendants from the action. Additionally, the plaintiff failed to provide exhibits to support his claimed damages and penalties, including emotional distress damages. As a result, the plaintiff has not sufficiently substantiated his claimed damages in support of the default judgment application.
