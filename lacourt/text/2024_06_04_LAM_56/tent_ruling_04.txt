  CASE NO.: 23STCV31356
 
ORDER RE: 
DEFAULT JUDGMENT APPLICATION
 
Date: 
  June 4, 2024 
Time: 10:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
            Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants Abdul Oil Corporation and Abdul Wahab
Hidayatulla. Plaintiff’s default judgment application is valid in all respects
except that: Plaintiff failed to submit a signed memorandum of costs and
disbursements as required by California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1800(a)(4). Plaintiff also failed to submit a signed declaration of
nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is sought. (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800(a)(5).) Plaintiff also did not obtain a dismissal
of Does 1 through 20, inclusive, from this action. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1800(a)(7).) Additionally, although seeking various penalties and damages, including
emotional distress damages, Plaintiff has not presented any exhibits in support
of his default judgment application to substantiate such damages and penalties.
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800(a)(8).) Plaintiff has therefore not
sufficiently substantiated his claimed damages in support of the default
judgment application. 
 
Plaintiff’s default judgment
application is therefore DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
