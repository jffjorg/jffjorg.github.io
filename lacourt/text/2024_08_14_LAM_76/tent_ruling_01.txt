ANALYSIS
Motion To Dismiss
Defendant/Cross-Complainants
Castaic Studios, LLC moves to dismiss the Complaint and Answer of Wonderland
Studios, LLC on the ground that this Court granted Wonderland’s previous
attorney's Motion to be Relieved as counsel on March 8, 2024 and Wonderland
remains unrepresented by counsel.
            “Since the passage of the State Bar
Act in 1927, it has been well settled that persons may represent their own
interests in legal proceedings but may not " ' "practice law [for
another] in this State unless [they are] active member[s] of the state
bar." ' " (Citations omitted.)” (Drake v. Superior Court
(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1826, 1830.)  Moreover,
 “ ‘A corporation cannot
represent itself in court, either in propria persona or through an officer or
agent who is not an attorney.’ (Citations omitted.)”  (Merco Constr. Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal
Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724,
729.)
            However:
Given the weight of nationwide authority and this state's increasing
acceptance of the view that representation of the corporation by an attorney is
not an absolute prerequisite to the court's fundamental power to hear or
determine a case, we are persuaded it is more appropriate and just to treat a
corporation's failure to be represented by an attorney as a defect that may be
corrected, on such terms as are just in the sound discretion of the court. First and foremost, this approach honors
the cornerstone jurisprudential policies that, in furtherance of justice,
complaints are to be liberally construed (§ 452) and disputes should be
resolved on their merits ( Hocharian v. Superior Court (1981) 28 Cal.3d 714,
724 [170 Cal. Rptr. 790, 621 P.2d 829]). 

 [*1150]  This conclusion also
recognizes the legislative directive that a corporation shall be deemed a
“person” with the capacity, or legal authority, to sue, that is, to be a party
to a lawsuit. (§ 17; Corp. Code, § 207; Parker v. Bowron (1953) 40 Cal.2d 344,
351 [254 P.2d 6]; Friendly Village Community Assn., Inc. v. Silva & Hill
Constr. Co. (1973) 31 Cal. App. 3d 220, 224 [107 Cal. Rptr. 123].) The rule
requiring representation by an attorney does not deprive a corporation of this
capacity to be a party to a lawsuit. It is not a fact essential to the
corporation's cause of action or an element constituting its right of action.
(See California Sav. & L. Soc. v. Harris (1896) 111 Cal. 133, 136 [43 P.
525].) To deem a pleading void because the corporation on whose behalf it
was filed, although statutorily authorized to be a party, did not have an
attorney sign the pleading, elevates the attorney to a role akin to that of an
indispensable party. 

Furthermore, the flexible rule we articulate in
no way impairs the court's ability to assure that trained legal professionals
participate in the presentation of the corporation's case. The rule's
pragmatic purpose of protecting against the distractions and potentially
harmful results that can arise from the unlicensed practice of law will still
be served because the court retains authority to dismiss an action if an
unrepresented corporation does not obtain counsel within reasonable time.
