And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiffs Cyrus Mazaherian and Linda Terashita. The motion was filed by Defendant Monika Mazaherian, who argues that the deadline for filing the amended complaint had passed and that Plaintiffs should have sought permission to file a belated pleading. The Judge has denied the motion to strike, finding that the delay in filing the amended complaint was due to excusable neglect and that the Defendant has not shown prejudice. The Judge has used discretion in denying the motion to strike, and has noted that even if the motion were granted, Plaintiffs could file for mandatory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473. The case will proceed, with any arguments regarding the merits of the action to be addressed on demurrer, motion for judgment on the pleadings, summary judgment, and the like.
