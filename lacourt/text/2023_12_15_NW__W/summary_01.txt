And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendants argued that the plaintiff, Feisty Gal, Inc., cannot continue to represent itself in the lawsuit and that Michelle Lander, the other plaintiff, is not a party to the franchise agreement and therefore lacks standing to bring the lawsuit. The judge finds that the motion is now moot because Feisty Gal, Inc. has retained new counsel, and the grounds for dismissal of Michelle Lander are based on the inability of Feisty Gal, Inc. to proceed with the lawsuit, which is no longer an issue. The judge exercises its discretion to consider the late-filed opposition from the plaintiffs and agrees that the motion is now moot. As a result, the motion is denied, and the case will proceed as scheduled.
