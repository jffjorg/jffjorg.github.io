Pursuant to CCP § 430.41, the meet and confer
requirement has been met. (Maata Decl. ¶ 2-7, Ex. A, B.) Plaintiff asserts that
the meet and confer was deficient because Defendant’s counsel asserted that the
only rationale for the demurrer was that the FAC was frivolous and that he
would move for sanctions. (Cortez Decl. ¶¶ 5-7.) “Any determination by the court that the meet and confer
process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer.” (CCP § 430.41(a)(4).) As the failure to meet and confer does not
constitute grounds to overrule a demurrer, the court continues to review the
merits.
