Background
 
On August
24, 2023, Holy Oil Partnerships (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Stephen
Hightower (“Hightower”); Stephen Hightower II (“Hightower II”); Hightowers
Petroleum Company (“HPC”) (collectively “Defendants”) and Does 1 to 100. 
On
March 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)
alleging six causes of action for: 
1)    
Breach
of Contract;
2)    
Breach
of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing;
3)    
Promissory
Estoppel; 
4)    
Intentional
Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage; 
5)    
Negligent
Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage; and 
6)    
Breach
of Fiduciary Duty. 
 
On
April 2, 2024, Defendants filed a demurrer to the FAC and a Motion for
Sanctions. Plaintiff opposes both Motions. The matter is now before the court. 
Demurrer[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP, § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Discussion
 
A.        Summary of Allegations
 
This action arises
out of Plaintiff’s plan to develop a public-private partnership with the City
of Adelanto (“City”) to develop mixed fueling stations (the “P3 Project”).
(FAC, ¶ 11.) If the P3 Project came to fruition, Plaintiff expected profits of
approximately $205 million over a five-year period based on figures obtained by
geologist Terry Bryant. (FAC, ¶¶ 20, 21.) Initial talks with the City began in
2020 but stalled. (FAC, ¶¶ 12, 15, 25.) Discussions with the City resumed in
January 2022. (FAC, ¶ 26.) 
 
On January 12, 2022,
Plaintiff through its owner, Shashon Jenkins (“Jenkins”), reached out to Defendant
HPC’s chief operating officer, Defendant Hightower II, to see if they were
interested in joining the P3 Project. (FAC, ¶ 27.) On January 28, 2022,
Plaintiffs submitted their proposal to Defendants for a partnership. (FAC, ¶¶
29-32, Ex. 3 at p. 2; Ex. 4.) Defendants agreed they liked the opportunity and
wanted to discuss further details. (FAC, ¶ 33, Ex. 5.) 
 
Plaintiff alleges
that at the February 18, 2022, meeting, Plaintiff and Hightower II agreed to
move forward with the P3 Project once they met with the City’s mayor. (FAC, ¶
36.) Plaintiff alleges that in its discussion with the Mayor “[t]he
City indicated that, based on Defendants’ expertise and resources, the P3
Project would be approved to move forward. The Mayor reconfirmed the City’s
support to the P3 Project and agreed to meet with Plaintiffs and Hightower II.”
(FAC, ¶ 37.)
 
On March 4, 2022, Plaintiff and
Hightower II had a phone conference wherein Hightower II “discussed the
services Defendants would bring to the P3 Project, estimated profits from the
venture, and what Defendants desired in terms of compensation from their role
in the Project.” (FAC, ¶ 38.) On March 18, 2022, a video conference meeting was
held between Plaintiff, the City’s Mayor, and Hightower II (the “Partnership
Meeting”) wherein the P3 Project was discussed, and the parties' roles, ideas
and commitments were outlined. (FAC, ¶ 40.) 
 
At the meeting, the
FAC alleges that Hightower II stated that HPC was able to meet its commitments
toward the P3 Project and would take the lead in securing funding as well as
commit the resources of HPC and its subsidiaries to the P3 Project. (FAC, ¶ 41.)
As part of the first phase of the P3 Project, HPC promised to implement smart
grid technology on the 40-acre parcel where the first location of the City Gas
would be located. (FAC, ¶ 3.) 
 
The Mayor stated that
the City’s contribution to the P3 Project would be a plot of land situated off
395 and El Mirage Road, with the City handling the land acquisition for the
private owner and in return the City would receive 3-4 cents per gallon in
return. (FAC, ¶ 51.) Plaintiff agreed to commit its Louisiana and Texas Energy
Assets to the P3 Project and expand the revenue sources for the P3 Project.
(FAC, ¶¶ 47, 48.)
 
Plaintiff asserts
that the Partnership Agreement was created orally at the March 18, 2022,
Partnership Meeting. (FAC, ¶¶ 40, 52, 76.) The FAC alleges that the parties'
obligations were as follows under the Partnership Agreement: 
 
The parties concluded the meeting with an understanding that
HPC was the principal lead partner tasked with putting the Project details in
writing, beginning the next phase of actual development, and bringing in
additional Operations Partners to the P3; City was tasked with acquiring the
land for the fueling station and to upgrade existing infrastructure; while
Plaintiffs was tasked with further expansion to bring in more locations within
the Project and bring in additional sources of revenue through its Assets. The
parties further committed that substantial revenue from the Project would be
shared and apportioned between them.
 
(FAC, ¶ 52.) 
 
In reliance on the
Partnership Agreement, Plaintiff reached an agreement with Kowrii,
a fintech bank (“Bank”), to build a brick-and-mortar store on all future City
Gas locations in exchange for Plaintiff receiving a 30% profit. (FAC, ¶ 55; Ex.
7.)
 
On March 28, 2022, Defendant
Hightower II emailed Plaintiffs asking about dates for a face-to-face meeting
with all P3 partners. (FAC, ¶ 57.) The in-person meeting did not occur as Hightower
II stated he became ill with COVID-10. (FAC, ¶ 62.) In response, Plaintiff
stated that “there is some urgency to finalize and memorialize the P3 Project
as there was some uncertainty that a different City administration would be
taking over who may not be interested in the Project” because the Mayor and
three other individuals were up for reelection. (FAC, ¶ 63.)
 
The FAC alleges that Defendant
Hightower II lied about being sick with COVID-19 as evidenced by his social
media posts. (FAC, ¶ 64; Ex. 12, 13.) Plaintiff asserts that despite Defendants
being aware of Plaintiff’s business relationships with the City and the Bank,
Defendants backed out of their obligations and duties under the P3 Partnership.
(FAC, ¶¶ 65, 78.) Plaintiff further maintains that such actions were “willful,
malicious, oppressive, and fraudulent.” (FAC, ¶ 65.) 
 
B.        First Cause of Action - Breach of
Contract
 
The elements of a claim for
breach of contract are: “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s
performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the
resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011)
51 Cal. 4th 811, 821.) In addition, the complaint must demonstrate damages
proximately caused by the breach. (St. Paul Ins. v. American Dynasty (2002)
101 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1060.) Furthermore, “the complaint must [also] indicate
on its face whether the contract is written, oral, or implied by conduct.” (Otworth
v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458-59
citing CCP, § 430.10(g).)
 
Defendants assert that there
was no oral contract to form a partnership, and the parties' communications
were preliminary discussions that never materialized into an actual
partnership. Defendants further maintain that even if there was an agreement to
form a partnership, the statute of frauds barred the agreement. To establish
the existence of a contract, there must be “(1) Parties capable of contracting;
(2) Their consent; (3) A Lawful Object; and (4) A Sufficient Cause or
Consideration.” (Civ. Code, § 1550.) “Any benefit
conferred, or agreed to be conferred, upon the promisor, by any other person,
to which the promisor is not lawfully entitled, or any prejudice suffered, or
agreed to be suffered, by such person, other than such as he is at the time of
consent lawfully bound to suffer, as an inducement to the promisor, is a good
consideration for a promise.” (Civ. Code, § 1605.) 
 
Plaintiff alleges it suffered a detriment
because in reliance on the Partnership Agreement with Defendants, Plaintiff
entered into an agreement with Kowrii Bank. (FAC, ¶ 55, Ex. 7.) Plaintiff
asserts that in consideration for the Agreement with the Bank, they wrote a
check for  $15,000.00. (FAC, ¶ 55, Ex.
7.) However, the check is dated February 12, 2021, more than a year before the
March 18, 2022, Partnership Meeting wherein Plaintiff alleges the Partnership
was formed. (FAC, ¶¶ 40, 76, Ex. 7.) Plaintiff also alleges that due to the
Partnership Agreement, Plaintiff reached an agreement with a food vendor,
Lincoln Avenue Brewery, for the City Gas locations. (FAC, ¶ 54, 77, 84.)
Plaintiff further alleges that Defendants knew about Plaintiff’s relationship with
the food vendor. (FAC, ¶ 118.) 
 
As Plaintiff suffered a detriment due to
the Partnership Agreement, the facts support a finding that there was
consideration for the Partnership Agreement. Whether the discussions Plaintiff,
the City, and Defendants had was a preliminary negotiation and not a final
agreement, is a disputed issue of fact not subject to demurrer. Lastly,
Defendants argue the Partnership Agreement is barred by the Statute of Frauds
because the Partnership Agreement cannot “by its terms” “be performed within a
year” of its making. (Civ. Code, § 1624(a).
 
“The test for determining whether an oral
contract is not to be performed within a year lies wholly within its terms. [Citation.] The terms of the oral agreement
may by express provision specify that the duty is not to be performed within a
year, or by clear implication make it evident from the subject matter of the
contract that a period longer than one year was contemplated by the parties.
[Citation.]” (Lacy v. Bennett (1962) 207 Cal.App.2d 796, 800 [italics
original].) Nothing in the FAC
reflects facts to show that the obligations of the parties as outlined in the
FAC could be performed within one year. (FAC¶¶ 51, 52.) This included the city
obtaining the plot of land and updating the existing infrastructure, completing
all the phases of development needed to bring the P3 Project into fruition,
obtaining additional partners and funding, and scouting for further locations.
(FAC, ¶ 52.)
 
In other words, the FAC fails to allege
facts to show that a possibility exists that the terms of the Partnership
agreement may be performed within a year. (See Hollywood Motion Picture Equipment Co. v.
Furer
(1940) 16 Cal.2d 184, 187.) “Furthermore, to fall under the bar of subdivision
1 of section 1624 of the Civil Code, the contract must, by its terms, be
impossible of performance within a year. If it is unlikely that it will be so
performed, or the period of performance is indefinite, the statute does not
apply. [Citation.]” (Blaustein v. Burton (1970) 9
Cal.App.3d 161, 185.) Here, the FAC fails to allege facts to show that the
Partnership Agreement was of indefinite duration such that the Statute of
Frauds does not bar the Partnership Agreement. 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the first
cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
C.        Second Cause of Action – Breach of Implied Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing
 
“Every contract contains an implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing providing that no party to the contract will do
anything that would deprive another party of the benefits of the contract.¿The
implied covenant protects the reasonable expectations of the contracting
parties based on their mutual promises.” (Digerati Holdings, LLC v. Young
Money Entertainment, LLC (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 873, 885.) The
covenant thus cannot “ ‘be endowed with an existence independent of its
contractual underpinnings.’ ” (Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange,
Inc. (1995) 11 Cal.4th 1, 36
quoting Love v. Fire Ins. Exchange (1990)
221 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1153.) “It cannot  impose substantive duties or
limits on the contracting parties beyond those incorporated in the specific
terms of their agreement.” (Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc. (2000) 24
Cal.4th 317, 349–350.) 
 
As Plaintiff has failed to
plead the existence of a valid contract, the demurrer to the second cause of
action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
D.        Third Cause of Action – Promissory
Estoppel 
 
“‘The elements of a promissory estoppel claim are ‘(1) a
promise clear and unambiguous in its terms; (2) reliance by the party to whom
the promise is made; (3)[the] reliance must be both reasonable and foreseeable;
and (4) the party asserting the estoppel must be injured by his reliance.’
[Citation.]” (Advanced Choices, Inc. v. State Dept. of Health Services (2010)
182 Cal.App.4th 1661, 1672, citing US Ecology, Inc. v. State of California (2005)
129 Cal.App.4th 887, 901.) “Conceptually, promissory estoppel is distinct from
contract in that the promisee's justifiable and detrimental reliance on the
promise is regarded as a substitute for the consideration required as an
element of an enforceable contract.” (Signal Hill Aviation Co. v. Stroppe
(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 627, 640.)
 
Defendants assert that Plaintiff’s third cause of action
fails because the promise is not clear and unambiguous and the FAC only pleads
in a conclusory manner that the promises were detailed. The FAC alleges that
Defendants stated they would “bring in additional, experience
national operations partners (“Operations Partners”) to handle the daily
operations of the City Gas station” which had not yet been built nor was the
location for the City Gas acquired by the City. (FAC, ¶ 45.) “HPC was the
principal lead partner tasked with putting the Project details in writing,
beginning the next phase of actual development”, with the first phase of the
project being the construction of the City Gas station the City Parcel that had
not yet been acquired. (FAC, ¶¶ 43, 52.) 
 
As the P3 Project details were
not put in writing by Defendants and the City had not moved to acquire the plot
to build the City Gas station, the alleged promise on which Plaintiff relied
appears to be ambiguous since no time frame was given as to when Defendants’
performance was due. Specifically, Plaintiff fails to plead facts to show that
between March 18, 2022, when the Partnership Agreement was formed, and July
2022,  shortly after Defendants backed
out of the Agreement Plaintiff in reliance of the Agreement entered into an
agreement with the Lincoln Avene Brewery and incurred expenses before realizing
that Defendants no longer intended to abide by the agreement. (FAC,  54, 105.) 
 
As the court finds that
Plaintiff failed to plead facts to show that the promise was clear and
unambiguous and that their reliance was reasonable and foreseeable, the
demurrer to the third cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
E.        Fourth and Fifth Causes of Action – Interference with
Prospective Economic Advantage and Negligent Interference with Prospective
Economic Advantage 
 
“The five elements for
intentional interference with prospective economic advantage [(“IIPEA”)] are:
(1) an economic relationship between the plaintiff and some third party, with
the probability of future economic benefit to the plaintiff; (2) the
defendant's knowledge of the relationship; (3) intentional acts on the part of
the defendant designed to disrupt the relationship; (4) actual disruption of
the relationship; and (5) economic harm to the plaintiff proximately caused by
the acts of the defendant.” (Youst v. Longo (1987) 43 Cal.3d 64, 71, fn.
6.) The tort of negligent interference with a prospective economic advantage
(“NIPEA”) differs in that the defendant's act disrupting the economic
relationship does not need to be intentional. (Venhaus v. Shultz (2007)
155 Cal.App.4th 1072, 1078.)“The
tort of negligent interference
with economic relationship arises only when the
defendant owes the plaintiff a duty of
care.” (Stolz v. Wong Communications Limited Partnership (1994)
25 Cal.App.4th 1811, 1825 [italics original].)
 
For both IIPEA and
NIPEA, the interference must be wrongful by some legal measure other than the
fact of the interference itself. (Della Penna v. Toyota Motor Sales,
U.S.A., Inc. (1995) 11 Cal.4th 376, 378.) “[A]n act is independently
wrongful if it is unlawful, that is, if it is proscribed by some
constitutional, statutory, regulatory, common law, or other determinable legal
standard.” (Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2003) 29 Cal.4th
1134, 1159.) 
 
Defendants’ demurrer to the
fourth and fifth causes of action on the grounds that the FAC fails to allege
negligent or intentional acts designed to disrupt the Plaintiff’s economic
relationship with the City of Adelanto and Kowrii Bank. (FAC, ¶¶ 11, 29, 41,
55, 56.) The FAC alleges that Defendants withdrew from the project shortly
after July 2022. (FAC, ¶ 104.) Defendants withdrew by failing to re-schedule
the in-person meeting despite Plaintiff and the City being on standby for a
conference by lying about being sick with COVID-19. (FAC, ¶¶ 62, 64, Ex. 12,
13.) 
 
The court finds that the FAC
sufficiently alleges that the wrongful conduct was Defendants’ withdrawal from
the Partnership resulting in the disruption of Plaintiff’s economic
relationships because Defendants did not take the lead on the P3 Project and
did not develop Plaintiff’s assets. (FAC, ¶ 103.) This soured any future
relationship Plaintiff may have had with the City, the Lincoln Brewery, and the
Bank. (FAC, ¶ 107.) Plaintiff lost out on potentially 30% of the profits in the
Agreement with the Bank and expected profits from the P3 Project (FAC, ¶ 55,
105.) 
 
Based on the above, the court
finds that Plaintiff has pled facts sufficient to show that Defendants’ conduct
was wrongful and disrupted Plaintiff’s economic relationships. 
 
On reply, Defendants
argue that Plaintiff fails to plead any independently wrongful conduct by
Defendants. The court does not consider this argument. “Points raised for the
first time in a reply brief will not be considered.” (Malmstrom v.
Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. (1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 299, 320.)
 
The demurrer to the fourth and
fifth causes of action is overruled. 
 
F.        Sixth Cause of Action – Breach of
Fiduciary Duty
 
“‘[B]efore a person
can be charged with a fiduciary obligation, he must either knowingly undertake
to act on behalf and for the benefit of another, or must enter into a
relationship which imposes that undertaking as a matter of law.’” (Hassov.
Hapke (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 107, 140 (quoting Committee on Children’s
Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp.(1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 221).) “A
fiduciary duty under common law may arise ‘when one person enters into a
confidential relationship with another.’” (Id.) A¿partnership relationship
is a fiduciary relationship. (See Cleveland v. Johnson (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1338.)
 
Defendants’ demurrer
to the sixth cause of action on the basis that the FAC fails to plead the
existence of a fiduciary relationship because there was no Partnership
Agreement. (FAC, ¶ 129.) As the FAC fails to allege the existence of a valid
contract forming a Partnership Agreement, the demurrer to the sixth cause of action
is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
Motion for Sanctions
 
I.         Legal
Standard 
 
CCP § 128.7(b)
provides that by presenting a pleading to the court, an attorney “is certifying
that to the best of the person’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed
after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, all of the following
conditions are met:   
 
(1)¿It is
not being presented primarily for an improper purpose, such as to harass or to
cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation. 
 
(2)¿The
claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing
law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal
of existing law or the establishment of new law. 
 
(3)¿The
allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if
specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a
reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery. 
 
(4)¿The
denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if
specifically so identified, are reasonably based on a lack of information or
belief. 
 
Section 128.7(c) provides that the court may impose
monetary sanctions on an attorney who violates subdivision(b) or who is
responsible for the violation.  “Under section 128.7, a court may impose sanctions
if it concludes a pleading was filed for an improper purpose or was
indisputably without merit, either legally or factually. [Citation.]” (Bucur
v. Ahmad (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 175, 189.) “[T]o obtain sanctions, the
moving party must show the party's conduct in asserting the claim was
objectively unreasonable. [Citation.] A claim is objectively unreasonable if
‘any reasonable attorney would agree that [it] is totally and completely
without merit.’ [Citations.]” (Id.) No showing of bad faith is required.
(In re Marriage of Reese & Guy (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1221.)¿ 
II.        Request for Judicial Notice 
 
The Court may
take judicial notice of records of any court of record of the United States.
(Evid. Code, § 452(d)(2).) However, the court may only judicially notice the
existence of the record, not that its contents are the truth. (Sosinsky v.
Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.) 
 
Defendants request
judicial notice of the following: 
 
1)    
The initial Complaint in this action,
filed on August 24, 2023, in the matter entitled Holy Oil Partnerships v.
Stephen Hightower, et al. (Los Angeles Superior Court Case No.
23STCV20381), a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit
A.
 
2)    
The First Amended Complaint in this
action, filed on March 1, 2024, in the above-referenced matter, a true and
correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
 
3)    
The Demurrer to Plaintiffs’ First
Amended Complaint in this action, filed on April 1, 2024, in the
above-referenced matter, a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as
Exhibit C.
 
Defendants’ request
for judicial notice is granted. 
 
III.      Discussion
 
Defendants move for
terminating sanctions on the basis that the causes of action asserted in the
FAC are brought for an improper purpose, are completely frivolous, and lack
evidentiary support in violation of CCP § 128.7. Defendants request that the
following sanctions be imposed: 
 
1)    
Terminating sanctions, i.e., an order
dismissing this action in its entirety;
 
2)    
Monetary sanctions sufficient to
reimburse Defendants for all attorneys’ fees and costs incurred as a direct
result of defending this action, i.e., an amount presently equivalent to
$38,122; and
 
3)    
Any other order that the Court deems
proper.
 
The court denies
Defendants’ Motion because the Motion is the equivalent of requesting that
Plaintiff prove the facts of its case at the pleading stage. "Whether
the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling
upon the demurrer." (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.) Discovery in this action has not been completed.
Plaintiff may still prevail on its claims such that it would be premature for
the court to rule that this action lacks merit without allowing Plaintiff to
conduct discovery. 
 
Furthermore, Defendants’ Motion
reiterates points already raised in their demurrer. “The
hearing on demurrer may not be turned into a contested evidentiary hearing
through the guise of having the court take judicial notice of affidavits,
declarations, depositions, and other such material which was filed on behalf of
the adverse party and which purports to contradict the allegations and
contentions of the plaintiff.” (Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials
Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 605.) 
 
As Defendants’ Motion
for Sanctions is premature, the Motion is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’ demurrer to the first,
second, third, and sixth causes of action are sustained with leave to amend and
overruled as to the fourth and fifth causes of action. Defendants’ Motion for
Sanctions is denied. Plaintiff is granted 30 days leave to amend. The court
sets a Non-Appearance OSC RE: Amended Complaint for July 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
Defendants to give notice.
