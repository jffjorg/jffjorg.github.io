And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the City of Los Angeles' motion for summary judgment or adjudication in this case. The case involves allegations of disability discrimination, retaliation, and harassment against Lee Newson, who was a police officer with the LAPD. The City argues that Lee Newson has not presented sufficient evidence to support his claims, but the judge finds that there are material disputes of fact that preclude summary adjudication.

The judge notes that Lee Newson has presented evidence that he was prevented from promotion to detective due to his disabilities, and that he was falsely accused of DUI and arrested. The judge also finds that there is evidence that Lee Newson's supervisor, Lt. Rippe, harbored discriminatory animus against him and was involved in the investigation and arrest.

The judge concludes that the City's motion for summary judgment or adjudication is denied, and that the case will proceed to trial.
