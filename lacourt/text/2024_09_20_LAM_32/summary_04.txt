Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions for attorney's fees filed by both parties. The court has determined that the contractual provision allowing for the recovery of reasonable attorney's fees and costs in arbitration does not apply to the proceedings at issue, which pertained to the plaintiff's declaratory relief claim. The court has also determined that there is no statutory basis for the recovery of attorney's fees. Therefore, neither party is entitled to attorney's fees, and the motions for attorney's fees are denied.
