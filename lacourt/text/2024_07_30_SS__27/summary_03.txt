(Frank E. Beckett Co. v. Bobbitt)
  - "Under the mandatory relief provision, on the other hand, upon a showing by attorney declaration of 'mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect,' the court shall vacate any 'resulting default judgment or dismissal entered.'" (Luri v. Greenwald)
  - "The Court is not persuaded that an email forwarding error led to Plaintiff's nonappearance at the trial in December 2023."
  - "What appears more plausible is Plaintiff's assertion that the case was dismissed due to Plaintiff's counsel's inadvertence to calendar the trial date."
```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case and has also denied the motion for substitution under CCP § 377.11. The judge is not convinced that the email forwarding error was the cause of the plaintiff's nonappearance at the trial in December 2023. Instead, the judge finds that the plaintiff's counsel's failure to calendar the trial date was the more plausible explanation for the dismissal. The judge notes that there was no declaration from any attorney or individual attesting to their mistake or inadvertence in failing to properly calendar the trial date, which led to the dismissal of the case. Therefore, the motion fails because there is no declaration from any attorney or individual attesting to their fault that led to the dismissal.
