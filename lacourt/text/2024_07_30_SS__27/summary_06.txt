And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the motion to be relieved as counsel by Khashayar Eshragi, the plaintiff's counsel. Eshragi has cited an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship as the reason for his request. Although the judge finds this to be proper grounds for withdrawal, the motion is continued to August ___, 2024, at 1:30 p.m., because the next hearing is only one day away and would be insufficient time for the plaintiff to retain new counsel. The judge notes that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship would be prejudicial or disrupt the orderly process of justice if Eshragi were to withdraw at this time. Eshragi is instructed to give notice of the continuance to the plaintiff.
