And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena without prejudice. The defendant served the subpoena on witness Yair Morales on May 7, 2024, and confirmed his attendance for the scheduled deposition on May 13, 2024. However, Morales failed to attend the deposition and the defendant did not receive any responses to its attempts to contact him. The Court finds that the defendant did not properly serve notice and motion on Morales, as required by California Rules of Court Rule 3.1346, and therefore denies the motion. The parties must submit to this tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument on July 30, 2024.
