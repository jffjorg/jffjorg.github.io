**Background**

* On September 7, 2023, the plaintiff filed a wrongful death complaint against the defendants.
* On June 24, 2024, General Motors LLC filed a motion to transfer venue to the Superior Court of California, Riverside.

**Legal Standard**

* In a personal injury case, the superior court in either the county where the injury occurs or the county where defendants reside at the commencement of the action is the proper court for the trial of the action. (Code Civ. Proc., ยง 395, subd. (a).)
* Code of Civil Procedure Section 396b provides that an action may be tried in the court where commenced, unless the defendant files a notice of motion for an order transferring the action or proceeding to the proper court. (Code Civ. Proc. ยง 396b, subd. (a).)

**Analysis**

* The court finds that the motion to transfer venue is premature because General Motors LLC has not yet filed an answer to the complaint.
* The court also finds that the moving party failed to establish that the convenience of witnesses is a ground for an order granting a change of venue.
* The court concludes that the motion to transfer venue is denied without prejudice.
