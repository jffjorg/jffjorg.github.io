The Defendant failed to provide responses to the requests by the statutory due date, despite being given an opportunity to do so. The Judge finds that the Defendant has been purposefully evading discovery and refusing to participate in the litigation. As a result, the Judge has ordered the Defendant to pay $500 in sanctions to the Plaintiff within 30 days. The Judge notes that sanctions are intended to compensate the Plaintiff's attorney for the time and effort expended to file the motion to seek compliance.
