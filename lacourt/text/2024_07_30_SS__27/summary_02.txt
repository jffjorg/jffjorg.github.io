And here is the summary in English text:

The Hon. Lee S. Arian, Judge of the Superior Court of California, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to continue the trial date in the case of Maria Angelica Amaral, et al. vs. Douglas James Westhoff, et al. (Case No. 22STCV19288). The motion was filed by the defendants, who are seeking to continue the trial date to May 1, 2025, due to the substitution of counsel and the need for additional time to review discovery responses, develop a trial strategy, file a motion for summary judgment, and conduct further discovery.

The plaintiff has opposed the motion, arguing that the defendants have already conducted extensive discovery and are seeking a continuance solely to file a motion for summary judgment. The court has considered the factors set forth in California Rule of Court 3.1332(c) and (d), including the proximity of the trial date, the length of the continuance requested, and the prejudice that parties or witnesses may suffer as a result of the continuance.

The court has tentatively ruled that it will hear argument on the motion to continue the trial, but has expressed reservations about the proposed 10-month continuance, finding it to be excessive. The court has directed the parties to address several considerations, including the substitution of counsel, the extent of discovery that has already occurred, the remaining time before trial, and the potential prejudice to the parties or witnesses.
