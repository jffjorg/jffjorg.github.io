  Case Number:  23LBCV00491    Hearing Date:   October 22, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.     Background Facts
Plaintiff Cary Atwood sued defendants Allyn Emery and Loma Law Group,
APC on March 15, 2023. She filed her operative second amended complaint (“SAC”)
on April 15, 2024, following Defendants’ successful demurrer. The SAC asserts
claims for breach of contract and quantum meruit. Plaintiff alleges she and
Defendants executed a contract whereby she, through her wholly-owned North
Carolina corporation, would “generate[ ] legal cases from which defendants
earned fees[,] but defendants breached the contract by failing and refusing to
pay [her].” (SAC, ¶ 4.)
On October 4, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel John P. Blumberg (“Counsel”)
moved to be relieved. 
Plaintiff filed an opposition to
her counsel’s motion on October 7, 2024.
 
2.     Motion to be Relieved as Counsel
The court has
discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be
granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal. App.
2d 398.) California Rule of Court 3.1362 prescribes the procedure that an
attorney must follow when the attorney moves to withdraw.
Counsel has
complied with Rule 3.1362 by giving proper notice to his client at her last
known address after confirming by email. Notice was clearly received, given
Plaintiff’s opposition. Counsel filed the proper forms – although he has
erroneously identified a trial date in March 2024, rather than March 2025, and
corrected filings will be necessary before his motion is granted.
As for
prejudice and orderly process: Counsel attests to “irreconcilable differences …
preventing the continuation of the attorney-client relationship.” (MC-052, ¶
2.) Plaintiff’s opposition, however, raises questions regarding the source of
Counsel’s differences with his clients and prejudice that might follow from
Counsel’s withdrawal. The matter requires further examination before Counsel’s
motion is granted.
 
3.     Order
The Court
orders Plaintiff and Counsel to appear at the hearing on October 22, 2024. The
Court will conduct an in camera discussion if appropriate and determine
whether withdrawal will be granted.
Counsel is
ordered to give notice to all parties and to Plaintiff.
