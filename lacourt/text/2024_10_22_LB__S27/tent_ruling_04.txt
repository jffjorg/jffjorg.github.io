Samuel Kupau (“Petitioner”) petitioned the Court to open a file and establish
jurisdiction over his underinsured motorist (“UIM”) arbitration with his
insurer, respondent CSAA Insurance Exchange (“Respondent”). On September 10,

b.     Legal
Standard
Insurance Code
section 11580.2 establishes certain rules governing uninsured and underinsured
motor vehicle insurance policies. Subdivision (f) of section 11580.2 requires
that “the determination as to whether the insured shall be legally entitled to
recover damages ... shall be made by agreement between the insured and the
insurer or, in the event of disagreement, by arbitration.” The provisions of
section 11580.2 are deemed to be a part of every uninsured motorist policy.
(See Quintano v. Mercury Casualty Co. (1995) 11 Cal.4th 1049, 1053; Harford
Fire Insurance Co. v. Macri (1992) 4 Cal.4th 318, 324; Travelers
Indemnity Co. v. Kowalski (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 607, 609.)  
A
petition for discovery under Insurance Code section 11580.2, subdivision (f)(2)
is not a civil case, but a special/civil petition. (See Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 1.6(5); CCP Sec. 23.) Special proceedings are created by statute to obtain
special relief. (City of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2017) 9
Cal.App.5th 272, 285.)¿
 
c.
Merits
“If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party
under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it ... , the
party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent's
attendance and testimony... .”  (Code
Civ. Proc., §2025.450(a).)
            “A motion
under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of the following: (1) The motion
shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. (2) The motion shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent
fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.”  (Id.,
§2025.450(b).)
Petitioner
has not offered any specific facts that demonstrate good cause for Respondent
to produce its PMQ. Petitioner’s deposition notice is overbroad. (See Mot.,
Exh. B [intent to examine PMQ on “matters [for examination] including, but not
limited to Respondent’s investigation”; individually demanding production of “ALL
WRITINGS which evidence” each of Respondent’s contentions in arbitration.) It
also seeks information already in Petitioner’s possession or which can easily
be sought via a simple request for production of documents. (See id. [demanding
a copy of Petitioner’s insurance policy].) And, as Respondent points out, the
deposition’s subject matter necessarily overlaps heavily with privileged
material. (See id., Att. 4 [“including, but not limited to, Respondent’s
investigation”].)
Petitioner
argues “Respondent cannot dictate [Petitioner’s] Discovery method” because
Petitioner has his choice of methods under the Civil Discovery Act. (Mot.,
8:16-17.) In the abstract, this is correct. But the Discovery Act also requires
Petitioner to show good cause before the Court may grant his motion. He has
not.
 
3.     Conclusion
Petitioner’s motion is denied.
Moving Petitioner is ordered to
give notice.
