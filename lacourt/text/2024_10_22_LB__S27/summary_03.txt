And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for sanctions in the amount of $6,124.00, which includes $3,220.00 in RPDs and $2,904.00 in attorney's fees. The judge finds that the defendant failed to respond to the plaintiff's discovery requests and waived its objections. The judge also declines to treat the plaintiff's motion as a motion to compel further responses to discovery, as the parties' in-court stipulations to meet and confer are considered stipulations to extend the discovery motion deadline. The judge orders the defendant to pay the sanctions within 15 days of the order and grants the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to discovery. The judge also notes that the parties' continued improper assertion of waived objections will be considered in future sanctions orders if necessary.
