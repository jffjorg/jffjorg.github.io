And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is in regards to a petition filed by Samuel Kupau to open a file and establish jurisdiction over his underinsured motorist (UIM) arbitration with his insurer, CSAA Insurance Exchange. The petition seeks to compel CSAA Insurance Exchange to produce its Person Most Qualified (PMQ) for deposition. However, the Court finds that Petitioner has not demonstrated good cause for Respondent to produce its PMQ, as the deposition notice is overbroad and seeks information already in Petitioner's possession or which can easily be sought via a simple request for production of documents. The Court also finds that the deposition's subject matter necessarily overlaps heavily with privileged material. Therefore, the Court denies Petitioner's motion to compel deposition.
