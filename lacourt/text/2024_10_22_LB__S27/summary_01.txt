The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion by Counsel, John P. Blumberg, to be relieved from representing Plaintiff, Cary Atwood.

The judge orders the parties to appear at a hearing on October 22, 2024, and will conduct an in-camera discussion to determine whether Counsel's motion will be granted.
