And here is the English summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Kyle Dou's motion to set aside the default judgment. The motion was filed after the six-month period allowed for seeking relief under California Code of Civil Procedure, section 473. However, the Court exercises its discretion to grant the motion, citing the strong public policy in favor of resolving cases on the merits. The Court notes that Dou attempted to demur to the Complaint but was unable to do so in a timely manner due to an insufficient filing fee. The Court also notes that Dou timely filed the present motion. Therefore, the Court grants Dou's request to vacate the entry of default and allows the proposed answer attached to Dou's declaration to be filed separately forthwith.
