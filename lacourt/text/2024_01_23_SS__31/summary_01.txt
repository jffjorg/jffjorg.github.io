And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of Colonnade Wilshire Corporation with prejudice. The plaintiff had previously sought to set aside the dismissal, but the court denied that motion on June 7, 2023. The plaintiff has filed new proof of service, but has not demonstrated that Colonnade was properly served. The court finds that Colonnade would be greatly prejudiced if the dismissal was set aside, as the case is already over 5 years old and a jury trial is scheduled to commence on January 24, 2024. The court also denies the plaintiff's request to set aside a $400 discovery sanction, as the plaintiff did not provide a rationale for this request.
