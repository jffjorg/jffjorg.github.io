And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the petition to approve a compromise of a pending action of a minor. The petition was filed on November 6, 2023, and seeks to approve a settlement agreement between the plaintiff, MARIO MOLINA-GUZMAN, and the defendants, including MICHAEL WILLIAM RICHTER ET AL. The settlement agreement provides for a total payment of $100,000, with $17,700 allocated for medical expenses, $33,000 for attorneys' fees, and $11,801.51 for costs. The net balance of $37,498.49 would be deposited into a blocked account.

However, the judge has denied the petition due to non-compliance with MC-350 requirements. Specifically, the petition failed to provide a copy of any doctor's report containing a diagnosis of the claimant's injuries or a prognosis for the claimant's recovery, a report of the claimant's current condition, and a copy of the written attorney fee agreement. The court has ordered the petitioner to file a new petition curing these defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.
