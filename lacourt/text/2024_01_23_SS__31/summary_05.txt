This tentative ruling is related to a petition to approve a compromise of a pending action of a minor, Orlandus Anderson, who is 41 years old. The petition was filed by Linda Gable, the parent and guardian ad litem with limited conservatorship. The Court has reviewed the settlement agreement between the Plaintiffs and Defendants, which will result in a total payment of $35,000, with $13,000 going to Orlandus Anderson.
