Background Plaintiff Mary Lim (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on October 23, 2018. The complaint alleges that on April 30, 2018, Plaintiff sustained injury while walking on a driveway near Serrano and 6th Street in Los Angeles because of an unsafe condition. Plaintiff sets forth a cause of action for premises liability against Defendants City of Los Angeles and Colonnade Wilshire Corporation (“Colonnade”).   On December 20, 2021, an Order of Dismissal was entered as to Colonnade, because Plaintiff failed to file proof of service.  Plaintiff once more seeks to set aside the dismissal of Colonnade, which the Court previously denied on June 7, 2023.   II. Discussion CCP §473(b) provides, in pertinent part: The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief … shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. … Under CCP § 473, the moving party bears the burden of demonstrating an excusable ground, such as fraud or mistake, justifying a court’s vacating a judgment.  (Basinger v. Roger & Wells (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 16, 23-24.) In determining the merits of a Code of Civil Procedure section 473 motion, the court should take into account the circumstances of the case and the prejudice, if any, to the parties. (See Martin v. Cook (1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 799, 807-808 [137 Cal.Rptr. 434]; Karlein v. Karlein (1951) 103 Cal.App.3d 496, 498 [229 P.2d 831]. Here, Plaintiff previously sought to set aside the dismissal of Colonnade on March 24, 2023, which the Court denied on June 7, 2023. The duplicative proofs of service filed thereafter, on November 27, 2023 and November 30, 2023, provide that Plaintiff served Wayne Morgan at Hanover Insurance Company (“Hanover”), the insurer for Colonnade. According to Hanover’s letter response to Plaintiff, Hanover advised Plaintiff that it is not authorized to accept service of process on behalf of Colonnade. To date, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that Colonnade has been properly served with the summons and complaint. Further, it is now over 2 years since the dismissal of Colonnade. Considering the length of time that has passed since the dismissal, the age of this case being now over 5 years old, and jury trial to commence on January 24, 2024 (just one day after the hearing on this motion), Colonnade would be greatly prejudiced if the dismissal was set aside.  Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to set aside the dismissal is denied with prejudice. Lastly, Plaintiff appears to also request that a $400 discovery sanction be set aside. However, Plaintiff provides no rationale for this request, and it is thus denied.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 22nd day of January 2024      Hon.
