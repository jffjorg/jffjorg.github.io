And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the unopposed motion to continue the trial date from May 17, 2024 to a date no earlier than December 9, 2024. The motion was brought by Defendant FSP - South Flower Street Associates, which requests the continuance to allow its motion for summary judgment to be heard prior to trial. The Plaintiff, Noli Alberto, has dismissed several defendants, and no opposition was filed to the motion. The Court considered the factors for granting a trial continuance, including the proximity of the trial date, the length of the requested continuance, and the availability of alternative means to address the problem. The Court found that FSP establishes good cause for the continuance and granted the motion. The trial date is continued to a new date, and all discovery and expert cutoff dates are continued to reflect the new trial date.
