And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling addresses the Defendant's motion to compel further discovery responses from the Plaintiff. The Defendant moves the Court to order the Plaintiff to provide further responses to the Defendant's request for production of documents and special interrogatories. However, the Court finds that the Defendant's motions are premature and must be continued to a new date because the Defendant did not schedule an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) prior to filing her motions. The Court orders the parties to participate in an IDC to resolve outstanding discovery issues and to file a joint statement of items in dispute if they are unable to resolve all outstanding issues. The Court encourages the parties to meet and confer to resolve the issues and to submit a joint statement of items in dispute if necessary.
