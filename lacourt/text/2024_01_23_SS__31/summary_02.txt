And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Farhad Nazarian's first request for default judgment against Defendant Johari Mohsen. The reason for the denial is that Plaintiff obtained Defendant's default on January 22, 2021, but served the summons and statement of damages on Defendant via publication on April 16, 2023, and later dates. This notice was provided after entry of default, and the initial proof of service of the Statement of Damages by mail on November 23, 2022 constitutes improper notice. The judge finds that the entry of default was erroneously obtained because a plaintiff must serve a statement of damages setting forth the nature and amount of damages to be sought before default may be taken. The judge has rendered the January 22, 2021 default void and ordered Plaintiff to obtain new entry of default. Additionally, the judge requires Plaintiff to provide evidence of all costs sought, and documents in support of general damages, and to use updated forms in preparing the new default judgment package.
