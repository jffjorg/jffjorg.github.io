The Court found that Plaintiff's motion does not comply with California Rule of Court 3.1324, which requires a copy of the proposed amendment, a statement of what allegations are proposed to be deleted or added, and a separate declaration specifying the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the new allegations were discovered, and why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The Court also noted that Defendant Nationstar Mortgage, LLC opposed the motion on the grounds that the First Amended/Supplemental Complaint is substantively defective. The Court denied the motion without prejudice to a procedurally proper motion for leave to file an amended or supplemental complaint.
