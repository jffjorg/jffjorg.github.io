STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for collection on a mortgage secured by a parcel of
real property. 
 
Plaintiff moves for appointment of
a receiver over the assets of Defendant 1775 Beloit, LLC. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion for Appointment of Receiver is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiff moves for appointment of
a receiver over the assets of Defendant 1775 Beloit, LLC. 
 
Service on Parties
 
            Plaintiff
did not file proof of service with this motion. Four Defendants: 1775 Beloit,
LLC, Adam GTS 2018 LLC, Alan GTS 2018 LLC, and Alexander GTS 2018 LLC were
defaulted on March 15, 2024. With respect to the remaining Defendants, consisting
of Alan, Adam, and Alexander Shekhter, and their associated Generational Trusts
Dated December 3, 2018, Plaintiff filed proofs of service on January 24, 2024
stating that these Defendants had been served with process on January 22, 2024
by substituted service. (See January 24, 2024 Proofs of Service.) Now, however,
Plaintiff contends that it was not successful in serving these Defendants
because they no longer live or conduct business at that address. (Declaration
of Claudia M. Coleman ISO Mot. ¶ 8.) Plaintiff states that it has discovered
Defendants live or conduct business in locations which are gated, preventing
Plaintiff’s process servers from reaching the individual Defendants to effect
service. (Id.) Thus, Plaintiff did not file a proof of service with this
motion because all other parties in the action have either not yet been served
with process or have been defaulted. As the party targeted for receivership,
1775 Beloit, LLC, has been defaulted, the Court will therefore consider the
motion on its merits, notwithstanding the absence of proof of service. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 564 provides that “[a] receiver may be
appointed, in the manner provided in this chapter, by the court in which an
action or proceeding is pending in any case in which the court is empowered by
law to appoint a receiver.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 564(a).)  Subdivision (b) of
section 564 lists the circumstances under which a receiver may be appointed,
including, inter alia, upon application of a party whose has a probable right
or interest in the property and where it is shown that the property is in
danger of being lost, removed, or injured, or where it is otherwise necessary
to protect the property or rights of any party. (Code Civ. Proc. § 564(b)(1),
(3), (9).)  after a judgment to enforce
the judgment.  (Id., § 564(b).) 
 
Analysis
 
            Plaintiff
seeks an order appointing a receiver with respect to the assets of Defendant
1775 Beloit, LLC to manage the dealings of the LLC and preserve the value of
the property secured as collateral for the Promissory Note at issue in this
case. 
 
            Defendant
1775 Beloit, LLC entered into a Construction Loan Agreement with Plaintiff’s
predecessor in interest on September 29, 2020 for the principal sum of
$15,254,000 plus interest for the construction and improvement of a 16-unit
multifamily development located at 1775 Beloit Ave, Los Angeles, California.
(Complaint ¶¶16-21, Exhs. 1-6.) Plaintiff’s predecessor in interest, First
Choice Bank, obtained a security interest in the development in exchange for
that loan. (Id.) First Choice Bank merged with Plaintiff on January 22,
2021. (Complaint ¶ 3; see also Declaration of Jon Hustedt ISO Mot. ¶ 3, Exh.
A.) Plaintiff contends that although the total balance on the loan as of
January 3, 2024 was $16,055,356.92, the property, as of March 14, 2024, is
valued between $7 million and $9 million, compared to its 2020 appraised value
of $22.2 million. (Hustedt Dec. ¶¶ 21-2, Exhs. B-C.) Plaintiff also contends
that, as of February 1, 2024, only four tenants were occupying the property and
paying rent for only 4 units out of 48 rental units, bringing in only $7,229 in
rent out of an anticipated total of $176,336.57. (Id. ¶ 25.) Plaintiff
has thus demonstrated that the value of the collateral is rapidly declining, and
that receivership is appropriate to manage the LLC’s assets and prevent a
further loss in value. 
 
            Plaintiff
offers Stephen J. Donell, President of FedReceiver, Inc., as a candidate for
receiver. Mr. Donell has provided his curriculum vitae and attests to his
experience as a receiver in other actions and his experience in residential
real estate. (Declaration of Stephen J. Donell ISO Mot. ¶¶ 2-5, Exh. 1.) Mr.
Donell also declares that he has no interest in this action, no relation to any
judge of the court, and has no contract, agreement, or understanding with any
party regarding the administration of the receivership estate. (Id. ¶¶
7-8.) Mr. Donell has attached a copy of his fee schedule. (Id. ¶ 11,
Exh. 2.) After reviewing Plaintiff’s filings, the Court finds Stephen J. Donell
to be an appropriate choice for receiver in this matter. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion for Appointment of Receiver is GRANTED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
