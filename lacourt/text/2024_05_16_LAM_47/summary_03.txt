And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to quash service of summons, finding that the plaintiff's attempt to serve process was not proper. The plaintiff's process server attempted to serve the defendant at 208 W 48th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90037, but the defendant does not reside at that address and does not receive mail there. The judge finds that service by posting is not proper except in an unlawful detainer action, and that the plaintiff's attempt to serve by posting and mailing documents was not sufficient. The judge also finds that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish personal jurisdiction over the defendant. As a result, the judge grants the defendant's motion to quash service of summons.
