effect proper service. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Specially
Appearing Defendant’s Motion to Quash Service of Summon is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Specially Appearing Defendant  Gregory Bass (“Defendant”) moves to quash
service of the Summons and Complaint for failure to effect proper service. 
 
//
 
//
Missing Proof of Service
 
            As an
initial matter, no proof of service accompanied Defendant’s moving papers. Nonetheless,
Plaintiffs substantively responded to the motion and do not object to the
motion as improperly served. The Court will therefore overlook this deficiency
and address the motion on the merits. 
 
Special Appearance 
 
No motion under Code of Civil Procedure 418.10 “shall be
deemed a general appearance by the defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 418.10(d).)
Here, Specially Appearing Defendant (“Defendant”) brought this motion under
section 418.10. Thus, filing this motion does not constitute a general
appearance.  
 
Legal Standard
 
On a motion to quash service of the summons and
complaint, the moving party must first present some admissible evidence, such
as declarations or affidavits, to place the issue of minimum contacts before
the Court. (School Dist. of Oskaloosa County v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1126, 1131.) “When a motion to quash is
properly brought, the burden of proof is placed upon the plaintiff to establish
the facts of jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.”  (Aquila, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 556, 568; see also Elkman v. National States Ins. Co. (2009)
173 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1312-13 [“Where a nonresident defendant challenges
jurisdiction by way of a motion to quash, the plaintiff bears the burden of
establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that minimum contacts exist
between the defendant and the forum state to justify imposition of personal
jurisdiction.”].) Evidence of the facts giving rise to personal jurisdiction or
their absence may be in the form of declarations. (Arensen v. Raymond Lee
Organization, Inc. (1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 991, 995.) The Court should
exclude evidence that would be inadmissible at trial. (See, e.g., Judd v.
Superior Court (1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 38, 43-44 [Court of Appeal excluded
inadmissible hearsay evidence offered in support of affirmation of trial
court’s denial of motion to quash, and subsequently reversed the trial court’s
denial].) A non-resident defendant may be subject to either general or specific
jurisdiction. (See Elkman v. National States Insurance Co., supra, 173
Cal.App.4th at 1314.) 
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant
moves to quash service of the Summons and Complaint on the ground that service
of process was not properly made. On April 5, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a “Declaration
of Reasonable Diligence” stating that Plaintiffs’ process server attempted to serve
Defendant at 208 W 48th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90037 on March 13,
14, 23, and 26, 2024, and then on April 2, 2024, but received no answer on any
of those dates. (Defendant’s Exh. 1. p.1.) The process server then “proceeded
to post the documents” at the address on April 2. (Id.) The documents
were then mailed to the same address on April 3, 2024. (Id. p.3.) Defendant
argues that service was not proper because, first, service by posting and
mailing is not proper except in an unlawful detainer action, and, second, Defendant
resides in Las Vegas and does not receive mail at the 208 W 48th Street
address. (Declaration of Gregory Bass ISO Mot. ¶¶4-7.) 
 
            In
response, Plaintiffs assert, without explanation or citation to authority, that
service was adequate and that Defendant Bass has been evading service. The
Court is not persuaded. Contrary to Plaintiffs’ claims, service by posting
is not proper service except in an unlawful detainer action, pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 415.45. Section 415.20, cited by Plaintiffs, instead
contemplates substituted service, and requires leaving a copy of the
documents with a person over the age of 18 who is a member of the household or
apparently in charge of the office, place of business, or usual mailing address.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 415.20(b).) Further, although service by mail is authorized
under section 415.30, Plaintiffs offer no evidence that contradicts the sworn
declaration that Defendant does not reside at the address where service was
attempted and does not receive mail at that address. Mere citation to the
Declaration of Diligence and proof of service is not sufficient. Defendant has
demonstrated that Plaintiffs did not properly effect service of process upon
him. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Specially Appearing Defendant’s Motion to Quash Service of Summon is GRANTED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
