And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for protective order and a request for monetary sanctions in a case involving a slip and fall incident at a Walgreen Co. store. The plaintiff, Nichell Morgan, propounded 127 special interrogatories on the defendant, Walgreen Co., but the defendant argued that this was excessive and asked the court to limit the number of interrogatories to 35. The court granted the motion for protective order, limiting the number of special interrogatories to 35, and denied the request for monetary sanctions. The court found that the plaintiff's declaration supporting the propounding of special interrogatories was insufficient and that the proposed sanctions were excessive. The court ordered Walgreen Co. to give notice of the protective order.
