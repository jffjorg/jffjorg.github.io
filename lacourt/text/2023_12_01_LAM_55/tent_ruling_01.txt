  Case Number:  21STCV40818    Hearing Date:   December 1, 2023    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Plaintiff’s Petition To Confirm Arbitration
Award.
 
The petition is granted only as to confirming the
award exactly as written without any changes, post-award/pre-judgment interest in
the sum of $9,770.15, and attorneys’ fees in the amounts of $425,000.00 awarded
by the arbitrator plus $3,600.00 awarded by the Court as to the instant
Petition.
 
 
On 11/4/21, SCOTT GOLDSTONE  (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint alleging that defendants
and co-conspirators MICHAEL SCHNEIDER, LOUIE CASTRO, and ZAKARI KURTZ
(“defendants”), locked Plaintiff out of the Internet business selling sneakers,
which he founded. After Plaintiff dismissed Defendants Castro and Kurtz, Plaintiff
and Defendant Schneider proceeded to binding arbitration. 
Plaintiff  (“Petitioner”)
has filed a petition to confirm an arbitration award, on grounds including
these:  1) Petitioner should not be
precluded from enforcing his Arbitration Award against Respondent MICHAEL
SCHNEIDER (Respondent) for damages that the Arbitrator found that Respondent
caused;  2)  As to each cause of action asserted against Respondent,
the Arbitrator specifically found that Respondent defrauded
Petitioner, breached his fiduciary duty, and caused consequential damages;  3) Respondent attempts to mislead this Court
based on a single provision in the “Injunctive Relief” section of the Award;  Respondent misstates the exchange as to a proposed
stipulation for attorneys’ fees;  and
4)  the Award in no way limits Petitioner’s
ability to enforce his judgment. 
Respondent opposes the petition, for reasons including
the following:  1)  The Award does not expressly require that Respondent
personally pay damages to Petitioner;  2)
Petitioner proposed a stipulation that Respondent personally pay Petitioner $425,000
in prevailing party fees and costs, but Respondent rejected this proposal, and Petitioner
accepted Respondent’s stipulation that did not also require his damages payment;  3)  this
Court’s authority is limited to confirming the Award as a Judgment, and so it
should reject Petitioner’s proposed judgment and instead use Respondent’s;  4)  the
Award was issued 8/14/23 which means that JAMS Rules required Petitioner to
request clarification no later than 8/24/23 but he took no action.  
“[W]here parties have agreed their dispute will be
resolved by binding arbitration, judicial intervention is limited to reviewing
the award to see if statutory grounds for vacating or correcting the award
exist.”  Corona v. Amherst (2003)
107 Cal. App. 4th 701, 706.  Unless a
petition or response seeking to correct or vacate an arbitration award was
filed properly based upon valid grounds, or the proceeding is dismissed, courts
are required to enter judgment in conformity with the award.  Valsan Partners Ltd. Partnership v. Calcor
Space Facility (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.  “‘[T]he court shall confirm the award as made
…, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it
as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.’”  Law Offices of David S. Karton v. Segreto
(2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 1, 8.  Courts
cannot amend an arbitration award to include provisions that were not included
in the award as rendered.   Valsan,
supra, at 819 (court improperly amended award to state a certain sum of
damages).  A court’s judgment may not go
beyond the boundaries of an arbitration award, but instead the judgment must be
inconformity with the award.  Ibid.
Any arbitrator’s amendment to a final arbitration
award must be made within the statutory 10 days.  Karton, 176 Cal.App.4th at 5. “[A]rbitrators,
not judges, should resolve any doubts or disputes concerning the award….”  Ajida Techs. v. Roos Instruments
(2001) 87 Cal. App. 4th 534, 550.  Accord 
Ajida Technologies, Inc. v. Roos Instruments, Inc. (2001) 87
Cal.App.4th 534, 550.
Petitioner seeks confirmation of the arbitration award
but also wants to modify some of the Award’s language such that Petitioner “shall
recover” the entire amount of the award from Respondent, which is not how the
damages award is phrased in the final award. The case cites above make clear,
however, that arbitration awards only can be confirmed as made. The final award
language therefore controls.
Further, the Arbitrator already ruled on the
attorneys’ fees stipulation, awarding $425,000.00 in attorneys’ fees. (Sean M.
Kneafsey decl., filed 9/5/23, ex. 10 (Final Award), p. 29).  Courts cannot revise unclear stipulations that
the parties are disputing in the opposing objection document and reply.  “It is up to the parties to state a
stipulation clearly and properly if they intend to be bound by it.” Bemer v.
Bemer (1957) 152 Cal. App. 2d 766, 771-72. 
“Unless it is clear from the record that both parties assented, there is
no stipulation.”  Sarracino v. Sup. Ct.
(1974) 13 Cal. 3d 1, 14.  “‘A stipulation
is an agreement between counsel with respect to business before a
court….’”  Harris v. Spinali Auto
Sales, Inc. (1966) 240 Cal. App. 2d 447, 452.  An essential requirement of settlement
agreements is evidence showing the parties’ manifestation of mutual, objective
assent, to the same thing.  Estate of
Thottam (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1331, 1340. 

The Court grants the Petition’s request for $3,600.00
in attorneys’ fees associated with the Petition.  The Arbitration Award already addressed other
attorneys’ fees, stating: “Pursuant to the Stipulation of the Parties,
Goldstone is entitled to attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of
$425,000.00.”  (Sean M. Kneafsey decl.,
filed 9/5/23, ex. 10 (Final Award), p. 29.)   Arbitrators have the jurisdiction to award
attorneys’ fees in connection with the arbitration.  Only a court may award attorneys’ fees, and
costs incurred in relation to statutorily authorized judicial proceedings
regarding arbitration, and the arbitrator makes the determination in connection
with the arbitration proceedings. Corona v. Amherst (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 701, 707;  DiMarco v. 
Chaney (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1809, 1816-17;  Carole Ring & Assocs. v. Nicastro
(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 253, 260-62; 
Ajida Technologies, Inc. v. Roos Instruments, Inc. (2001) 87 Cal.
App 4th 534, 552 n. 11. 
Also, the Petition’s request for pre-judgment interest
of $9,770.15 is granted because the arbitrator did not already address
that.  Trial courts are required to award
post-award, pre-judgment interest, running from the date of the award, because
the award is a fixed liability, unless the arbitrator already decided the
question.  E.g., Pierotti v. Torian 
(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 17, 27-28 (citing CC §3287(a)).  
 
Conclusion
Given the clear law set forth above, the Court will
grant the motion by confirming the arbitration award as made.  (See Sean M. Kneafsey decl., filed 9/5/23,
ex. 10 (Final Award), pp. 30-31), plus awarding $3,600 attorneys’ fees
associated with the Petition (in addition to the fees awarded by the arbitrator),
and $9,770.15 as prejudgment interest (ex. 14).
