And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the petition to confirm the arbitration award, but only to the extent that it confirms the award exactly as written without any changes. The judge also awards additional attorneys' fees in the amount of $3,600.00 and pre-judgment interest in the amount of $9,770.15. The judge rejects the plaintiff's request to modify the language of the arbitration award and instead confirms the award as made. The judge also rejects the defendant's attempt to mislead the court by misstating the exchange regarding the proposed stipulation for attorneys' fees. The ruling is based on the clear law set forth in various California court cases, including Corona v. Amherst, Valsan Partners Ltd. Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, and Ajida Techs. v. Roos Instruments.
