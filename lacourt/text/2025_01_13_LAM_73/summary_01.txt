And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendants, R.I.C.H. Management Group, LLC, and Kenneth Randolph. The plaintiff, Angelica Lassiter, alleges that the defendants breached a contract and owe her $66,000, plus interest and costs. The plaintiff has filed several requests for default judgment, but this latest request has been denied due to the plaintiff's failure to provide a summary of the case, declarations or other evidence in support of the judgment, and a calculation of the damages. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to provide these materials before the hearing date of January 13, 2025.
