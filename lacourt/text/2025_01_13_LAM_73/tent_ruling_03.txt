REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT (filed 11/25/2024) 
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is granted.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff
Mingzhe Zhao (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Mi Ni Fashion,
Inc., Hyun S. Lee, Young Mi Lee, and Does 1 to 10 (collectively “Defendants”)
on April 2, 2024. Plaintiff’s complaint alleges the following causes of action
against Defendants: (1) breach of written agreement; (2) goods sold and
delivered; (3) account stated; and (4) open book account; and (5) false
promises. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants are in breach of a contract for
purchase orders of clothing products in the amount of $535,320.35.
 
After
Defendants’ answers to Plaintiff’s complaint were stricken on October 3, 2024, Plaintiff
has attempted to obtain default judgment against Defendants a couple of times. Plaintiff’s
most recent requests for entry of default were filed on November 25, 2024. On
that date, Plaintiff filed requests for entry of default against Defendants Hyun
S. Lee, Mi In Fashion, Inc., and Young Mi Lee. Plaintiff also filed a request
for dismissal of the Does Defendants, a proposed judgment, summary of the case,
a declaration from Plaintiff’s attorney accounting for the requested attorney
fees, and a declaration from Plaintiff in support of the judgments with
attached exhibits. On December 11, 2024, a Case Management conference was held
and the Court scheduled the Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of Default for
January 13, 2025. Plaintiff was to submit a default judgment packet prior to
the continued hearing date of January 13, 2025. Plaintiff has not submitted a
default judgment packet since the Court requested one on December 11; however,
the paperwork filed by Plaintiff on November 25 appears to fulfill the
requirements for entry of default judgment.
