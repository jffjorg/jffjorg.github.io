Counsel for
Defendant: N/A
 
REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT (filed 12/09/2024) 
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is denied.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff
Angelica Lassiter (“Plaintiff”), in pro per, filed this action against
Defendants R.I.C.H. Management Group, LLC, and Kenneth Randolph (collectively
“Defendants”) on October 20, 2023. Plaintiff’s complaint alleges a breach of
contract cause of action against Defendants. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants
approached her for monies to complete a home renovation. The parties signed a
Promissory Note, and Plaintiff gave Defendants $30,000 that they were to pay back
with 10% of the $30,000 accruing in interest each month for the duration that
the funds were held. After the home was sold, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants
owed her a total of $66,000 but never paid it out to her and ceased all
communications with Plaintiff.
 
After
Defendants failed to answer Plaintiff’s complaint, Plaintiff has attempted to
obtain default judgment against Defendants several times. Recently, she filed a
request for default judgment on November 25, 2024, that was rejected due to
errors in the request. On December 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed another request for
entry of default that has not been rejected. On December 11, 2024, an Order to
Show Cause Re: Entry of Default was held and continued due to Plaintiff submitting
a corrected request for entry of default. Upon entry of default, Plaintiff was
to submit a default judgment packet prior to the continued hearing date of
January 13, 2025. As of January 8, 2025, Plaintiff has not done so.
