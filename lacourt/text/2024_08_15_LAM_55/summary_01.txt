And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of consolidating Case Number 22STCV17187 with Case Number 22TRCV00428 for all purposes. The two cases arise from the same helicopter accident on March 25, 2022, and involve identical affirmative claims, defenses, and cross-claims. The Judge finds that the cases involve common questions of law and fact, and that consolidating the cases will promote trial convenience and economy by avoiding duplication of procedure.

The Judge rejects Plaintiff Kristen Wallis's argument that the cases should not be consolidated because they involve different plaintiffs with different roles, and that consolidating the cases would produce jury confusion. Instead, the Judge finds that the cases can be consolidated without prejudice to a substantial right, and that consolidating the cases will avoid unnecessary costs and delays.

The Judge grants the motion to consolidate the two cases, finding that nearly identical issues of fact and law exist in both cases. The Judge also notes that the cases will require the use of the same evidence and that consolidating the cases will avoid the danger of inconsistent adjudications.
