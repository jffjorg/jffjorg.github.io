Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on Defendant Armen Ambarachyan's demurrer and motion to apply Ohio law. The demurrer is sustained as to the second and third causes of action, which allege violations of the Homeowner's Bill of Rights and quiet title. The judge finds that because the notice of default has been rescinded and no trustee's sale has taken place, there is no live controversy under HBOR for the court to adjudicate. The plaintiff's quiet title claim is also infirm because it is based on the allegedly void notice of default. The motion to apply Ohio law is denied. The judge notes that the plaintiff is a resident of California, not Ohio, and that the property at issue is not owner-occupied. The judge grants leave to amend the complaint as to the second and third causes of action.
