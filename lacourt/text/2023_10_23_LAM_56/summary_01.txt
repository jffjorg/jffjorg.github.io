And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Holly J. Fujie, has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Thomas Edward Waljeski's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Plaintiffs Richard Galvan and Paige Galvan. The motion is related to a lease and option to purchase agreement between the parties. The Court has considered the moving and opposition papers and has granted the motion, finding that Defendant Waljeski's motion is made in good faith. The Court notes that the purpose of the compulsory cross-complaint statute is to prevent piecemeal litigation and that courts liberally construe the statute to avoid forfeiture of causes of action. The Court also finds that Defendant Waljeski has provided sufficient evidence to support his motion, including his age and serious health problems, which prevented him from properly attending to his business affairs and timely providing his counsel with sufficient information to prepare a cross-complaint at the time the answer was filed. The Court orders Defendant Waljeski to file the cross-complaint within ten days of the date of the order.
