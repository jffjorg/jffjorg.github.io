Waljeski claims that he did not act in bad faith when he did not file a cross-complaint with his original answer, citing health issues and lack of access to counsel. Galvan and Galvan oppose the motion, alleging that Waljeski is attempting to delay the trial date and that he is not providing sufficient evidence to support his claims. The Judge has found that Waljeski has brought forth this motion in good faith and has granted the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint. Waljeski is ordered to file the cross-complaint within 10 days of the date of this order.
