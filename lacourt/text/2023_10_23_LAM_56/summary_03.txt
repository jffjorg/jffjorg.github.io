And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Sheldon's motion for a preliminary injunction to compel access to the condominium unit owned by Defendant Henriquez. The motion was filed due to alleged water damage to the unit caused by a burst pipe in a connected unit owned by Plaintiff Johnson. The judge found that there is a high probability that Defendant Johnson will prevail against Defendant Henriquez, who failed to have repairs done on her own unit, owns the unit that has caused damage to another unit, and refuses to grant Defendant Sheldon access to conduct the necessary repairs. The judge also found that if the injunction is not issued, Plaintiff Johnson will continue to suffer damage to her own unit. The judge ordered that the motion be granted and a mandatory preliminary injunction be issued to compel access to the condominium unit.
