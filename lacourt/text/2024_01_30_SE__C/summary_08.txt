And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Adam Agathakis vs. Daniel Joseph Botton, et al. The defendants have filed a demurrer, arguing that the plaintiff's failure to file a government claim with the City of Los Angeles bars the lawsuit. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff cannot file an amended complaint to address the defects in the current complaint.

The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the plaintiff's insurer, Garrison Property and Casualty Insurance Company, filed a claim with the City on February 18, 2022, seeking damages for property damages only. The City issued a draft payment for those damages on August 30, 2022. The plaintiff did not file a separate claim for medical damages, and the judge concludes that the claim for property damages does not preserve the plaintiff's right to sue for medical damages.

The judge's ruling is consistent with the purpose of the claims statutes, which are designed to provide public entities with sufficient information to investigate claims and settle them without the expense of litigation. In this case, the City was under no duty to investigate a claim for medical damages when Garrison only claimed property damages. By suing for medical damages, the plaintiff has frustrated the purpose of the claims statute and is barred from proceeding with the lawsuit.
