And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiffs' motion to set aside and vacate the order of dismissal. The motion was filed due to the plaintiffs' counsel's mistake and inadvertence in failing to appear at a case management conference, resulting in the entry of an order of dismissal. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have demonstrated mistake and inadvertence under CCP § 473(b) and that they have filed an amended motion with an accompanying amended complaint on January 26, 2024. Since the motion is unopposed, the judge grants the motion and orders the plaintiffs' amended complaint to be separately filed and served.
