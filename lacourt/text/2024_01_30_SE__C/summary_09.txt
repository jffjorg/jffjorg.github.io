And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for a writ of attachment to secure the recovery of unpaid rent totaling $34,975.00. The plaintiff, CNNA, LLC, is seeking to recover this amount from the defendant, Steven J. Hoffman, who was a tenant of a commercial property owned by the plaintiff. The defendant had promised to pay the unpaid rent on or before April 12, 2023, but failed to do so. The plaintiff has also requested attorneys' fees and costs, which are estimated to exceed $30,000.00. The court has found that the plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim and that the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim. The court has also determined that the amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero. The plaintiff must post an undertaking of $10,000.00 before the writ of attachment is issued.
