And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings and the motion to dismiss. The motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied, as the plaintiff has not made a prima facie showing that the common interest privilege applies in this case. The court finds that the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FAXC) adequately alleges that the defendant's conduct caused the plaintiff to incur damages.

The motion to dismiss is granted as to All-Ways Far East, LLC and All-Ways Forwarding International, Inc., as they are not registered to do business in California and are not necessary parties to this action. The court permits the First Amended Cross-Complaint to be amended to address the naming issue. The defendant, Rialto Pacific LLC, is ordered to file an amended complaint within 20 days.
