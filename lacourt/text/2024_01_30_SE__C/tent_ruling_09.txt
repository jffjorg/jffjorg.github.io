Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff CNNA, LLC’s motion for writ of
attachment is GRANTED. 
Plaintiff to post an
undertaking of $10,000.
Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
Background
The Complaint was filed on August 10, 2023. This is a
collections case by former-landlord/Plaintiff CNNA, LLC (“Plaintiff”) against
tenant/Defendant STEVEN J. HOFFMAN (“Defendant”). Defendant was a tenant of the
premises Plaintiff used to own and sold to a third party in October 2022. Under
the agreement between Plaintiff and the third-party buyer, Plaintiff was to
collect unpaid rents from Defendant until the month of October 2022. (Chang
Decl. ¶ 5-6; Ex. A.) 
Plaintiff engaged an attorney in or around March 2023, and
on March 16, 2023, Defendant promised that he would pay the sum on or before
April 12, 2023, or he would be liable for twelve (12) percent interest.
However, Defendant was unable to obtain the loan necessary to keep his promise.
The current balance for unpaid rent is in the sum of $34,975.00. Plaintiff also
argues that Defendant is liable for attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest for
the unpaid balance at the rate of twelve (12) percent. (Chang Decl. ¶ 10; Ex. B
and D.) 
On November 27, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for issuance
of a writ of attachment. 
On January 2, 2024, this Court continued the hearing for
the instant motion to allow Plaintiff to produce original contract between
parties that would indicate whether Defendant signed a valid lease and if the
right to attorney fees was included in the contract.
As of January 29, 2024 this motion is unopposed.
Legal Standard 
“Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time
thereafter, the plaintiff may apply pursuant to this article for a right to
attach order and a writ of attachment by filing an application for the order
and writ with the court in which the action is brought.” (CCP § 484.010.) 
The application shall be executed under oath and must
include: (1) a statement showing that the attachment is sought to secure the
recovery on a claim upon which an attachment may be issued; (2) a statement of
the amount to be secured by the attachment; (3) a statement that the attachment
is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the
attachment is based; (4) a statement that the applicant has no information or
belief that the claim is discharged or that the prosecution of the action is
stayed in a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. section 101 et
seq.); and (5) a description of the property to be attached under the writ of
attachment and a statement that the plaintiff is informed and believes that
such property is subject to attachment. (CCP § 484.020.) 
“The application [for a writ of attachment] shall be
supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the facts presented
would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the attachment is
based.” (CCP § 484.030.)
The Court shall issue a right to attach order if the Court
finds all of the following: 
(1) The claim upon which the
attachment is based is one upon which an attachment may be issued. 
(2) The plaintiff has
established the probable validity of the claim upon which the attachment is
based.
(3) The attachment is not
sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the
attachment is based. 
(4) The amount to be secured
by the attachment is greater than zero.
(CCP § 484.090.) 
“A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is more likely
than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on
that claim.” (CCP § 481.190.) 
In determining the probable validity of a claim where the
defendant makes an appearance, the court must consider the relative merits of
the positions of the respective parties and make a determination of the
probable outcome of the litigation.” (See Loeb & Loeb v. Beverly Glen
Music, Inc. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 1110, 1120.) 
At the times prescribed by CCP section 1005(b), the
defendant must be served with summons and complaint, notice of application and
hearing, and the application and supporting evidence. (CCP § 484.040.) 
“The Attachment Law statutes are subject to strict
construction.” (Epstein v. Abrams (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1168.)
Discussion 
The application is based on claims for unpaid rents
totaling $34,975.00. On March 16, 2023, Defendant promised to pay the sum of
the unpaid rent on or before April 12, 2023, or he would be liable for 12
percent interest. Plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees and costs are also recoverable
under the lease agreement, and Plaintiff requests that the cost for the
attachment would exceed $10,000.00, and the attorneys’ fees will exceed $30,000.00.
(Lee Decl. ¶ 11.) 
Here, the Court is persuaded that the claim is one the
attachment may be issued. A claim is “readily ascertainable” where the amount
due may be clearly ascertained from the contract and calculated by evidence;
the fact that damages are unliquidated is not determinative. (CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc, v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 540-41 (attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for
lease of commercial equipment).) Here, there is a contract for rent of a
commercial property. 
Given the supplemental evidence, the Court is persuaded
that Plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim. The Court
notes that Defendant in email correspondence indicates that he believes a rent
is owed. Plaintiff also attaches to the Chang Declaration, as Exhibit B, an
invoice for the owed rent which shows a balance of $34,975.00. The supplemental
briefings filed on January 5, 2024, show an original contract between parties
that indicates Defendant signed a valid lease with Plaintiff. (Chang Decl., Ex.
H.) Paragraph 17 of said contract indicates that the prevailing party has the
right to attorney fees. (Chang Decl., Ex. H ¶ 17.) 
The Court is also persuaded that the attachment is not
sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the
attachment is based. 
Further, the amount to be secured by the attachment is $74,975.00,
which is greater than zero.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion
is GRANTED. 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 489.210 requires the plaintiff to file an
undertaking before issuance of a writ of attachment.  Code of Civil
Procedure section 489.220 provides, with exceptions, for an undertaking in the
amount of $10,000.  The parties have not argued that a different amount of
undertaking should be required.
