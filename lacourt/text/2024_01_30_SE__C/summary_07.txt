And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to take off-calendar the demurrer filed by Defendant Jennifer Fraser. This means that the hearing scheduled for January 30, 2024, will no longer take place. The reason for this decision is that Plaintiff Tiffany Packman filed a First Amended Complaint instead of an Opposition to the Demurrer. As a result, the Demurrer is rendered moot and the hearing is no longer necessary. The judge has also ruled that the First Amended Complaint supersedes the original complaint, and that the Defendant will be given notice of this decision.
