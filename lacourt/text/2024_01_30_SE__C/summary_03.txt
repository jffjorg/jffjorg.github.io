Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment on all three causes of action: breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty of merchantability, and breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. The judge has found that there are triable issues of fact in all three cases, and therefore the case will proceed to trial.
