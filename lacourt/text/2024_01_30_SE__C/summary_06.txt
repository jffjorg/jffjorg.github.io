And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment in this medical negligence case. The plaintiff, Edna Melissa Molina, alleges that her son, Gerardo Lorenzo Molina, died due to negligent care provided by Dr. Yeh and Physician's Assistant Panlilio at Whittier Hospital Medical Center on January 13, 2022. The defendants argue that they did not breach the standard of care, citing the expert declaration of Dr. Barcay, who reviewed Decedent's medical records and opined that Dr. Yeh and Physician's Assistant Panlilio's treatment complied with the standard of care.

However, the plaintiff has raised a triable issue of fact with respect to Physician's Assistant Panlilio, citing the expert declaration of Dr. Pregerson, who opines that Physician's Assistant Panlilio did not meet the standard of care at all relevant times during his evaluation and treatment of Decedent. The plaintiff also raised a triable issue of fact with respect to Dr. Yeh, citing Dr. Pregerson's opinion that Dr. Yeh, as the supervising physician, was responsible for the care and treatment provided by Physician's Assistant Panlilio and that his actions and/or omissions fell below the standard of care.

Therefore, the defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Dr. Yeh and Physician's Assistant Panlilio is denied. The plaintiff is instructed to give notice.
