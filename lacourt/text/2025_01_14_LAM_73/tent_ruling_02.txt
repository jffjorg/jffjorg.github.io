I. BACKGROUND
 
On August 14, 2024, Plaintiff Ciro Martinez (“Plaintiff”) filed
this motor vehicle – personal injury action against Defendant Sheny Maradiaga
(“Defendant”). Plaintiff has alleged one cause of action for negligence against
Defendant. Plaintiff’s complaint alleges that Defendant negligently operated
his vehicle, causing it to collide with Plaintiff’s vehicle.
 
On October 3, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with form
interrogatories and a demand for inspection and production of documents.
Plaintiff’s responses to this discovery were due on or before November 4, 2024.
On November 7, 2024, Defendant reminded Plaintiff of the failure to timely
respond and gave Plaintiff until November 14, 2024, to provide responses
without objections. To date, Defendant has not received any responses from
Plaintiff.
 
On December 13, 2024, Defendant filed the motion to compel responses to
form interrogatories and the motion to compel responses to the demand for
inspection and production of documents, arguing:
·               
Due to Plaintiff’s failure to respond,
Defendant is entitled to an order compelling Plaintiff’s discovery responses.
·               
Defendant is entitled to monetary
sanctions in the amount of $455.34 for the motion to compel responses to the
demand for inspection and production of documents and monetary sanctions in the
amount of $455.34 for the motion to compel responses to the form
interrogatories.
As of January 9, 2025, no opposition has
been filed to the motions.
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard
 
1.     
Form Interrogatories
 
A responding party has 30 days after
service of interrogatories to serve their responses on the propounding party.
(CCP § 2030.260(a).) However, if interrogatories are served by electronic
service, a responding party has an additional two (2) court days to respond. (CCP
§ 1010.6(a)(3)(B).)¿¿ 
¿ 
If the responding party fails to
timely respond to the interrogatories, “The party to whom the interrogatories
are directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010).” (CCP § 2030.290(a).)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Furthermore, the party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.
(CCP §§ 2030.290(b).) And “Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a
motion to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the
propounding party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it
satisfied a ‘meet and confer’ requirement.” (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)¿¿¿ 
 
2.      Production of
Documents
 
A responding
party has 30 days after service of the demand for inspection and production to
serve their responses on the propounding party. (CCP § 2031.260(a).) However,
if they are served by electronic service, a responding party has an additional
two (2) court days to respond. (CCP § 1010.6(a)(3)(B).)
 
Failure to
serve timely responses to demands for inspection and production results in the
responding party waiving any objection to the discovery requests, including
those based on privilege and work product. (CCP § 2031.300(a).)¿The party
making the demand for inspection and production may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (CCP § 2031.300(b).)
 
B.      Discussion
 
Defendant
served the form interrogatories and demand for inspection and production of
documents on Plaintiff on October 3, 2024. Plaintiff’s responses to the discovery
were due by November 7, 2024. Despite Defendant giving Plaintiff an extension
to November 14, 2024, Plaintiff never served responses to Defendant’s form
interrogatories and demand for inspection and production of documents.
Defendant has moved for an order compelling Plaintiff’s responses to this
discovery.
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to the form interrogatories
and Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to the demand for
inspection and production of documents are granted.
 
C.      Sanctions
 
Sanctions may
be imposed for misuse of discovery process. (CCP § 2023.030(a).) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (CCP § 2023.010(d).)
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348 provides that a court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery even if no opposition was filed.¿
 
Defendant has requested sanctions in the amount
of $455.34 for each motion against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s attorney of record.
This is based on 2 hours of attorney time to meet and confer, review the
motion, and appear at the hearing at $160.17 per hour, plus 1 hour of legal
assistant time to reserve the hearing and draft the motion at $75 an hour, plus
the $60 filing fee. 
 
This amount is reasonable given the nature of
the motions. Defendant’s request for sanctions against Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s attorney of record is granted in the total amount of $910.68 for
the two motions ($455.34 for each motion).
 

III. DISPOSITION
 
 
The motion to compel responses to form interrogatories
and the motion to compel responses to the demand for inspection and production
of documents are granted. Compliance within 20 days.
 
Defendant’s request for sanctions against Plaintiff
and Plaintiff’s attorney of record is granted in the total amount of $910.68
for the two motions ($455.34 for each motion), payable within 20 days
