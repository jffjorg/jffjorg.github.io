Background
Pleadings in Lead Case [22STCV07972]
Plaintiff Michelle Leonard sued Defendants Brian E. Claypool (Brian
Claypool), The Claypool Law Firm (Claypool Law), and Does 1 to 20 pursuant to a
May 3, 2023, First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleging claims of (1) Legal
Malpractice and (2) Breach of Fiduciary Duty.
The claims arise from the following allegations. In the course of their
legal representation of Michelle Leonard in claims surrounding her injuries
arising from the Route 91 Harvest Festival concert shooting in Las Vegas
Nevada, Brian Claypool and Claypool Law
(the Claypool Parties), as well as Does 1 to 20, engaged in conduct
amounting to legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty. This conduct
included: (1) the Claypool Parties’
failure to submit key medical records for Michelle Leonard’s injuries in
relation the Route 91 shooting and class action case in Nevada; (2) the Claypool Parties’ failure to file
documentation with the federal government regarding Michelle Leonard’s total
disability as a result of her injuries; (3) the Claypool Parties providing erroneous tax information regarding
Michelle Leonard’s personal injury claims; and (4) the Claypool Parties’ omission of the aforementioned misconduct
through failure and refusal to communicate with Michelle Leonard to keep her
apprised of the significant developments in the class action case or respond to
Michelle Leonard’s documents requests, including giving Michelle Leonard a copy
of her retainer agreement upon execution.
Pleadings in Related Case [22AHCV00796]
In turn, the Claypool Parties sued
Michelle Leonard pursuant to an October 10, 2022 Complaint that also served as
a Rejection of Arbitration Award and Request for Trial after Attorney-Client
Fee Arbitration, i.e., a prior, non-binding Los Angeles County Bar Association (LACBA)
arbitration decision relating to the dispute between the parties.
The Complaint also alleged a single
claim of breach of contract premised on Michelle Leonard’s breach of two
agreements: (1) the retainer agreement between the parties, breached when
Michelle Leonard initiated the LACBA proceedings challenging the fees provided
for in the retainer agreement; and (2) the global settlement in the Route 91
shooting class action (the One October Protocol), which instituted the
arbitration structure by which Michelle Leonard should have pursued her claims
against Defendants, with Michelle Leonard breaching the global settlement by instituting
the LACBA proceedings rather than following the One October Protocol arbitration
framework.
The lead and related cases were consolidated
on May 17, 2023.
Motion Before the Court
On January 11, 2024, the Claypool
Parties filed a motion for issue and evidence sanctions against Michelle
Leonard and for monetary sanctions against Michelle Leonard and counsel of
record, The Law Offices of Kevin Gerry.
The issue and evidence sanctions
requests arise from disputes over whether Michelle Leonard’s first supplemental
responses to the Claypool Parties’ Requests for Production of Documents (RPDs),
Set One, Nos. 15, 16, and 29—indicating that after a diligent search, no
responsive documents to these RPDs could be located and that those documents were
lost, misplaced, or stolen—satisfied the Code of Civil Procedure and this
Court’s December 7, 2023 order compelling first supplemental responses to these
production requests. (Mot., Separate Statement, pp. 2-4; Mot., Yee Decl., Ex. B.)
On February 26, 2024, Michelle
Leonard filed an opposition, which clarified that on February 25, 2024, after
various disputes relating to the form of the responses, Michelle Leonard served
supplemental responses and initial production in relation to RPDs, Set One,
Nos. 15, 16, and 29.
On February 29, 2024, the Claypool
parties filed a reply and various objections to Michelle Leonard’s opposition
evidence.
The Claypool Parties’ motion is now
before the Court.

Motion for Sanctions
I.
A.
Preliminary
Note – Timeliness
Here,
the Court declines the reply’s objections to the opposition as untimely. The
Claypool Parties have responded to the opposition on the merits and failed to
raise arguments detailing the prejudice that sprung from the untimeliness.
(Reply, pp. 2-5.) Those circumstances support a consideration of the opposition
on the merits. (Carlton v. Quint (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 690, 697 [Even
when the opposing party does expressly object to inadequate notice but then
opposes the motion on the merits, the issue of defective notice may be waived
unless the opposing party makes a request for a continuance or demonstrates
prejudice from the defective notice]; accord Reedy v. Bussell (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 1272, 1288.)
B.
Preliminary
Note – Compliance with Code Civ. Proc., § 2015.5, Opposition Declarations
Here,
the oppositions’ support declarations from counsel and Michelle Leonard are not
sworn in conformity with the laws of the State of California. (Opp’n, Harman
Decl., ¶¶ 1-6; Opp’n, Leonard Decl., ¶¶ 1-5.) The Court also notes that the
opposition points and authorities are unsworn. (Opp’n, pp. 1-4.)
A
sworn statement, declaration, verification, certificate, oath, or affidavit
executed in writing by a person out of California must specifically state: “I
certify (or declare) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and
correct[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2015.5, subd. (b).)
“[A]
declaration is defective under section 2015.5 absent an express facial link to
California or its perjury laws”. (Kulshrestha v. First Union Commercial
Corp. (2004) 33 Cal.4th 601, 612; see, e.g., Hearn v. Howard (2009)
177 Cal.App.4th 1193 [Declaration of due diligence attached to the proof of
substituted service that provided it was executed “under penalty of perjury
under the laws of the State of Arizona” was facially not in compliance with
statutory requirements, as declaration neither indicated that it was executed
in California nor provided that it was executed under penalty of perjury under
the laws of the State of California].)
“[C]ourts
do not find compliance with section 2015.5 to be both substantial and
sufficient unless all statutory conditions appear on the face of the
declaration in some form.” (Ibid., citing People v. Pacific Land
Research Co. (1977) 20 Cal.3d 10, 21, fn. 11 (Pacific) [place of
execution established where declarant’s address appeared near signature] & People
v. Pierce (1967) 66 Cal.2d 53, 58-59 (Pierce) [§ 2015.5 satisfied
even though declaration differed in format from exemplar] & Hirschman v.
Saxon (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 589, 593 (Hirschman) [same].)
However,
courts have held that where procedural or technical errors under section 2015.5
are harmless, the court may consider the papers at issue. (People v. Flores
(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1566, 1574 [noting that “courts have held procedural or
technical errors [under § 2015.5] to be harmless”]; see, e.g., Hearn, supra,
177 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1203-1204 [determining trial court was not prevented
from considering declaration of due diligence that was not executed in
California and did not provide that it was executed under the laws of the State
of California where the declaration made reference to the proof of service,
which was executed in accordance with California law, and plaintiff’s attorney
submitted a properly subscribed declaration outlining the efforts to effect
personal service, thus rendering the defect harmless]; Hicks v. Hicks (1968)
264 Cal.App.2d 890, 893 [court deemed an unsigned declaration to be subscribed
because it was attached to a subscribed motion].)
Here,
the Court determines that it will consider the opposition’s declarations.
The
purpose of the declarations attached to the opposition is to bring Michelle
Leonard’s initial and supplemental production to the Court’s notice. These papers
accomplish this purpose by referencing attachments, including the February 15, 2024,
initial production by Michelle Leonard (allegedly not in proper form) and the attachment
of the same into the February 25, 2024, second supplemental responses and
(repeat) initial production by Michelle Leonard. (Opp’n, Exs. A-B.) Those
second supplemental responses/initial production were sworn as verified under
the laws of California, which sufficiently serves the purpose of the statute
where the declarations were executed outside of California. (Opp’n, pp. 1-4
[unsworn]; Opp’n, Hartman Decl., ¶ 4 at p. 5 [referencing February 25, 2024,
production] & p. 6 [sworn but executed in South Carolina with no reference
to laws of California]; Opp’n, Leonard Decl., ¶ 5 at p. 1 [referencing February
25, 2024, production] & p. 1 [sworn but executed in Arizona with no
reference to laws of California]; Opp’n, Exs. A [initial February 15, 2024,
production], B [February 25, 2024, production in conformity with California
laws].)
While
the Court admonishes Michelle Leonard and counsel for failing to properly
follow California law in executing their declarations, the effect of that
failure is harmless where the central focus of Michelle Leonard’s papers is the
discovery production attached to the opposition, which is sworn under penalty
of perjury pursuant to California law, and which is not contested by the
Claypool parties as not having been served. Moreover, the declarations are
sworn under penalty of perjury but simply fail to qualify these to California
law. (See Opp’n, Hartman Decl., p. 6; Opp’n, Leonard Decl., p. 1.) For these
reasons, the Court determines that the declarations may be considered because
any violation of section 2015.5 is harmless, even if executed and sworn outside
of California without reference to the laws of the State of California. (Pacific,
supra, 20 Cal.3d at p. 21, fn. 11; Pierce, supra, 66
Cal.2d at pp. 58-59; Hirschman, supra, 246 Cal.App.2d at p. 593.)
II.
Legal
Standard
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 permits California courts to impose issue
or evidence sanctions for discovery misuses, which are defined by section
2023.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (See Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &
Co. v. Superior Court (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 272, 288 [The court’s inherent
power to curb abuses and promote fair process extends to the preclusion of
evidence].)
“‘The
trial court has broad discretion in selecting discovery sanctions, subject to
reversal only for abuse. [Citations.] The trial court should consider both the
conduct being sanctioned and its effect on the party seeking discovery and, in
choosing a sanction, should “‘attempt[] to tailor the sanction to the harm
caused by the withheld discovery.’” [Citation.] The trial court cannot impose
sanctions for misuse of the discovery process as a punishment. [Citation.] [¶]
The discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions,
starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of
termination. “Discovery sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the dereliction,
and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the
party entitled to but denied discovery.’” [Citation.] If a lesser sanction
fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of
the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the
sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.’” (Padron v. Watchtower Bible
& Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 1246, 1259-1260
(Padron), quoting Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 992; accord Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771,
793 [Discovery sanctions “should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should
not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party
entitled to but denied discovery”]; Karlsson v. Ford Motor Co. (2006)
140 Cal.App.4th 1202, 1217 (Karlsson) [“Discovery sanctions must be
tailored in order to remedy the offending party’s discovery abuse, should not
give the aggrieved party more than what it is entitled to, and should not be
used to punish the offending party”].) 
“A
discovery order, though not in the form of a default or dismissal, is
justifiably treated as such where the effect of the order is to preclude proof
of essential elements of each cause of action.” (Puritan Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 877, 884, citing Karz v. Karl
(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 637, 648.) “The sanction of dismissal or the rendition of
a default judgment against the disobedient party is ordinarily a drastic
measure which should be employed with caution. [Citation.] The sanction of
dismissal, where properly employed, is justified on the theory the party’s
refusal to reveal material evidence tacitly admits his claim or defense is
without merit.” (Puritan Ins. Co., supra, at p. 885.) Except for
in cases of extreme misconduct and when other viable options are unavailable, a
trial court abuses its discretion when a sanctions order deprives a party “of
any right to defend the action upon its merits” and was “designed not to
accomplish the purposes of discovery but designed to punish” the party for not
fully complying with its discovery obligations. (Caryl Richards, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1961) 188 Cal.App.2d 300, 305; accord Newland v.
Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613-616 [party’s failure to
timely pay monetary sanctions did not warrant terminating sanctions].)
Misuses
of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following:
(a)
Persisting, over objection and without substantial justification, in an attempt
to obtain information or materials that are outside the scope of permissible
discovery.
(b)
Using a discovery method in a manner that does not comply with its specified
procedures.
(c)
Employing a discovery method in a manner or to an extent that causes
unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and
expense.
(d)
Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.
(e)
Making, without substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to
discovery.
(f)
Making an evasive response to discovery.
(g)
Disobeying a court order to provide discovery.
(h)
Making or opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a
motion to compel or to limit discovery.
(i)
Failing to confer in person, by telephone, or by letter with an opposing party
or attorney in a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve informally any
dispute concerning discovery, if the section governing a particular discovery
motion requires the filing of a declaration stating facts showing that an
attempt at informal resolution has been made.
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (a)-(i); see, e.g., Vallbona v. Springer
(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545 [the court imposed evidence sanctions where defendants
misused discovery process by not responding to authorized method of discovery];
In re Marriage of Eustice (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1291, 1308-1309 [respondent
was sanctioned for willfully violating order to produce accounting and
financial documents].)
III.
Order
Granting Sanctions: GRANTED, in part [as to issue and evidence
sanctions]; GRANTED [as to monetary sanctions].
A. Issue and Evidence Sanctions
After
review, the Court GRANTS issue and evidence sanctions, in part. 
First,
the Court notes that the production requests at issue seek:
(1)
“All WRITINGS and DOCUMENTS that evidence, memorialize, or relate to any
payments that [MICHELLE LEONARD] received in the UNDERLYING ACTION.
(2)
“All WRITINGS and DOCUMENTS that evidence, memorialize, or relate to any
payments that [MICHELLE LEONARD] received for the UNDERLYING INCIDENT.”
(3)
“All WRITINGS and DOCUMENTS that evidence or show YOUR income for the 5 years
prior to the [ROUTE 91 CONCERT SHOOTING].”
Second,
the Court notes that the proposed order sets forth the scope of the evidence
and issue sanctions sought by the Claypool Parties as follows:
(2)
“Plaintiff is barred from introducing or relying upon any documents which are
responsive to nos. 15, 16, and 29 of defendant’s request for production of
documents, set one.”
(3)
“It is established in this action that plaintiff did not have any income for
five years prior to the underlying incident.”
(4)
“It is established in this action that plaintiff received an amount of money
for the Underlying Action, but plaintiff is barred from introducing the amount
that she received. 
(5)
“It is established in this action that plaintiff received an amount of money
for the underlying incident, but plaintiff is barred from introducing the
amount that she received.”
(Mot.,
Proposed Order, p. 2, ¶¶ 3-5.)
Third,
the Court notes that any relief much be commensurate to the discovery abuse. (Karlsson,
supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at p. 1217 [“Discovery sanctions must be tailored
in order to remedy the offending party’s discovery abuse, should not give the
aggrieved party more than what it is entitled to, and should not be used to
punish the offending party”].)
Fourth,
the Court recognizes that a prior order from this Court ordered Michelle
Leonard to provide supplemental responses to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 15, 16, and
29. (12/7/23 Minutes, p. 6.)
Fifth,
a review of the supplemental production shows that Michelle Leonard provided
responsive documents to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 15-16: writings showing payments
received by Michelle Leonard in or for the Nevada class action case. (Opp’n,
Ex. B.)
Sixth,
the Court determines that while those same documents show some financial
information for Michelle Leonard, she has failed to submit information
detailing her income for the five years preceding this action. (See Opp’n, Ex.
B.)
Based
on these observations, the Court finds as follows:
(1)
Except as to evidence produced by Michelle Leonard by February 25, 2024, Michelle
Leonard and her witnesses are PRECLUDED from testifying or introducing writings
or documents that relate to any payments that Michelle Leonard received in or
for the Underlying Action; and
(2)
It is established in this action that Michelle Leonard did not have any income
for five years prior to the underlying incident, other than as shown in the
evidence produced by Michelle Leonard as of February 25, 2024.
(3)
It is established in this action that Michelle Leonard received an amount of
money for the Underlying Action, but Michelle Leonard is barred from
introducing any amount that she received, other than the evidence produced by
Michelle Leonard as of February 25, 2024. 
(4)
It is established in this action that Michelle Leonard received an amount of
money for the underlying incident, but Michelle Leonard is barred from
introducing any amount that she received, other than the evidence produced by
Michelle Leonard as of February 25, 2024.
The
Court imposes these sanctions on various grounds.
First,
despite this Court’s December 7, 2023, order, Michelle Leonard has not served documents
responsive to RPDs, Set One, No. 29 [her income for 5 years prior to the Route
91 Concert.] (12/7/23 Minutes, p. 6; Opp’n, Ex. B.) Despite her initial
response stating that she had no such documents, she eventually filed untimely
responses on February 25, 2024, including six documents. However, the documents
attaching do not appear to be responsive, dealing instead with the receipts of
payments in or for the Underlying Action. (Opp’n, Ex. B.) (The Court briefly
notes that it does not consider the Sorkin declaration attached to the February
26, 2024, motion for summary judgment by the Claypool Parties because it is possible
hearsay (contra party admission) comprising a secondary source. (Reply, p. 3, §
II.) Based on the untimeliness and lack of responsiveness, the Court finds that
issue and evidence sanctions are appropriate as to RPDs, Set One, No. 29. 
Second,
despite this Court’s December 7, 2023, order, Michelle Leonard has produced a very
limited amount of documents in response to RPDs, Set One, 15-16, and untimely at
that. (12/7/23 Minutes, p. 6; Opp’n, Ex. B.) As pointed out by the reply
(Reply, pp. 3-4), Michelle Leonard and counsel should have made a greater
effort of securing documents relating to payment to Michelle Leonard from
Leonard’s Nevada counsel, which was the source of the February 25, 2024,
initial production. (Opp’n, Hartman Decl., ¶ 2 [receipt of documents from
Nevada counsel on January 29, 2024].) Such conduct is not Code compliant
because Michelle Leonard and counsel should have been aware well before this
hearing that they could seek documents responsive to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 15-16
from Leonard’s Nevada counsel, who had access to the responsive documents. (Opp’n,
Hartman Decl., ¶ 2.) Indeed, Michelle Leonard or counsel should have reached
out to Nevada counsel by some date on or around January 19, 2023, when RPDs,
Set One, were served on Michelle Leonard. Issue and evidentiary sanctions thus
appear appropriate based on several factors: delayed and possibly incomplete
production; implicit refusals to comply with a court order relating to that
production by failing to make a more diligent effort in locating responsive
documents with Nevada counsel; and repeated representations by Michelle Leonard
that she has no more documents responsive to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 15-16. (Mot.,
Yee Decl., Ex. A, Proof of Service [RPDs, Set One] & Ex. C, pp. 1-2 [first
supplemental responses to RPDs, Set One, indicating no further responsive
documents in Michelle Leonard’s control]; Opp’n, Ex. B [February 25, 2024, supplemental
responses]; Regency Health Services, Inc. v. Superior Court (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th
1496 [“[A] party has a general duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to
obtain responsive information [citations] …”].)
Last,
the Court notes that because a prior court order exists in relation to the
discovery at issue here (12/7/23 Minutes, p. 6), the Court’s imposition of
issue and evidence sanctions follows the incremental approach to sanctions. (Padron,
supra, 16 Cal.App.5th at pp. 1259-1260.)
Issue
and evidence sanctions are thus GRANTED, in part.
B. Monetary Sanctions
After
review, the Court GRANTS the request for monetary sanctions in the amount of
$2,710, which is unopposed by the opposition (Opp’n, pp. 1-4 [focusing on issue
and evidence sanctions]), and is comprised of a reasonable fee rate of $265 per
hour, three hours meeting and conferring with Michelle Leonard’s counsel and
preparing this motion, an additional five hours to review the opposition and
draft a reply, and two hours in preparing for attending this hearing, plus a
$60 motion filing fee. (Mot., Yee Decl., ¶ 10 [miscalculating final figure as
$2,445 by multiplying reasonable fee rate by nine instead of ten].)
The
Court notes that monetary sections are premised on failure to respond to an
authorized method of discovery and disobedience of a court order, e.g.,
non-production as to RPDs, Set One, No. 29, despite Michelle Leonard serving prior
supplemental responses to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 15, 16, and 29, which attested that
no further responsive documents were in Michelle Leonard’s control, and where the
February 25, 2024 supplemental production contradicted that representation. (Mot.,
Yee Decl., Ex. C, pp. 1-2; Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (g),
2023.030, subd. (a).)
