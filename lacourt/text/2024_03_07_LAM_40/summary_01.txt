And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the default judgment package and notes several errors and deficiencies. These include incorrect dates and figures provided, incomplete naming of defendants, and insufficient grounds for the declaration of non-military status. Additionally, the declaration supporting the interest award is insufficiently supported. The court will set a further hearing to address these issues and will require the plaintiff to refile the Request for Court Judgment and provide an updated declaration with exact start and end dates for the interest award sought.
