Case Name:    Li, et al. v. Zhang, et al.




Case No.:        20STCV46927


Complaint
  Filed:   12/3/20




Department:    40


Trial Date:             N/A




Hearing:          OSC re Default Judgment


Hearing Date:
        3/7/24




 

 The Court has reviewed the
default judgment package on file and notes as follows.
 
First, the February 28,
2024 Judicial Council form CIV-100, Request for Court Judgment, contains
various errors or deficiencies and must be refiled:
 
(1) In section 1.a.,
Plaintiff incorrectly dates the Complaint’s filing date as January 2, 2024,
rather than December 3, 2020;
 
(2) In section 1.d.,
Plaintiff must fully name all Defendants against whom/which default judgment is
sought, with any overflow names addable to an attachment to form CIV-100;
 
(3) In section 1.e.(3), the
date of default judgment is incorrectly listed as December 28, 2023, rather
than the correct dates of August 19, 2021 and November 2, 2021, where the Court
notes that this section need not be filled out for court judgment given that
this section involves a clerk’s judgment;
 
(4) In section 2, the
“TOTALS” figure must be updated to correctly reflect a summation of the “Demand
of Complaint” and “Interest” requests; and
 
(5) In section 8, Plaintiff
does not provide sufficient grounds for the declaration of non-military status.
 
Second, the February 28,
2024, declaration from counsel supporting the interest award is not
sufficiently supported.
 
The November 1, 2017,
judgment should seemingly involve a maximum interest award of $1,069,339.99 as
based on a judgment of $1,683,818.20, with a 10% per annum interest rate, for
the dates of November 1, 2021, to March 7, 2024. (Cf. 2/28/23 Qi Decl., p. 2
[seeking $1,094,481.83 interest award].)
 
The April 8, 2017, judgment
should seemingly involve an interest award of $51,151.56 as based on a judgment
of $64,603 judgment, with a 10% per annum interest rate, for the dates of April
8, 2017, to March 7, 2024. (Cf. 2/28/23 Qi Decl., p. 2 [seeking $41,992.56
interest award].)
 
Plaintiff must provide an
updated declaration giving the exact start and end dates for the interest award
sought here rather than simply providing “6.5 years.”
 
The Court will set a
further OSC re: default judgment to address the above issues.
