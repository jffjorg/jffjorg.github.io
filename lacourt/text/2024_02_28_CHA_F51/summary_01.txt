And here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendants. The Court has overruled the demurrer as to Plaintiff's first, second, fourth, sixth, tenth, and eleventh causes of action, sustained with 30 days leave to amend as to Plaintiff's third and seventh causes of action, and sustained without leave to amend as to Plaintiff's eighth and ninth causes of action. The Court has granted the motion to strike in part, with leave to amend. The Court has found that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to state a cause of action for violation of California Civil Code § 1942.4, breach of the implied warranty of habitability, and private nuisance, but has not sufficiently alleged facts to state a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress or violation of the Los Angeles Municipal Tenant Anti-Harassment Ordinance.
