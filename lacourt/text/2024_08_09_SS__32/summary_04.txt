And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to quash a deposition subpoena served on Lyft, Inc. by the defendants. The subpoena requests records from January 1, 2021, to the present, including records of rides taken by Plaintiff Kanwardeep Singh, who allegedly uses Lyft instead of driving on freeways due to anxiety related to the motor vehicle accident. The judge finds that the subpoena is not overly broad and that the records requested are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs have not shown a legally protected privacy interest in the records and that the subpoena does not violate their right of privacy. Therefore, the judge denies the motion to quash the subpoena. The judge also declines to award monetary sanctions to either party, finding that the motion is moot and that there is substantial justification for the subpoena.
