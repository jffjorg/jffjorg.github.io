CASE NUMBER:


21STCV01447




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff Danielle Coleman




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Seyed Abbas Hojati  




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            Defendant
Seyed Abbas Hojati (“Defendant”) moves to compel Plaintiff Danielle Coleman’s (“Plaintiff”)
deposition. No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action . . . , without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410,
fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for
inspection any document . . . described in the deposition notice, the party
giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance
and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document . . .
described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
 
“A motion under subdivision (a) [above] shall comply with
both of the following: 
 
1. The motion
shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
2. The motion
shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040,
or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition
notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent
to inquire about the nonappearance.” 
 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b).) 
 
If a motion is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction in favor of that party unless the court finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450 (g).)
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
The Declaration of Solair T. Kharadjian, Defendant’s counsel states
the following: “Counsel for Hojati has met and conferred with Plaintiff’s
counsel after the noticed deposition to avoid court intervention and in an
attempt to resolve these issues informally.” (Kharadjian Decl. ¶ 8.)
Additionally, it appears counsel for Defendant has spoken with Plaintiff’s
counsel to schedule another deposition. Therefore, the meet and confer
requirement appears to have been met. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
On April 29, 2024, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for May
20, 2024. (Kharadjian Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. B.) Plaintiff was unresponsive to
Defendant’s efforts to confirm the deposition. (Id. ¶ 6, Exh. C.)
However, on May 17, 2024, Plaintiff informed Defendant that the date did not
work. It appears Plaintiff did not serve an objection. As a result, Plaintiff
did not appear at the deposition and Defendant obtained a Certificate of
Non-Appearance. (Id., Exh. D.) 
 
Defendant asserts that the parties later agreed on a June 21, 2024
deposition; if that deposition occurred, Defendant would withdraw the instant
motion. (Kharadjian Decl. ¶ 9-11.) 
 
Because Plaintiff did not serve an objection under Section 2025.410 to the May 20, 2024 deposition
and did not follow up regarding efforts to reschedule, the motion to compel is
granted. 
 
Because Defendant did not request monetary sanctions in the Notice of
Motion, the Court declines to award sanctions. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition is GRANTED. Plaintiff Danielle Coleman shall
appear within 15 days’ notice of this order for a deposition.
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.

MEET
AND CONFER
 
The Declaration of Solair T. Kharadjian, Defendant’s counsel states
the following: “Counsel for Hojati has met and conferred with Plaintiff’s
counsel after the noticed deposition to avoid court intervention and in an
attempt to resolve these issues informally. Based on information and belief, my
supervising partner Ava Vahdat, spoke with Plaintiff’s counsel Hess Panah,
telephonically on June 5, 2024. Ms. Vahdat requested deposition availability
from Plaintiff’s counsel. However, to date, no such availability was provided,
thereby necessitating this motion.” (Kharadjian Decl. ¶ 8-9.) Therefore, the
meet and confer requirement appears to have been met.

available dates for a future deposition. 
 
Because Plaintiff did not serve an objection under Section 2025.410 to the May 20, 2024
deposition and did not follow up regarding efforts to reschedule, the motion to
compel is granted. 
 
Because Defendant did not request monetary sanctions in the Notice of
