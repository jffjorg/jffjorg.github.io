 Case Number:  23PSCV03560    Hearing Date:   March 26, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Trini  Nguyen, et al. v. Khiem “Kevin” Nguyen  Defendant’s  Demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Complaint  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the First Cause of Action with  leave to amend. The Court OVERRULES the demurrer to the Second Cause of Action.  The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the Third Cause of Action without leave to  amend, subject to an offer of proof. Plaintiffs must file and serve their  amended complaint within 30 days of the Court’s order.              Defendant is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is a partition action. On November 14, 2023, plaintiffs Trini  Nguyen, Natalie Nguyen, Bryant Nguyen, Patrick Nguyen, and David Lovold (collectively,  Plaintiffs) filed this action against defendant Khiem “Kevin” Nguyen (Defendant)  and Does 1 through 20, alleging causes of action for partition by sale of real  property, constructive trust, and contribution.  On February 6, 2024, Defendant demurred to each cause of action in  the complaint. On March 8, 2024, Plaintiffs opposed the demurrer. On March 20,  2024, Defendant filed a late reply.  LEGAL  STANDARD  A  demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other  pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or  content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or  cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10; see Donabedian v.  Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the function  of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for  purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are  assumed to be true. (Id.)  A  demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the  pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially  noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian,  supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be  considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,  881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting  demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862, disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal  v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287 [error to consider  contents of release not part of court record].)  A  demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete  or discloses some defense that would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc.  v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of  the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are  incorporated by reference into the complaint, or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.  Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s  Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as  surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”])  A demurrer  can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner  v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of  Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108  Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)   REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE              The Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice. Defendant’s discovery responses are  not subject to mandatory judicial notice, nor are they a court record. (Evid. Code §  451; Id., § 452, subd. (d).)  DISCUSSION  Meet and Confer  Per Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a),  Defendant was required to meet and confer with Plaintiffs before bringing this  demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) It is unclear from counsel  Chang’s declaration whether the meet and confer occurred in person or by  telephone, (see Chang Decl., ¶¶ 2-3), but Plaintiffs’ opposition appears to  indicate that they discussed the demurrer either telephonically or in person,  (Opp., 8:25-27). Accordingly, the Court finds Defendant’s meet-and-confer  efforts sufficient, but the Court does admonish Defendant going forward to provide  sufficient detail in the declaration regarding how the meet and confer  occurred. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3)(A).)  First Cause of Action – Partition by Sale of Real Property  To plead a cause of action for partition, the  plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating, “(a) A description of the property  that is the subject of the action… In the case of real property, the  description shall include both its legal description and its street address or  common designation, if any. (b) All interests the plaintiff has or claims in  the property. (c) All interests of record or actually known to the plaintiff  that persons other than the plaintiff have or claim in the property and that  the plaintiff reasonably believes will be materially affected by the action,  whether the names of such persons are known or unknown to the plaintiff. (d)  The estate as to which partition is sought and a prayer for partition of the  interests therein. (e) Where the plaintiff seeks sale of the property, an  allegation of the facts justifying such relief in ordinary and concise  language.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 872.230.) Equitable owners of real property may maintain  actions for partition. (Kolis v. Kolis (1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 86, 87.)  Defendant demurs to the First Cause of Action for  partition on the grounds that the complaint fails to state a cause of action  and is uncertain. Defendant contends Plaintiffs’ claim fails because there is  no evidence an agreement memorialized in writing, and thereby fails to satisfy  the Statute of Frauds.  In opposition, Plaintiffs contends there are  exceptions to the Parol Evidence Rule[1] which allow oral evidence to supply the missing element of ownership under Code  of Civil Procedure sections 872.230, subdivision (b), and 872.210, subdivision  (a)(2). Plaintiffs further contend that an equitable owner has the right to  commence a partition action against an owner with bare legal title.  The Court finds the parties’ discussion regarding the  Statute of Frauds and Parol Evidence Rule have no bearing on whether Plaintiffs  have alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action for partition. The  Statute of Frauds governs the enforceability of a contract while the Parol  Evidence Rule determines the terms of an agreement. (See Sterling v. Taylor (2007)  40 Cal.4th 757, 766.) Partition is a statutory equitable proceeding, not a  contract-based cause of action. (Cummings v. Dessel (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th  689, 598-599.) But, the Court does agree with Plaintiffs that equitable owners  can bring partition claims. (Kolis, supra, 104 Cal.App.2d at p. 87.)  Nevertheless, the Court notes pleading defects not  directly addressed in the parties’ respective briefs. Defendant’s demurrer  cites Code of Civil Procedure section 872.230, (Demurrer, 6:15-19), which  provides in part that the complaint must allege the legal description of the  property sought to be partitioned. (Code Civ. Proc., § 872.230, subd. (a),  italics added [“The complaint shall set forth: (a) A description of the  property that is the subject of the action… In the case of real property, the  description shall include both its legal description and its street  address or common designation, if any.”]) The complaint does not allege the  legal description of the subject property. (See generally, Compl.)  The other pleading defect the Court discovered in the  complaint is that it names 20 Doe Defendants whose names are unknown. (Compl.,  ¶ 7.) Such unknown parties must be named in the manner provided in Code of  Civil Procedure section 872.550. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 872.520, subd. (a); Id.,  § 872.550.) The Court is further obligated to make orders requiring the joinder  of additional parties as are necessary or proper. (Id., § 872.520, subd.  (c).)  Based on the foregoing, the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the  First Cause of Action with leave to amend.  Second Cause of Action – Constructive Trust  Constructive trust is not a cause of  action but is instead a remedy for an underlying wrong. (Glue-Fold, Inc. v.  Slautterback Corp. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023 fn. 3.) “One who gains a thing by fraud, accident, mistake,  undue influence, the violation of a trust, or other wrongful act, is, unless he  or she has some other and better right thereto, an involuntary trustee of the  thing gained, for the benefit of the person who would otherwise have had it.”  (Civ. Code, § 2224.) For purposes of a demurrer, what matters is the facts  alleged, not the label of the cause of action. (Alfaro v. Community Housing  Improvement System & Planning Assn., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1356,  1371.)  The statute of limitations for claims based on  constructive trust is four years from the defendant’s repudiation of the  plaintiff’s interest in the property, (Burns v. Ross (1923) 190 Cal.  269, 277), or the plaintiff discovers the facts that entitle the plaintiff to  enforce the trust, (Bainbridge v. Stoner (1940) 16 Cal.2d 423, 429). (See  also Marshall v. Marshall (1965) 232 Cal.App.2d 232, 250-251 [holding statute  of limitations for a constructive trust was five years].) For a demurrer to lie  based on the statute of limitations, the pleading defects must be apparent from  the face of the pleading. (United Western Medical Centers v. Superior Court (1996)  42 Cal.App.4th 500, 505.)  Defendant  demurs to the Second Cause of Action on the grounds that the complaint fails to  state a cause of action and is uncertain, and on the grounds that the statute  of limitations has passed. Defendant contends it is unclear what the underlying  basis for this claim is, but that it seems to be based on activity from  2014-2015. Defendant further contends this cause of action is also time-barred  because it is based on an oral agreement, which has a two-year statute of  limitations.  In  opposition, Plaintiffs contend family promises are enforceable by constructive  trust. Plaintiffs also reference discovery responses provided by Defendant  regarding his income at the time of acquiring legal title to the subject  property. Plaintiffs contend they have a claim based on their valuable  improvements to the subject property. Plaintiffs also contend constructive  trust is a cause of action, but even if not, they have alleged sufficient facts  to state a cause of action for wrongdoing against Defendant. Plaintiffs further  contend there is no statutory bar based on equitable estoppel and that any  statute of limitations is tolled by Defendant’s residing outside of the United  States for 10 years per Code of Civil Procedure section 351.  The Court  finds Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action and  that this claim is not uncertain. While there is no cause of action for  constructive trust, that does not mean Plaintiffs have not alleged facts  stating a claim against Defendant for wrongdoing. Civil Code section 2224  specifically provides that the violation of a trust provides the basis for  imposition of a constructive trust. (Civ. Code § 2224; see also Marshall,  supra, 232 Cal.App.2d at pp. 250-251 [addressing statute of limitations for  imposing constructive trust].)  Here, the  complaint alleges that the parties’ mother told all of them when purchasing the  subject property that it would be for all four of her children, and that  Defendant took title only because the parties’ mother had no credit rating in  the United States. (Compl., ¶ 10.) The complaint alleges that Plaintiffs paid  the costs of running the subject property, including the maintenance and  repairs, property taxes, and utilities. (Compl., ¶¶ 17, 20.) The complaint then  alleges Plaintiff Trini spent over $46,000 improving the subject property,  while Plaintiff David spent $1,700 repairing the roof. (Compl., ¶ 18.) The  complaint further alleges Defendant violated that trust when he initiated  eviction proceedings against Plaintiffs. (Compl., ¶ 21.)  As for the  statute of limitations argument, the complaint does not allege sufficient facts  on its face to establish that Plaintiffs’ claims are time-barred. (United  Western Medical Centers, supra, 42 Cal.App.4th at p. 505.) Defendant’s argument  regarding the two-year statute of limitations is also unsupported. (Burns,  supra, 190 Cal. at p. 277; Bainbridge, supra, 16 Cal.2d at p. 429).  Defendant did not repudiate Plaintiffs’ interest in the subject property until October  23, 2023, when he caused the 60-day Notice to Quit to be served on Plaintiffs.  (Compl., ¶ 21.)  Based on the foregoing, the Court OVERRULES the demurrer to the  Second Cause of Action.  Third Cause of Action – Contribution              To enforce  a right of support against an adult child for support of the parent, the  parent, or the county on behalf of the parent, may bring an action to enforce  the duty of support. (Fam. Code, § 4403.) Thus, for a plaintiff to recover  under this code section, the plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating that he,  she, or it is either the parent of an adult child or the county acting on  behalf of that parent.              Defendant  demurs to the Third Cause of Action on the grounds that it fails to state a  cause of action and is uncertain. More specifically, Defendant contends Plaintiffs  do not have the right to bring this cause of action because they are not Defendant’s  parent, nor are they the county acting on behalf of Defendant’s parent.  Defendant notes the complaint does not allege Plaintiffs are executors of their  mother’s estate or otherwise authorized to bring this action on behalf of her  estate.              In  opposition, Plaintiffs contend they are able to bring this cause of action based  on the case of In re Marriage of Drake (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1139, which  purportedly allowed nephew trustees to recover against the decedent wife’s  husband based on the husband’s duty of care for his disabled adult child.  Plaintiffs contend Defendant will be unjustly enriched because he has  improperly acquired the bank accounts and social security checks of their  decedent mother, and that Defendant cannot otherwise escape his obligations to  care for his mother.              The  Court agrees with Defendant. The statutory language is clear that it is either  the parent or the county that can recover for support against the adult child.  (Fam. Code, § 4403.) It does not say the other children can recover. The only  other means for Plaintiffs to recover under this code section would be for  Plaintiffs to be appointed executors or other authorized legal representatives  of their deceased mother’s estate. (See, e.g., Code Civ. Proc., § 372, subd.  (a)(1).) The complaint contains no allegations that Plaintiffs are such  authorized legal representatives. (See generally, Compl.)  The Court further finds Plaintiffs’  citation to In re Marriage of Drake unpersuasive because that case did  not address Family Code section 4403. (See generally In re Marriage of Drake  (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1139.) That  case is also factually distinguishable because it involved parental support of  a disabled adult child, not an adult child’s support of a disabled parent. (See  Id.)              Plaintiffs’  opposition offers no new facts that can be alleged to address these defects. Accordingly,  the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer without leave to amend, subject to an offer of  proof at the hearing on this demurrer.  CONCLUSION  The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the First Cause of Action with  leave to amend. The Court OVERRULES the demurrer to the Second Cause of Action.  The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the Third Cause of Action without leave to  amend, subject to an offer of proof. Plaintiffs must file and serve their  amended complaint within 30 days of the Court’s order.              Defendant is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
