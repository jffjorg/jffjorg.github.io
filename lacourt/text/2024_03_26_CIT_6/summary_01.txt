And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motions to compel responses to discovery requests are denied. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's requests for monetary sanctions. The defendant, Hassan Hashemian, is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of the order. The judge notes that the plaintiff did not allow sufficient time for the defendant's responses to be delivered by mail before filing the motions to compel, and that the defendant contends that all responses were timely served and received by the plaintiff. The judge finds that the defendant acted with substantial justification in timely depositing the discovery responses in the mail, and that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust given the circumstances.
