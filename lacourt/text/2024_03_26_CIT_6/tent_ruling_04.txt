  [1] The Court infers Plaintiffs meant to  refer to the Statute of Frauds, which is not the same as the Parol Evidence  Rule. (See 4. [§ 68] Statute of Frauds Distinguished., 2 Witkin, Cal. Evid. 6th  Docu Evid § 68 (2023) [“The object of the statute of frauds is to  prevent perjured testimony in proof of purported contracts of important types,  and the statute applies only to those enumerated types. [Citation.] The Parol Evidence Rule applies to  any type of contract, and its purpose is to make sure that the parties' final  understanding, deliberately expressed in writing, shall not be changed.
