And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrers filed by the defendant and has issued a tentative ruling. The court sustains the demurrer to the first cause of action, which is the partition by sale of real property, with leave to amend. The court overrules the demurrer to the second cause of action, which is the constructive trust, and finds that the plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to state a claim. The court sustains the demurrer to the third cause of action, which is the contribution, without leave to amend, subject to an offer of proof.

The court finds that the first cause of action fails to state a claim because the complaint does not allege the legal description of the subject property. The court also finds that the third cause of action fails to state a claim because the plaintiffs are not the parents or the county, as required by the statute.

The court orders the plaintiffs to file and serve their amended complaint within 30 days of the order, and the defendant is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of the order.
