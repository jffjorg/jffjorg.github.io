BACKGROUND
            On October 10, 2023, American
Express National Bank filed a complaint against Dominic Kennedy for common
counts.  
            On March 7, 2024, the parties
stipulated and the Court ordered that the case be dismissed and that the court
retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP §664.6.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Pursuant to CCP §664.6:  “If parties to pending litigation stipulate,
in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” 
“Section 664.6 was enacted to
provide a summary procedure for specifically enforcing a settlement contract
without the need for a new lawsuit.”  Chan v. Lund (2010)
188 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1165-66 (quoting Weddington Productions,
Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809-10).  Under CCP
§664.6, a court may determine disputed factual issues regarding the settlement agreement
and even permits the court “to entertain challenges to the actual terms of the
stipulation, that is, whether there actually was a settlement . . . and to
interpret the terms of the settlement agreement.”  Fiore v.
Alvord (1985) 182 Cal. App. 3d 561, 566. 
DISCUSSION
            Under CCP §664.6, plaintiff American
Express National Bank requests an order to set aside and vacate the dismissal
and enter judgment against defendant Dominic Kennedy in the amount of $65,958.90,
consisting of $65,395.90 in damages and $563 in costs.
            On March 7, 2024, the case was
dismissed, and the Court retained jurisdiction under CCP §664.6.
            Plaintiff explains that the parties
entered into a stipulation on February 23, 2024.  As set forth in the stipulation, defendant
agreed that defendant was indebted to plaintiff in the amount of $70,400 on
defendant’s account ending 1000. 
Paragraph 5 of the agreement states that the Court can enter a judgment
for $70,400 plus costs.  The repayment
schedule was set forth in paragraph 6. 
Plaintiff asserts that defendant has failed to make payments consistent
with the agreement, and that defendant has not made a payment since March 29,
2024.  On June 25, 2024, plaintiff’s
counsel sent a notice of default to defendant. 
Defendant has not cured the default. 
Defendant has made payments totaling $5005.10.  See Scott Dyle decl.
            Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.

in the amount of $$65,958.90 in favor of plaintiff and against defendant.  See judgment.
            Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
