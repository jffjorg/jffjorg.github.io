And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the motion to enforce judgment against Hugo R. Salguero and Geyrin Salguero, Trustees of The Salguero Family Living Trust Dated June 28, 2021, without prejudice. The plaintiff, L & W Supply Corporation, seeks to enforce the judgment against the trust assets, which are community property. However, the Court finds that the plaintiff has not explained how it seeks to have the Court enforce the judgment against the trustees, who hold title to the trust property. The Court also notes that the plaintiff has failed to cite any authority in support of its motion. The proper procedure for enforcing a judgment against trust property is to sue the trustee in their representative capacity, as stated in Portico Management Group, LLC v. Harrison (2011) and Galdjie v. Darwish (2003). The motion is denied without prejudice, and the plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
