The tentative ruling is in regards to a motion by the plaintiff, Essex Property Trust, Inc., to file an amended complaint or to amend the existing complaint. The motion was not opposed by the defendant, Sejin Park. The court granted the motion, allowing the plaintiff to file a First Amended Complaint by October 2, 2024. The amendment is necessary because the plaintiff discovered an error in attaching the wrong notice to the original complaint. The court found that the plaintiff complied with the relevant rules and regulations, and that leave to amend is generally required to be granted liberally. The court cited several legal authorities to support its decision, including California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(a)(1) and California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324.
