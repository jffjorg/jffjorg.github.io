```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of plaintiff Suzanne Matek's attorney, David J. Furtado, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was granted because the attorney submitted a declaration stating that irreconcilable differences had arisen between the client and the attorney, making it unreasonably difficult to carry out the employment effectively. The judge also found that the attorney had shown sufficient reason why the motion to be relieved as counsel should be granted. The attorney is relieved as counsel of record for the plaintiff, effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed "Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel – Civil" upon the client.
