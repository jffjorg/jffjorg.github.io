Motion
to Enforce Judgment

 

            The Court considered the moving papers.

RULING

            The motion is DENIED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE.

BACKGROUND

            On September 12, 2023, plaintiff L
& W Supply Corporation filed a complaint against Gubuce Bros., Inc. and
Hugo R. Salguero for (1) breach of contract, (2) goods sold and
delivered/agreed price, (3) open book account, (4) account stated, and (5)
breach of personal guaranty.

            On January 8, 2024, a default was
entered against defendants.

            On January 10, 2024, a default
judgment was entered against defendants for $58,970.84.

            On January 31, 2024, a writ of
execution was issued.

DISCUSSION

            Plaintiff
and judgment creditor L&W Supply Corporation request that the Court enforce
the judgement against Hugo R. Salguero and Geyrin Salguero, Trustees of The
Salguero Family Living Trust Dated June 28, 2021.  They are not named on the judgment or the
writ of execution although Hugo R. Salguero is a judgment debtor.

Plaintiff
explains that judgment debtor Hugo R. Salguero and his spouse, Geyrin Salguero,
are the trustors, trustees, and beneficiaries of the Salguero Trust.  Plaintiff further contends that the trust is
a revocable living trust and, as a result, the property of the Salguero Trust
is legally Hugo’s property and subject to the claims of Hugo’s creditors,
citing to Probate Code §18200.  Plaintiff
asserts that on July 26, 2021, Hugo and Geyrin Salguero transferred their
property located at 6400 W. 87th Pl., Los Angeles out of their names
individually and into their revocable living trust.  

            Plaintiff
contends that despite the fact that it is entitled to levy on the assets of the
Salguero Trust by operation of law due to Hugo’s position as trustee and
settlor, defendant has run into problems levying where assets are in the name
of a debtor’s revocable living trust. 
Plaintiff also argue that it is entitled to pursue the trust assets
because they are community property, citing to Family Code §910.

            The
Court rules as follows:  Under Probate
Code §18200, “[i]f the settlor retains the power to revoke the trust in whole
or in part, the trust property is subject to the claims of creditors of the
settlor to the extent of the power of revocation during the lifetime of the
settlor.”  To enforce a judgment against
trust property, a judgment must be entered against those who hold title to such
property, the trustees.  Portico
Management Group, LLC v. Harrison (2011) 202 Cal. App. 4th 464,
474.  “[I]t is clear that the proper
procedure for one who wishes to ensure that trust property will be available to
satisfy a judgment, whether for damages for breach of contract or for specific
performance, should sue the trustee in his or her representative capacity.”  Galdjie v. Darwish (2003) 113 Cal.
App. 4th 1331, 1349.  Here,
there is no judgment against the trustees. 
Plaintiff does not explain how it seeks to have the Court “enforce the
judgment” against the trustees.  Further,
the notice of motion cites to no authority.

            The
motion is thus DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

 

ORDER

            The
motion is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

            Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of ruling.
