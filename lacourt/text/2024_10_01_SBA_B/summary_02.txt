And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial date and all trial-related dates. The defendants had requested a continuance due to a "significant change in the status of the case" caused by the plaintiff's recent surgery, which was rescheduled from August 22, 2024 to September 26, 2024. The defendants argued that they need more time to complete discovery regarding the plaintiff's surgery and obtain medical and billing records. The judge found that the defendants have shown good cause for a continuance and granted the motion. The trial date is continued to a new date, and the discovery cut-off date is also extended.
