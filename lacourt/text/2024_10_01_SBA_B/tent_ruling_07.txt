LEGAL AUTHORITY
CCP § 473(a)(1) provides, in
relevant part:  “The court may, in
furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to
amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party,
or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other
respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or
demurrer.  The court may likewise, in its
discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be
just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may
upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this
code.”
 “This discretion should be exercised liberally
in favor of amendments, for judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed
matters in the same lawsuit.”  Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court
(1989) 213 Cal. App. 3d 1045, 1047.
Under CRC Rule 3.1324(a), a motion
to amend a pleading shall (1) include a copy of the proposed amendment or
amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from
previous pleadings or amendments; (2) state what allegations in the previous
pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph and
line number, the deleted allegations are located; and (3) state what
allegations are proposed to be added to the previous pleading, if any, and
where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the additional allegations are
located.
Under CRC Rule 3.1324(b), a
separate declaration must accompany the motion and must specify (1) the effect
of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the
facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the
reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier.
Even if a good amendment is
proposed in proper form, a long, unwarranted and unexcused delay in presenting
it may be a good reason for denial.  In
most cases, the factors for timeliness are: 
(1) lack of diligence in discovering the facts or in offering the
amendment after knowledge of them; and (2) the effect of the delay on the
adverse party.  If the party seeking the
amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced the opposing party,
the judge has discretion to deny leave to amend.  Hirsa
v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal. App. 3d 486, 490.  Prejudice exists where the amendment would
require delaying the trial, resulting in loss of critical evidence, or added
costs of preparation such as an increased burden of discovery.  Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal. App. 4th 471, 486-488.
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
requests leave to file an amended complaint or, in the alternative, to amend
the complaint as follows:  para. 10.a.(3)
to 12/6/2023; para. 9.b.(1) to 12/11/2023; para 19.g. to 01/01/2024; Exh. 2 to
the correct notice; and Exh. 4 to the correct proof of service.
            Plaintiff
explains that Exhibit 2 to the complaint is a pay or quit notice, which
plaintiff served on November 6, 2023, but that the notice was attached in error
as it is not the most recent notice. 
Plaintiff asserts that it had subsequently served another pay or quit
notice on December 6, 2023 that should have been attached instead.  Plaintiff contends that it was an inadvertent
oversight, and that plaintiff discovered the error when preparing for trial.
            There
is no opposition.
            The
Court rules as follows:  The Court finds that plaintiff
complied with CRC Rule 3.1324.  Further, “[l]eave to amend is in general
required to be liberally granted.”  Kolani
v. Gluska (1998) 64 Cal. App. 4th 402, 412 (citation omitted).  
            The
motion is GRANTED.
 
ORDER
The
motion is GRANTED.

by October 2, 2024.
