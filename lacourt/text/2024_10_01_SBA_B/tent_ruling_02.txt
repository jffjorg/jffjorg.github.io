BACKGROUND
On May 26, 2023, Deven Ronnquist
filed a complaint against John Harris and Jerry Harris for motor vehicle
negligence based on an incident that occurred on June 21, 2021 on the
northbound I-405 freeway.
On August 26, 2024, the Court
granted plaintiff’s motions to compel responses to the extent that defendant
was ordered to serve amended verifications that are dated.  The Court ordered sanctions against defendant
in the sum of $1250.
Trial is set for November 18, 2024.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1332, “(a)
To ensure the prompt disposition of civil cases, the dates assigned for a trial
are firm.  All parties and their counsel
must regard the date set for trial as certain. 
(b) A party seeking a continuance of the date set for trial, whether
contested or uncontested or stipulated to by the parties, must make the request
for a continuance by a noticed motion or an ex parte application under the
rules in chapter 4 of this division, with supporting declarations.  The party must make the motion or application
as soon as reasonably practical once the necessity for the continuance is
discovered.  (c) Although continuances of
trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its
own merits.  The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance. . . .”   
            CRC Rule 3.1332(d) sets forth other
factors that are relevant in determining whether to grant a continuance.
DISCUSSION
            Defendants
John Harris and Jerry Harris request that the Court continue trial and all
trial related dates.  Defendants request
that the trial be continued to March 3, 2025.
            Defendants
argue that they have good cause because of a “significant change in the status
of the case.”  Defendants explain that
plaintiff was scheduled to receive [neck] surgery on August 22, 2024, but that
the surgery was rescheduled to September 26, 2024.  Defendants argue that with the current trial
date and the fact discovery cutoff on October 21, 2024, defendants are unable
to complete discovery regarding plaintiff’s surgery.  Defendants assert that they need to obtain
the complete medical and billing records from the surgery and depose the
surgery facility’s PMK plaintiff’s surgeon. 
Defendants point out that the trial date has not been previously
continued.  
            In
opposition, plaintiff argues that defendants have failed to show good cause for
a continuance and plaintiff is entitled to a preferential trial date.  Plaintiff asserts that although she is having
surgery on September 26, 2024, and the discovery cut-off is October 19,
defendants have not shown why the “allotted time would be insufficient to
acquire the necessary medical records and depose the surgeon.”  Further, plaintiff contends, such information
can be obtained through plaintiff’s designated experts.
            In
reply, defendants argue that plaintiff is not entitled to a trial preference as
she has not filed a motion and that plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration is
insufficient.  Defendants also reiterate
their argument that plaintiff’s recent surgery is good cause to continue the
trial date, including that the medical and billing records will not
automatically be available on September 26 and defendants will have to subpoena
the records and serve a notice to consumer, and provide statutory time for the
medical facility to respond; and take depositions of the doctors to lay
foundation, which is time consuming.
            The
Court finds that defendants have shown good cause for a continuance based on
plaintiff’s recent surgery.
The
motion is GRANTED.
 
ORDER
            The
motion is GRANTED.
            The
November 8, 2024 final status conference is continued to _____________.  The November 18, 2024 trial date is continued
to _________________.
The
discovery cut-off date is as to the new trial date.
            Defendants
are ordered to give notice of the ruling.
