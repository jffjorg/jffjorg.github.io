  - "The Court finds that Robert Alba's declaration was credible, especially considering the level of detail in what occurred. Mata's declaration lacks credibility, including because the evidence indicates that he was informed by plaintiff's counsel's case manager of the incident prior to when defendants were served, although he denies it."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion of defendants Lexlux Associates, LP and Alamitos Associates Management, LLC to set aside the default and default judgment entered against them. The defendants had argued that they were never properly served with the lawsuit and that they did not have actual notice of the lawsuit until much later. However, the judge found that the registered process server's declaration was credible and that the agent for service's declaration lacked credibility. The judge also noted that the defendants did not serve and file with the notice a copy of a responsive pleading to be filed in the action. As a result, the judge denied the motion to set aside the default and default judgment.
