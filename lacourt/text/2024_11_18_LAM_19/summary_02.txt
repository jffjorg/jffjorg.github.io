Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Dewey Demetro, Jr. v. Robert Ramirez, case number 24STCV20149. The plaintiff, Dewey Demetro, Jr., brought a lawsuit against the defendant, Robert Ramirez, alleging denial of due process. The defendant filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that it is uncertain and fails to state a cause of action.

The judge agrees with the defendant that the complaint is uncertain and fails to state a cause of action. The judge also finds that the defendant is immune from liability based on the doctrine of quasi-judicial immunity. Therefore, the judge sustains the defendant's demurrer and dismisses the complaint.

The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint, as there is no reasonable possibility that the defects can be cured by amendment. The defendant is ordered to submit a proposed judgment of dismissal, and the court sets a non-appearance care review for November 27, 2024.
