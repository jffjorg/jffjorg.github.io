Case #23CHCV03799
 
MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Motion filed on 8/1/24.
 
MOVING ATTORNEY: Brett Yorke
CLIENT: Plaintiff Billy Jean Goulette
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order relieving Brett Yorke
as counsel for Plaintiff Billy Jean Goulette in this action.
 
RULING: The motion is placed off calendar.
 
On 8/1/24, attorney Brett Yorke filed the instant motion
seeking an order relieving him as counsel for Plaintiff Billy Jean Goulette
(Plaintiff) in this action.  The proof of
service attached to the motion indicates that the motion was served on 7/8/24 by
electronic mail, only, on counsel for Defendant Extended Stay (Defendant) and
on Plaintiff.  While electronic service
of the motion on counsel for Defendant was proper, there is no evidence that
Plaintiff agreed to electronic service.  See
CCP 1010.6(b), (c). 
 
The motion was originally scheduled for hearing on 2/20/25.  On 8/5/24, pursuant to Plaintiff’s counsel’s
ex parte application, the hearing on the motion was advanced to 9/5/24 and
Plaintiff’s counsel was ordered to give notice. 
(See 8/5/24 Minute Order). 
While the notice of ruling on the ex parte application was served on
Plaintiff via U.S. mail and email, as noted above, the proof of service for the
motion only shows that it was served by email on Plaintiff.   
 
There is no response to the motion by Plaintiff to cure
the defect in service of the actual motion on Plaintiff.  Additionally, the proposed order does not
include Plaintiff’s telephone number as required in number 6.
