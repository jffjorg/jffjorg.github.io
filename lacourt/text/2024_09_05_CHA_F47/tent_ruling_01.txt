MOTION FOR
JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS
 
Motion filed on 8/5/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Rock Creek Capital, LLC
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Norma S. Carcamo
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order entering judgment for
Plaintiff and against Defendant in this matter. 

 
RULING: The motion is placed off calendar.  
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION & PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
 
On 1/30/23, Plaintiff Rock Creek Capital, LLC (Plaintiff)
filed this action against Defendant Norma S. Carcamo (Defendant) for breach of
contract.  On 4/4/23, Defendant,
representing herself, filed an answer to the complaint.  
 
On 2/2/24, Plaintiff served Defendant, by U.S. Mail, with
Requests for Admissions, Set 1. Defendant failed to serve responses.  Therefore, on 4/4/24, Plaintiff filed and
served a motion seeking an order deeming the truth of matters specified in
Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions served on Defendant.  Defendant did not oppose or otherwise respond
to the motion.  On 7/11/24, the Court
granted the motion to deem the requests for admissions admitted and ordered Plaintiff
to give notice.  (See 7/11/24
Minute Order).  There is no evidence in
the court file that Plaintiff gave notice of the 7/11/24 ruling.  
 
On 8/5/24, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for
judgment on the pleadings which requests that the Court enter Judgment for
Plaintiff and against Defendant in this matter. 
Defendant has not opposed or otherwise responded to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
There is no evidence that the instant motion for judgment
on the pleadings was served on Defendant. 
No proofs of service are attached to the moving papers filed on
8/5/24.  The separate proof of service
filed by Plaintiff’s counsel on 8/5/24, which would seemingly be for the
instant motion, indicates that it is for: 
 
1. 
NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, OR ALTERNATIVELY, FOR
SUMMARY ADJUDICATION OF ISSUES, IN FAVOR OF PLAINTIFF; 
 
2. 
NOTICE OF NONAPPEARANCE AT PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OR
ALTERNATIVELY PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION; 
 
3. 
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF'S MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, OR ALTERNATIVELY, FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION OF ISSUES; 
 
4. 
SEPARATE STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS IN SUPPORT MOTION FOR SUMMARY
JUDGMENT, OR ALTERNATIVELY, FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION OF ISSUES IN FAVOR OF
PLAINTIFF; 
 
5. 
NOTICE OF LODGMENT OF EXHIBITS IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR
SUMMARY JUDGMENT, OR ALTERNATIVELY, FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION OF ISSUES; 
 
6. 
[PROPOSED] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT 
 
A motion for summary judgment and the necessary
supporting documents have not been filed. 
CCP 437(b)(1).  Additionally,
service of documents on 8/5/24 for a 9/5/24 hearing date would not provide the
necessary 75 days plus 5 days notice required when a motion for summary
judgment is served by mail.  See
CCP 437(a)(2).  However, it seems like a
motion for summary judgment would be the appropriate motion rather than the
motion for judgment on the pleadings which has been filed. 
 
Further, contrary to Plaintiff’s assertion, Coyne
(1950) 36 C2d 257, 262 does not indicate that “[i]f the Motion to Deem Matters
Admitted establishes Defendant has no defense a Motion for Summary Judgment
under California Case of Civil Procedure section 437c cannot be granted, the
defect may be raised by (1) demurrer or (2) a motion to strike, or (3) by Motion
for Judgment on the Pleadings.”  (See
Memorandum of Points & Authorities, p.2:4-8).  Rather, Coyne notes that it is not the
purpose of a motion for summary judgment under CCP 437c to test the sufficiency
of the pleadings and goes on to state that “[i]f the pleadings are
insufficient, the defect may be raised by demurrer or motion to strike, or by
motion for judgment on the pleadings.”  See
Coyne, supra.
 
Plaintiff goes on to contend that Defendant’s answer is
insufficient based on the matters deemed admitted by the Court on 7/11/24.  However, Plaintiff has not made a proper
request for judicial notice of the order. 
A request for judicial notice must be made in a separate document.  See CRC 3.1113(l).  Here, Plaintiff merely makes the request for
judicial notice within the memorandum of points and authorities in support of
the motion.  (See Memorandum of
Points & Authorities, p.4:1-3). 
Plaintiff also refers to an exhibit (the Order which is purportedly
attached as Exhibit 1) which is not included with the motion.  (See Memorandum of Points &
Authorities, p.3:23-24).  Plaintiff has
failed to provide sufficient authority and/or analysis to establish that a
motion for judgment on the pleadings, rather than a motion for summary
judgment, is the appropriate vehicle for obtaining judgment in its favor under
the circumstances.  
 
Plaintiff also improperly includes a request for an award
of costs in the motion.  Such a request
should be made by the filing of a memorandum of costs after judgment has
been entered in favor of Plaintiff. 
Here, Plaintiff filed a memorandum of costs at the same time the motion
for judgment on the pleadings was filed. 
     
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is placed off calendar.
