And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to relieve attorney Brett Yorke as counsel for Billy Jean Goulette is placed off calendar. The motion was filed on August 1, 2024, and served on counsel for the defendant and Plaintiff via electronic mail. However, there is no evidence that Plaintiff agreed to electronic service, and the proof of service does not show service on Plaintiff by U.S. mail. Additionally, the proposed order does not include Plaintiff's telephone number as required. The Judge notes that there is no response to the motion by Plaintiff to cure the defect in service, and the motion is therefore denied. The hearing date was originally set for February 20, 2025, but was advanced to September 5, 2024, pursuant to an ex parte application.
