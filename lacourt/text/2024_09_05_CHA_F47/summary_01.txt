And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the Plaintiff, Rock Creek Capital, LLC, is placed off calendar due to several procedural issues. The Plaintiff failed to properly serve the Defendant, Norma S. Carcamo, with the motion and did not provide sufficient authority and/or analysis to establish that a motion for judgment on the pleadings is the appropriate vehicle for obtaining judgment in its favor. Additionally, the Plaintiff failed to give notice of the court's previous ruling deeming the requests for admissions admitted, and improperly included a request for an award of costs in the motion. The judge also notes that the Plaintiff failed to make a proper request for judicial notice of the order deeming the requests for admissions admitted, and did not include the relevant exhibit with the motion.
