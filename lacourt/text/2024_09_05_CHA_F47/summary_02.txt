And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has placed the motion to relieve attorney Charles Oglesby of his representation of plaintiff Edwardo Malave off calendar. The motion was filed on May 3, 2024, and was originally scheduled for a hearing on December 16, 2024. However, the court advanced the hearing date to September 5, 2024, on August 2, 2024, after an ex parte application by plaintiff's counsel. Despite this, there is no evidence that plaintiff's counsel gave notice to plaintiff or defendant's counsel of the advanced hearing date, and no response has been received to cure the defect in notice.
