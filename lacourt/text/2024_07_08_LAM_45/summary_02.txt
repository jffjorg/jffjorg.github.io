And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to seal the records in this case. The plaintiff, who is acting pro se, filed a lawsuit for wrongful termination in 2011 and was terminated. Ten years later, the plaintiff seeks to seal the records in this case and requests a redaction order to protect their identity. However, the judge has ruled that the motion cannot be granted because the plaintiff did not file proof of service on the other parties that have appeared in the case and the motion is untimely. The judge also cited California Rules of Court and a previous case, Savaglio v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., to support their decision.
