And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of John Vasquez v. Thomas P. Schmalzried, M.D., et al. The court sustains the demurrer to the first cause of action for strict product liability, without leave to amend. The court sustains the demurrer to the sixth cause of action for breach of express warranty, with 20 days' leave to amend. The court overrules the demurrer to the third, fourth, and fifth causes of action. The court denies the motion to strike.

The court notes that the parties did not meet and confer as required under CCP § 430.41(a), and that the demurrer and motion to strike were filed without providing Plaintiff with an opportunity to amend the complaint.

The court finds that the Complaint properly alleges fraud against Schmalzried and TPS, but that the sixth cause of action for breach of express warranty is defective because it fails to plead the notice requirement. The court also finds that the fifth cause of action for breach of implied warranties is sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.

The court orders that the demurrer to the fifth cause of action be overruled, and that the motion to strike be denied. The court grants the requests for judicial notice of certain orders in other cases.
