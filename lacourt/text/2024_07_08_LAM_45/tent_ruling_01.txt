Background
This is a product liability case involving
an allegedly defective hip implant, the Pinnacle Hip System. On April 5, 2023,
Plaintiff John Vasquez (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against defendants Thomas P. Schmalzried, M.D. (“Schmalzried”),
Thomas P. Schmalzried, M.D., A Professional Corporation (“TPS”) (collectively,
“Defendants”), Medical Device Business Services, Inc. (f/k/a DePuy, Inc.), et
al., alleging six causes of action for (1) Strict Product Liability, (2)
Negligence, (3) Fraud, (4) Negligent Misrepresentation, (5) Breach of Implied
Warranties, and (6) Breach of Express Warranty. 
On July 14, 2023, Defendants filed
a demurrer to the first, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action in
the Complaint, and a motion to strike portions of the Complaint.
Defendants’
demurrer and motion to strike came on for hearing on May 22, 2023. The Court
found that the parties did not meet and confer as required under CCP §§
430.41(a) and 435.5. The Court continued the hearing to this date. Defendants
were ordered to file meet-and-confer declarations no later than seven court
days prior to the continued hearing date. Both parties were granted leave to
file supplemental briefing. (5/22/24 Minute Order.) 
On June 24,
2024, Plaintiff filed a supplemental opposition to Defendants’ demurrer and motion
to strike. 
On June 26,
2024, Defendants supplemental papers in support of their demurrer and motion to
strike.
 
Legal
Standard
When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of
the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The
only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
CCP § 430.41(a) states, in relevant part:
“Before filing a demurrer . . . the demurring party shall meet and confer in
person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.”
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
            Plaintiff requests judicial notice
of four orders in three different California Superior Court cases, Pool v.
DePuy Orthopaedics, et al., LASC Case No. BC465008, Marquay v. Johnson
& Johnson Services, Inc., et al., SFSC Case No. 20STCV24678, and
Newton v. Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc., et al., SFSC Case No. 21STCV08729.
            Defendants request judicial notice
of an order in Rosie Morris v. DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. et al., SFSC
Case No. CJC-10-004649.
            The requests are granted pursuant to
Evidence Code § 452(d). The Court takes judicial notice of the existence of the
records, but not the truth of the matters contained in the records. (Sosinsky
v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.)
 
Discussion
Meet and Confer
Counsel for Defendants declares that he
met and conferred telephonically with Plaintiff’s counsel on June 13, 2024.
(Cohen Supp. Decl., ¶ 2.) During the call, Defendants’ counsel identified the
causes of action subject to demurrer and the legal basis for Defendants’
demurrer. Plaintiff agreed to dismiss his first cause of action for strict
product liability, but the parties were otherwise unable to reach an agreement.
(Id., ¶ 4.) The meet-and-confer declaration has been met. 
 
First COA for Strict Product Liability
Counsel for Defendants represents that
Plaintiff agreed to dismiss the first cause of action in the Complaint for
Strict Liability Design Defect. (Cohen Supp. Decl., ¶ 4.) The demurrer is
granted as to this cause of action.
 
Third and Fourth COAs for Fraud
and Negligent Misrepresentation
“The elements of
fraud are (a) a misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or
nondisclosure); (b) scienter or knowledge of its falsity; (c) intent to induce
reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Hinesley v.
Oakshade Town Ctr. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) The facts constituting
the alleged fraud must be alleged factually and specifically as to every
element of fraud, as the policy of “liberal construction” of the pleadings will
not ordinarily be invoked. (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th
631, 645.) 
To properly
allege fraud against a corporation, the plaintiff must plead the names of the
persons allegedly making the false representations, their authority to speak,
to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written. (Tarmann
v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.) 
“The tort of
negligent misrepresentation is similar to fraud, except that it does not
require scienter or an intent to defraud. . . . [T]he same elements of intentional
fraud also comprise a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation, with the
exception that there is no requirement of intent to induce reliance . . . .” (Tenet
Healthsystem Desert, Inc. v. Blue Cross of California (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 821, 845, internal citation omitted; CACI No. 1903.)
Plaintiff
properly pled fraud against Schmalzried: Schmalzried made misrepresentations
and material omissions to Plaintiff regarding the Pinnacle Hip System’s safety
and effectiveness (Compl., ¶¶ 112-113, 80, 120, 121); Schmalzried knew that
those representations were false but made them with the intent of inducing
Plaintiff’s reliance (id., ¶ 114); Plaintiff justifiably relied on Schmalzried
(id., ¶¶ 116, 80, 123); and Plaintiff was injured as a consequence (id., ¶¶
117, 81, 82, 84, 124).
Plaintiff also
properly pled fraud against TPS: Schmalzried made the false representation that
the Pinnacle Hip System is “safe and effective” to Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s
orthopedic surgeon, on behalf of TPS, in Schmalzried’s capacity as TPS’s
director, officer, and sole shareholder. (Id., ¶¶ 6, 80.) Schmalzried made
misrepresentations and omissions in writing in brochures that were given to
Plaintiff’s orthopedic surgeon. (Id., ¶ 55.)
The demurrer is
overruled as to the third and fourth causes of action.
 
Sixth COA for
Breach of Express Warranty
“An express warranty ‘is a contractual
promise from the seller that the goods conform to the promise. . . .’ ” (Dagher
v. Ford Motor Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 905, 928.) “The essential elements
of a cause of action under the California Uniform Commercial Code for breach of
an express warranty to repair defects are (1) an express warranty to repair
defects given in connection with the sale of goods; (2) the existence of a
defect covered by the warranty; (3) the buyer’s notice to the seller of such a
defect within a reasonable time after its discovery; (4) the seller’s failure
to repair the defect in compliance with the warranty; and (5) resulting
damages.” (Orichian v. BMW of North America, LLC (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th
1322, 1333-1334, internal citations omitted; CACI No. 1230.) 
Here, Plaintiff failed to plead the notice
requirement. Nowhere in the Complaint does Plaintiff allege that he informed
either Schmalzried or TPS of the defective nature
of his hip replacement after he first discovered in October 2020 that the
Pinnacle Hip System could be hurting him. (Compl., ¶ 85.) Defendants were not
given a chance to repair any alleged defect.
Accordingly, the
demurrer to the sixth cause of action is sustained with 20 days’ leave to
amend. 
 
Fifth COA for
Breach of Implied Warranties
“Unlike an express warranty, ‘the implied
warranty of merchantability arises by operation of law’ and ‘provides for a
minimum level of quality.’” (Isip v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (2007) 155
Cal.App.4th 19, 26-27, internal citations omitted.) “‘Implied warranty of
merchantability’ or ‘implied warranty that goods are merchantable’ means that
the consumer goods meet each of the following: [¶] (1) Pass without objection
in the trade under the contract description. [¶] (2) Are fit for the ordinary
purposes for which such goods are used. [¶] (3) Are adequately contained,
packaged, and labeled. [¶] (4) Conform to the promises or affirmations of fact
made on the container or label.” (Civ. Code, § 1791.1, subd. (a); CACI No.
3210.) The core test of merchantability is fitness for the ordinary purpose for
which such goods are used. (Isip, supra, at 26-27.)
Plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded the
Pinnacle Hip System’s abnormally dangerous nature. (See Compl., ¶¶ 51-54 [high
numbers of complaints and injuries from patients who received a Pinnacle hip
transplant]; ¶¶ 58-79 [recall of a substantially identical hip system].)
Plaintiff alleges that the Johnson & Johnson defendants have received more
than 2,500 reports claiming that the Pinnacle Hip System failed. (Compl., ¶
52.) Plaintiff was injured as a result of buying and using Defendants’ hip
system. (Id., ¶ 131.)
The demurrer to the fifth cause of action
is overruled.
 
Motion to Strike
Defendants’ motion to strike allegations
regarding punitive damages is denied. As discussed above, Plaintiff properly
alleged a cause of action for fraud, which is sufficient to support a claim for
punitive damages. 
 
            It
is so ordered.
