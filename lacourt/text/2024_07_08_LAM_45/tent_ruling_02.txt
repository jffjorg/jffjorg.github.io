Hearing date:  July 8, 2024
Moving Party:  Plaintiff, DonRay Jones, Jr. 
Responding
Party:  none
Motion
to Seal
The Court
considered the moving papers.
            The
motion is denied.
Background
            Plaintiff
filed a lawsuit for wrongful termination in 2011. In 2014, the Court entered
judgment against Plaintiff. Now, ten years later, Plaintiff seeks to seal the
records in this lawsuit. Plaintiff also requests that the Court “order any
website publishing information about this case to take down the information. If
an order to seal is not possible”, Plaintiff asks that the court issue a
“redaction order” to protect Plaintiff’s identity. 
            Plaintiff
is acting pro se. The motion is unopposed.
Legal
Standard
Unless
confidentiality is required by law, court records are presumed to be open to
the public.¿ (CRC Rule 2.550(c).)¿ Therefore, pleadings, motions, discovery
documents, and other papers may not be filed under seal merely by stipulation
of the parties; a prior court order must be obtained by way of noticed motion.¿
(CRC Rule 2.551(a)&(b)(1).)¿ 
“If documents
are filed in court before the motion is granted, the right to move for an order
sealing the documents is waived. The court cannot entertain a later motion to
seal documents that are already a matter of public record. [Savaglio v.
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., supra, 149 CA4th at 601, 57 CR3d at 224].”
¿(Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-I.) 
California Rules
of Court, Rule 2.551(b)(2), sets out the means of service for a motion to
seal.¿It states: “A copy of the motion or application must be served on all
parties that have appeared in the case. Unless the court orders otherwise, any
party that already possesses copies of the records to be placed under seal must
be served with a complete, unredacted version of all papers as well as a
redacted version.” (CRC, Rule 2.551(b)(2).)
Discussion
            Plaintiff’s
motion cannot be granted. First, Plaintiff did not file proof of service of the
motion on the other parties that have appeared in this case. Second,
Plaintiff’s motion is untimely. This case was disposed of ten years ago. (See Savaglio
v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., (2007) 149 Cal. App. 4th 588,
601 [“any reading of rules 2.550 and 2.551 that encourages an open-ended time
frame for filing a motion to seal records long after the underlying substantive
matter has been decided would defeat the purpose of the rules”].) 
            The motion is
denied.
            It
is so ordered.
