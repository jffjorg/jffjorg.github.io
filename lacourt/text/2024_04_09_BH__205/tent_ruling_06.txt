 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR
  SUMMARY ADJUDICATION FOR UNLAWFUL DETAINER  



 
Background
 
This is an
unlawful detainer action concerning a property located at 22413 Dardeene
Street, Calabasas, CA 91302 (the “Subject Property”). On January 10, 2024,
Plaintiff Arkas LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed a Verified Complaint for Unlawful
Detainer (the “Complaint”) against Defendants Lloyd Douglas Dix aka Lloyd Dix,
Mary Linda Dix aka Mary Dix, Michael Alexander Dix aka Michael Dix, All Unknown
Occupants, Tenants, and Subtenants (collectively “Defendants”), and DOES 1
through 20, inclusive. 
The Complaint alleges
the following: Plaintiff obtained ownership of the Subject Property after a
non-judicial foreclosure sale properly conducted in accordance with Civil Code
§ 2924, that occurred on or about October 31, 2023. (Complaint, ¶ 10.) Plaintiff
perfected its title under the sale to the Subject Property as reflected in a
duly recorded Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale in Plaintiff’s favor, which was recorded
on December 22, 2023. (Complaint, ¶ 11; Exh. 1.) Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants are currently in possession of the Subject Property without any
right to do so or claim to have a right to occupancy or possession of the
Subject Property, without any right to do so. (Complaint, ¶ 12.) On December
29, 2023, pursuant to CCP § 1162(a), Plaintiff caused to be served on
Defendants a Three/Thirty/Ninety-Day Notice to Quit by a registered process
server. (Complaint, ¶ 13; Exh. 2.) More than three days have passed since the
service of the Notice to Quit. (Complaint, ¶ 14.) Defendants have failed and
refused to deliver possession of the Subject Property. (Complaint, ¶ 14.) Defendants
remain in possession of the Subject Property without the consent of Plaintiff.
(Complaint, ¶ 14.) 
On February 13,
2024, Defendants Lloyd Douglas Dix (aka Lloyd Dix) and Mary Linda Dix (aka Mary
Dix) filed an Answer to the Complaint. 
On February 28,
2024, default was entered against All Unknown Occupants, Tenants, and
Subtenants. 
On March 5, 2024,
default was entered against Defendant Michael Alexander Dix (aka Michael Dix). 
On March 12, 2024,
Plaintiff filed and served the instant Motion for Summary Judgment or, alternatively,
Summary Adjudication for Unlawful Detainer. Plaintiff moves for summary
judgment in its favor against all Defendants. The motion is brought on the
grounds that there is no triable issue of material fact and, as a matter of
law, Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on its sole cause of action for
unlawful detainer. 
Plaintiff’s motion
is unopposed. 
Request for Judicial Notice 
            “Courts
can take judicial notice of the existence, content and authenticity of public
records and other specified documents, but do not take judicial notice of the
truth of the factual matters asserted in those documents.” (Glaski v. Bank
of America (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1090.) 
            The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice. 
Motion for Summary
Judgment/Summary Adjudication Standard
 
            The function of a motion for summary judgment
or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party
cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order
of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826,
843.) Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary
judgment if all the evidence submitted, and all inferences reasonably deducible
from the evidence and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that
there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler
v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The
function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the
scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to
disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited
by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of
Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67.) 
            “The
procedures governing a motion for summary judgment in an unlawful detainer
action are streamlined (e.g., separate statements are not required under
section 437c, subdivision (s) of the Code of Civil Procedure, but such a motion
shall be granted or denied on the same basis as a motion under [Code of Civil
Procedure s]ection 437c.” (Borden v. Stiles (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th
337, 344-45.) In the unlawful detainer context, “[a] motion for summary
judgment may be made at any time after the answer is filed upon giving five
days notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1170.7.) “Motions for summary adjudication
are procedurally identical to motions for summary judgment.” (Dunn v. County
of Santa Barbara (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1290.) “The
summary judgment statute [is] not intended nor can it be used as a substitute
for existing methods in the trial of issues of fact.” (Travelers Indemn. Co.
v. McIntosh (1952) 112 Cal.App.2d 177, 182.) The summary judgment
“procedure is drastic and should be used with caution.” (House v. Lala (1960)
180 Cal.App.2d 412, 415.) “Any doubt in granting summary judgment should be
exercised against the moving party.” (Ibid.) 
            “In
moving for summary judgment, a plaintiff . . . has met his burden of showing
that there is no defense to a cause of action if he has proved each element of
the cause of action entitling him to judgment on that cause of action.” (Borden
v. Stiles, supra, 92 Cal.App.5th 337, 345, internal
quotations omitted.) “Once the plaintiff . . . has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the defendant . . . to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.,
internal quotations omitted.) “The defendant . . . may not rely upon the mere
allegations or denials of his pleadings to show that a triable issue of
material fact exists.” (Ibid., internal quotations omitted.) 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff contends that this action is brought under CCP §
1161a and that it is entitled to summary judgment.
Relevant
Legal Standards for Post-Foreclosure Unlawful Detainers
            “[A] person who holds over and
continues in possession of . . . real property after a three-day written notice
to quit the property has been served upon the person, or if there is a
subtenant in actual occupation of the premises, also upon such subtenant, as
prescribed in Section 1162, may be removed therefrom.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1161a, subd. (b).) Such removal may occur “[w]here the property has been sold
in accordance with Section 2924 of the Civil Code, under a power of sale contained
in a deed of trust executed by such person, or a person under whom such person
claims, and the title under the sale has been duly perfected.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1161a, subd. (b)(3).) “Delivery of the deed by the trustee makes conclusive
the presumption that the sale was properly conducted . . . [under Civil Code
section 2924] and recordation of the deed perfects the title.” (Matson v.
S.B.S. Trust Deed Network (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 33, 41.) 
            A notice to quit may be served: (1)
by delivering a copy to the occupant personally; (2) if he or she is absent
from his or her place of residence, and from his or her usual place of
business, by leaving a copy with someone of suitable age and discretion at
either place, and sending a copy through the mail addressed to the occupant at
his or her place of residence; or (3) if such place of residence cannot be
ascertained, or if a person of suitable age or discretion there can not be
found, then by affixing a copy in a conspicuous place on the property, and also
by delivering a copy to a person there residing, if such person can be found;
and also sending a copy through the mail addressed to the occupant at the place
where the property is situated. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1162, sudbs. (a)(1)-(3).) Service
on a subtenant may be accomplished in a manner articulated in CCP § 1162(a).
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1162, subd. (a)(3).) A notice to quit served on one
defendant is deemed as sufficient notice to such defendant’s co-occupants. (University
of Southern Cal. v. Weiss (1962) 208 Cal.App.3d 759, 769.) 
            Under Civil Code section 2924,
“[t]he trustee starts the nonjudicial foreclosure process by recording a notice
of default and election to sell.” (Yvanova v. New Century Mortgage Corp. (2016)
62 Cal.4th 919, 927.) “After a three-month waiting period, and at
least twenty days before the scheduled sale, the trustee may publish, post, and
record a notice of sale.” (Ibid.) “If the sale is not postponed and the
borrower does not exercise his or her rights of reinstatement or redemption, the
property is sold at auction to the highest bidder.” (Ibid.)
Plaintiff’s
Undisputed Material Facts and Discussion
            Plaintiff’s motion for summary
judgment is unopposed and therefore all material facts presented in support of
the motion are undisputed. Plaintiff presents the following undisputed material
facts: a Deed of Trust (“DOT”), executed by borrower Lloyd Douglas Dix, was
recorded against the Subject Property on July 5, 2018, securing a loan in the
amount of $400,000.00. (Plaintiff’s Undisputed Material Facts at No. 1.) A
Substitution of Trustee (“SOT”) was recorded on November 20, 2018, substituting
RESS Financial Corporation in as the new trustee for the DOT, in place of the
original trustee which had been First American Title Company. (Id. at
No. 2.) On March 31, 2021, RESS Financial Corporation, as Trustee, recorded a
Notice of Default and Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust (“NOD”) against the
Subject Property, indicating a default amount of $12,335.00 as of March 25, 2021
under the loan secured by the DOT. (Id. at No. 3.) On January 4, 2023, a
Notice of Trustee’s Sale (“NOTS”) was recorded against the Subject Property by
RESS Financial Corporation, as Trustee, indicating that the Subject Property
would be sold, and that the estimated debt at the time was $587,335.88. (Id.
at No. 4.) 
            On October 31, 2023, the Subject
Property was purchased by Plaintiff at a public auction for a winning bid of
$750,000.00. (Id. at No. 5.) The Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale (“TDUS”)
granting Plaintiff title to the Subject Property was recorded on December 22,
2023 (Id. at No. 6). The Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale contained a recital
regarding the notice of default and notice of sale, which indicated that such
notices complied with all requirements of the law pertaining to mailing,
posting, publication, and recordation (Id. at No. 7), and the Deed of Trust
recorded on July 5, 2018, contained language concerning the trustee’s deed upon
sale (Id. at No. 8). At the time Plaintiff purchased the Subject
Property, Plaintiff made payment for value, in good faith, in legal tender, and
without having any notice of any others’ asserted rights and having reviewed
title records and not seeing or being aware of any notice of lis pendens
on title, and not being aware of any irregularities or defects in the conduct
of the nonjudicial foreclosure sale. (Id. at No. 9.) 
            Plaintiff presents the following
further undisputed material facts: on December 29, 2023, California registered
process server, Marco Toscano, served Defendants and all unknown occupants,
tenants, and subtenants with a Notice to Quit pursuant to CCP § 1162, by
posting copies on a conspicuous place on the property, and mailing the
documents to the occupants at the Subject Property. (Id. at No. 10.)
Notwithstanding service of the Notice to Quit, Defendants remain in possession
of the Subject Property and continue to claim the right to possess the Subject
Property. (Id. at No. 11.) The instant unlawful detainer complaint was
filed on January 10, 2024, which is more than three days after the Notices to
Quit were served. (Id. at No. 12.) 
            The Court finds that Plaintiff has
met its burden in showing the existence of each element of its cause of action
for unlawful detainer pursuant to CCP § 1161a(b)(3). Plaintiff has presented undisputed
material facts that: (1) Plaintiff’s acquisition of the Subject Property and
the title thereto were in compliance with Civ. Code § 2924; (2) Plaintiff properly
served Defendants and all other occupants of the Subject Property with the
Notice to Quit; (3) Plaintiff waited the required three days before filing this
action after service of the Notice to Quit; and (4) Defendants continue to
remain in possession of the Subject Property. 
            Given that the motion is unopposed,
Defendants have not met their burden in showing the existence of a triable
issue of material fact. Moreover, due to the lack of an opposition, there is
“an inference that the motion is meritorious.” (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) By failing to oppose the motion,
Defendants have conceded to the arguments raised in the motion because
“[c]ontentions are waived when a party fails to support them with reasoned
argument and citations to legal authority.” (Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v.
Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.) 
Conclusion
Accordingly, the
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment.
