And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted Plaintiff ARKAS LLC's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication for unlawful detainer. The Plaintiff acquired the Subject Property through a non-judicial foreclosure sale and served a Notice to Quit on Defendants and all unknown occupants. Despite the Notice to Quit, Defendants failed to vacate the property, and the Plaintiff filed this action for unlawful detainer. The judge found that the Plaintiff met its burden in showing the existence of each element of its cause of action for unlawful detainer and that Defendants failed to show the existence of a triable issue of material fact. The judge granted the Plaintiff's motion, finding that the Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment or summary adjudication for unlawful detainer.
