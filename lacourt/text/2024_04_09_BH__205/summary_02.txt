And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Webcor's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Plaintiff Quality Cabinet and Fixture Company, LLC. The proposed cross-complaint asserts causes of action against the plaintiff for breach of contract, express contractual indemnity, and equitable indemnity. The judge finds that the proposed cross-complaint is compulsory because it arises from the same transaction that gives rise to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint against the defendant. The judge also notes that there is no evidence of bad faith on the part of the defendant in seeking to file the cross-complaint. The defendant is ordered to file and serve the proposed cross-complaint within five calendar days of the date of the order.
