And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for an order setting aside a dismissal of an action. The action arises from a breach of an agreement to pay for legal services. The plaintiff, Novian & Novian, LLP, filed a complaint against the defendants, Raphael Berry, et al., alleging causes of action for breach of written contract, common count: goods and services rendered, account stated, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment. The court dismissed the action without prejudice. The plaintiff moves to set aside the dismissal, alleging that the court's mistake and inadvertence resulted in the failure to attend the OSC hearing. The court finds that the dismissal was due to the plaintiff's mistake and inadvertence and grants the motion. The court also finds that the plaintiff is not required to pay reasonable compensatory fees and costs to the opposing parties.
