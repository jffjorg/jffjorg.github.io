And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment against the defendants. The plaintiff had filed a complaint alleging four causes of action for breach of contract against the defendants, and defaults were entered against the defendants on January 23, 2024. The plaintiff then filed papers seeking entry of default judgment against the defendants in the total amount of $41,696.84. The judge found the application to be deficient due to the lack of personal knowledge by the plaintiff's counsel and insufficient supporting documentation. The judge ruled that the application for entry of default judgment is denied.
