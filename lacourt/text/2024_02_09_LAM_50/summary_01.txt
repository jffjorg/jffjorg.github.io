And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants Plaintiffs' motion for relief from waiver of their constitutional right to a trial by jury. The court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated the timeliness of their request and that they did not delay in rescheduling the jury trial. The court also notes that the right to trial by jury is a fundamental part of our system of jurisprudence and should be zealously guarded by the courts. The court orders that Plaintiffs shall give notice of this ruling.

The basis for the court's decision is that the Plaintiffs have shown that they have a valid reason for seeking relief from the waiver of their right to a trial by jury, and that granting the motion would not cause significant prejudice to the Defendants. The court also finds that the Defendants have not shown any valid reason why the motion should be denied.
