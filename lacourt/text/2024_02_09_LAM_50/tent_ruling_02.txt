[1]The Court’s January 10, 2024 minute order provides, inter
alia, that “[t]he Court sets the case for a Court Trial if Plaintiff
Alleeance Service Group, Inc. and Lee believe they have grounds for making a
Motion for Jury Trial they can file the Motion by January 24, 2024.” 


[2]Defendants indicate that on January 22, 2021,
Plaintiffs filed a Case Management Statement in advance of a February 1, 2021
Case Management Conference indicating that Plaintiffs request a nonjury trial.
(See Heath Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A, Item 5.) Defendants’ counsel states in his
supporting declaration that “I attended the Case Management Conference
conducted by the Court in this matter. At that time and in response to a direct
inquiry from the Court, counsel for Plaintiffs confirmed that his clients were
requesting a court trial and that they did not seek a jury trial.” (Heath
Decl., ¶ 3.)
