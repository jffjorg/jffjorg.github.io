And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling sets forth the current state of the case. The Court had previously scheduled a Case Management Conference for February 1, 2021, and the Plaintiffs, Alleeance Service Group, Inc., had filed a Case Management Statement indicating their intention to request a nonjury trial. At the conference, counsel for the Plaintiffs confirmed that they were seeking a court trial and did not want a jury trial. The Court had also set a deadline for the Plaintiffs to file a motion for a jury trial, which has yet to be filed. The Defendant's counsel has submitted a declaration stating that they believe the Plaintiffs have waived their right to a jury trial. The Judge is considering the Plaintiffs' intentions and the Defendant's counsel's declaration in making their tentative ruling.
