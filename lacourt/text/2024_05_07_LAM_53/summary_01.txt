```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to trifurcate the trial. The court denies the defendant's request to separate the phases of trial on the issues of liability and damages, but grants the request to separate the phases of trial on the issues of punitive damages. The court finds that separating the issues of liability and damages may lead to duplicative testimony and confusion for the jury. The court grants the defendant's request to bifurcate the trial, allowing the jury to first decide the issues of liability and compensatory damages, and then decide the issue of punitive damages.
