**Case Summary**

Case Number: 22STCV34738

 Parties: Amosun Akala, Daniel P. Stelzer, and Stacy Hayes (Plaintiffs) vs. Los Angeles Unified School District (Defendant)

**Tentative Ruling**

The court has considered the motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication filed by the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District (Defendant). The court grants the motion as to the first cause of action for failure to accommodate religious belief or observance and the second cause of action for discrimination based on religion.

**First Cause of Action: Failure to Accommodate Religious Belief or Observance**

The court finds that the defendant has met its burden of showing that the first cause of action has no merit. The defendant has shown that accommodating plaintiffs' requests for exemptions from the COVID-19 vaccination policy would have imposed an undue hardship on the defendant. The court finds that plaintiffs have not met their burden to show that a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether the defendant could have accommodated their requests without imposing an undue hardship.

**Second Cause of Action: Discrimination Based on Religion**

The court finds that the defendant has met its burden of showing that the second cause of action has no merit. The defendant has shown that the termination of plaintiffs was based on a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, namely the defendant's COVID-19 vaccination policy. The court finds that plaintiffs have not met their burden to show that a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether the defendant's proffered reason for terminating them was pretextual.

**Third Cause of Action: Harassment Based on Religion**

The court finds that the defendant has met its burden of showing that the third cause of action has no merit. The court finds that the conduct complained of by plaintiffs does not constitute harassment as a matter of law. The court finds that plaintiffs have not met their burden to show that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the element of acts of severe and pervasive harassment.

**Conclusion**

The court grants the defendant's motion for summary adjudication as to the first cause of action for failure to accommodate religious belief or observance and the second cause of action for discrimination based on religion. The court grants the defendant's motion for summary adjudication as to the third cause of action for harassment based on religion.
