And here is the English-text summary:

The court has considered the objections raised by the defendant regarding the deposition transcripts of individuals taken in other actions. The defendant did not cite authority requiring judicial notice of these documents. The plaintiffs claimed to be willing to pay the costs associated with daily testing, but did not provide authority establishing their legal permission to do so. The defendant argued that such actions may have been unlawful under Labor Code section 2802, subdivision (a). The court also noted that the deposition testimony submitted by the defendant showed that the plaintiffs did not testify to religious harassment.
