Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, Providence Health System – Southern California dba Providence Holy Cross Medical Center. The plaintiff, Ceasar Carrillo, alleges medical malpractice against the defendant, claiming that his mother, Maria G. Carrillo, received negligent treatment at the hospital in 2016, resulting in Ceasar's premature birth and numerous complications. The defendant argues that it is not liable for the alleged malpractice, as the treating physicians were independent contractors and not its employees or agents.

The judge finds that the defendant has met its initial burden to negate an element of the plaintiff's Medical Malpractice cause of action. The plaintiff must now produce substantial evidence showing that a triable issue remains. The judge further finds that the plaintiff has failed to create an issue of material fact regarding Ms. Carillo's treating physicians being ostensible agents of the defendant.

The motion for summary judgment is granted, and the defendant is ordered to submit a proposed judgment within 10 days.
