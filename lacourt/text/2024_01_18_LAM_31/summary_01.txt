And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Kerry Bensinger has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to quash a subpoena issued by Kaiser Foundation Hospitals to Sedgwick Claims Management Services, Inc. seeking documents related to Emmanuel Akuamoah's workers' compensation claims. The subpoena is relevant to the case, as it seeks information regarding Akuamoah's credibility and may support the defendant's argument that it did not discriminate or retaliate against Akuamoah based on his injuries or absences. The judge ruled that Akuamoah's right to privacy does not overcome the discoverability of the documents, as the defendant is a party to Akuamoah's claim for workers' compensation benefits. The motion to quash is denied, and the defendant is ordered to provide notice.
