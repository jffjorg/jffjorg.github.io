Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies the motion for leave to file a third amended complaint. The proposed amendments would introduce new issues not included in the original pleadings and upon which the adverse party had no opportunity to defend. The evidence presented at trial did not establish the newly proposed causes of action, and the amendments would not prejudice the defendants. The court further notes that the various appraisers' qualifications can and will be weighed by the court in its analysis of the issues in Phase One, and the proposed new causes of action are unnecessary and would distract from the issues being tried.
