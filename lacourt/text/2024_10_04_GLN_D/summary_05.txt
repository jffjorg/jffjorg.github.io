And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to strike paragraph 12 of the complaint, which alleges the reasonable rental market value of the subject property is at least $1,666.66 per day. The court finds that the parties have not met and conferred prior to filing the motion, as required by CCP § 435.5, and orders the parties to engage in a meet and confer prior to the motion being called for hearing. The court also assumes the truth of the allegations which appear in the pleading and cannot consider the defendant's declaration in support of the motion. The motion to strike is denied and the parties are given ten days to answer. The court notes that the defendant is in default and needs clarification of his current status.
