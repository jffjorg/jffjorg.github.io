Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the unopposed motion of Counsel Elan B. Zektser to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff Vrezh Papelyan. The reason for the motion is that Counsel has been unable to communicate with the client due to his failure to provide a current address. Counsel has made reasonable efforts to locate a more current address, but has been unable to do so within 30 days before filing the motion. The court finds that Counsel has satisfied the requirements of the California Rules of Court and notes that the trial date has not been set, giving the plaintiff sufficient time to find new counsel. The motion is granted on the condition that Counsel serves a copy of the signed order on the client and all parties that have appeared in the case, and files proof of service with the court within 10 days.
