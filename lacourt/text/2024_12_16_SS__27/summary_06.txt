And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses from the plaintiff. The motion is moot because the further responses were served on November 12, 2024, after the motion was filed. However, the judge has granted sanctions to the defendant because the plaintiff's counsel did not provide any information about the forthcoming responses prior to or on November 12, 2024. The judge orders the plaintiff and her counsel to pay the defendant $960 in sanctions within 20 days from today.
