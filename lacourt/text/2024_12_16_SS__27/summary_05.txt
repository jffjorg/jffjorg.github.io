And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of County of Los Angeles vs. Cacheris Washington, et al. The case stems from an automobile accident that occurred on October 13, 2020, in which Christian Lopez, an on-duty police officer, was rear-ended by a vehicle driven by Cacheris Washington and owned by Taneicia Washington. The case involves a dispute over which party is entitled to $15,000.00 deposited with the court.

The County of Los Angeles filed a complaint against the Washington Defendants for compensatory damages and workers' compensation benefits paid to Lopez. The Washington Defendants filed a cross-complaint and an amended cross-complaint in interpleader. Lopez filed an answer to the amended cross-complaint, alleging that the County's claims were junior to his claims.

The judge has granted the County's Motion to Quash Lopez's subpoena to Sedgwick Claims Management Services, finding that the subpoena is overly broad and seeks protected information. The judge notes that the subpoena is untimely, but California has a strong public policy in favor of deciding cases on the merits, especially if the opposing party has suffered no prejudice.

The judge has also ruled that the County must provide a privilege log pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §2031.240(c)(1) if it chooses to assert privileges in its response to the new subpoena. The judge has scheduled a hearing for December 16, 2024, to consider the tentative ruling.
