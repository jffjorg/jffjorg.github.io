  Case Number:  22STCV19458    Hearing Date:   December 16, 2024    Dept:  27 Hon. Lee S. Arian, Dept 27 
 
MOTION TO CONTINUE
Hearing Date: 12/16/24¿ 
CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV19458 BRADLEY SCHENK vs
KATHRYNN ANGELL, et al.
Moving Party: Defendants
Responding Party: Plaintiff¿ 
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: MOTION GRANTED
 
While the Court primarily agrees with Plaintiff
that the bases for the requested continuance are mostly insufficient and unpersuasive,
the trial conflict with a much older case is a good cause basis for a
continuance.  The Court thus continues
trial to April 28, 2025, and continues the FSC to April 14, 2025.  Discover is continued to align with the new
trial date only for discovery related Dr. Corday.  The new trial date is to be deemed firm.
 
NOTICE:
 
If a party
intends to submit on this tentative ruling, the party
must send an email to the court at sscdept27@lacourt.org with the
Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.  The body of
the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact
information, and the identity of the party submitting.
 
Unless all parties
submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear
remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.  You should
assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.
 
If the
parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off
calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.  After the
Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of
the subject motion without leave.
