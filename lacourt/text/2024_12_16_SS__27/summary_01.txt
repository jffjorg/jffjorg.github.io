And here is the English-text summary:

The judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to continue the trial date in the case of Bradley Schenk vs. Kathrynn Angell, et al. The defendants had requested a continuance, but the court primarily agrees with the plaintiff that the reasons given are insufficient and unpersuasive. However, the court does find that the trial conflict with a much older case is a good cause basis for a continuance. As a result, the trial date is continued to April 28, 2025, and the fees and costs (FSC) hearing is continued to April 14, 2025. Discovery is also continued, but only for discovery related to Dr. Corday. The parties are advised to submit to the tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
