The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Salinas v Transit, granting the defendant Claude Jared Dodson's motion to dismiss without prejudice. The judge denied the defendant's request for monetary sanctions, finding that the notice of motion failed to set forth the statutory basis for the sanctions. The judge cited CCP section 128.7, which requires that a motion for sanctions be made separately and only after safe harbor. The judge noted that absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm shall be held jointly responsible for violations committed by its partners, associates, and employees. The hearing is scheduled for February 8, 2024.
