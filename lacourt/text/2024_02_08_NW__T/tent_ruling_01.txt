  Case Number:  19STCV37977    Hearing Date:   February 8, 2024    Dept:  T 19STCV37977
Salinas v Transit
 
Tentative
ruling: Motion to Dismiss by defendant Claude Jared Dodson – Granted.  Mr. Dodson is dismissed without
prejudice.  Monetary sanctions are
denied.  The notice of motion fails to
set for the statutory basis for the sanctions and CCP section 128.7
specifically requires the motion to be made separately and only after safe
harbor.
 
“(1) A
motion for sanctions under this section shall be made separately from other
motions or requests and shall describe the specific conduct alleged to violate
subdivision (b). Notice of motion shall be served as provided in Section 1010,
but shall not be filed with or presented to the court unless, within 21 days
after service of the motion, or any other period as the court may prescribe,
the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, allegation, or denial is not
withdrawn or appropriately corrected. If warranted, the court may award to the
party prevailing on the motion the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees
incurred in presenting or opposing the motion. Absent exceptional
circumstances, a law firm shall be held jointly responsible for violations
committed by its partners, associates, and employees.”
