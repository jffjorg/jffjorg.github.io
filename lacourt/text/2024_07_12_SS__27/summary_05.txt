And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to seal and maintain confidentiality of the settlement terms between the Plaintiffs and the Settling Defendants, including the settlement amount. The motion was filed by the Settling Defendants, 123 Moving & Storage LLC and Rafael Rodriguez Sanchez, and was unopposed by the Plaintiffs. The Court found that the contractual obligation not to disclose certain information constitutes an overriding interest within the meaning of Rule 2.550(d) of the California Rules of Court, and that the motion is narrowly tailored to only seal the portions of the public document that reveal the confidential terms of the settlement agreement. The Court also found that no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest of maintaining the confidentiality of the settlement terms, and that the parties are not requesting to seal more than what is necessary to protect their agreed-upon confidentiality.
