And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery for the limited purpose of taking depositions of the Defendant's PMKs (Person Most Knowledgeable). The Court finds that the Plaintiff should have the opportunity to depose the PMKs, especially since the Defendant initially agreed to produce them for deposition. The Court also grants the Plaintiff's request to reopen discovery for this limited purpose because fairness and due process require that both parties have an equal chance to prepare for trial.

However, the Court denies the Plaintiff's request to reopen discovery for the purpose of designating a toxicology expert, as this falls outside the scope of fact discovery and is governed by different procedures. The Court also denies the Plaintiff's request to reopen discovery for the purpose of conducting supplemental discovery on the Defendant's sub rosa surveillance, finding that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated diligence in pursuing this discovery and that the discovery cut-off date has already passed.
