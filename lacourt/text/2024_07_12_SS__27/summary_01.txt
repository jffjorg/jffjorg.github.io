And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a creditor's lien against a judgment debtor. The creditor, Law Offices of Melissa B. Buchman, filed two notices of lien against the debtor, Adam Coulter, for attorney's fees related to a confidential parentage action. The debtor argues that the notices of lien are defective and that he has waived his claim of exemption. The judge finds that the notices of lien are valid and that the debtor did not file a claim of exemption within 30 days of receiving notice of the lien. The judge will hear further argument on the claim of exemption.

The judge also notes that the debtor's argument that the creditor impermissibly attached an order when filing the notice of lien is without merit. The judge finds that post-judgment orders for attorney's fees are enforceable under the Enforcement of Judgments Law, and that the purpose of the statute is to secure creditors' rights to money they are owed.

The judge has given the parties notice that they must submit to the tentative ruling by email or appear in person or remotely for oral argument. If the parties do not submit or appear, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
