And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Kevin Collins vs. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). The case involves a motion to compel initial discovery responses and a request for sanctions. The Defendant, MTA, served requests for productions and interrogatories on January 19, 2024, and the responses were due on February 23, 2024. However, the Plaintiff did not serve any responses or request an extension.

The Court has granted the motion to compel initial discovery responses, ordering the Plaintiff to provide complete and verified responses to the Defendant's requests within 30 days. The Court has also awarded sanctions of $1500 to the Defendant, to be paid by the Plaintiff and his counsel jointly and severally within 30 days.

The Court's decision was based on the Plaintiff's failure to serve initial discovery responses, which is a violation of the California Code of Civil Procedure. The Court has discretion to impose monetary sanctions when a party fails to respond to discovery requests, and in this case, the Court has ordered the Plaintiff and his counsel to pay $1500 to the Defendant.
