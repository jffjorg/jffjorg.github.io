The judge has ruled that the petition to approve a minor's compromise should be denied. The claimant and their guardian ad litem are excused from appearing in person, and counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call. The judge also specifies that the petitioner must file a regular petition (MC-350) and not an expedited petition (MC-350EX). The total settlement amount, which exceeds $50,000, will be paid to the claimant and other individuals named in the settlement. A non-appearance case review has been scheduled for July 12, 2024, at 4:00 PM in Department 27, and no appearance is required if receipt is filed in advance. Finally, the judge orders the moving party to give notice.
