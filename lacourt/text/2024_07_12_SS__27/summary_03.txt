And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against the Plaintiff, Delia Ramirez. The motion was filed after the Plaintiff failed to provide responses to discovery propounded by the Defendant, Mokhtar Zhoobin. The Judge found that the Defendant did not demonstrate a history of discovery abuses and that the Plaintiff's failure to comply was not willful. The Judge also noted that the Plaintiff's counsel was recently relieved and that there was a possibility that the Plaintiff would engage more fully in the discovery process with new counsel. The Judge denied the motion without prejudice, allowing the Defendant to reconsider its position if additional efforts are made to engage the Plaintiff in the discovery process.
