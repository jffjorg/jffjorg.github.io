Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff, Francis Ford Coppola, may lift the discovery stay to conduct limited discovery to identify the anonymous sources quoted in the article published by Variety Media, LLC. The discovery will be limited to issues related to the anti-SLAPP motion, and the sources may be identified as "Source One, Source Two," etc., with their identities kept confidential at this stage. The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff has made a prima facie case for libel and that the defendant's anti-SLAPP motion raises issues of fact that require discovery. The judge has ordered that the hearing on the anti-SLAPP motion be continued to February 14, 2024, to allow the plaintiff to conduct the limited discovery.
