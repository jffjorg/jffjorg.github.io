And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has determined that the service of the motion was proper and timely. The plaintiff's opposition to the motion fails to address the proof of service filed on October 17, 2023, which shows that a copy of the moving papers was personally delivered to the plaintiff's counsel's office on October 16, 2023. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's argument that October 16, 2023 email service was untimely is irrelevant since the proof of service filed on October 17, 2023 shows that personal service was completed. The judge notes that the Code of Civil Procedure allows for personal service on an attorney whose only address of record is a Post Office Box. The plaintiff's statement that the parties had agreed to serve each other via electronic means is not supported by evidence and is therefore ignored. Finally, the judge finds that the plaintiff's appearance at the hearing and opposition to the motion on its merits constitutes a waiver of any defects or irregularities in the notice of the motion.
