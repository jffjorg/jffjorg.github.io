 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant Showtime
  Networks, Inc. and Paramount Global’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings 
 



 
Defendant Showtime/CBS filed a
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings of Plaintiff’s 8th cause of action for
attempted extortion and 9th cause of action for IIED on grounds that the
actions are time-barred under CCP §583.210, attempted extortion is not a cause
of action and there are insufficient allegations to impose liability on them
for the acts of third party “goons” who allegedly threatened, menaced and
harassed Plaintiff.  
Defendant Showtime/CBS fails to
establish that the action is time-barred and subject to dismissal pursuant to
CCP §583.210.  Defendant Showtime/CBS
establishes that there is no civil cause of action for attempted
extortion.  Finally, Plaintiff’s FAC fails
to allege IIED against Showtime/CBS. 
Defendant Showtime/CBS’s Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED without leave to amend as to the 8th cause
of action for attempted extortion and GRANTED with 20 days leave to amend as to
the 9th cause of action for IIED.
 
Background
Pleadings
Plaintiff Gabriel Rueda sues
Defendants Emmanuel Pacquiao, Frederick Roach, Keith M. Davidson, Paramount
Global (Paramount; formerly CBS Corporation), Showtime Networks, Inc.
(Showtime) (with Paramount, the CBS Defendants), and Does 1-25 pursuant to an August
25, 2016 First Amended Complaint (FAC) that alleges claims of (1) Breach of
Oral Contract, (2) Breach of Implied-in-Fact Contract, (3) Common Counts for
Labor, Work, and Services, (4) Quantum Meruit, (5) Fraud in the Inducement, (6)
Fraudulent Misrepresentation, (7) Unjust Enrichment, (8) Attempted Extortion,
and (9) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
The claims arise from allegations
that Rueda, pursuant to a still unpaid finder’s fee, introduced Leslie
Moonves—the president of CBS Corporation and Showtime Networks—to Defendant
Roach—trainer and confidant of boxer Pacquiao—with Moonves using the introduction
to broker a bout between Pacquiao and boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr.—dubbed the
“Fight of the Century”—that earned Pacquiao, Mayweather, and Showtime Networks
more than $430 million, with Rueda entitled to 2% of the gross proceeds the CBS
Defendants, Roach and Pacquiao earned from the Fight and any rematches between
Mayweather and Pacquiao.
Motion Before the Court
On October 6, 2023, Defendants Showtime/CBS
filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings of the 8th cause of action for
attempted extortion and 9th cause of action for IIED of the FAC.  On November 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed an
opposition to Defendant Showtime/CBS’s Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings.  On December 4, 2023,
Defendant Showtime/CBS field a reply.  
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
Defendant Showtime/CBS’s Request
for Judicial Notice in support of his MJP is GRANTED pursuant to CCP
§452(d).  
Plaintiff Rueda’s Request for
Judicial Notice in support of his oppositions to Pacquiao’s and Davidson’s MJPs
are GRANTED pursuant to CCP §452(d).  
The RJNs seek judicial notice of
prior pleadings, rulings and appellate opinions relevant to this action.  
 
Showtime/CBS’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
Legal
Standard
Either
prior to trial or at the trial—and barring statutory provisions otherwise—the
plaintiff or the Defendants may move for judgment on the pleadings where the
appropriate ground for such a motion is the same as that arguable by general
demurrer, namely, the failure to state a cause of action or defense. (Dobbins
v. Hardister (1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 787, 791 A motion for JOP is used to
challenge a pleading in the same manner as a general demurrer—that is, the
challenged pleading (1) establishes that the court does not have subject-matter
jurisdiction or (2) does not allege facts sufficient to support a cause of
action or defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1); see Marzec v.
Public Empls. Ret. Sys. (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 889, 900; International
Assn of Firefighters v. City of San Jose (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1196.)
To
sufficiently allege a cause of action, a complaint must allege all the ultimate
facts—that is, the facts needed to establish each element of the cause of
action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods
Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212 (Committee on Children’s Television),
superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan
Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) In testing the sufficiency of the cause
of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)
Courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228,
disapproved on other grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership
(2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) However, this analysis “does not admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab
Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) The face of the complaint includes exhibits
attached to the complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d
91, 94.) If facts appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts
in the exhibits take precedence. (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc.
(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded by statute on other grounds as
stated in White v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
As
with a demurrer, the grounds for a motion for judgment on the pleadings must
appear on the face of the pleading or be based on facts capable of judicial
notice. (Bufil v. Dollar Fin. Grp. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1202,
disapproved on other grounds in Noel v. Thrifty Payless, Inc. (2019) 7
Cal.5th 955, 985-986, fn. 15.) The only significant difference between the two
motions is that a motion for judgment on the pleadings is brought after the
time to file a general demurrer has expired. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (f);
Caldera Pharms. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th
338, 350; International Assn of Firefighters v. City of San Jose, supra,
at p. 1196.)
Order
re: Showtime/CBS Judgment on the Pleadings: 
GRANT without leave to amend as to the 8th cause of action for
attempted extortion and GRANT with 20 days leave to amend as to the 9th cause
of action for IIED     
Defendant
Showtime/CBS move for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to CCP
§438(c)(1)(B)(ii) and 438(c)(2) of the 8th cause of action for attempted
extortion and 9th cause of action for IIED on the following grounds:
(1)
both claims are time-barred pursuant to CCP §583.210, as Judge Soleto found in
connection with the 2nd prong of Showtime/CBS’s SLAPP;  
(2)
both claims fail to allege facts regarding vicarious liability for the
purported acts of nonparties; and 
(3)
there is no such cause of action as “attempted extortion” and even if there
were, the cause of action fails for lack of a threat to base such a claim.
In
response, Plaintiff argues:
(1)
the argument that the 8th and 9th causes of action are time-barred under CCP
§583.210 does not apply, because Showtime/CBS made a general appearance within
three years of filing this action and the DOE amendment was timely served given
the various stays of the 8th and 9th causes of action;
(2)
based on Supreme Court authority, vicarious liability for both the extortion
and IIED claims are sufficiently pled; 
(3)
the attempted extortion claim is a recognized cause of action.
In
reply, Defendant Showtime/CBS reiterates their position that:
(1)
The action is time barred under CCP §583.210. 
Showtime/CBS argues their general appearance on June 9, 2017 did not
trigger the exception under CCP §583.220 because they had not yet been named as
DOEs on the 8th and 9th causes of action. 
Showtime/CBS argues the FAC is an “incomprehensible mess,” because DOEs
1 and 2 are allegedly “men Rueda recognized from the Wildcard Gym,” and at
other times DOE 1 is a restaurant patron. 
Showtime/CBS argues any attempt to amend and avoid dismissal per CCP
§583.210 would be futile.
(2)
there is no recognized cause of action for attempted extortion;
(3)
the facts alleged do not support imposition of vicarious liability for the
conduct of third parties.   
The
Court finds in favor of Defendant Showtime/CBS. 
Defendant Showtime/CBS’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED
without leave to amend as to the 8th cause of action for attempted extortion
and GRANTED without leave to amend as to the 9th cause of action for IIED.  
(1)  CCP §583.210 does not bar the 8th and 9th
cause of action 
CCP
§583.210(a) provides, “The summons and complaint shall be served upon a
defendant within three years after the action is commenced against the
defendant.  For the purposes of this
subdivision, an action is commenced at the time the complaint is filed.”  “If the summons has not been served and
return made within three years after the commencement of the action, and if the
case does not come within a statutory or judicially-declared exception,
dismissal of the complaint under Code of Civil Procedure section 581a,
subdivision (a), is mandatory and jurisdictional.  It is not necessary to show that the
defendant has been prejudiced by the delay. 
(Botsford v. Pascoe (1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 62, 66 (interpreting
predecessor statute to CCP §583.210).)
An
exception to the three-year deadline under CCP §583.210 is set forth in CCP
§583.220.  “The time within which service
must be made pursuant to this article does not apply if the defendant enters
into a stipulation in writing or does another act that constitutes a general
appearance in the action.”  (CCP
§583.220.)
“A
general appearance is not necessarily a formal, technical step or act. The term
is applied to various acts which, under established principles of procedure,
are deemed to confer jurisdiction of the person.  Whether there has been a general appearance
will often depend upon an examination of all the circumstances.  A general appearance must be express or arise
by implication from the defendant's seeking, taking, or agreeing to some step
or proceeding in the cause beneficial to himself or detrimental to the
plaintiff, other than one contesting the jurisdiction only.”  (Botsford v. Pascoe (1979) 94
Cal.App.3d 62, 67.)  
In
order for the exception under CCP §583.220(a) to apply, the general appearance
must have been made in the “action” in which the defendant seeks
dismissal.  Thus, where a defendant
generally appeared on a cross-complaint within three years of filing the
underlying complaint, but did not appear within three years on the underlying
complaint, CCP §583.220 did not apply and the underlying complaint was properly
dismissed pursuant to CCP §583.210.  (Botsford,
supra, 94 Cal.App.3d at 67.)  “[F]or
purposes of section 581a, subdivision (a), an ‘action’ on a complaint should be
distinguished from an “action” on a related cross-complaint and that a general
appearance in one such action will not necessarily constitute a general
appearance in the other. A complaint and a cross-complaint in a single lawsuit
are for most purposes treated as independent actions.”  (Id.) (applying predecessor statute to
CCP §583.210.)
On
March 24, 2016, Plaintiff filed the complaint in this action.  On August 25, 2016, Plaintiff filed the
operative First Amended Complaint.  The
FAC named Defendant Showtime/CBS as Defendants. 
(FAC, ¶¶6-7.)  On June 9, 2017, Defendant
Showtime/CBS filed a joint answer to the First Amended Complaint.  On September 11, 2019, Plaintiff filed DOE
Amendments to the Complaint naming CBS as DOE 1 and Showtime as DOE 2.  
Based
on these facts, which appear from the record and are cited by Plaintiff and
Defendant in reply, Showtime/CBS made a general appearance within three years
of filing of the complaint.  The
complaint was filed on March 24, 2016 and Showtime/CBS generally appeared in
the action on June 9, 2017, a little over a year later.  Pursuant to CCP §583.220, the three-year time
limit set forth in CCP §583.210 would therefore not apply.  
Showtime/CBS’s
reply does not adequately respond to Plaintiff’s argument that CCP §583.220
applies.  Showtime/CBS argue that of
their general appearance in this action, they were not yet named as DOE
defendants and they were specifically not yet named in the 8th and 9th causes
of action.  Showtime/CBS argue they could
not make a general appearance on causes of action to which they had not yet
been named.
Showtime/CBS
offers no authority that supports their position that “action” under CCP
§583.220 is properly interpreted to mean “causes of action.”  Showtime/CBS cite to Botsford v. Pascoe
(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 62, 67, Brumley v. FDCC California, Inc. (2007) 156
Cal.App.4th 312 and Barrington v. A. H. Robins Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d
146.  None of these cases stand for the
proposition that “action” in CCP §583.220 means “cause of action.”  
Botsford
states that for purposes of CCP §583.220, a complaint and a cross-complaint in
a single litigation are separate “actions” for purposes of CCP §583.220.  Here, there is no question that Showtime/CBS
generally appeared in the “action,” i.e. the underlying complaint, within three
years of the original filing.  
Barrington
held that a complaint that was amended to charge a DOE defendant with a new
cause of action arising from different operative facts did not need to be filed
within three years of the original filing. 
(Barrington, supra, 39 Cal.3d 146, 149.)  Barrington held that an amendment
adding a new cause of action against a DOE defendant based on different
operative facts did not relate back to the original complaint, and therefore, the
three-year period to serve CCP §581.210 did not begin to run until the amended
complaint adding that new cause of action was filed.  (Id. at 157.)  
Brumley
followed Barrington’s application of the relation back doctrine to a
motion to dismiss based on the five-year period for bringing an action to
trial.  For purposes of calculating the
five-year period to bring an action to trial, as to amended causes of action
asserting different rights and damages from those alleged in the original
complaint, the date of the “action was commenced” was the date on which the
amendments were filed, not the date the original action was filed.  (Brumley, supra, 156 Cal.App.4th
at 316.)
Neither
Barrington nor Brumley support Showtime/CBS’s position that their
general appearance in June 2017 does not trigger the exception under CCP
§583.220.  Those cases merely stand for
the proposition that, for purposes of calculating the three-year period under
CCP §583.210 or the five-year period under CCP §§583.310 and 583.360, the
relation back doctrine applies.  As to
amendments that do not relate back, to calculate these statutory deadlines, the
action commenced when the amendment was filed, not when the original complaint
was filed.
Showtime/CBS
also argue that this Court already found the action time-barred under CCP
§583.210 in connection with Showtime/CBS’s SLAPP motion.  (Defendant Showtime/CBS’s RJN, Ex. B,
November 13, 2020 Minute Order.)  On the
second prong of the SLAPP analysis, Judge Sotelo found the action was
time-barred based on CCP §583.210, because Defendants were not served as DOE
defendants within three years of the filing of the original complaint and
nothing prevent Plaintiff from doing so based on the evidence presented by
Showtime/CBS on the second prong of SLAPP. 
(Defendant Showtime/CBS’s RJN, Ex. B, p. 10 of 11.)  
Based
on the Rueda’s Opposition to the Showtime/CBS SLAPP and the November 13, 2020,
Rueda never argued that the June 9, 2017 answer triggered CCP §583.220. Rueda
argued that the September 2016 demurrer qualified as a general appearance.  (Defendant Showtime/CBS’s RJN, Ex. B, p. 10
of 11; Plaintiff’s Opposition to Showtime/CBS SLAPP filed on October 16, 2020.)  While the November 13, 2020 Minute Order references
the argument that the September 6, 2016 demurrer was a general appearance, it does
not address that argument nor does it reference CCP §583.220.  As such, the specific argument raised here,
that the June 9, 2017 answer triggered the exception under CCP §583.220, was
never previously addressed by this Court. 

Moreover,
Defendants fail to cite any authority holding that the findings on the second
prong of SLAPP have any binding effect outside of the SLAPP motion.  The soundness of the second prong findings
was also not at issue in Rueda’s appeal of the Showtime/CBS SLAPP motion.  (Defendant Showtime/CBS’s RJN, Ex. A, p. 16
(“Rueda has not challenged the trial court’s determination that he has no
reasonable probability of prevailing on the claims that arise from Davidson’s
conduct…Accordingly, we need not analyze the issue.”)
Defendant
Showtime/CBS’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings based on CCP §583.210 is
denied.  
 
(2)
Attempted extortion is not a recognized cause of action.  
As
discussed in connection with the Motions for Judgment of the Pleadings of
Defendants Pacquiao and Davidson, the Court finds there is no recognized cause
of action for attempted extortion.  For
reference that discussion is reproduced here.
The
parties do not disagree that there exists a cause of action in California for
extortion. (Fuhrman v. California Satellite Systems (1986) 179
Cal.App.3d 408, 426, disapproved of on other grounds in Silberg v. Anderson
(1990) 50 Cal.3d 205.) However, as both parties acknowledge, to bring such a claim
one must show that he or she paid the money or took whatever action is demanded
by the extortioners. As noted in Fuhrman, a claim for actual extortion was
recognized by the Supreme Court as “[h]owever denominated (e.g., extortion, menace,
duress) . . a cause of action for the recovery of money obtained by the
wrongful threat of criminal or civil prosecution.” (Fuhrman, supra, 179
Cal.App.3d at p. 426.) In that case, the court affirmed dismissal of the cause
of action on that ground. (Ibid. [“[t]he fatal flaw in plaintiff’s
action is that she apparently never paid the money defendants demanded in their
letters”].) The question here is whether there is a cause of action in
California for attempted extortion; that is, the kind of claim set forth
in Fuhrman in which the threat is made but the victim refuses to pay. 
The
Fuhrman case considered whether the cause of action in its case –
essentially, attempted extortion, or extortion without payment -- could be
upheld on some other theory, and noted that it “could be construed as one for
the recovery of damages for the severe emotional distress caused by defendants’
‘outrageous’ conduct. As such, it is simply a variation of the tort of
intentional infliction of emotional distress.” (Id. at p. 428.) There,
as here, the plaintiff had already alleged such a claim in addition to the
extortion claim, and the Court dismissed the extortion claim. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff
nonetheless urges this Court to find a cause of action for attempted extortion.
In the November 13, 2020 ruling on the Showtime/CBS SLAPP motion, Judge Sotelo
addressed the argument that attempted extortion is not a recognized cause of
action by stating, “[t]he Court finds that Rueda could allege his attempted
extortion claim:  Rueda claims that
percentage of proceeds were promised to him—it was his money.  An attempt to withhold his claimed earnings
may be attempted extortion.”  However, in
the very next sentence, Judge Sotelo acknowledged that the issue was moot given
his findings regarding Showtime/CBS’s affirmative defenses based on litigation
privilege and statute of limitations.  Therefore,
Judge Sotelo’s statement regarding Rueda’s ability to allege attempted
extortion was advisory or dicta, and not a ruling on the specific issue of
whether such a cause of action exists under California law.  
Attempted
extortion is a crime.  (Penal Code §524.)  “There are at least three different ways
alleged violations of criminal law can result in civil actions. First, and
perhaps most commonly, violation of a criminal statute can be used to establish
a breach of the standard of care or other element of an ordinary tort cause of
action.  Second, and pertinent to [plaintiff]'s
argument on appeal, a criminal statute can expressly or impliedly give rise to
a private right of action for its violation. 
Third, under some circumstances, a governmental or quasi-governmental
agency can sue to enjoin further breaches of the statute on a public nuisance
or related theory.”  (Animal Legal
Defense Fund v. Mendes (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 136, 141.)  
While
Plaintiff does not cite any controlling authority expressly recognizing that
attempted extortion is a civil cause of action, Plaintiff cites to federal
cases recognizing attempted extortion as a cause of action under California law.  (Monex Deposit Co. v. Gilliam (C.D.
Cal. 2009) 666 F.Supp.2d 1135, 1137; Leibman v. Prupes (C.D. Ca. 2015)
2015 WL 898454 *16, fn. 6; TaiMed Biologics, Inc. v. Numoda Corp. (N.D.
Cal. 2011) 2011 WL 1630041 *5; Baker v. FirstCom Music (C.D. Cal. 2018)
2018 WL 2572725 *11.  However, the Court
is not bound by federal decisions on matters of California law.  (Haynes v. EMC Mortgage Corp. (2012)
205 Cal.App.4th 329, 335; Qualified Patients Assn. v. City of Anaheim
(2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 734, 764 [“[D]ecisions of the lower federal courts are
not binding precedent [citation], particularly on issues of state law.”)  
Monex
argued recognition of a civil cause for extortion was proper even when there
was no payment of monies (thus, akin to the “attempted extortion alleged here),
given the California Supreme Court’s adoption of section 874A of the
Restatement (Second) of Torts, which states: 
“When a legislative provision protects a class of persons by proscribing
... certain conduct but does not provide a civil remedy for the violation, the
court may, if it determines that the remedy is appropriate in furtherance of
the purpose of the legislation and needed to assure the effectiveness of the
provision, accord to an injured member of the class a right of action, using a
... new cause of action analogous to an existing tort action.”  (Monex, supra, 666 F.Supp.2d at
1137.)  Monex concluded, “[B]ecause
the civil tort for extortion is derived from the crime of extortion, and because
recognizing a claim for civil extortion furthers the purpose of California
Penal Code section 523, the Court declines to dismiss the third cause of action.”  (Id.) 

The
Court does not find Monex persuasive, because Monex did
not identify any analogous, existing tort action that would support a claim for
“attempted extortion,” despite citation to the Restatement (Second) of Torts
section 874A.  (Monex, supra,
666 F.Supp.2d at 1137.)  While the
specific claim before it was for civil extortion, as noted, the plaintiff
alleged that it “never gave in to defendants’ alleged extortion(s),” and thus
the claim was for attempted extortion.  (Id.
at 1136.)  The Court finds the Fuhrman
court’s opinion better reasoned (and actually to have precedential effect) which
finds that the tort of attempted extortion, by contrast, is more analogous with
a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  (Id. at p. 428.) The Court finds that none
of the other remaining federal authorities cited are persuasive. (Leibman,
supra, 2015 WL 898454 *16, fn. 6 [not analyzing the difference between
extortion and attempted extortion and relying on Monex]; TaiMed
Biologics, Inc. v. Numoda Corp., supra, 2011 WL 1630041 *5 [citing Monex’s
analysis]; Baker v. FirstCom Music (C.D. Cal. 2018) 2018 WL 2572725 *11 [not
analyzing the difference between extortion and attempted extortion and replying
on Monex].)  
Plaintiff
also cites to an isolated ruling from a Los Angeles County trial court.  (Chang v. Ruy (2019) 2019 WL 13194157
*5 [Rico, J].)  “Trial courts do not make
binding precedents.” (9 Witkin (6th ed. 2021) California Procedure,
Appeal §507.)  “When collected and
readily available for study,” trial court orders “may be cited for their
persuasive value and are occasionally followed in the absence of controlling
higher authority.” (Id.)  However,
an isolated ruling that is not part of a readily available compilation is not
citable for its persuasive value. (Santa Ana Hosp. Med. Center v. Belshé
(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 819, 830.) Nor does the Court find the Chang case
persuasive, even if it was citable for such a purpose. The trial court there
also cited Monex but just as did the court in Monex, as noted
above, the superior court failed to consider the requirement of tethering the
new cause of action to an analogous, existing tort action.
Plaintiff
also argues attempted extortion exists as a cause of action, because it was
implicitly recognized in Flatley v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299.   Plaintiff relies on the concurring opinion
of Justice Werdegar.  The issue of
whether attempted extortion is a recognized cause of action was not before the Flatley
court.  Indeed, the majority opinion
focused on whether the conduct arose to the level of criminal extortionate conduct
(id. at p. 330), and the issue of whether a civil claim for extortion
requires the payment of money did not arise either in the majority or the
concurring opinion. “It is axiomatic that cases are not authority for
propositions that are not considered.”  (California
Building Industry Assn. v. State Water Resources Control Bd. (2018) 4 Cal.5th
1032, 1043.)  The Court cannot imply a
finding in Flatley on an issue that was never considered or presented to
the Flatley court.  
Plaintiff
fails to identify an analogous, recognized civil tort claim to attempted
extortion.  As did the court in Fuhrman,
this court finds that the most analogous tort claim would be a claim for
intentional infliction of emotional distress, which is separately pleaded as
the 9th cause of action. Plaintiff also fails to identify any other
recognized tort that is stated based on the allegations in the 8th cause of
action for attempted extortion.  Finally,
Plaintiff does not argue or establish any of these three grounds to recognize a
private, civil right of action for attempted extortion based on Penal Code
§524.  
Plaintiff
fails to establish that attempted extortion is recognized cause of action under
California law.  Defendant Pacquiao’s and
Davidson’s Motions for Judgment on the Pleadings are GRANTED as to the 8th
cause of action for Attempted Extortion. 

(3)  The IIED claim is not sufficiently alleged
as to Showtime/CBS 
Defendant
argues the IIED claim fails against them, because Plaintiff fails to allege any
facts that would make them vicariously liable for the conduct of third parties,
e.g. the Wildcard members.  The IIED claim
incorporates ¶¶1-45 and 91-99 of the FAC. 
However, the July 26, 2023 opinion, the Court of Appeals only struck the
incorporated “general allegations.”  The
Court interprets “general allegations” to refer to ¶¶1-45.  
Based
on the allegations in support of the IIED claim, Plaintiff alleges DOES 1-6 and
“goons from the Wildcard Gym” “harassed, stalked, best and terrorized Rueda on
behalf of Roach and Paquiao.  (FAC, ¶92.)  Plaintiff alleges, “Roach and Pacquiao knew
their agents Davidson, DOES 1-6 and the goons from the Wildcard Gym would make
the above described threats or take the above-described actions.”  (FAC, ¶94.) 
Plaintiff alleges Pacquiao and Davidson intentionally caused Plaintiff
to suffer severe emotional distress by “threat[en]ing…physical harm to himself
and property…and causing him to live in fear for his safety and
livelihood.”  (FAC, ¶101.)  Plaintiff alleges he “felt fearful for his
personal and physical safety.  He could
not go out in public for fear that Wildcard Gym members and Pacquiao’s Posse
would physically attack him at anytime.” 
(FAC, ¶102.)  Plaintiff also
alleges that the DOE defendants were acting as agents of the other named
Defendants. (FAC, ¶12.)  Plaintiff specifically
alleges the threatening and menacing behavior at ¶42, that the behavior was
carried out by persons he recognized as being members of the Wildcard Gym owned
by Roach and patronized by Pacquiao’s fans. 
(FAC, ¶42.)  Plaintiff alleges the
menacing behavior occurred just after Davidson approached him with an offer to
settle his claims, and he believes was intended to intimidate him into
accepting Davidson’s offer.  (Id.
at ¶¶41 and 44.)  
“Under
the doctrine of respondeat superior, the innocent principal or employer is
liable for the torts of the agent or employee, committed while acting within
the scope of employment. It is immaterial that the employee acts in excess of
authority or contrary to instructions.”  (3
Witkin, Summary (11th ed. 2020), Agency §175.)  “The courts have approved a general statement
to the effect that the wrongdoer was the agent or employee of the defendant
principal, and “was acting in the scope of his employment.  [¶] The general averment is sufficient not
only in negligence cases but also where the cause of action is based on an
intentional tort.”   (5 Witkin, Cal. Proc. (6th
ed. 2021), ¶918.  
“An
allegation of agency constitutes an averment of ultimate fact, which we accept
as true on a demurrer.  But where factual
allegations are based on information and belief, the plaintiff must allege
information that leads the plaintiff to believe that the allegations are
true.”  (Brown v. USA Taekwondo
(2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 1077, 1106.)  “[G]eneral
allegations of agency that are contradicted by, or inconsistent with, facts
specifically pleaded, will be disregarded.” 
(5 Witkin, Cal. Proc. (6th ed. 2021), Plead §918.)
Plaintiff’s
FAC fails to allege any facts that would support a finding of agency making Showtime/CBS
liable for the actions of the alleged “goons” from Wildcard Gym or any other
unidentified persons for harassing, threatening, stalking or menacing
Plaintiff.  Plaintiff’s general
allegation of agency is insufficient as to Showtime/CBS for the simple reason
that his DOE amendments render his FAC unclear, or, as uncharitably
characterized by Showtime/CBS, an “incomprehensible mess.”  
There
are no allegations directed specifically at Showtime/CBS to hold them
vicariously liable for the actions of these third party “goons.”  Plaintiff relies on the DOE allegations,
including the general allegation of agency that “each DOE defendant was acting
as an agent…for each of the other Defendants…” 
Showtime/CBS were named as DOEs 1 and 2 in the 9th cause of action for
IIED.  However, the general allegation of
agency seems to allege that Showtime/CBS were acting as agents for the other
named Defendants.  Plaintiff must allege
that the “goons,” who are themselves DOE defendants or unidentified persons,
were acting as Showtime/CBS’s agents when they harassed and intimidated
Plaintiff.  
More
importantly, Plaintiff alleges that DOEs 1-3, which would include Showtime and
CBS, were “men.”  (FAC, ¶42.)  Plaintiff alleges DOEs 1-6 directly engaged
in the alleged harassment.  (FAC,
¶43.)  Showtime and CBS are corporate
entities, not “men.”  They could not have
physically “pointed at Rueda and laughed” or “forcefully grabbed” Rueda’s
wrist.  “A corporation can only act
through its servants, agents and employees.” 
(Alvarez v. Felker Mfg. Co. (1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 987, 998.)  Plaintiff must allege facts that would make
Showtime/CBS vicariously liable for the acts of these “men.”  Plaintiff does not achieve this by naming
Showtime/CBS as DOE 1 and 2.  The
allegations as to DOEs 1-2 allege direct liability as to DOEs 1-2 as actual
participants in the alleged harassment, intimidation and physical threats.
“[G]eneral
allegations of agency that are contradicted by, or inconsistent with, facts
specifically pleaded, will be disregarded.” 
(5 Witkin, Cal. Proc. (6th ed. 2021), Plead §918.)
Given the conflicting and inconsistent DOE allegations, the general allegation
of agency is also disregarded.  
Defendant
argues on reply that Plaintiff was required to comply with CRC Rule 3.1324(a)-(b)
to obtain leave to amend.  However, CRC
Rule 3.1324’s requirements apply to a noticed motion for leave to amend.  Plaintiff did not file such a noticed motion,
nor was he required to in the face of an MJP. 
“[I]t is an abuse of discretion to grant a motion for judgment on the
pleadings without leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility that
the plaintiff can state a good cause of action.” (Dudley v. Department of
Transportation (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 255, 260.)  Plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating
the defect can be cured by amendment. (Id..) Such a showing need not be
made in the trial court, but may be made to the reviewing court. (Id..)
Defendant
Showtime/CBS’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is granted with 20 days
leave to amend as to the 9th cause of action for IIED.  
 

Conclusion
Defendant Showtime/CBS’ Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED as to the 8th cause of action for
attempted extortion without leave to amend and GRANTED as to the 9th cause of
action for IIED with 20 days leave to amend.

 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
(1) Defendant Emmanuel
  Pacquiao’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings 
(2) Defendant
  Keith M. Davidson’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings



 
Defendant Emmanuel Pacquiao and
Defendant Keith M. Davidson filed separate Motions for Judgment on the
Pleadings of Plaintiff’s 8th cause of action for attempted extortion and 9th
cause of action for IIED on grounds that attempted extortion is not a cause of
action, the claims are both based on statements by Davidson that have already
been deemed protected by the litigation privilege and there are insufficient
allegations to impose liability on them for the acts of third party “goons” who
allegedly threatened, menaced and harassed Plaintiff.  
Defendants Pacquiao and Davidson
establish that there is no civil cause of action for attempted extortion.  However, Defendants fail to articulate any
legal doctrine that would apply this Court’s or the Court of Appeal findings in
connection with the Showtime/CBS SLAPP motion to them, including this Court’s
finding that the Davidson statements are protected by the litigation
privilege.  Finally, Plaintiff’s FAC
alleges that the “goons” who threatened Plaintiff were the agents of Defendants
Pacquiao and Davidson, making Defendants Pacquiao and Davidson vicariously
liable for their outrageous conduct.  The
Court accepts these allegations of agency as true at the pleading stage.
Defendant Pacquiao’s Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED as to the 8th cause of action for
attempted extortion without leave to amend and DENIED as to the 9th cause of
action for IIED.  Defendant Davidson’s
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED as to the 8th cause of action
for attempted extortion without leave to amend and DENIED as to the 9th cause
of action for IIED.
 
Background
Pleadings
Plaintiff Gabriel Rueda sues
Defendants Emmanuel Pacquiao, Frederick Roach, Keith M. Davidson, Paramount
Global (Paramount; formerly CBS Corporation), Showtime Networks, Inc.
(Showtime) (with Paramount, the CBS Defendants), and Does 1-25 pursuant to an August
25, 2016 First Amended Complaint (FAC) that alleges claims of (1) Breach of
Oral Contract, (2) Breach of Implied-in-Fact Contract, (3) Common Counts for
Labor, Work, and Services, (4) Quantum Meruit, (5) Fraud in the Inducement, (6)
Fraudulent Misrepresentation, (7) Unjust Enrichment, (8) Attempted Extortion,
and (9) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
The claims arise from allegations
that Rueda, pursuant to a still unpaid finder’s fee, introduced Leslie
Moonves—the president of CBS Corporation and Showtime Networks—to Defendant
Roach—trainer and confidant of boxer Pacquiao—with Moonves using the introduction
to broker a bout between Pacquiao and boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr.—dubbed the
“Fight of the Century”—that earned Pacquiao, Mayweather, and Showtime Networks
more than $430 million, with Rueda entitled to 2% of the gross proceeds the CBS
Defendants, Roach and Pacquiao earned from the Fight and any rematches between
Mayweather and Pacquiao.
Motions Before the Court
On October 10, 2023, Defendant
Keith Davidson filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings of the 8th and 9th
causes of action for attempted extortion and IIED in the FAC.  On November 14, 2023, Defendant Emmanuel
Pacquiao filed a substantively identical motion for judgment on the pleadings
of the 8th and 9th causes of action.  
On November 28, 2023, Plaintiff
filed separate oppositions to Davidson’s MJP and Pacquiao’s MJP.  On December 4, 2023, Defendant Davidson filed
a reply to Plaintiff’s Opposition, and Defendant Pacquiao filed a reply to
Plaintiff’s opposition.  
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
Defendant Davidson’s Request for
Judicial Notice in support of his MJP is GRANTED pursuant to CCP §452(d).  
Defendant Pacquiao’s Request for
Judicial Notice in support of his MJP is GRANTED pursuant to CCP §452(d).
Plaintiff Rueda’s Requests for
Judicial Notice in support of his oppositions to Pacquiao’s and Davidson’s MJPs
are GRANTED pursuant to CCP §452(d).  
The RJNs seek judicial notice of
prior pleadings, rulings and appellate opinions relevant to this action.

(2) Davidson Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings
Legal
Standard
Either
prior to trial or at the trial—and barring statutory provisions otherwise—the
plaintiff or the Defendants may move for judgment on the pleadings where the
appropriate ground for such a motion is the same as that arguable by general
demurrer, namely, the failure to state a cause of action or defense. (Dobbins
v. Hardister (1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 787, 791 A motion for JOP is used to
challenge a pleading in the same manner as a general demurrer—that is, the
challenged pleading (1) establishes that the court does not have subject-matter
jurisdiction or (2) does not allege facts sufficient to support a cause of
action or defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1); see Marzec v.
Public Empls. Ret. Sys. (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 889, 900; International
Assn of Firefighters v. City of San Jose (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1196.)
To
sufficiently allege a cause of action, a complaint must allege all the ultimate
facts—that is, the facts needed to establish each element of the cause of
action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods
Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212 (Committee on Children’s Television),
superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan
Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) In testing the sufficiency of the cause
of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)
Courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228,
disapproved on other grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership
(2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) However, this analysis “does not admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab
Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) The face of the complaint includes exhibits
attached to the complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d
91, 94.) If facts appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts
in the exhibits take precedence. (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc.
(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded by statute on other grounds as
stated in White v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
As
with a demurrer, the grounds for a motion for judgment on the pleadings must
appear on the face of the pleading or be based on facts capable of judicial
notice. (Bufil v. Dollar Fin. Grp. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1202,
disapproved on other grounds in Noel v. Thrifty Payless, Inc. (2019) 7
Cal.5th 955, 985-986, fn. 15.) The only significant difference between the two
motions is that a motion for judgment on the pleadings is brought after the
time to file a general demurrer has expired. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (f);
Caldera Pharms. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th
338, 350; International Assn of Firefighters v. City of San Jose, supra,
at p. 1196.)
Order
re: Pacquiao Judgment on the Pleadings: 
       GRANT as to 8th cause of
action for Attempted Extortion and DENY as to 9th cause of action for IIED
Order
re: Davidson Judgment on the Pleadings:        GRANT
as to 8th cause of action for Attempted Extortion and DENY as to 9th cause of
action for IIED
Defendants
Davidson and Pacquiao (“Defendants”) filed separate motions for judgment on the
pleadings of the 8th and 9th causes of action for attempted extortion and IIED
that make the nearly the same substantive arguments.  Both Defendants argue: 
(1)
there is no such cause of action as “attempted extortion”;  
(2)
the attempted extortion claim is based on Davidson’s statements to Rueda that
have already been deemed by this Court and the Court of Appeal to be statements
protected by the litigation privilege; and
(3)
as to the alleged harassing conduct of third parties, Plaintiff fails to allege
sufficient facts that would make either Davidson or Pacquiao liable for their
actions, e.g. agency, conspiracy allegations.
In
addition to the arguments above, Defendant Pacquiao alone makes the following
arguments:
(1)
even if attempted extortion were a cause of action, Plaintiff never
relinquished any of his claims to a finder’s fee in response to the attempted
extortion; and 
(2)  there are no allegations of conduct by
Pacquiao that would support either the 8th or 9th cause of action, nor are
there sufficient allegations to support imposition of vicarious liability on
Pacquiao for the conduct of either Davidson or non-parties. 
In
response, Plaintiff filed separate oppositions to Pacquiao’s and Davidson’s
MJPs that are essentially identical. 
Plaintiff argues:
(1)
attempted extortion is a cause of action and the Court indicated it is a
recognized cause of action in its prior ruling on the 2nd prong of CBS/Showtime’s
SLAPP;
(2)
the appellate opinion issued on the CBS/Showtime SLAPP does not apply to
Davidson or Pacquiao, as neither was a party to that appeal and the doctrine of
“law of the case” only applies to parties to the appeal; 
(3)
Davidson specifically waived any right to rely on the CBS/Showtime SLAPP,
because he inexplicably withheld evidence and argument from his SLAPP that
CBS/Showtime later presented in their SLAPP; 
(4)
even without the statements allegedly made by Davidson that were stricken in
the CBS/Showtime SLAPP, judgment on the pleadings cannot be granted because
Plaintiff alleges other conduct that supports the extortion and IIED claims.
(5)
based on Supreme Court authority, vicarious liability for both the extortion
and IIED claims are sufficiently pled based on the bare allegation that DOES
1-6 and the Wildcard Gym were the agents of both Davidson and Pacquiao.  
(6)
the IIED claim is sufficiently pled based on the physical stalking, harassment
and threats by third parties who were acting as the agents of Davidson and
Pacquiao.
In
their replies, Pacquiao and Davidson both reiterate that attempted extortion is
not a recognized cause of action in California. 
Defendants argue that nothing in the language or history of Penal Code
§524 indicates an intent to provide for a civil right of action, nor has any
California Court of Appeal ever held that such a claim exists.  
In
addition, Davidson argues in reply that the prior ruling on the CBS/Showtime
SLAPP never found that a claim for attempted extortion exists in
California.  Defendant Davidson argues
the court indicated that issue was moot. 
Davidson
also argues in reply that, even if attempted extortion were a recognized cause
of action, no extortionate threat is alleged. 
Davidson argues that the Court of Appeal already deemed his statements protected
by the litigation privilege in connection with the Showtime/CBS SLAPP.  Davidson argues that conduct therefore cannot
form the basis of Plaintiff’s attempted extortion claim.  Davidson argues the Court of Appeal never
limited its ruling to the Showtime/CBS.  Davidson
argues even if law of the case does not apply, Plaintiff should be estopped
from relitigating whether Davidson’s statements are protected by the litigation
privilege.  Davidson argues he has never
waived any rights with respect to the assertion that his statements were
subject to the litigation privilege.  Davidson
argues that even if the appellate opinion did not find the call between
Davidson and Susser privileged, it found Davidson’s allegedly extortionate
threats to Plaintiff privileged.  
Pacquiao
echoes Davidson’s arguments regarding the impact of the appellate opinion on
Showtime/CBS’s SLAPP motion.  Pacquiao
argues Davidson’s alleged statements were already deemed by the Court of Appeal
to be protected by the litigation privilege and cannot form the basis of a
claim for attempted extortion.  Pacquiao
also argues on reply that, without the Davidson statements, there is no claim
for attempted extortion based on the allegations of physical intimidation and
harassment by Wildcard gym members and DOEs.
Both
Pacquiao and Davidson argue in reply that there are insufficient factual
allegations to support a finding of agency. 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff therefore fails to allege attempted
extortion or IIED against based on the conduct of third parties.  
The
Court finds in favor of Defendants on the 8th cause of action for attempted
extortion and in favor of Plaintiff on the 9th cause of action for IIED.  Defendant Pacquiao’s Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings is granted as to the 8th cause of action for attempted extortion
and is denied as to the 9th cause of action for IIED.  Defendant Davidson’s Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings is granted as to the 8th cause of action for attempted extortion
and denied as to the 9th cause of action for IIED.  
 
(1)  Attempted extortion is not a recognized
cause of action.  
The
parties do not disagree that there exists a cause of action in California for
extortion. (Fuhrman v. California Satellite Systems (1986) 179
Cal.App.3d 408, 426, disapproved of on other grounds in Silberg v. Anderson
(1990) 50 Cal.3d 205.) However, as both parties acknowledge, to bring such a claim
one must show that he or she paid the money or took whatever action is demanded
by the extortioners. As noted in Fuhrman, a claim for actual extortion was
recognized by the Supreme Court as “[h]owever denominated (e.g., extortion, menace,
duress) . . a cause of action for the recovery of money obtained by the
wrongful threat of criminal or civil prosecution.” (Fuhrman, supra, 179
Cal.App.3d at p. 426.) In that case, the court affirmed dismissal of the cause
of action on that ground. (Ibid. [“[t]he fatal flaw in plaintiff’s
action is that she apparently never paid the money defendants demanded in their
letters”].) The question here is whether there is a cause of action in
California for attempted extortion; that is, the kind of claim set forth
in Fuhrman in which the threat is made but the victim refuses to pay. 
The
Fuhrman case considered whether the cause of action in its case –
essentially, attempted extortion, or extortion without payment -- could be
upheld on some other theory, and noted that it “could be construed as one for
the recovery of damages for the severe emotional distress caused by defendants’
‘outrageous’ conduct. As such, it is simply a variation of the tort of
intentional infliction of emotional distress.” (Id. at p. 428.) There,
as here, the plaintiff had already alleged such a claim in addition to the
extortion claim, and the Court dismissed the extortion claim. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff
nonetheless urges this Court to find a cause of action for attempted extortion.
In the November 13, 2020 ruling on the Showtime/CBS SLAPP motion, Judge Sotelo
addressed the argument that attempted extortion is not a recognized cause of
action by stating, “[t]he Court finds that Rueda could allege his attempted
extortion claim:  Rueda claims that
percentage of proceeds were promised to him—it was his money.  An attempt to withhold his claimed earnings
may be attempted extortion.”  However, in
the very next sentence, Judge Sotelo acknowledged that the issue was moot given
his findings regarding Showtime/CBS’s affirmative defenses based on litigation
privilege and statute of limitations.  Therefore,
Judge Sotelo’s statement regarding Rueda’s ability to allege attempted
extortion was advisory or dicta, and not a ruling on the specific issue of
whether such a cause of action exists under California law.  
Attempted
extortion is a crime.  (Penal Code §524.)  “There are at least three different ways
alleged violations of criminal law can result in civil actions. First, and
perhaps most commonly, violation of a criminal statute can be used to establish
a breach of the standard of care or other element of an ordinary tort cause of
action.  Second, and pertinent to [plaintiff]'s
argument on appeal, a criminal statute can expressly or impliedly give rise to
a private right of action for its violation. 
Third, under some circumstances, a governmental or quasi-governmental
agency can sue to enjoin further breaches of the statute on a public nuisance
or related theory.”  (Animal Legal
Defense Fund v. Mendes (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 136, 141.)  
While
Plaintiff does not cite any controlling authority expressly recognizing that
attempted extortion is a civil cause of action, Plaintiff cites to federal
cases recognizing attempted extortion as a cause of action under California law.  (Monex Deposit Co. v. Gilliam (C.D.
Cal. 2009) 666 F.Supp.2d 1135, 1137; Leibman v. Prupes (C.D. Ca. 2015)
2015 WL 898454 *16, fn. 6; TaiMed Biologics, Inc. v. Numoda Corp. (N.D.
Cal. 2011) 2011 WL 1630041 *5; Baker v. FirstCom Music (C.D. Cal. 2018)
2018 WL 2572725 *11.  However, the Court
is not bound by federal decisions on matters of California law.  (Haynes v. EMC Mortgage Corp. (2012)
205 Cal.App.4th 329, 335; Qualified Patients Assn. v. City of Anaheim
(2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 734, 764 [“[D]ecisions of the lower federal courts are
not binding precedent [citation], particularly on issues of state law.”)  
Monex
argued recognition of a civil cause for extortion was proper even when there
was no payment of monies (thus, akin to the “attempted extortion alleged here),
given the California Supreme Court’s adoption of section 874A of the
Restatement (Second) of Torts, which states: 
“When a legislative provision protects a class of persons by proscribing
... certain conduct but does not provide a civil remedy for the violation, the
court may, if it determines that the remedy is appropriate in furtherance of
the purpose of the legislation and needed to assure the effectiveness of the
provision, accord to an injured member of the class a right of action, using a
... new cause of action analogous to an existing tort action.”  (Monex, supra, 666 F.Supp.2d at
1137.)  Monex concluded, “[B]ecause
the civil tort for extortion is derived from the crime of extortion, and because
recognizing a claim for civil extortion furthers the purpose of California
Penal Code section 523, the Court declines to dismiss the third cause of action.”  (Id.) 

The
Court does not find Monex persuasive, because Monex did
not identify any analogous, existing tort action that would support a claim for
“attempted extortion,” despite citation to the Restatement (Second) of Torts
section 874A.  (Monex, supra,
666 F.Supp.2d at 1137.)  While the
specific claim before it was for civil extortion, as noted, the plaintiff
alleged that it “never gave in to defendants’ alleged extortion(s),” and thus
the claim was for attempted extortion.  (Id.
at 1136.)  The Court finds the Fuhrman
court’s opinion better reasoned (and actually to have precedential effect) which
finds that the tort of attempted extortion, by contrast, is more analogous with
a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  (Id. at p. 428.) The Court finds that none
of the other remaining federal authorities cited are persuasive. (Leibman,
supra, 2015 WL 898454 *16, fn. 6 [not analyzing the difference between
extortion and attempted extortion and relying on Monex]; TaiMed
Biologics, Inc. v. Numoda Corp., supra, 2011 WL 1630041 *5 [citing Monex’s
analysis]; Baker v. FirstCom Music (C.D. Cal. 2018) 2018 WL 2572725 *11 [not
analyzing the difference between extortion and attempted extortion and replying
on Monex].)  
Plaintiff
also cites to an isolated ruling from a Los Angeles County trial court.  (Chang v. Ruy (2019) 2019 WL 13194157
*5 [Rico, J].)  “Trial courts do not make
binding precedents.” (9 Witkin (6th ed. 2021) California Procedure,
Appeal §507.)  “When collected and
readily available for study,” trial court orders “may be cited for their
persuasive value and are occasionally followed in the absence of controlling
higher authority.” (Id.)  However,
an isolated ruling that is not part of a readily available compilation is not
citable for its persuasive value. (Santa Ana Hosp. Med. Center v. Belshé
(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 819, 830.) Nor does the Court find the Chang case
persuasive, even if it was citable for such a purpose. The trial court there
also cited Monex but just as did the court in Monex, as noted
above, the superior court failed to consider the requirement of tethering the
new cause of action to an analogous, existing tort action.
Plaintiff
also argues attempted extortion exists as a cause of action, because it was
implicitly recognized in Flatley v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299.   Plaintiff relies on the concurring opinion
of Justice Werdegar.  The issue of
whether attempted extortion is a recognized cause of action was not before the Flatley
court.  Indeed, the majority opinion
focused on whether the conduct arose to the level of criminal extortionate conduct
(id. at p. 330), and the issue of whether a civil claim for extortion
requires the payment of money did not arise either in the majority or the
concurring opinion. “It is axiomatic that cases are not authority for
propositions that are not considered.”  (California
Building Industry Assn. v. State Water Resources Control Bd. (2018) 4 Cal.5th
1032, 1043.)  The Court cannot imply a
finding in Flatley on an issue that was never considered or presented to
the Flatley court.  
Plaintiff
fails to identify an analogous, recognized civil tort claim to attempted
extortion.  As did the court in Fuhrman,
this court finds that the most analogous tort claim would be a claim for
intentional infliction of emotional distress, which is separately pleaded as
the 9th cause of action. Plaintiff also fails to identify any other
recognized tort that is stated based on the allegations in the 8th cause of
action for attempted extortion.  Finally,
Plaintiff does not argue or establish any of these three grounds to recognize a
private, civil right of action for attempted extortion based on Penal Code
§524.  
Plaintiff
fails to establish that attempted extortion is recognized cause of action under
California law.  Defendant Pacquiao’s and
Davidson’s Motions for Judgment on the Pleadings are GRANTED as to the 8th
cause of action for Attempted Extortion. 

 
(2)
Defendants fail to establish that the affirmative defense of litigation
privilege applies to them based on the Showtime/CBS SLAPP, nor would the 9th
cause of action for IIED fail to state a claim if the litigation privilege applied
to them
The
following discussion applies to the remaining 9th cause of action for IIED. 
In
the July 26, 2023 Court of Appeal opinion on the Showtime/CBS SLAPP (“July 26,
2023 Opinion”), the Court of Appeal held that Davidson’s alleged conduct was
not illegal as a matter of law, rejecting Rueda’s position that SLAPP did not
apply per the illegality exception set forth in Flatley.  (Plaintiff’s RJN, Ex. A, July 26, 2023
Opinion, p. 13.)  The Court of Appeal
indicated that the appeal did not “challenge the trial court’s conclusion that
Davidson’s actions…were undertaken in anticipation of litigation contemplated
in good faith and under serious consideration. 
That point is accordingly waived.” 
(Plaintiff’s RJN, Ex. A, July 26, 2023 Opinion, pp. 13-14.)  
The
Court of Appeal also wrote that “Rueda has not challenged the trial court’s
determination that he has no reasonable probability of prevailing on the claims
that arise from Davidson’s conduct that we have concluded, for purposes of this
appeal, is protected by the anti-SLAPP statute (in that it is not illegal as a
matter of law).  We accordingly need not
analyze the issue; we can and do hold there was no error in granting the
anti-SLAPP motion as to those claims.” 
(Plaintiff’s RJN, Ex. A, July 26, 2023 Opinion, p. 16.)  
Defendants
Pacquiao and Davidson argue the 9th cause of action fails to state a claim
against them to the extent based on Davidson’s conduct, because those
statements are protected by the litigation privilege. Defendants argue the
finding of litigation privilege applies to them based on the doctrine of law of
the case.  
Even
if Davidson’s statements are protected by the litigation privilege, Plaintiff’s
IIED claim is based on conduct other than Davidson’s statements. (FAC, ¶101.  As made clear in the July 26, 2023 opinion,
the 8th and 9th causes of action for attempted extortion and IIED were based on
Davidson’s protected statements and unprotected “conduct of Wildcard gym
members, Palmer, or other nonparties.” 
(Plaintiff’s RJN, Ex. A, July 26, 2023 Opinion, p. 22.)  The Court of Appeal reversed the ruling to
the extent it granted Showtime/CBS’s SLAPP motion as to the entirety of the 8th
and 9th causes of action for this precise reason:  “The trial court’s order is reversed, and the
cause is remanded with directions to enter a new and different order granting
the CBS Defendants’ special motion to strike the eighth and ninth causes of
action (including the general allegations incorporated therein) except insofar
as those causes of action include claims for vicarious liability based on the
conduct of ‘Wildcard Gym members,” Palmer, or other nonparties.’” (Plaintiff’s
RJN, Ex. A, July 26, 2023 Opinion, p. 22.)
As
discussed below in connection with the remaining IIED claim, a cause of action
is stated based solely on the alleged conduct of “Wildcard Gym members, Palmer,
or other nonparties” physically intimidating and harassing Rueda.  Thus, even if the Davidson statements are
protected by the litigation privilege as to both Pacquiao and Davidson, there
remains a portion of the IIED claim that is properly stated.  A general demurrer cannot be brought to a
part of a cause of action.  If there are
sufficient allegations to entitle plaintiff to relief, other allegations cannot
be challenged by general demurrer.  (Daniels
v. Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1150, 1167
(disapproved on other grounds by Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022)
12 Cal.5th 905, 948.)  
Moreover,
Defendants fail to establish that the law of the case doctrine applies to
them.  “The decision of an appellate
court, stating a rule of law necessary to the decision of the case,
conclusively establishes that rule and makes it determinative of the rights of
the same parties in any subsequent retrial or appeal in the same case.”  (9 Witkin, Cal. Proc. (6th
ed. 2021), Appeal § 480.)  Law of the
case does not apply to issues not analyzed by the prior appeal or necessary
thereto. (Morohoshi v. Pacific Home (2004) 34 Cal.4th 482, 491-491 (law
of the case precluded plaintiff from taking issue with holding that defendant
was vicariously liable under the rationale of nondelegable duty for negligence
of co-defendant, which was decided in prior appeal, but law of the case did not
apply to issue of whether same defendant could be held vicariously liable for same
co-defendant’s breach of co-defendant’s own duty of care, which was not
analyzed in prior appeal).)
“[L]aw
of the case does not apply to arguments that might have been but were not
presented and resolved on an earlier appeal.” 
(Leider v. Lewis (2017) 2 Cal.5th 1121, 1130.)  “A most perplexing problem arises where the
point could have been determined in the first appeal, but counsel did not raise
it and the appellate court's opinion does not expressly mention it. May a point
be deemed impliedly decided for the purpose of the doctrine of the law of the
case?  The general rule holds that the
doctrine is applicable only to points raised below. In other words, stated
negatively: ‘The doctrine of the law of the case (in this state) does not extend
to the facts or the points of law which might have been but were not presented
and determined on a prior appeal.’”  (9
Witkin, Cal. Proc. (6th ed. 2021), §497.)  
Law
of the case also only applies to “those parties who appealed and whose rights
were affected by that prior appeal.”  (Bigbee
v. Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. (1983) 34 Cal.3d 49, 57.)  Thus, in Bigbee, law of the case based
on a prior appeal brought by two defendants did not apply to remaining two
co-defendants, who were not parties to the prior appeal.  (Id.) 
“Pacific Telephone and Western Electric were the only defendants who
were parties to the Bigbee I proceeding. The rights of Western
Industrial and Decker were not determined in that proceeding. Therefore, in
order to determine whether summary judgment was properly granted as to them,
this court must consider anew the question of
foreseeability.”  (Id.)
As
Plaintiff points out, neither Davidson nor Pacquiao were parties to Rueda’s
appeal of the Showtime/CBS SLAPP motion. 
On reply, Pacquiao fails to offer any satisfactory response to this
argument.  On reply, Davidson argues
Plaintiff should be estopped from denying that the litigation privilege
protects the alleged statements. 
Davidson also argues his rights were encompassed by the July 26, 2023
Opinion.  Defendants fail to adequately
respond to Plaintiff’s argument that the “same parties” requirement of law of
the case is not met.  The requirement is
not “same parties or whose rights were affected by that prior
appeal.”  The requirement is those
parties who appealed and whose rights were affected by that prior
appeal.”  Defendants fail to offer any
authority holding otherwise.
Defendants
argue the Court of Appeal did not limit its order striking the Davidson
statements and the general incorporated allegations from the FAC to
Showtime/CBS.  Defendants argue it would
be ridiculous to say that the order only applied to Showtime/CBS.  The Court disagrees.  The motion was filed by Showtime/CBS and the
relief granted would only logically be as to Showtime/CBS.  
This
is not to say that there is no legal doctrine pursuant to which Defendants
Pacquiao and Davidson could take advantage of Judge Soleto’s second prong
determinations on the Showtime/CBS SLAPP motion.  The Court only finds that Defendants Pacquiao
and Davidson have not raised any such legal doctrine on this motion for
judgment on the pleadings.  
(3)  The IIED sufficiently states a claim
against Pacquiao and Davidson 
Defendants
argue the IIED claim fails against them, because Plaintiff fails to allege any
facts that would make them vicariously liable for the conduct of third parties,
e.g. the Wildcat members.  The IIED claim
incorporates ¶¶1-45 and 91-99 of the FAC. 
Even if the July 26, 2023 opinion applied to Defendants Pacquiao and Davidson,
the Court of Appeal only struck the incorporated “general allegations.”  The Court interprets “general allegations” to
refer to ¶¶1-45.  
Based
on the allegations in support of the IIED claim, Plaintiff alleges DOES 1-6 and
“goons from the Wildcard Gym” “harassed, stalked, best and terrorized Rueda on
behalf of Roach and Paquiao.  (FAC, ¶92.)  Plaintiff alleges, “Roach and Pacquiao knew
their agents Davidson, DOES 1-6 and the goons from the Wildcard Gym would make
the above described threats or take the above-described actions.”  (FAC, ¶94.) 
Plaintiff alleges Pacquiao and Davidson intentionally caused Plaintiff
to suffer severe emotional distress by “threat[en]ing…physical harm to himself
and property…and causing him to live in fear for his safety and
livelihood.”  (FAC, ¶101.)  Plaintiff alleges he “felt fearful for his
personal and physical safety.  He could
not go out in public for fear that Wildcard Gym members and Pacquiao’s Posse
would physically attack him at anytime.” 
(FAC, ¶102.)  Plaintiff also
alleges that the DOE defendants were acting as agents of the other named
Defendants. (FAC, ¶12.)  Plaintiff specifically
alleges the threatening and menacing behavior at ¶42, that the behavior was
carried out by persons he recognized as being members of the Wildcard Gym owned
by Roach and patronized by Pacquiao’s fans. 
(FAC, ¶42.)  Plaintiff alleges the
menacing behavior occurred just after Davidson approached him with an offer to
settle his claims, and he believes was intended to intimidate him into
accepting Davidson’s offer.  (Id.
at ¶¶41 and 44.)  
“Under
the doctrine of respondeat superior, the innocent principal or employer is
liable for the torts of the agent or employee, committed while acting within
the scope of employment. It is immaterial that the employee acts in excess of
authority or contrary to instructions.”  (3
Witkin, Summary (11th ed. 2020), Agency §175.)  “The courts have approved a general statement
to the effect that the wrongdoer was the agent or employee of the defendant
principal, and “was acting in the scope of his employment.  [¶] The general averment is sufficient not
only in negligence cases but also where the cause of action is based on an
intentional tort.”   (5 Witkin, Cal. Proc. (6th
ed. 2021), ¶918.  
“An
allegation of agency constitutes an averment of ultimate fact, which we accept
as true on a demurrer.  But where factual
allegations are based on information and belief, the plaintiff must allege
information that leads the plaintiff to believe that the allegations are
true.”  (Brown v. USA Taekwondo
(2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 1077, 1106.)  “[G]eneral
allegations of agency that are contradicted by, or inconsistent with, facts
specifically pleaded, will be disregarded.” 
(5 Witkin, Cal. Proc. (6th ed. 2021), Plead §918.)
For
purposes of this motion for judgment on the pleadings, the Court accepts as
true Plaintiff’s allegation that the DOE defendants, i.e. including the “goons”
from Wildcard Gym, were agents of the named Defendants, including Pacquiao and
Davidson.  This allegation of ultimate
fact must be accepted as true, even if it is a general allegation and
regardless of Plaintiff’s ultimate ability to prove it.  Indeed, “we accept as true even improbable
alleged facts, and we do not concern ourselves with the plaintiff's ability to
prove the factual allegations.”  (Marina
Pacific Hotel and Suites, LLC v. Fireman's Fund Insurance Company (2022) 81
Cal.App.5th 96, 104–105.)  
Moreover,
Plaintiff is not alleging an ordinary agency akin to a real estate broker or an
employee.  Plaintiff is alleging that Defendants
Pacquiao and Davidson instructed these DOEs to illegally intimidate and harass
Plaintiff into accepting the settlement offer proposed by Davidson.  Plaintiff supports his general allegation of
agency with specific allegations of the circumstances indicating that the
“goons” were acting on behalf of Pacquiao and Davidson.  Whether Plaintiff can prove the claims is of course
not germane to a decision at this stage of the case.  
Defendant
Pacquiao’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings of the 9th cause of action for
IIED is DENIED. Defendant Davidson’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings of
the 9th cause of action for IIED is DENIED. 
 
 

Conclusion
Defendant Pacquiao’s Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED as the 8th cause of action for attempted
extortion and DENIED as to the 9th cause of action for IIED is DENIED. 
Defendant Davidson’s Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings of the 9th cause of action is GRANTED as to the 8th
cause of action for attempted extortion and DENIED as to the 9th cause of
action for IIED.
