And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to consolidate Case No. 22AHCV00886 with Case No. 23STCV01341. The plaintiffs, U&G Construction Group, Inc. and Zhuoheng Gu, seek to consolidate the two cases, which arise out of the same real property and the same alleged scheme to induce the plaintiff to purchase and make improvements to the property during escrow. The defendant, Real Prosperity Investment LLC, does not oppose the motion. The judge grants the motion because there are overlapping issues of fact and the parties in both cases are identical. The judge orders the plaintiffs to file a proposed Second Amended Complaint within 5 days and sets an OSC re: Failure to File Proof of Service for August 21, 2024. All future papers must be filed in Case No. 22AHCV00886, and all future hearing dates currently pending in Case No. 23STCV01341 are vacated.
