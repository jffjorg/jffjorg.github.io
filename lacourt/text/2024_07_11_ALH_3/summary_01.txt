As for the English summary, here is a brief summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted Eastern Horizon's motion to compel Pauline Yip to serve further responses to special interrogatories asking about her gross annual income for 2020-2022. The Court found that requiring disclosure of this information is not a "serious" intrusion into Yip's privacy, especially since her claims are based on her ability to repurchase the property. The Court also rejected Yip's argument that providing her net or disposable income would be a more narrowly tailored method of proving or disproving her ability to repurchase the property. Additionally, the Court denied both parties' requests for sanctions.
