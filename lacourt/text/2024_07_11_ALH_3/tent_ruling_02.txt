     CASE NO: 23STCV01341

[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE 
 
Dept.
  3
8:30
  a.m. 
July 11,
   2024



 
Plaintiffs
 U&G Construction Group, Inc. and Zhuoheng Gu (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
seek an order consolidating Case No. 22AHCV008866 with Case No.
 23STCV01341 for all purposes including trial, contending the two
actions arise out of the same real property and the same alleged scheme to induce Plaintiff
 to purchase and make improvements to said property during escrow. 
Plaintiffs also seek leave to file a
proposed Second Amended Complaint in the consolidated action which would merge
all allegations against the parties in both actions into a single pleading. Defendant
CDMY Investment, LLC (“CDMY”), is named in both actions but has only appeared
in Case No. 23STCV01341 to file demurrers, which have been sustained with leave
to amend. CDMY does not oppose this motion to consolidate or the request to
file an amended complaint. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the unopposed motion because
there are overlapping issues of fact and the parties in both actions are
identical. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048.) Plaintiffs are ordered to file the
proposed complaint within 5 days of the date of this Order. 
Case No.
 22AHCV00886 is the lead case. All future papers must be filed in Case No.
 22AHCV00886. All future hearing dates must be reserved in Case No.
 22AHCV00886. All future hearing dates currently pending in Case No.
 23STCV01341 are vacated. The Court sets an OSC re: Failure to File
Proof of Service for August 21, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3. 
Plaintiffs
are ordered to give notice and file a notice of this order in both cases. 
Dated
this 11th
day of July 2024
