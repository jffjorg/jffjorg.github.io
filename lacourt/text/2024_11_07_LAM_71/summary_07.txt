And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling continuing the motion for summary judgment filed by Dr. Marvin Anton Perer, M.D. (Moving Defendant) to February 6, 2025. The motion was filed in response to the second amended complaint filed by Plaintiffs Gina Castleberry Prewitt and Adrian Prewitt. Moving Defendant argues that his care and treatment of Gina complied with the standard of care, and that no act or omission by him caused or contributed to Gina's claimed damages. He also argues that if Gina's medical malpractice cause of action fails, then Adrian's loss of consortium cause of action, which is a derivative claim, must also fail.

The court has continued the motion to allow for additional expert discovery, as Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Paul Key, is unavailable to testify in this matter. The court notes that it will deny the motion or order a continuance for discovery where it appears there may be additional evidence.
