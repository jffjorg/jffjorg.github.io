And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court will not grant the plaintiff's request for a default judgment. Instead, the court will hold a hearing on December 9, 2024, to determine why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned for failing to enter the default judgment. The court's decision is based on two main reasons: the plaintiff did not provide authenticated exhibits to support the amount of damages sought, and the interest calculation provided was unclear and lacked explanation for the starting date used. The court is also imposing a $250 sanction on the plaintiff's counsel for their failure to comply with court rules.
