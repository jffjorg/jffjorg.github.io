And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of Jennifer Johnson vs. Simone Bellinger et al. The judge denies the plaintiff's request for default judgment and sets a hearing to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned $250. The reasons for this decision include the lack of a request for court judgment, a proposed judgment, and an incorrect address listed for Aaron J. Byrd and Robert Byrd, Jr. Additionally, the prayer for damages in the complaint does not specify the amount of damages claimed, which may be a violation of the court's jurisdiction. The judge has cited relevant case law, including Falahati v. Kondo (2005), to support this decision.
