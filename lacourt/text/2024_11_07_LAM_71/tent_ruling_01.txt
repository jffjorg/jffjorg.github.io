JENNIFER JOHNSON,  
 
  
         vs.
 
SIMONE BELLINGER, et al.


 Case No.: 
  22STCV32796
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  November 7, 2024



 
The Court denies Plaintiff’s default judgment
packet.  
The Court sets a hearing on an order to show
cause why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or Plaintiff’s counsel
sanctioned $250 for failing to enter default judgment (California Rule of
Court, rule 3.110(h)) on December 11, 2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at
Stanley Mosk Courthouse for the following reasons:

1.     No request for court judgment (CIV-100).
 
2.     No proposed judgment (JUD-100).
 
3.     The address listed on the proof of personal service
for Aaron J. Byrd and Robert Byrd, Jr., is incorrect. The address should read,
“13003 Ruthelen Street Apt 1, Gardena, CA 90249.”
 
4.     The prayer for damages in the Complaint does not
specify the amount of damages claimed.  (See,
e.g., Falahati v. Kondo (2005)
127 Cal.App.4th 823, 830-831 [court acts in excess of its jurisdiction and the
resulting default judgment is void if the court awards default judgment in an
amount greater than that demanded in the complaint, including if the complaint
does not specify the amount demanded].)
