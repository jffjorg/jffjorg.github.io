Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendants' motions for summary judgment, finding that there are triable issues of material fact regarding Dr. Srour's compliance with the standard of care and whether his acts or omissions were a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff Stefano Vitolo's injuries. The court finds that Dr. Srour's declaration that he complied with the standard of care is in conflict with the expert testimony of Dr. Krieger, which suggests that Dr. Srour breached the standard of care. The court also finds that Dr. Srour's acts or omissions were a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff Stefano Vitolo's injuries. The court concludes that the motion for summary judgment as to the first cause of action for medical negligence and the second cause of action for loss of consortium is denied.
