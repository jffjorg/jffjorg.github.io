Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff City National Bank’s Application for Default
Judgment is GRANTED in the reduced
amount of $126,809.00.
BACKGROUND
This
is a collections action. In January 2022, Plaintiff City National Bank (CNB)
entered into a written agreement with Defendant IOU USA, Inc. (IOU USA) in
which CNB agreed to extend credit to IOU. In support of the agreement,
Defendant Max Cho executed a personal guaranty. In May 2022, CNB alleges IOU
USA and Cho failed to make payments as required and now owes a balance of
$111,841.89.
On April
17, 2023, CNB filed a complaint against IOU USA, Cho, and Does 1-10, alleging causes
of action for (1) breach of contract and (2) common counts. On February 20,
2024, CNB’s process server served IOU USA through the California Secretary of
State. In March 2024 and April 2024, CNB served IOU USA and Cho by publication.
On June
27, 2024, the court entered default against IOU USA and Cho after they failed
to file a timely answer. On July 16, 2024, CNB submitted the present
application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default/Default Judgment is set for August 8, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
CNB
seeks default judgment against IOU USA and Cho in the total amount of $137,838.01,
including $100,000.00 in damages, $33,916.00 in interest, $2,890.00 in attorney
fees, and $1,032.01 in costs. Because the Court finds CNB has submitted
sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS CNB’s application for default
judgment with the following modification.
In
CNB’s supporting declaration, CNB requests interest of $33,916.44 at an annual
rate of 15.75% pursuant to paragraph ten of their contract with IOU USA and
Cho. (Moore Decl., p. 3:2-3.) But the Court notes paragraph ten of the contract
does not explicitly impose an interest rate of 15.75%. Instead, it states the
annual percentage rate is comprised of an index and margin which are calculated
by CNB and subject to change. (Moore Decl., Ex A, ¶ 10.) Because CNB does not
provide any evidence establishing what these amounts were at the time of
default, the court will limit CNB’s requested interest to the initial annual
interest rate of 10.25% as stated in the contract. (Moore Decl., Ex A, p. 1.)
Accordingly,
the court reduces the requested interest to $22,886.99 (10.25% of $100,000.00
divided by 365 = $28.0821917808 per diem multiplied by 815 days (5/16/22 –
8/08/24)) and calculates the total amount of damages as $126,809.00.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, CNB’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $126,809.00.
