 Case Number:  23PSCV02923    Hearing Date:   August 8, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Jaime Adolfo De La Vega’s Application for Default
Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Jaime Adolfo De
La Vega’s Application for Default Judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $34,838.46.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action. In April 2022, Plaintiff Jaime Adolfo De La
Vega entered into a written agreement with Defendant Mynor Rolando Mejia
Hernandez in which Mejia Hernandez agreed to remodel a property in Pomona in
exchange for estimated labor and material costs of $89,500. After Mejia
Hernandez commenced work on the Pomona property in May 2022, De La Vega agreed
to pay an additional $15,000 in August 2022 after Mejia Hernandez claimed
additional funds would be needed to complete the project. In January 2023, De
La Vega asked Mejia Hernandez to stop work on the Pomona property and sought
out the services of another contractor. De La Vega alleges that only half of
the work had been completed at this time and that twenty percent of the
completed work was unsatisfactory.
On September
21, 2023, De La Vega filed a complaint against Mejia Hernandez and Does 1-10 alleging
the following causes of action: (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (3) breach of implied warranty, and (4)
negligence. On October 30, 2023, De La Vega’s process server served Mejia
Hernandez with substitute service in Apple Valley.
On February
8, 2024, the court entered default against Mejia Hernandez after Mejia
Hernandez failed to file a timely answer. On May 1, 2024, De La Vega submitted
the present application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for August 8, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
De
La Vega seeks default judgment against Mejia Hernandez in the total amount of $217,806.22,
including $199,229.37 in damages, $12,117.51 in interest, $3,930.00 in attorney
fees, and $2,529.34 in costs. Because the Court finds De La Vega has submitted
sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS De La Vega’s application with the following
modifications.
While
De La Vega requests damages that include a total of $170,684.77 for payments
made to Mejia Hernandez, the court finds this amount is excessive. When money
damages are awarded for breach of contract, “the amount awarded is determined
with the purpose of putting the injured party in as good a position as he would
have occupied, had the contract been fully performed by the defendant.” (Pay
Less Drug Stores v. Bechdolt (1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 496, 501.) Thus, “[t]he
proper measure of damages for breach of a contract to construct improvements on
real property where the work is to be done on plaintiff's property is ordinarily
the reasonable cost to the plaintiff of completing the work.” (Glendale Fed.
Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Marina View Heights Dev. Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 101,
123.)
Here,
De La Vega initially agreed to pay $89,500 to Mejia Hernandez for work that was
to be completed on August 20, 2022. (Complaint, ¶ 9.) After Mejia Hernandez
informed De La Vega that work would not be complete by August 20, 2022, and
requested an additional $15,000 to complete the work by the end of November
2022, De La Vega agreed and continued to make payments in the total amount of
$51,584.77. (Complaint, ¶ 16-17; De La Vega Decl., ¶ 12-16.) After Mejia
Hernandez failed to complete the work by the end of November 2022, De La Vega
told Mejia Hernandez to stop the work in January 2023 and hired a new
contractor. (Complaint, ¶ 19-20; De La Vega Decl., ¶ 16-17.) Because De La Vega
agreed to pay Mejia Hernandez for the additional labor and materials, De La
Vega is not entitled to the refund of these amounts. De La Vega’s damages are
limited to the $28,544.60 in costs that De La Vega incurred in hiring a new
contractor to complete the work and to correct the deficient work done by Mejia
Hernandez. (De La Vega Decl., ¶ 24.)
Based
on the above reduction to De La Vega’s awarded damages, the court adjusts the
award of interest to $2,518.18 (10% of $28,544.60 divided by 365 = $7.820438356164384
per diem multiplied by 322 days (9/21/2023 – 8/8/2024) and the award of
attorney fees to $1,246.34 ($690 + $556.34 or 3% of $18,544.60). Accordingly,
the total judgment awarded is reduced to $34,838.46.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, De La
Vega’s application for default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount
of $34,838.46.
