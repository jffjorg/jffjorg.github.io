[1] This
demurrer and motion to strike first appeared on the Court’s calendar for
October 21, 2024.  At that time, no one
appeared for the hearing, and the Court adopted its tentative, which was
substantively similar to this tentative. 
In any event, given that the October 21 hearing date was reserved but
not used, the Court now vacates its October 21, 2024, order adopting the
tentative at that time.
