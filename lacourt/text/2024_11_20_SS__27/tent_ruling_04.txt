Legal Standard
“The¿mandatory¿relief
provision of section 473(b) is a “narrow
exception to the discretionary relief provision for default judgments and¿dismissals.” [Citation.] Its purpose “‘was to alleviate the hardship on
parties who¿lose their day in court¿due
solely to an inexcusable failure to act on the part of their attorneys.’”
[Citation.] An application for¿mandatory¿relief
must be filed within six months of entry of judgment and be in proper form,
accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. [Citation.] The defaulting party “must submit sufficient evidence
that the default was actually caused by the attorney's error. [Citation.] ‘If the prerequisites for the
application of the¿mandatory¿relief
provision of section 473, subdivision (b) exist, the trial court does not have
discretion to refuse relief.’”
[Citation.]”

Discussion
On September 4, 2024,
the Court dismissed this case without prejudice because Plaintiff failed to
file a required declaration or Request for Dismissal prior to the OSC (Order to
Show Cause) re Dismissal hearing. Plaintiff alleges this failure was due to counsel’s
oversight in not calendaring the deadline to file the declaration. Although
Plaintiff’s counsel appeared for the OSC hearing via LACourt Connect, the
matter was not heard because no declaration or Request for Dismissal had been
submitted. Plaintiff now moves the Court to vacate its September 4, 2024
dismissal.
The present motion is
timely. The case was dismissed on September 4, 2024, and the motion was filed
on October 18, 2024, within the six-month deadline under California Code of
Civil Procedure §473(b). Second, Plaintiff’s counsel has submitted a declaration
attesting to her mistake in failing to file the required documents prior to the
OSC. The dismissal was a direct result of counsel’s error. Third, dismissal is
one of the court orders that qualifies for mandatory relief under §473(b). All
statutory requirements to vacate the dismissal are satisfied.
Moreover, the parties
have already reached a settlement, and the terms of the agreement have been
presented to the Court. Dismissing the case due to counsel’s oversight would
cause undue prejudice to Plaintiff. Accordingly, the motion is granted.
