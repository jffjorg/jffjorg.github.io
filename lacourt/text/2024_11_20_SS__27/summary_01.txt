And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the Defendants, Barrett Wissman and Nina Wissman. The Judge denies the demurrer and motion to strike because they were filed late and not properly served. The Defendants had previously filed multiple motions to quash, which were denied by the Court. The Plaintiff, Merced Maldonado, served the complaint by publication, and the Defendants failed to answer the complaint within the time allowed. The Judge finds that the demurrer and motion to strike are procedurally defective and therefore denies them. The Defendants are ordered to answer the complaint within 30 days or be subject to default judgment.
