Legal Standard 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030 gives the
court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a misuse of
the discovery process. Misuse of the discovery process includes failure to
respond to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying a court order to
provide discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (g).) A court may
impose terminating sanctions by striking pleadings of the party engaged in
misuse of discovery or entering default judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (d).) A violation of a discovery order is sufficient for the imposition
of terminating sanctions. Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620. Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party
persists in disobeying the court’s orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796.) 
 
The court should consider the totality of the
circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine if the actions were
willful, the detriment to the propounding party, and the number of formal and
informal attempts to obtain discovery. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) If a lesser sanction fails to curb abuse, a greater
sanction is warranted. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th
1495, 1516.) However, “the unsuccessful imposition of a lesser sanction is not
an absolute prerequisite to the utilization of the ultimate sanction.” (Deyo,
supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787.) Before any sanctions may be imposed the court
must make an express finding that there has been a willful failure of the party
to serve the required answers. (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los Angeles
County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.) Lack of diligence may be deemed
willful where the party understood its obligation, had the ability to comply,
and failed to comply. (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787; Fred
Howland Co. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d
605, 610-611.) The party who failed to comply with discovery obligations has
the burden of showing that the failure was not willful. (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66
Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500, 605.) 
 
A terminating sanction is a “drastic measure
which should be employed with caution.” (Deyo, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.)
“A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But
where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence
shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) While the court
has discretion to impose terminating sanctions, these sanctions “should be
appropriate to the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Deyo,
84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) “[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate
sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with
his discovery obligations.” (Ibid.)
 
Discussion
On July 31, 2024,
Defendant Southern California Gas Company filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint or, in the alternative, a motion to compel Plaintiff’s initial
discovery responses. In that motion, Defendant requested terminating sanctions.
Plaintiff did not oppose the motion and failed to appear at the hearing to
contest Defendant’s request for terminating sanctions. At that time, the Court
found terminating sanctions to be premature because there was no prior
violation of court orders. Instead, the Court issued an order compelling
Plaintiff to respond to Defendant’s discovery requests, requiring Plaintiff to
serve responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories (Set No. Two), Special
Interrogatories (Set No. Two), and Requests for Production of Documents (Set
No. Two) without objections by October 9, 2024.
Despite this clear
directive, Plaintiff has failed to respond to Defendant’s discovery requests.
Defendant now moves the Court for terminating sanctions, and once again,
Plaintiff has neither opposed the motion nor provided any explanation for the
continued failure to comply with discovery obligations.
The Court finds that
Plaintiff’s repeated failure to comply with discovery obligations, disregard
for the Court’s orders, and lack of opposition to two motions for terminating
sanctions demonstrate willful disobedience and abandonment of the case. Despite
being warned of potential sanctions and ordered to respond by October 9, 2024,
Plaintiff failed to provide discovery responses, file an opposition or make an
appearance to justify his noncompliance. The Court concludes that Plaintiff has
abandoned his case, and lesser sanctions would not compel compliance with
discovery rules. Accordingly, the present motion is granted.
