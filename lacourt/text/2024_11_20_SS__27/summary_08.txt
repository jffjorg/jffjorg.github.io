Significant Statements:
  - "A terminating sanction is a 'drastic measure which should be employed with caution.'"
  - "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, to compel the plaintiff's initial discovery responses. The plaintiff has failed to comply with discovery obligations and has disregarded the court's orders. Despite being warned of potential sanctions, the plaintiff has failed to provide discovery responses and has not opposed the defendant's motion. The court finds that the plaintiff's repeated failure to comply with discovery obligations demonstrates willful disobedience and abandonment of the case. Therefore, the court is justified in imposing terminating sanctions.
