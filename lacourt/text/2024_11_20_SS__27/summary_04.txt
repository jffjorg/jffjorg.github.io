And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case, which was dismissed on September 4, 2024, due to the plaintiff's counsel's oversight in not calendaring the deadline to file a required declaration or Request for Dismissal. The court finds that the motion is timely, that the plaintiff's counsel has submitted a sworn affidavit attesting to the mistake, and that the dismissal was a direct result of counsel's error. The court also notes that the parties have reached a settlement and that dismissing the case would cause undue prejudice to the plaintiff. Therefore, the motion is granted, and the dismissal is vacated.
