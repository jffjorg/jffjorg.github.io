And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Access Services and MV Transportation. The Judge found that the defendants have met their initial burden of showing that no dangerous condition existed and that they did not breach any applicable standard of care. The plaintiff, Brenda Lee, had alleged that the defendants were liable for her injuries, but the Judge found that the plaintiff failed to present any affirmative evidence to support her claims. The Judge also denied the plaintiff's request for a continuance, finding that the plaintiff did not provide a sufficient declaration justifying the request.

The Judge's ruling is based on the evidence presented, which shows that the Access van meets or exceeds ADA standards and that the plaintiff's injuries were caused by her own actions, rather than any negligence on the part of the defendants. The Judge concludes that the plaintiff has not met her burden under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c and that the defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is granted.
