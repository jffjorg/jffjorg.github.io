And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Hertz Vehicles, LLC's motion to intervene in the lawsuit against Pablo Lopez Baltodano and others. The Judge found that Hertz Vehicles, LLC has a direct interest in the litigation, as it may be liable for any judgment against its renter, Mr. Baltodano. The Judge also found that Hertz Vehicles, LLC's ability to protect its own interests would be severely impaired without intervention, as Mr. Baltodano has failed to respond to discovery requests and is uncooperative. The Judge granted the motion for intervention, allowing Hertz Vehicles, LLC to stand in the shoes of its insured and raise defenses that Mr. Baltodano would have raised if he had cooperated.
