A Case
Management Conference is set for May 9, 2024.
Legal Standard
A demurrer may be made on grounds that the
pleading, inter alia, does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
and/or is uncertain. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e) and (f).)
When considering
demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only
allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis
for the claim against him. (Semole v.
Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer does not,
however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in
the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded therein, or
facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which a court may
take judicial knowledge.” (S. Shore Land
Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732
[citations omitted].)
Discussion
Miri demurs,
per Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10, subdivisions (e) and (f), to the entirety
of TSI’s SACC, on the basis that it fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action and is uncertain.
Request
for Judicial Notice
The court
rules on Miri’s Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) as follows: Granted as to
Exhibit 1 (i.e., January 9, 2024 order) and Granted as to Exhibit 2 (i.e.,
FACC).
Merits
First Cause
of Action (i.e., for Cancellation of Registration for Fraud)
The second cause of action alleges Cancellation of the
Registration of the Mark allegedly because of fraud. For such a claim to be
alleged, TSI must show:
(1)              
A false representation regarding a material fact;
(2)              
Miri’s knowledge or belief that the representation is false;
(3)              
Miri’s intent to induce reliance upon the misrepresentation;
(4)              
Actual, reasonable reliance on the misrepresentation; and,
(5)              
Damages.
(Vineyard House, LLC v. Constellation Brands U.S.
Operations, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2021) 515 F.Supp.3d 1061, 1077.)
Miri contends that TSI’s first cause of action fails because
TSI has not alleged damages.
“Any person who shall procure registration in the Patent and
Trademark Office of a ‘mark by a false or fraudulent declaration or
representation, oral or in writing, or by any false means, shall be liable in a
civil action by any person injured thereby for any damages sustained in
consequence thereof.” (15 U.S.C.A. § 1120 [emphasis added]). 
TSI still has not alleged any damages in its first cause of
action. TSI has only alleged that it is “likely to be damaged. . .,” which
infers that there are no existing damages (SACC, ¶ 17). Additionally, TSI
has failed to alleged with specificity the fraudulent activity by Miri to
presumably the Patent and Trademark office. (Lazar v. Superior Court
(1996) 12 Cal. 4th 631, 645 ["In California fraud must be pled
specifically; general and conclusory allegations do not suffice .... "].)
Further, “[i]t is not sufficient to allege fraud or its
elements upon information and belief, unless the facts upon which the belief is
founded are stated in the pleading.” (Dowling v. Spring Val. Water Co.
(1917) 174 Cal. 218, 221; see also Woodring v. Basso (1961) 195
Cal.App.2d 458-459 [“The allegations concerning fraud through nondisclosure at
the time of the hearing are clearly insufficient. These allegations are upon
information and belief, without a statement of the facts upon which the belief
is founded. Such a statement is required”].) TSI has not allege the information
leading it to believe the allegations set forth in Paragraph 12.
Miri’s demurrer to the first cause of action is sustained on
this basis.
Second Cause
of Action (i.e., for Common Law Unfair Competition)
“The common law tort of unfair competition is generally
thought to be synonymous with the act of ‘passing off’ one's goods as those of
another. The tort developed as an equitable remedy against the wrongful
exploitation of trade names and common law trademarks that were not otherwise
entitled to legal protection.” (Bank of the West v, Superior Court
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1263).
TSI has not
alleged facts showing that it is entitled to use of the trademark. Miri’s demurrer
to the second cause of action is sustained.
THird Cause
of Action (i.e., for Unfair Business Practices [Business and Professions Code
Section 17200, et seq.])
“To bring a UCL claim, a plaintiff must show either an (1)
unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice, or (2) unfair,
deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.” (Lippitt v. Raymond James
Financial Services, Inc. (2003) 340 F.3d 1033, 1043 [internal citations and
quotation omitted].)
TSI’s
allegations are still conclusory and factually devoid. Miri’s demurrer
to the third cause of action is sustained.
