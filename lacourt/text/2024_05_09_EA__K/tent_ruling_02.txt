 Case Number:  23PSCV00325    Hearing Date:   May 9, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiffs Zhenni
Zou’s and Xiaoye Cui’s unopposed Motion for Consolidation of Cases is GRANTED.
Background   
Case No. 23PSCV00325
Plaintiffs Zhenni Zou (“Zou”) and Xiaoye Cui (“Cui”) (together, “Zou/Cui”)
allege as follows:
On July 30, 2023, CC Express Trucking
(“CC Express”) was formed by Zou/Cui as 50/50 shareholders, each contributing
$20,000.00, and registered as a general stock corporation with the State of
California; Zou was named as its Director, CEO and CFO, while Cui was named as
its Secretary. 
 
On August 29, 2020,
Qian Yu (“Yu”) visited Zou/Cui’s
house, during which time an oral agreement was entered into wherein Yu would
become a 20% shareholder of CC Express for a $10,000.00 investment and Zou/Cui were to remain equal,
majority shareholders with 40% each of the remaining shares. On September 4,
2020, CC Express received Yu’s $10,000 investment. 
 
On November 6, 2020,
CC Express, partially with a capital contribution from Yu, purchased truck #6
for the use and benefit of CC Express with title to the truck in Yu’s name. It
was orally agreed by Yu and Zou/Cui
that Zou/Cui and Yu would
each be 33.3% shareholders. Between October-December 2021, two of CC Express’
trucks, including truck #6, broke down out-of-state, resulting in expensive
repairs and towing costs paid by CC Express. On November 26, 2021, a CC Express
truck was sold for $100,000.00; the profits from same were split equally
between Zou/Cui and Yu. Yu
used her share of the profits for her own benefit, while Zou/Cui deposited the remaining
amount into the CC Express account. Zou/Cui
believe Yu has converted truck #6 for her own use and benefit. Zou/Cui and Yu have material
disagreements which have resulted in the mismanagement of CC Express assets.
On July 5, 2023, Case Nos. 23PSCV00325 and 23STCV02756 were related;
Case No. 23PSCV00325 was designated as the lead case.
On February 13, 2024, Zou/Cui filed a Derivative First Amended Complaint,
asserting causes of action against Yu and Does 1-50 and Nominal Defendant CC
Express for:
1.      Conversion2.      Dissolution of Corporation Pursuant to
California Corporations Code § 1800 et seq.
On April 9, 2024, Yu’s default was entered.
A Case Management Conference is
set for May 9, 2024.
Case No. 23STCV02756
Yu alleges as follows: Yu, Zu and Cui are each 33.3% shareholders of
CC Express. On or about September 14, 2021, Zou and Cui set up CSZ Logistics,
Inc. (“CSZ”); since that time, Zou and Cui have transferred the entire business
of CC Express to CSZ without Yu’s consent.
On February 8, 2023, Yu filed a complaint, asserting causes of action

Legal Standard
“When actions involving a common question of law or fact are
pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all
the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated
and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid
unnecessary costs or delay.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).)
“There are two types of consolidation: a complete consolidation
resulting in a single action, and a consolidation
of separate actions for trial. Under the former procedure, which may be
utilized where the parties are identical and the causes could have been joined,
the pleadings are regarded as merged, one set of findings is made, and one
judgment is rendered. In a consolidation
for trial, the pleadings, verdicts, findings and judgments are kept separate;
the actions are simply tried together for the sake of convenience and judicial
economy.” (Sanchez v. Superior Court
(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1391, 1396 [citation omitted].)
“A notice of motion to consolidate must: (A) List all named parties in
each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of their
respective attorneys of record; (B) Contain the captions of all the cases
sought to be consolidated, with the lowest numbered case shown first; and (C)
Be filed in each case sought to be consolidated.” (Cal. Rules of Court [“CRC”]
Rule 3.350(a)(1).) “The motion to consolidate: (A) Is deemed a single motion
for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but memorandums,
declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in the lowest
numbered case; (B) Must be served on all attorneys of record and all
nonrepresented parties in all of the cases sought to be consolidated; and (C)
Must have a proof of service filed as part of the motion.” (CRC Rule 3.350,
subd. (b).)
Discussion
Zou/Cui
move the court for an order consolidating Case Nos. 23PSCV00325 and 23STCV02756 for
all purposes.
Procedural Deficiencies
At the outset, the court notes
that Plaintiff’s motion fails to comply with CRC Rule 3.350, subdivision (a)(1)(A)
and (C) [see above]. Zou/Cui’s counsel is admonished in this regard.
Merits
Case No. 23PSCV00325 arises from disputes between Zou/Cui
and Yu, the three individual shareholders of CC Express. Case No. 23STCV02756 likewise involves disputes
between Zou/Cui and Yu regarding CC Express.
Plaintiff’s unopposed request for consolidation is granted. The
court determines that Case Nos. 23PSCV00325 and 23STCV02756 should be consolidated for all purposes because (1)
there is a factual and legal overlap of the issues in the two cases, (2) there
is an overlap in the evidence and witnesses in both cases, (3) consolidation
would provide convenience to the parties and attorneys and (4) consolidation
would promote judicial economy.
