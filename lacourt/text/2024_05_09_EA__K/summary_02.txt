Here is the summary text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the unopposed motion to consolidate Case Nos. 23PSCV00325 and 23STCV02756 for all purposes. The cases involve disputes between Zhenni Zou and Xiaoye Cui, the shareholders of CC Express, and Qian Yu, who also holds a 20% stake in the company. The court finds that the cases have factual and legal overlap, and consolidation would provide convenience to the parties and attorneys, as well as promote judicial economy. The court notes that the plaintiff's motion failed to comply with the California Rules of Court, but grants the motion nevertheless.
