The court has granted the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that the plaintiff's pre-suit notice failed to comply with the requirements of California Code of Regulations, Title 27, Section 25903. The court held that the notice must identify a responsible individual within the noticing entity, and that the plaintiff's notice did not meet this requirement. The court also noted that the plaintiff's notice did not substantially comply with the requirements of the statute, and that the court must strictly construe the statute's requirements. The court granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing the action.
