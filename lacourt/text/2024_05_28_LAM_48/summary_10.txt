Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

On May 28, 2024, Judge Thomas D. Long issued a tentative ruling granting the petition for approval of transfer of structured settlement payment rights. The petition, filed by J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC, seeks to transfer certain structured settlement payment rights held by Amanda Encinas (Payee) under a settlement in connection with a personal injury claim. The transfer would involve Payee transferring 60 monthly payments of $1,996.05 each, increasing at 3% annually, beginning on March 17, 2025 and ending on February 17, 2030, in exchange for a payment of $90,000.00. The judge found that the transfer is in Payee's best interest, taking into account her financial situation and the welfare of her dependents. The judge also found that Payee knowingly waived her right to seek independent professional advice and received the required disclosure form. The transfer agreement complies with statutory requirements, and Payee understands the terms of the agreement. The judge granted the petition, and parties who intend to submit on the tentative ruling must send an email to the court.
