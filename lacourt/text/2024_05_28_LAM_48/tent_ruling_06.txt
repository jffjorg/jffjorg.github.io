Goldstein was placed in default on April 16, 2024.  “The entry of a default terminates a defendant’s
rights to take any further affirmative steps in the litigation until either its
default is set aside or a default judgment is entered.”  (Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc.
(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385.)  A defendant
in default therefore cannot file pleadings unless and until default is set aside.  (Ibid.)
