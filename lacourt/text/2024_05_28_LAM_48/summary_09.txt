Here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motions of the Defendants to set aside the defaults. The Judge concludes that the Defendants were not properly served, and that Marvin Johnson was entitled to relief due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The Judge finds that the process server did not properly serve the individual Defendants, and that Johnson did not notice the multiple copies of the summons with different names. The Judge grants the motions of Lori Gay, Jesse Ibarra, and Angela Heyward, and also grants the motion of Marvin Johnson. The defaults are vacated, and the Defendants are ordered to file and serve their answers within 10 days.
