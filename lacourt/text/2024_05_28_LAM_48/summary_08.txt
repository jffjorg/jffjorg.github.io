And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for leave to file a second amended complaint (SAC) subject to conditions. The plaintiff, Walter Gee, has filed a motion to amend his complaint and has provided a redlined copy of the proposed SAC. The defendants, Laguna Creek Construction, Inc. and Mohammadali Kalantari, have opposed the motion, arguing that the SAC is a sham pleading intended to defeat their pending motion for summary judgment. The court has rejected this argument and has granted the motion subject to the condition that the plaintiff reimburses the defendants' costs incurred in preparing the motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff is ordered to file and serve the SAC within 10 days.
