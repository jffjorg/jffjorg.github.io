  CASE NO.: 21STCV45599
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR DETERMINATION
  OF GOOD FAITH SETTLEMENT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
May 28, 2024



 
On
December 14, 2021, Plaintiff Concord Estates filed this construction defect action
against Defendants Y&Y New Hampshire Inc. and I Park Inc.  I Park also filed a cross-complaint against Y&Y,
Horizon Plastering Inc., Allstate Engineering dba Allstate Waterproofing, and others.
On
April 29, 2024, I Park filed a motion for determination of good faith settlement.
Any
party to an action with two or more joint tortfeasors may petition the court for
a determination of the issue of the good faith of a settlement.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (a)(1).)  The court’s approval of the settlement furthers
two sometimes-competing policies: (1) the equitable sharing of costs among the parties
at fault, and (2) the encouragement of settlements.  (Erreca’s v. Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th
1475, 1487.)  To demonstrate a lack of good
faith, a non-settling party must show that the settlement is so far “out of the
ballpark” as to be inconsistent with the equitable objectives of Section 877.6.  (Nutrition Now, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 209, 213.)  The Court
will typically consider: (1) the plaintiff’s (roughly) approximated total recovery;
(2) the settlor’s share of liability; (3) the size of the settlement at issue; (4)
the distribution of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs; (5) the usual discount
value when plaintiffs settle before trial; the settlor’s financial condition and
insurance policy limits; and (6) whether there is evidence of “collusion, fraud,
or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of nonsettling defendants.”  (Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates
(1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, 499.)  These factors
will be evaluated according to what information is available at the time of settlement.  (Ibid.)  “When no one objects, the barebones motion which
sets forth the ground for good faith, accompanied by a declaration which sets forth
a brief background of the case is sufficient” for the Court to grant a motion for
determination of good faith settlement.  (City
of Grand Terrace, supra, 192 Cal.App.3d at p. 1261.)
The
motion and counsel’s declaration set out the background of this case and the terms
of the settlement.  The settlement was reached
“following extensive arms-length negotiations before a neutral mediator.”  (Alsua Decl. ¶ 9.)  Under the settlement, Concord will receive $10,000
from Y&Y, $915,000 from I Park, $550,000 from Horizon, and $325,000 from Allstate,
for a total of $1.8 million.  (Motion at p.
5; see Alsua Decl. ¶ 9.)  In exchange for
dismissals, the settling parties will entered into a mutual complete and total general
release of all past, present, and future claims, including presently unknown claims
pursuant to Civil Code section 1542.  (Alsua
Decl. ¶¶ 11-13.)  There is no evidence of
collusion or fraud in the settlement.  No
party opposed the motion.
Based
on the record presented and the lack of any objection, the Court GRANTS the application,
finds this settlement was made in good faith, and orders that any other joint tortfeasor
or co-obligor is barred from asserting further claims against I Park, Y&Y, Horizon,
and Allstate for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity,
based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
