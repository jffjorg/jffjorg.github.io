And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling is issued by Judge Hon. Thomas D. Long in the case between The Greenspan Co. and Jennifer McCullum. The court is considering the Greenspan Co.'s motion to compel arbitration, which was opposed by McCullum. McCullum argues that the arbitration agreement is illegal because Greenspan was not licensed to act as a public insurance adjuster in New Mexico at the time the agreement was executed. Greenspan argues that McCullum's evidence is insufficient to support this claim. The court has ordered supplemental briefing on the issue and has continued the hearing to July 18, 2024.
