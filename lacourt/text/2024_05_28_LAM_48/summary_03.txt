And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has tentatively denied the motion to seal certain documents filed by Cross-Defendant Stacy Summers. The Court finds that the motion does not meet the requirements for sealing, as the accompanying declaration does not contain facts sufficient to justify the sealing. Additionally, the documents were not properly lodged with the Court, and the Court is unable to review them. The motion to seal is denied, without prejudice to the filing of a renewed motion that satisfies all requirements for sealing.
