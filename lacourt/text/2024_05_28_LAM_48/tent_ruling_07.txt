  CASE NO.: 23STCV01149
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING MOTION TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
May 28, 2024



 
Harlan
Legal PC, counsel of record for Defendant Rock Assets LLC, seeks to be relieved
as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states
that there has been an irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship, and the client has failed to fulfill an obligation owed to
counsel under the terms of their agreement.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
generally complies with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362.  Trial is not until December 2, 2024, and there
is no showing of prejudice.
However,
counsel filed a blank form MC-053 Order Granting Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.  Counsel needs to fill in the form, including the
information about how counsel served Rock Assets, Rock Assets’ current or last known
address and telephone number, and all upcoming hearing dates.
The
motion to be relieved as counsel is CONTINUED to June 18, 2024 at 8:30
a.m.  No later than five court days
before the hearing, counsel is ordered to file an amended and complete proposed
order.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit.  If all parties in the case submit on the
tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are required unless a
companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference) is also on
calendar.
 
      
Dated this 28th day of May 2024
