Background
 
            On October 9, 2024, Plaintiff
Champion Echo Park, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed an unlawful detainer complaint
against Defendant Pineapple, Inc. (“Defendant”) based on Defendant’s failure to
pay rent according to the lease for the property located at 1485 West Sunset
Blvd., Los Angeles, California 90026.
 
            On October 21, 2024, Defendant filed
an answer to Plaintiff’s complaint. 
            
            On November 27, 2024, the court
granted Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment. 
            
            On December 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed
this Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs. On January 2, 2025, Defendant filed
an opposition. On January 3, 2025, Plaintiff filed a reply. 
 
            On December 18, 2024, the court
entered a judgment in favor of Plaintiff. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
            A prevailing party is entitled to
recover its attorney’s fees when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code
of Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(10); Civ. Code § 1717(a).) “A successful party means
a prevailing party, and [a party] may be considered prevailing parties for
attorney’s fees purposes if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation
which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.” (Bowman
v. City of Berkeley (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 173, 178.)
 
Discussion
 
A.             
The Parties’ Arguments
 
            Plaintiff moves the court to award
him $17,804.91, which is comprised of $16,157.00 in attorney’s time billed, and
$1,647.91 in costs and expenses associated with litigation. (Motion for
Attorney’s Fees, at p. 5; Memorandum of Costs, at p. 1.)
 
            In opposition, Defendant argues that
Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees and costs was filed prematurely under
California Rules of Court 3.1702 and should be denied. (Opp., at p. 2.)
Additionally, Defendant argues that the amount requested by Plaintiff is
unreasonable. (Id., at pp. 2-3.)
 
            In reply, Plaintiff argues that
Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff is the prevailing party nor that
Plaintiff is entitled to recover fees and costs. (Reply, at p. 2.) Plaintiff
also argues that rule 3.1702 only provides the statutory deadline for filing
this motion and does not create a window before the motion can be filed. (Ibid.)
As such, Plaintiff contends this motion is timely. (Ibid.)
 
            As an initial matter, the court
finds that Plaintiff’s motion is not premature under California Rules of Court
3.1702(b)(1). “A notice of motion to claim attorney’s fees for services up to
and including the rendition of judgment in the trial court . . . must be served
and filed within the time for filing a notice of appeal under rules 8.104 and 8.108 in an
unlimited civil case or under rules 8.822 and 8.823 in a limited civil case.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1702, subd. (b)(1).) Generally, the deadline for
filing notices of appeal is 60 days after notice of entry of judgment. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 8.104, subd. (a).) As Plaintiff’s motion was filed within
60 days after notice of entry of judgment, it is timely. 
 
B.             
Authority for Fees & Prevailing Party
 
1.              
Legal Standard 
A prevailing party in a
lawsuit includes “the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose
favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant
obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not
recover any relief against that defendant.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 1032(a)(4).) 
2.              
Discussion 
 
            The court granted Plaintiff’s Motion
for Summary Judgment on November 27,
2024 and entered judgement for Plaintiff and against Defendant on December 18,
2024. As such, Plaintiff is the prevailing party entitled to reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs. 
 
3.              
Method of Calculation for Fees 
 
            Plaintiff uses the lodestar
adjustment method to calculate his request for attorney’s fees. (Motion for
Attorney’s Fees, at p. 10, Exh. A.) 
 
            Defendant does not dispute using the
lodestar method nor proposes a different method. 
 
            The court uses the lodestar
adjustment method to calculate fees.
 
4.              
Reasonableness of the Fees Claimed
 
a.               
Reasonableness of the Hourly Rates
 
                                                                            
i.                   
Legal Standard 
 
            “The courts repeatedly have stated
that the trial court is in the best position to value the services rendered by
the attorneys in his or her courtroom, and this includes the determination of
the hourly rate that will be used in the lodestar calculus. In making its
calculation, the court may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with the
legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney
requesting fees, the difficulty or complexity of the litigation to which that
skill was applied, and affidavits from other attorneys regarding prevailing
fees in the community and rate determinations in other cases.” (569 East
County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6
Cal.App.5th 426, 437, citations omitted.) 
 
                                                                          
ii.                   
Discussion 
 
            Counsel for Plaintiff, Andrew V.
Jablon (“Jablon”), has an hourly rate of $535.00 per hour. (Jablon Decl., ¶ 4.)
Jablon graduated from Georgetown University Law Center and has practiced as an
attorney for over 10 years. (Ibid.) 
 
            In opposition, Defendant argues that
the amount requested by Plaintiff is patently unreasonable and outrageous as
only a motion for summary judgment was filed with limited discovery. (Opp., at
p. 3.) 
 
            In reply, Plaintiff contends that Defendant
does not argue that the work billed was unnecessary or took an undue amount of
time. (Reply, at p. 4.) As such, Plaintiff argues that the fees requested are
reasonable. (Ibid.)
 
            After considering the information
provided, the court finds that the appropriate hourly rate for Counsel Jablon is
$475.00 per hour. 
 
b.              
Reasonableness of the Number of Hours
 
                                                                            
i.                   
Legal Standard 
 
            “Under the lodestar adjustment
methodology, the trial court must initially determine the actual time expended
and then ascertain whether under all the circumstances¿of the case the amount
of actual time expended and the monetary charge being made for the time
expended are reasonable. Factors to be considered include, but are not limited
to, the complexity of the case and procedural demands, the attorney skill
exhibited and the results achieved. The prevailing party and fee applicant
bears the burden of showing that the fees incurred were reasonably necessary
to¿the conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in amount. It follows
that if the prevailing party fails to meet this burden, and the court finds the
time expended or amount charged is not reasonable under the circumstances, then
the court must take this into account and award attorney fees in a lesser
amount.” (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of N. Am., LLC (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240,
247 [cleaned up].) 
 
                                                                                              
ii.     Discussion

 
            Counsel Jablon claims that 30.20
total hours were incurred in litigating this matter. (Motion for Attorney’s
Fees, at p. 10, Exh. A.)
 
            In opposition, Defendant argues that
Plaintiff’s counsel’s fees are unreasonable and outrageous as only a motion for
summary judgment was filed with limited discovery. (Opp., at p. 3.) 
 
            In reply, Plaintiff continues to
argue that the requested attorney’s fees are reasonable. (Reply, at p. 4.)
 
            In this case, the declaration
provided by Plaintiff’s counsel is sufficient to meet the burden of proving the
reasonableness of the claimed fees in terms of amounts and tasks. To satisfy
this burden, evidence and descriptions of billable tasks must be presented in
sufficient detail, enabling the court to evaluate whether the case was
overstaffed, the time attorneys spent on specific claims, and the
reasonableness of the hours expended. (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014)
230 Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)
 
            Plaintiff’s fee recovery is based on
30.20 hours Plaintiff’s counsel spent litigating this case. (Motion for
Attorney’s Fees, at p. 10, Exh. A.) The court agrees, in part, with Defendant
that the only substantive portion of this case involved the filing of a Motion
for Summary Judgment on a fairly limited issue. As a result, the court finds the
fees incurred are unreasonable, as captured in the billing entries submitted,
and will adjust them accordingly. The court understands the submission of Plaintiff’s
time records is not necessary under California law and  “are entitled to credence in the absence of a
clear indication the records are erroneous.” (Horsford v. Board of Trustees
of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.) However, in
this case, given the nature of the case and the work involved, the court finds
a reduction in the amount of hours is necessary.
 
               Accordingly,
the court grants Plaintiff’s requested attorney’s fees in the reduced amount of
$9,500.00 for 20.00 hours at $475.00 per hour. 

 
5.              
Reasonableness of the Costs Claimed 
 
            Plaintiff lists $1,647.91 in costs
and expenses as seen evidenced in Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Costs. (Memorandum
of Costs, at p. 1.)
 
            The
court notes that as a prevailing party, Plaintiff can obtain costs.
Accordingly, the court finds that all
of these costs are reasonable and allowable under at least one of the cost
statutes. 
 
            The
court will award $1,647.91 in
costs and expenses.  
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff
Champion Echo Park, LLC’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs is GRANTED in
part. Fees and costs are AWARDED in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in
the reduced amount of $11,147.91, comprised of $9,500.00 in attorney’s fees and
$1,647.91 in costs and expenses.
