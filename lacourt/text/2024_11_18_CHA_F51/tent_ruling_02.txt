BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff brings this action under the Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act (Civil Code § 1790 et seq.) for a vehicle he purchased on or
around 5/14/22, for which Defendant issued the manufacturer’s express warranty.
(Compl. ¶¶ 7, 11.) Plaintiff alleges that “Defendants violated the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act by failing to conform the Vehicle to the express written
warranties within a reasonable number of repair attempts or within the warranty
periods, and by failing to promptly replace the vehicle or make restitution to Plaintiff,”
after “defects, malfunctions, and nonconformities that were presented to
Defendant’s authorized repair facilities multiple times and substantially
impair the use, value, and/or safety of the Vehicle.”  (Id. at ¶¶ 15–16.) 
 
On 8/16/23, Plaintiff filed her complaint, alleging against the
dealership and manufacturer defendants the following causes of action: (1)
Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty; (2) Violation of
Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty; (3) Violation of Business and
Professions Code § 17200; and (4) Negligent Repair (against the dealership
defendant). On 11/27/23, Defendant filed its answer.
 
On 12/8/23, Plaintiff served her first set of Form
Interrogatories, RFPs, Special Interrogatories, and RFAs on Defendant. (Decl.
of Jonathan Mora ¶ 3.) On 9/20/24, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motions to
compel Defendant’s objection-free responses to Plaintiff’s first set of Form
Interrogatories, RFPs, and Special Interrogatories. 
 
On 10/24/24, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel
Defendant’s compliance with the Court’s 9/20/24 Order. On 11/12/24, Defendant
filed an untimely opposition. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1005, subd. (b).) No reply has
been filed to date.
 
ANALYSIS
 
The Court has the statutory power to “compel obedience to
its judgments, orders, and process, and to the orders of a judge out of court,
in an action or proceeding pending therein.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 128, subd.
(a)(4).) 
 
Here, Plaintiff asserts that
despite having been provided with an extension to comply, “Defendant has
failed to provide any responses to Plaintiff’s in accord with this Court’s
September 20, 2024, order.” (Pl.’s Mot.
4:7–23.) In opposition, Defendant asserts that “FCA US’s verified, Court
ordered responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Production of Documents, Set One,
were served to Plaintiff on November 11, 2024.” (Decl. of Gregory G. Brezovec ¶
3.) While the Court notes that Plaintiff has failed to file a reply to
Defendant’s opposition, it also notes that Defendant’s untimely filing and
service of its opposition thereby deprived Plaintiff of an opportunity to file
a timely reply. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1005, subd. (b).)
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the
instant motion is moot, as Defendant has now complied with the Court’s 9/20/24
order granting Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s
first set of Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and RFPs. To the
extent that Defendant’s discovery responses are somehow defective or
insufficient, the Court notes that Plaintiff may bring a motion to compel
further discovery responses. The Court emphasizes the statutory requirements
prior to bringing such a motion, particularly that counsel for the parties must
engage in meaningful meet and confer conversations, either in-person or
telephonically.
 
“The court may impose a
monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030, subd. (a).) Here, based on Defendant’s
delay in providing initial responses to Plaintiff’s discovery requests,
necessitating two motions to compel, and based on Defendant’s delay in filing
an opposition to the instant motion, the Court finds it reasonable to issue
monetary sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $1,000.00.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion
is off-calendar as moot. The Court issues monetary sanctions against Defendant
in the amount of $1,000.00 payable within 60 days.
