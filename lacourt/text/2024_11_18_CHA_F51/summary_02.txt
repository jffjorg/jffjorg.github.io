And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Claudia Perez v. FCA US, LLC. The Plaintiff, Claudia Perez, brought a motion to compel the Defendant, FCA US, LLC, to comply with the Court's 9/20/24 order requiring the Defendant to provide objection-free responses to the Plaintiff's first set of discovery requests within 30 days. The Plaintiff also sought $1,500.00 in monetary sanctions against the Defendant.

The Court finds that the motion is moot because the Defendant has now complied with the Court's order. However, the Court notes that the Defendant's delay in providing initial responses to the Plaintiff's discovery requests and its untimely filing of an opposition to the instant motion justify the imposition of monetary sanctions.

Accordingly, the Court issues monetary sanctions against the Defendant in the amount of $1,000.00 payable within 60 days. The Court also emphasizes the importance of counsel for the parties engaging in meaningful meet and confer conversations prior to bringing a motion to compel further discovery responses.
