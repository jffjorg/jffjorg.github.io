And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions for reconsideration and to set aside default. The plaintiff, Nestor Manrique, moves to reconsider the court's denial of his request for default judgment, which was denied on November 20, 2023, because he failed to complete a CIV-100 form and did not provide allegations of damages. The judge finds that the court's order was not based on legal error and that the plaintiff has not presented new facts or evidence that would justify reconsideration. Therefore, the motion for reconsideration is denied.

The defendant, Peggi Carbonel, moves to set aside the default entered against her, alleging that she did not receive actual notice of the action and that her failure to answer was due to excusable neglect. However, the judge finds that the defendant did not provide a declaration attesting to her lack of notice and did not argue that she was not aware of the action. Therefore, the motion to set aside default is denied.

The judge concludes that the motions for reconsideration and to set aside default are denied, and the case will proceed as scheduled.
