  Case Number:  20STCV44672    Hearing Date:   June 6, 2024    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  6/6/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  20STCV44672 ARAM KARYAN vs JAYSN KEITH DOBARD, et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  Jaysn Keith Dobard and Skyline Exchange LLC RECOMMENDATION:  GRANT in the following amounts: Principal damages: $71,445.00 Costs: $17.66 TOTAL: $71,462.66   TENTATIVE  Plaintiff Aram Karyan (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants Jaysn Keith Dobard (“Dobard”) and Skyline Exchange LLC (“Skyline”) for damages arising from a September 12, 2019 motor vehicle incident. Dobard is alleged to have been operating the motor vehicle in the course of his employment with Skyline. Plaintiff has properly dismissed all unnamed Doe defendants.  The Court notes that after curing the defects identified in the last denial, Plaintiff did not file a renewed application on CIV-100. Nonetheless, in the interests of judicial economy, the Court will consider the CIV-100s filed on January 17, 2024 seeking judgment against Dobard and Skyline, and will consider them in conjunction with the proposed judgment (JUD-100) and declarations filed on April 19, 2024.   Plaintiff seeks $51,445 in special damages, and $250,000 in general damages against Dobard and Skyline.   Plaintiff declares that because of the automobile collision, he received epidural injections due to back pain. Plaintiff avers his back never fully recovered, and that he is unable to sit for more than thirty minutes without having to take a break to stretch his back. In support of his medical expenses, Plaintiff provides evidence of past medical specials amounting to $51,445. The request for $51,445 in special damages is therefore granted.  However, based on the evidence provided, Plaintiff has not substantiated general damages in the amount of $250,000. The amount in general damages is reduced to $20,000.  Lastly, Plaintiff seeks $824.43 in costs, yet the memorandum of costs on Item 7 only provides for $17.66 in clerk’s filing fees. The Court will not grant non-itemized and unspecific requests. Therefore, Plaintiff is awarded the $17.66 in clerk’s filing fees only.   Based on the foregoing, the application for default judgment filed on January 17, 2024 is GRANTED in the principal amount of $71,445, and $17.66 in costs, against Jaysn Keith Dobard and Skyline Exchange LLC, jointly and severally.
