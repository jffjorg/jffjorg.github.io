And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to continue the trial date from August 19, 2024, to January 2, 2025, or a date thereafter. The motion was unopposed and the court considered the factors set forth in California Rules of Court (CRC) Rule 3.1332 in making its decision. The defendant needs additional time to obtain medical records from the Department of Veteran Affairs and to complete an independent medical examination of the plaintiff. The court finds that a continuance is warranted given the defendant's diligence in seeking the necessary records and the lack of opposition from the plaintiff.
