And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Neil Pio Fernandes, has filed a motion to consolidate three cases (22STCV29932, 22STCV30845, and 22STCV30912) due to common questions of law and fact arising from the same automobile accident on September 22, 2020. However, the court has denied the motion because the notice of motion was not filed in both cases, violating California Rules of Court, Rule 3.350. The defendant is ordered to refile the motion after complying with all Rules of Court. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and are reminded to submit any objections to the tentative ruling by email. If no objections are received, the court may adopt the tentative ruling as the final order of the court.
