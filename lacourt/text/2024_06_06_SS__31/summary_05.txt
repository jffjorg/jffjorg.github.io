Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Krystyn Chavez (plaintiff) vs. Jose Torres Carballo and Mehran Termechi (defendants). The plaintiff sought to compel the defendants to respond to discovery requests and to deem certain requests for admission (RFAs) admitted. The defendants argued that the motions were timely served and that the plaintiff failed to provide verifications. The court found that the motions to compel and deem RFAs admitted were moot due to the responses and verifications served on the plaintiff prior to the hearing. The court also found that sanctions were warranted due to the defendants' failure to respond timely to the discovery requests. The court awarded the plaintiff $800 in monetary sanctions, to be paid by the defendants and their counsel. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if necessary, to submit their positions on the tentative ruling.
