And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to compel arbitration is granted. The defendant is seeking to compel arbitration based on the arbitration provision in the lease agreement executed by the plaintiff on May 29, 2023. The judge has found that the defendant is a third-party beneficiary of the lease agreement and that the agreement shows an intent to confer a benefit to the defendant. The judge has also found that the plaintiff has not presented any authority to support their argument that a named third-party beneficiary cannot compel arbitration. As a result, the judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and has stayed the action.
