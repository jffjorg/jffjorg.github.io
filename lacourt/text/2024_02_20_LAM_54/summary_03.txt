And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to compel arbitration as against the plaintiffs only, and stays the action in its entirety. The motion was filed by Defendant Norman Reeves, Inc. and joined by Defendant Honda Motor Co., Inc. The arbitration provision in the Retail Installment Sale Contract executed by the plaintiffs on February 27, 2021, provides for arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). The Court finds that the moving defendants have met their burden to establish the existence of an agreement to arbitrate, and that the burden shifts to the plaintiffs to establish any defenses to enforcement.

The Court also finds that the plaintiffs have not established waiver of the right to compel arbitration, despite allegations of delay. The agreement provides for AAA as the arbitrator, but allows for a different arbitrator with mutual consent from the parties. The Court will not order the action to JAMS, as the moving defendants have not agreed to that.

The ruling grants the motion to compel arbitration as to Defendant Norman Reeves, Inc. and Honda Motor Co., Inc. only, and stays the action in its entirety.
