The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply.
 
Plaintiff moves to compel verifications of Defendant’s discovery
responses, to compel responses to RPDs, set two, and to deem RFAs admitted
against Defendant. 
 
In opposition, Defendant represents that verifications have been served
and responses to RPDs, set two, will be served before the hearing on the
motions. In reply, Plaintiff admits verification and responses have been
served, but requests sanctions for bringing the motions. 
 
As verification and responses have been served, Plaintiff’s motions are
DENIED. The Court declines to award sanctions as these motions should have been
taken off calendar upon receipt of Defendant’s production.
