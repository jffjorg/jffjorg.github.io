  Case Number:  22SMCV01939    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   SAMRON & ASSOCIATES, et al.,    Plaintiff, v.  3523 GREENFIELD, LLC, et al.,  Defendants.    Case No.:  22SMCV01939     Hearing Date:  June 13, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO COMPEL    ALVARO CASTILLO, TO ANSWER,    SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES,    WITHOUT OBJECTIONS AND FOR    SANCTIONS, COSTS AND ATTORNEYS’    FEES OF $752.82 AGAINST CASTILLO    AND HIS COUNSEL   BACKGROUND This action arises from alleged construction defects.  Plaintiff Samron & Associates (“Samron”) purchased a remodeled single-family residence from Defendant 3523 Greenfield, LLC (“Greenfield”).  The home is located at 3523 Greenfield Ave, Los Angeles, California (the “Property”). Plaintiff alleges numerous defects with the construction.  Plaintiff alleges Defendant Alvaro Castillo was involved in the hiring of several unskilled and unlicensed “contractors” who participated in the construction of their home.  Plaintiff has added these various contractors as defendants in this action.   On February 29, 2024, Plaintiff e-mail served Castillo with special interrogatories designed to determine a good address for service of process for the various individuals and small companies who were added as defendants in the action.  Responses to the interrogatories were due by April 1, 2024.  Castillo did not answer the interrogatories.     On April 11, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a letter to Castillo’s counsel demanding answers to the special interrogatories.  Castillo’s counsel never responded.   This hearing is on Plaintiff’s motion to compel Castillo to respond to special interrogatories without objections.  Plaintiff also seeks $752.82 in sanctions.   LEGAL STANDARD A motion to compel an initial response can be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response to interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); see¿Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)   Failing to timely respond waives any objections. (CCP § 2030.290(a).) To move to compel initial responses, a movant must show: (1) proper service (see¿Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.080, subd. (a)); (2) expiration of the deadline for the initial response, 30 days after service or on date agreed to by the parties (see¿Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subds. (a),¿(b)); and (3) no timely response (see¿Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.90). There is no “meet and confer” requirement where there is a total failure to respond to discovery.  (Sinaiko, 148 Cal.App.4th at 411.)  There is also no separate statement requirement for a motion to compel initial responses.  (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(b).) Where the court grants a motion to compel responses, sanctions shall be imposed against a party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the person or entity acted with substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.90, 2033.280, subds. (c);¿Cal. Rule of Court, rule 3.1348.)  In addition, the court may award sanctions for any misuse of discovery process.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2023.010¿and¿2023.030.)  A failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse of the discovery process.  (Code Civ. Proc, § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿ DISCUSSION All the requirements for a court order compelling a party to answer discovery have been met here.  Plaintiff properly served Castillo with special interrogatories.  The deadline to respond was April 1, 2024.  Castillo failed to timely respond.  Accordingly, he has waived all objections and must respond to the special interrogatories without objections. The Court further concludes sanctions are warranted given Castillo’s misuse of the discovery process in failing to timely respond.  In calculating the amount of sanctions, the Court starts with the lodestar which is the reasonable hourly rate multiplied by the reasonable hours expended.   Plaintiff’s counsel bills at an hourly rate of $450, but there are no further facts to support the reasonableness of his rate.  Counsel does not specify how long he has been in practice, and accordingly, the Court cannot conclude whether his rate is reasonable for an attorney of similar experience in the prevailing market.  Counsel also does not state whether his hourly rate has been approved by other Courts.  Accordingly, the Court will use an hourly rate of $250.     As to the time expended, the Court concludes that 1.5 hours to prepare the motion is reasonable.  Plaintiff also seeks costs of $77.82 for filing fees which the Court also concludes is reasonable.   CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to special interrogatories and for sanctions.  Sanctions in the amount of $452.82 is awarded against Castillo and his counsel, jointly and severally.      IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: June 13, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
