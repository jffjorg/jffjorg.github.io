Lesley Talavera’s Motion to Compel Further Responses
from Defendant Philly Auto, Inc. to Special Interrogatories, Set One is granted.

 
Background
 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on February 7, 2023.
Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff alleges that her 2029 Land
Rover Discovery suffers from transmission defects. Plaintiff set forth causes
of action under the Song-Beverly Act and the Consumer Legal Remedies Act.  
 
Motions to
Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents and Special
Interrogatories
 
A party responding to an
inspection demand shall respond to each demand with one of the following:  a statement the party will comply with the
demand, a representation the party lacks the ability to comply with the demand,
or an objection.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.210, subd. (a).)  A response to an
inspection demand may be inadequate because it is evasive or incomplete;
contains an incomplete statement of compliance; an inadequate, incomplete, or
evasive representation of inability to comply; or meritless or overly general
objections to a demand.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).) 
 
If a demanding party
believes the responding party responded inadequately, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling further response. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)  “Unless notice of this motion is given within
45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party
and the responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any
right to compel a further response to the demand.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(c).)   
 
 Where
responses to interrogatories have been served but the requesting party believes
that they are deficient because the answers are evasive or incomplete, or,
because an objection is without merit, that party may move for an order
compelling a further response.  CCP §
2030.300(a).  Notice of the motion must
be given within 45 days after service of verified responses in question, or any
verified supplemental responses.  CCP §
2030.300(c).  The motion must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration in compliance with CCP §
2016.040.  CCP § 2030.300(b).
 
Meet and
Confer
 
Plaintiff set forth meet and
confer declarations in substantial compliance with CCP §§ 2030.300(b) and
2031.310(b)(2).  (Declarations, David Alan
Cooper, ¶¶ 4-11.)
 
Motions to
Compel 
 
Request for Production of
Documents, Set One
 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel
further responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, is granted,
in part, and denied without prejudice, in part. 
 
As to Requests 2, 7, 8, 11-14,
16, and 17, the motion is granted. The responses are
incomplete, evasive, not code-compliant, and/or the objections are without
merit.

 
As to Request 3, Defendant
set forth an unqualified statement of compliance. If Defendant did not produce
documents in connection with that statement, the proper motion would be a
motion to compel compliance under Section 2031.320 and not a motion to compel
further responses under Section 2031.310.
 
In addition, the Court notes
that, as to all the requests, Defendant’s responses are not verified. Unverified
responses are tantamount to no responses at all. Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636. 
 
As to Requests 2, 7, 8,
11-14, 16, and 17, the motion is granted, and Defendant is ordered to serve
further verified responses without objections within 10 days of this date.
 
As to Request 3, the motion
is denied without prejudice subject to the filing of a proper motion to compel
compliance.
 
Special Interrogatories, Set
One
 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel
further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, is granted.  
 
As to special
interrogatories 1 to 6, the responses are incomplete, evasive, not
code-compliant, and/or the objections are without merit.
 
In addition, as to all the
requests, Defendant’s responses are not verified. Unverified responses are
tantamount to no responses at all. Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636. 
 
As to special interrogatories
1 to 6, Defendant is ordered to serve further verified responses without
objections within 10 days of this date.
 
Finally, the Court informs
the parties that Dept M requires an informal discovery conference prior to the
hearing date for future motions to compel further responses to discovery.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.
