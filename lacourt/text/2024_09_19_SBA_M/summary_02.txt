And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Kintetsu Enterprises Company of America v. Rexford Industrial Acquisitions, LLC, et al. The case involves a dispute between the plaintiff, who owns the Miyako Hybrid Hotel, and the defendants, who developed a warehouse project in the City of Torrance, adjacent to the hotel.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the eighth and ninth causes of action, which alleged that the City of Torrance had a mandatory duty to prevent noise and other harm from the warehouse project. The judge found that the plaintiff had failed to identify an enactment that imposes a mandatory duty, and that the City of Torrance did not have a duty to prevent harm from the project.

The judge also found that the plaintiff had failed to state a cause of action for declaratory relief, as the controversy was not justiciable and did not involve a proper subject for declaratory relief. The judge granted the defendants 20 days to amend their demurrer.

The judge's ruling is tentative and subject to change after further briefing and argument.
