Summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is to sustain the demurrer filed by Irene Terrell and dismiss the case without leave to amend. The court finds that the causes of action in the current case are duplicative of those already pending in an earlier action between the same parties. The court notes that the parties have not opposed the demurrer and that it appears to be a waste of resources for all parties, including the plaintiffs, for the case to continue. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs have not shown how an amendment to the complaint would cure the problems with the current complaint.
