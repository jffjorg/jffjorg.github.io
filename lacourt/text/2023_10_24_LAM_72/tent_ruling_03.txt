Defendant Irene Terrell (Terrell) filed a demurrer
to the complaint in this action on May 30, 2023.  
 
The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer without leave to
amend.  This action accordingly will be
dismissed.
 
Background
 
This action concerns Plaintiffs’
claims that the duplex residence at which they lived, located at 6810 S. Van
Ness Avenue in Los Angeles, was not habitable. Defendant Irene Terrell (“Defendant”)
owns the building, which is managed by her family members.
 
On August 31, 2022, Plaintiffs
filed Nickiah Sims v. Irene Terrell, et al., case number 22STCV28503
assigned to Department 12 of the Los Angeles Superior Court (the “Earlier
Action”).  The Earlier Action alleged
causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of implied warranty of
habitability; (3) nuisance; (4) negligence; (5) intentional infliction of
emotional distress, (6) retaliatory eviction, and (7) violation of California
Civil Code Section 1942.4. In the earlier action, Terrell served and filed an
Answer on January 17, 2023.
 
On December 14, 2022, Plaintiffs
filed the current complaint against Defendants Maria Acosta, Allen Acosta, and
Does 1-50, alleging causes of action for (1) private nuisance, (2) negligence,
(3) breach of warranty of habitability, (4) breach of covenant of good faith
and fair dealing, (5) breach of implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, (6)
violation of Civil Code Section 1942.7, and (7) intentional infliction of
emotional distress. 
 
Defendant Irene Tyrell was not
named in the original complaint. 
However, on February 15, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an amendment to the
complaint identifying Irene Tyrell as Doe No. 1.  On the same day, Plaintiffs attempted to
dismiss certain claims without prejudice, but the request for dismissal was not
entered. On 2/17/2023 the Court ordered dismissal pursuant to the oral request
made by counsel for Plaintiff without prejudice as to” “Maria Acosta et
al.”  
 
Because of the words “et al” in
the dismissal order, it is not entirely clear whether the Court meant to
dismiss only Maria Acosta and Allen Acosta or all defendants, including
Tyrell.  The parties have been conducting
themselves as if Maria and Allen Acosta are no longer in the case, but that the
case is still pending against Tyrell. 
The Court will proceed with that understanding.
 
On May 30, 2023, Terrell demurred
to the complaint, arguing that the claims against her in the complaint were
duplicative of those pending against her in the Earlier Action.  The demurrer was originally set for hearing
on July 20, 2023.  On July 12, 2023, the
Court on its own motion continued the hearing on the demurrer to September 21,
2023, along with a case management conference and Plaintiffs’ counsel’s motions
to be relieved as counsel.  On August 21,
2023, Terrell continued her demurrer hearing to October 24, 2023, which allowed
for time for an opposition by Plaintiffs between Plaintiffs’ counsel being
relieved as counsel and the hearing on the demurrer.  On September 21, 2023, the Court granted
Plaintiffs’ counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel.
 
To date, Plaintiffs have not filed
an opposition to the demurrer.  Terrell
filed a notice of non-opposition on October 13, 2023.
 
 
Legal Standard
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding,
the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A
demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab,
Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As
such, the court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or
implied factual allegations. (Id.) The only issue a demurrer is concerned with
is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
The Court does not “read passages from a
complaint in isolation; in reviewing a ruling on a demurrer, we read the
complaint ‘as a whole and its parts in their context.’ [Citation.]” (West v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 804.) The Court
“assume[s] the truth of the properly pleaded factual allegations, facts that
reasonably can be inferred from those expressly pleaded and matters of which
judicial notice has been taken.” (Harris, supra, 56 Cal.4th p. 240.)
“The court does not, however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions, or
conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) 
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend
must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is
on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully.
(Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.)
However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state
a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to
amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245.)           
 
Discussion
 
          Meet and
Confer 
California Code of Civil Procedure
§§ 430.4 (a), and 435.5 (a), requires meeting and conferring “in person or by
telephone” at least five days before filing a demurrer or motion to strike. Terrell’s
counsel sets forth in his declaration that On March 29, 2023, Terrell’s counsel
followed up with Plaintiffs’ counsel via email regarding the status of
dismissing the complaint. (Newell Decl. ¶5, Ex. B.) Plaintiffs’ counsel
responded on the same day via email stating that they tried to contact
Plaintiffs’ other counsel regarding the prior complaint filed but they had not
heard back from them in weeks. (Id. at ¶6.) Terrell’s
counsel asserts that “the parties agreed to a 30-day extension for Irene
Terrell’s due date for a responsive pleading to allow time to determine if the
instant Complaint would be dismissed.” (Id., Ex. C.) On April 13, 2023, Terrell’s
counsel followed up with Plaintiffs’ counsel via email regarding the status of
a dismissal of the duplicative complaint. (Id. at ¶7, Ex. D.) Terrell
has fulfilled her obligation to meet and confer.
Terrell’s Demurrer
          A demurrer
may be sustained on the basis that a particular cause of action is duplicative
or another.  (Palm Springs Villas II
Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 268, 290.)  Moreover, a demurrer is proper where there is
another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of
action.  (Civ. Proc. Code § 430.10(c).)
          While the case law about
“duplicative causes of action” relates to causes of action within the same
lawsuit, it applies with force here, where each of the causes of action are
duplicative of the causes of action in the Earlier Action between the same
parties.  There is no good reason of
which the Court is aware for the current case to continue in any form.  .
          Moreover, Plaintiffs have
not opposed this demurrer.  See
California Rule of Court 8.54(c)(“A failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a
consent to the granting of the motion”). 
It is not even clear that Plaintiffs want this duplicative lawsuit to
exist.  It appears to be a waste of
resources for all parties, including Plaintiffs, and for the Court.
          Plaintiffs have not made
any request to amend the complaint in this case, much less shown how an
amendment would cure the problems in the current complaint.  Accordingly, the demurrer is granted without
leave to amend.
