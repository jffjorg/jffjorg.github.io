Background
 
          This is an action to recover damages for the
mismanagement of a company. On
December 6, 2022, Plaintiffs New General Market Partners, LLC, and NGM1, LLC
(“Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Defendants the Trust, Moj Mahdara,
Elastic Ventures, Inc., and Does 1-10.  
 
          The
operative complaint is the First Amended Complaint filed on May 19, 2023,
against Defendants the Trust, Moj Mahdara, Elastic Ventures, Inc., and Does
1-10.  The First Amended Complaint alleges
causes of action for (1) conversion, (2) constructive fraudulent conveyance;
(3) conversion; (4) trespass to chattels; (5) unjust enrichment; (6) violation
of the Computer Data Access and Fraud Act (Cal Penal Code §§ 502 et seq.); (7)
unfair business practices.  
 
          On
July 14, 2023, the Trust filed an opposition. On October 17, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed a reply. 
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must
respond to interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30
days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories or requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).) The party also waives the right to make any objections, including one
based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for
a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or production of documents
other than the cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2024.020, subd. (a), 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) No
meet and confer efforts are required before filing a motion to compel responses
to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)   
 
Discussion
 
          Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of
Documents 
On March 17, 2023, Plaintiffs
propounded and served their Form Interrogatories, Set One and Request for
Production of Documents on The Trust. (Colwell Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. A, B.) The Trust’s
responses to the Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents
were due on April 21, 2023. (Id.) On March 21, 2023, Plaintiffs served their
Special Interrogatories, Set One on The Trust. (Id. at ¶3, Ex. C.)  The Trust’s Responses to the Special
Interrogatories were due on April 28, 2023. (Id.) On April 20, 2023, the
Trust’s counsel requested an extension of time to respond to the discovery
requests. (Id. at ¶4.)  On April 21,
2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel agreed to provide the Trust with a two-week extension
to respond to the discovery requests. (Id., Ex. D.) The Trust’s deadline
to respond to Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production was on May 5,
2023, and the deadline to respond to the Special Interrogatories was on May 12,
2023. (Id.) Although not required, Plaintiffs’ counsel sent the Trust a
meet and confer letter on May 19, 2023, regarding the lack of responses to the
discovery and detailed the subsequent correspondence regarding the failure to
respond to the discovery requests. (Colwell Decl. ¶6-10, Ex. E, F, G, H.) To
date, Plaintiffs assert that The Trust has failed to serve written responses to
any of the discovery requests. (Id. at ¶11.) 
In opposition, the Trust argues that it has
already turned over all documents and electronic records to Plaintiffs and the
discovery requests are premature. The Trust attests that it has turned over all
its assets that were within its custody and control. (Amended Compl. ¶
123.) The Trust also argues that the discovery requests are tied to the initial
complaint where the Court granted the Trust’s initial demurrer of the causes of
action. The Trust asserts that the Amended Complaint asserts new causes of
action against the Trust and does not retain a single count alleged against the
Trust. As a result, the Trust contends that the discovery requests are not
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence pertinent
to the First Amended Complaint. The Trust requests Plaintiffs propound new
discovery requests tailored to the First Amended Complaint. 
In reply, Plaintiffs
state that the Trust does not dispute that it failed to serve written
objections, produce any of the requested documents or serve discovery
responses. Plaintiffs assert that under California law, the right to discovery
does not depend on the status of pleadings. Plaintiffs contend that the Trust
fails to provide a substantial justification for its refusal to engage in the
discovery process. 
The Trust asserts that it
has turned over all documents and electronic records to Plaintiffs but fails to
provide evidence that it did so. It is unclear to the Court whether the Trust
has provided responses to the discovery requests. Plaintiffs further indicate
that The Trust failed to respond to any of the discovery requests. (Colwell
Decl. ¶11.) The Court also notes that the Amended Complaint arise out of the
same facts as the prior complaint. The Amended Complaint alleges its prior
causes of action but seeks relief this time against the Trust. See Lipton v.
Superior Court (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1611-1612 (noting a party may
obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action, if the matter either is itself
admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence).) The Court finds that the discovery requests
are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Thus,
Plaintiffs are entitled to an order compelling the Trust to provide verified
responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for
Production of Documents without objections.
Accordingly, the motion to compel responses to Request for
Production, Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Production of
Documents is GRANTED. 
Sanctions
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030,
subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a
monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to
pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes failing to
respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010, subd. (d).)  
If a motion to compel responses to interrogatories
or requests for production is filed, the Court may impose a monetary sanction
against the losing party “unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c),
2031.300, subd. (c).) If a motion to have requests for admission deemed
admitted is filed, “[i]t is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction
. . . on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely
response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).) Further, “[t]he court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)
Plaintiffs seek sanctions against the Trust and
its counsel of record in the amount of $4,900 to compensate Plaintiffs for
attorney’s fees and costs incurred in seeking the Trust to compel with the
discovery requests. The Court acknowledges that Kevin M. Capuzzi’s Application
to Appear Pro Hac Vice is pending before this court, and Natalie Cuadros is
also counsel of record in this case. Plaintiffs’ counsel asserts that he has
been practicing law since 2001 and his billing rate is $965 per hour. (Colwell
Supp. Decl. ¶2.) In this matter, Plaintiffs’ counsel’s
billing rate is $700 per hour. (Id.) Plaintiffs’ counsel claims to have
spent (4) hours preparing the motion, declaration and evidence on this motion
and another (3) hours reviewing the Trust’s Opposition and preparing
Plaintiffs’ reply papers. (Id. at ¶3-4) 
In opposition, the Trust requests the Court deny
Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions. 
The Trust has failed to provide a substantial
justification for failing to comply with the discovery requests. Furthermore,
Plaintiffs have provided ample evidence of their efforts to obtain a response
from Defendant, including granting extensions. (See Colwell Decl. ¶6-10, Ex. D,
E, F, G, H.)
Accordingly, the Court awards sanctions against the
Trust in the total amount of $4,900.00. The Trust shall make this payment
within 30 days directly to Plaintiffs’ counsel.SUPERIOR

through Saccullo Business consulting, LLC, in its capacity as trustee of the

Inc (the “Trust”) demurs the first, fourth and
seventh causes of action in the Amended Complaint.   The Court OVERRULES the Trust’s demurrer.  The Trust shall answer the Amended Complaint
within 10 days.
 
The Trust alternatively
moves for a stay of these proceedings in favor of proceedings in Delaware.  The Court DENIES the Trust’s request for a
stay without prejudice.
 
Background 
 
On December 6, 2022, Plaintiffs New General Market
Partners, LLC, and NGM1, LLC (“Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Defendant
BeautyCon, was  acting through Saccullo
Business consulting, LLC, in its capacity as trustee of the trust and assignee
for the benefit of creditors of assignor BeautyCon Media, Inc., as well as
against MOJ Mahdara, Elastic Ventures, and Does 1 through 10. The complaint
alleged eight causes of action.

Request
for Judicial Notice 
 
The Court may take judicial notice of the existence
of the records, but not the truth of matters asserted in such records. (Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th
1548, 1565). As a result, although the court may take judicial notice that the
documents exists, the Court may not take judicial notice of the truth of the
facts in the documents. 
 
          Additionally,
Evidence Code only allows the Court to take judicial notice of certain types of
documents. The court may take judicial notice of “official acts of the
legislative, executive, and judicial departments of the United States and of
any state of the United States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or
(2) any court of record of the United States or of any state of the United
States,” and “[f]acts and propositions that are not reasonably subject to
dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to
sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code § 452, subds. (c),
(d), and (h).) The Evidence Code does not allow the Court to take judicial
notice of discovery responses or parts of cases, such as depositions.
 
The Trust requests the following
documents be judicially noticed:

Request for Judicial Notice is GRANTED. 
 
 
Demurrer 
   
 Legal Standard
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. In
a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer
tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. ….
The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it
stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
 
Meet and Confer:
 
Prior to filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required
to satisfy their meet and confer obligations pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc.
§430.41 and demonstrate that they so satisfied their meet and confer obligation
by submitting a declaration pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. §430.41(a)(2) &
(3). The Declaration of Kevin M. Capuzzi indicates that the parties met and
conferred telephonically on June 14, 2023, but the parties were unable to
resolve the issues. (Dec. Capuzzi, ¶ 2.) 
 
Discussion 
 
The Trust demurs to the first, fourth, and seventh
causes of action. 
 
1.     First Cause
of Action: Conversion 
 
The elements of conversion are
(1) plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of property; (2) the
defendant’s conversion by a wrongful act or right to disposition of property
rights; and (3) damages. (Lee v. Hanley
(2015) 61 Cal.4th 1225, 1240.) 
 
The Trust concedes that
Plaintiffs’ conversion cause of action alleges the first element of conversion
but fails to allege the second and third.   For their part, Plaintiffs argue that the
second element is met by allegations that The Trust deprived Plaintiffs of
their property, specifically the assets, and did not return them. (Opp. 6:
19-21, FAC ¶ 122.) Second, Plaintiffs argue that the damage element is property
alleged as the FAC adequate alleges damages. Specifically, the FAC states that
Plaintiffs were (1) prevented from realizing the value of the Foreclosed
assets, (2) harmed Plaintiffs business operations, (3) caused the loss of the
Foreclosed Assets, and (4) required Plaintiffs to spend money to obtain the
missing assets. (Opp. 8: 17-21, FAC ¶¶ 134, 138.) 
 
          After
a review of the FAC, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged
facts to constitute a cause of action for conversion. First, the FAC states
that Plaintiffs owned the Foreclosed Assets. (FAC ¶ 133.) Second, Defendant
interfered with Plaintiffs’ assets when it failed to return the assets when
demanded. (FAC ¶ 134-135.)  Lastly, the
FAC sufficiently alleges that Plaintiffs were damaged, which includes, but is
not limited to, the Value of the assets, damages for the loss of the uses of
those assets, damages for the time Defendant deprived Plaintiffs of the assets.
(FAC ¶ 138.) 
 
          Thus,
Demurrer as to the 1st Cause of Action is OVERRULED. 
 
 
2.     Fourth Cause
of Action: Trespass to Chattels 
 
A cause of action for “the tort
of trespass to chattels allows recovery for interferences with possession of
personal property ‘not sufficiently important to be classed as conversion, and
so to compel the defendant to pay the full value of the thing with which he has
interfered.
Though
not amounting to conversion, the defendant's interference must, to be
actionable, have caused some injury to the chattel or to the plaintiff's rights
in it. Under California law, trespass to chattels ‘lies where an intentional
interference with the possession of personal property has proximately caused injury.” (Jamgotchian v. Slender (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1400–1401.) 
 
Defendant argues that this cause
of action fails because the Trust did not intentionally interfere with
Plaintiff’s property rights and the FAC does not allege that Plaintiffs were
injured by the alleged interference.   Plaintiffs
argue that the FAC sufficiently alleges a cause of action for trespass to
chattels. The FAC states that Defendant knew it possessed the assets but failed
to return them when asked on multiple occasions. (Opp. 8: 3-7; FAC ¶ 122.)
Additionally, the FAC sufficiently alleges that Plaintiffs suffered damages by
the interference. Specifically, paragraph 157 and 158 states that Defendant
prevented Plaintiffs from exercising control over their assets, “damaged the
confidential nature of the information” of those assets, caused the assets to
diminish in value, and deprived Plaintiffs from using their assets. (Opp. 8:
18-23; FAC ¶¶ 157-158.) 
 
After reviewing the FAC, the
Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a cause of action for
trespass to chattels. The FAC states that Defendants failed to timely deliver
the Assets after repeated requests to do so and this refusal was knowing and
intentional. (FAC ¶ 122.) Because of those repeated refusals to turn over the
assets, Plaintiff was damaged because Plaintiffs were prevented from
controlling their own property and the assets diminished in value. (FAC ¶
157-158.) 
 
          Thus, Demurrer as to the 2nd
Cause of Action is OVERRULED. 
 
3.     Seventh
Cause of Action: Unfair Business Practices – Cal. Bus & Prof. Code
§ 17200 et seq. 
 
The Trust argues that this cause
of action fails because the Trust is not a business, and non-businesses cannot
be sued. 
 
Plaintiffs argue that under Bus.
& Prof. Code § 17201, a person is defined as “natural persons,
corporations, firms, partnerships, joint stock companies, associations and
other organizations of person.” Further, under Evidence Code § 175, a person is
defined as a “natural person, firm, association, organization, partnership,
business trust, corporation, limited liability company, or public entity.”
Additionally, UCL is broad and includes business acts that are either unfair,
unlawful or deceptive. (Opp. 11: 1-8.) Thus, the Trust engaged in business
acts, such as when it sued NGMP for breach of contract or admitted that a
commercial entity obtained the assets through competitive bidding. (Id. at 17-23.) 
 
          The
Court agrees with Plaintiffs.  The
definition of person for purposes of the Unfair Business practice Act is broad
enough to include the Trust and its commercial actions under the circumstances
of this case.  
 
          Accordingly, the Demurrer as to
the 7th Cause of Action is OVERRULED. 
 
Stay the Proceedings: 
 
Alternatively, the Trust argues that the matter should be
stayed in favor of the proceedings that are underway in the Delaware Superior
Court and the Delaware Chancery Court. 
 
However, as Plaintiffs correctly argue, a request to stay an
action via demurrer is procedurally proper only when the matters are pending in
the same state. As the Court in Leadford
stated, 
 
However, abatement is required only where the multiple
actions are pending in courts of the same state. (Simmons v. Superior Court
(1950) 96 Cal.App.2d 119, 123 [214 P.2d 844, 19 A.L.R.2d 288] [pendency of
prior suit in one state cannot be pleaded as a bar to a subsequent suit in
another state]; and see Rest.2d, Conf. of Laws, § 86.) Where, as here, the
actions are pending in courts of different states, the determination whether to
stay the later-filed action is discretionary, not mandatory, and should be raised
by motion, not demurrer.
 
(Leadford v. Leadford (1992) 6
Cal.App.4th 571, 574.) 
 
The Trust is requesting a stay due to an action in Delaware.  The Trust’s request as part of the demurrer is
procedurally improper. To the extent that the Trust has a valid request for a
stay, it should file a separate noticed motion. 
That will allow the parties to brief the issue, and the Court to decide
the issue, in an orderly way now that the pleadings have been set.
