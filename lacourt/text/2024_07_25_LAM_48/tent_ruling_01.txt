  CASE NO.: 23STCV28569
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
  TO DEEM RFAs ADMITTED
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
July 25, 2024



 
On November 21, 2023, Plaintiff
William Hoyman this action against Defendant Michael Elliott Plotkin.
On
May 17, 2024, Plaintiff served Request for Admission, Set One on Defendant.  (DeClercq Decl. ¶ 2.)  The deadline for Defendant to respond was June
18, 2024, but to date, no responses have been received.  (DeClercq Decl. ¶ 2.)
On
June 27, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to deem the RFAs in Request for Admission,
Set One admitted.
When
a party fails to timely respond to a request for admission, the propounding party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections
to the demand, unless the court grants them relief from the waiver, upon a showing
that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and
(2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence,
or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court shall
grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is
in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Defendant
filed no opposition to this motion and did not serve timely responses.  It does not appear that Defendant served substantially
compliant responses prior to the hearing. 

Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED.  Request for Admission,
Set One is deemed admitted.
Defendant
is ordered to pay sanctions of $2,380.00 to Plaintiff within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
