 Case Number:  22SMCV35303    Hearing Date:   May 9, 2024    Dept:  I The court is inclined to GRANT the application.  The court earlier continued the trial over
plaintiff’s objection.  Unfortunately the
new date picked creates a conflict for an important plaintiff’s witness.  Because the new date was set without
counsel’s ability to check all other dates, the court believes plaintiff’s
request—to which defendant has agreed—is appropriate.  The parties are looking for a date in late
October.  The court will look at its
calendar and set a new date.
