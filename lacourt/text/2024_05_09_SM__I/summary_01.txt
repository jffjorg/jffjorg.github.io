And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has reconsidered the defendant's motion for fees, as the underlying case has settled and there will be no trial. The judge is concerned about the defendant's allegations of bad faith by the plaintiff and has decided to hear live testimony from witnesses who have submitted declarations. The judge will allow brief cross-examination and re-direct examination of witnesses. The judge emphasizes that the burden of proof is on the defendant to show that the case was prosecuted for an improper purpose. The judge will set the hearing for the original trial date and will consider using the prior trial date to hear live testimony.
