And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in response to an unopposed motion for terminating sanctions in a case involving elder abuse. The plaintiff, an elderly woman, is seeking justice for abuse suffered at the hands of the defendant. The defendant has failed to respond to discovery, ignored court orders, and has been silent on the issue. The court has concluded that the defendant has abandoned the case and has granted the motion for terminating sanctions. The defendant's answer is struck, but the plaintiff will not seek a default judgment for at least 30 days. The court will set a status conference in approximately 60 days. The court also notes that any judgment must comply with due process and that the plaintiff is advised to ensure that the amount sought is proper.
