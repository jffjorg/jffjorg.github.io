 Case Number:  22SMCV00454    Hearing Date:   May 9, 2024    Dept:  I The court is inclined to GRANT the application to continue
the trial.  Good cause is shown due to
the recent accident involving plaintiff that renders him unable to attend the
trial until October.  The court notes
that it appears that the defense does not oppose the request.
 
The court will discuss new dates with the parties.  The court will also discuss what effect, if
any, the parties intend this to have on discovery.
