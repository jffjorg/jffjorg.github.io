  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to reclassify
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Target Corporation           
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Reclassify  
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Target Corporation (“Defendant”) moves the court for an
order reclassifying this action, filed by plaintiff Emily Keough (“Plaintiff’),
as a limited jurisdiction case. 
“If
a party files a motion for reclassification after the time for that party . . .
to respond to a complaint, cross-complaint, or other initial pleading, the
court shall grant the motion and enter an order for reclassification only if
both the following conditions are satisfied: [¶] (1) The case is incorrectly
classified [, and] [¶] (2) The moving party shows good cause for not seeking
reclassification earlier.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §¿403.040, subd. (b).) 
“A party seeking to reclassify a case from unlimited to limited faces a ‘high
threshold.’  [Citation.]  The trial court must conclude ‘that the
verdict will “necessarily” fall short of the superior court jurisdictional
requirement of a claim exceeding $25,000.’  [Citation.]”  (Hiona
v. Superior Court of City and County of San Francisco (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th
866, 872; Code Civ. Proc., §¿85, subd. (a) [amending statute to provide that a
limited civil case is one in which the amount of controversy does not exceed
$35,000].)  
The court
finds that Defendant has not met its burden to show that this case is
incorrectly classified and that a verdict in favor of Plaintiff with
necessarily fall short of the jurisdictional requirement.  (Code Civ. Proc., §¿403.040, subd. (b); Hiona, supra, 48 Cal.App.5th at p. 872.)

The court
acknowledges that Defendant has submitted Plaintiff’s discovery responses in
which Plaintiff (1) produced documents establishing that she has incurred
$7,173.31 in medical bills, and (2) stated that she has not suffered lost
wages.  (Mendoza Decl., Ex. D [medical
bills totaling $7,173.31]; Mendoza Decl., Ex. C, PDF p. 120 [Pl. response to
Request for Production of Document No. 11 stating “Responding Party is not
making a claim for loss of wages”].) 
However, the court finds that this does not establish that Plaintiff’s
recovery will “necessarily” fall short of the $25,000 jurisdictional minimum.[1] 
First,
Defendant has not produced evidence establishing that Plaintiff will not incur
additional medical expenses in the future for which Defendant may be liable if
she is successful on her claims.  Second,
although Defendant has asserted that “Plaintiff’s general damages, based on the
last date of treatment of January 25, 2022, do not support the classification
of an unlimited civil action matter[,]” Defendant has not submitted competent
evidence in support of that contention. 
(Mendoza Decl., ¶ 14.)  In her
Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that she has suffered emotional distress and
emotional injuries (Compl., ¶¶ 15, 25, 35) and prays for punitive
damages (Compl., ¶¶ 40, 51, 62; Compl., Prayer, ¶ 2).  Plaintiff’s discovery responses further
indicate that she suffered emotional injuries. 
(Mendoza Decl., Ex. C, PDF pp. 77 [Pl. response to Form Interrogatory
No. 6.2 stating that she “felt emotionally distraught due to the fact that she
experienced a near death like experience”], 167 [Pl. response to Special Interrogatory
No. 24 stating that she “suffered physical and emotional injuries”]
[emphasis added].)  Defendant has not
presented evidence or argument showing that Plaintiff’s recovery must be
limited only to the $7,173.31 in medical bills in light of the Complaint’s
prayer for punitive damages and allegations that Plaintiff sustained emotional
injuries. 
Thus, the
court finds that Defendant has not met its burden to show that a verdict in
favor of Plaintiff “will necessarily fall short of the superior court
jurisdictional requirement” for an unlimited civil case and therefore has not
shown that this “case is incorrectly classified.”  (Hiona, supra, 48 Cal.App.5th
at p. 872 [internal quotations and citations omitted]; Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 403.040, subd. (b)(1).) 
The court
therefore denies Defendant’s motion.
ORDER
            The court denies defendant Target
Corporation’s motion to reclassify. 
            The court orders plaintiff Emily
Keough to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
