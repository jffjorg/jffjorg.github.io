  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to set aside dismissal
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff and cross-defendant
Romana Ortiz
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Set Aside Dismissal
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff and cross-defendant
Romana Ortiz (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order     (1) setting aside the dismissal of this
action entered by the court on February 14, 2024, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 581, subdivision (b)(3) on the ground that no party appeared
for trial, (2) reinstating this case, and (3) permitting the parties to file a
Notice of Settlement.  (Feb. 14, 2024
Minute Order, p. 1; Feb. 14, 2024 Order of Dismissal.) 
“[T]he court shall, whenever
an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of
judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn
affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect,
vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her
client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting
default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the
court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the
attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) 
Plaintiff has submitted the
declaration of her counsel, Roger Haag (“Haag”), in which Haag states that (1)
on January 29, 2024, Plaintiff and defendants Diana Covarrubias and Diana’s
Flower’s, Inc. agreed to settle this case; (2) Haag instructed his office to
file a Notice of Settlement; (3) Haag’s office did not file the Notice of
Settlement, but removed all litigation dates from the calendar; (4) Haag,
therefore, did not see any February dates on his calendar for this action; and
(5) Haag realized that he did not clearly communicate his instructions about
the Notice of Settlement.  (Haag Decl.,
¶¶ 6-9.)  Thus, the court entered
dismissal of this action on February 14, 2024. 
The court finds that (1)
Plaintiff has filed this motion no more than six months after entry of the
February 14, 2024 order of dismissal, (2) the declaration of Plaintiff’s
counsel, Haag, establishes that the resulting dismissal of this action was
taken as a result of Haag and his office’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and
neglect in failing to properly file with the court a Notice of Settlement (which
would have led the court to vacate trial), and (3) Plaintiff filed the proposed
Notice of Settlement with the court on April 15, 2024, and therefore the
application is in proper form.  
The court therefore grants
Plaintiff’s motion.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 473, subd. (b).) 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff and
cross-defendant Romana Ortiz’s motion to set aside dismissal.
            The court orders that the Order of
Dismissal entered by the court on February 14, 2024 is vacated. 
            The court sets an Order to Show
Cause re dismissal (settlement) for hearing on June 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., in
Department 53. 
            
The court orders plaintiff and cross-defendant Romana Ortiz to give
notice of this ruling. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  April 29, 2024
