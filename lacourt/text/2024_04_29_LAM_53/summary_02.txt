And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed Defendant Target Corporation's motion to reclassify this case from an unlimited civil case to a limited jurisdiction case. After considering the evidence, the court finds that Defendant has not met its burden to show that the case is incorrectly classified. The court notes that Plaintiff Emily Keough has incurred medical bills of $7,173.31 and has suffered emotional injuries, but Defendant has not produced evidence of additional medical expenses or shown that Plaintiff's recovery will necessarily fall short of the superior court jurisdictional requirement. Therefore, the court denies Defendant's motion to reclassify the case.
