The court grants Plaintiff Romana Ortiz's motion to set aside the dismissal of the action. The court finds that the resulting dismissal was caused by the mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and neglect of Plaintiff's counsel, Roger Haag, in failing to properly file a Notice of Settlement. The court orders that the Order of Dismissal entered on February 14, 2024, is vacated. The court sets an Order to Show Cause re dismissal (settlement) for hearing on June 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 53. The court orders Plaintiff and cross-defendant Romana Ortiz to give notice of this ruling.
