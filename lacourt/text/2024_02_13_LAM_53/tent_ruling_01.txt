  Order RE:
 
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL FOR
  DEFENDANT JACK CUMMINS
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:
            Albert Chang and Law Offices
of Albert Chang
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant Jack Cummins
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Albert Chang and Law Offices of Albert Chang (“Defendant’s Counsel”)
move to be relieved as counsel for defendant Jack Cummins (“Defendant”).)
“The
question of granting or denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as
counsel (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. 2) is one which lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.’”¿ (People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations omitted].)¿ The court
should also consider whether the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished
without undue prejudice to the client’s interests.”¿ (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
For
a motion to be relieved as counsel under Code of Civil Procedure section 284,
subdivision (2), California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice
of motion and motion directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration
stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
284, subdivision (2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil
Procedure section 284, subdivision (1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on
the client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-053)).¿¿ 
The court
finds that Defendant’s Counsel has served Defendant (1) with the moving papers
filed in connection with this motion at Defendant’s last known address, and
Defendant’s Counsel was unable to confirm that the address is current or locate
a more current address after making reasonable efforts to do so, and (2) with a
notice of the court’s January 8, 2024 ruling continuing the hearing on this
motion to February 13, 2024.  (MC-052, ¶
3, subds. (a)(2), (b)(2), (c); Jan. 11, 2024 Notice of Ruling, pp. 7-8 [proof
of service].)  The court also finds that
Defendant’s Counsel has shown sufficient reasons why the motion should be
granted, and why counsel has brought the motion under Code of Civil Procedure
section 284, subdivision (2) instead of filing a consent under section 284,
subdivision (1).  (MC-052, ¶ 2.) 
The court
therefore grants Defendant’s Counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel for
Defendant. 
Albert
Chang and Law Offices of Albert Chang will be relieved as counsel of record for
defendant Jack Cummins upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed
“Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” on the
client. 
 
The court
orders Albert Chang and Law Offices of Albert Chang to give notice of this
ruling and the signed “Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel – Civil” to defendant Jack Cummins and to all other parties who have
appeared in this action. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  February 13, 2024
