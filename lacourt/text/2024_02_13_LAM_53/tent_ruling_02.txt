[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiffs’ motion to substitute estate in
  place of deceased defendant
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:
            Plaintiffs AWI Builders, Inc.,
Construction Contractors Corporation, Zhirayr “Robert” Mekikyan, and Anna
Mekikyan
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Substitute Estate in Place of Deceased Defendant
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs AWI Builders, Inc., Construction Contractors Corporation,
Zhirayr “Robert” Mekikyan, and Anna Mekikyan (“Plaintiffs”) move the court for
an order substituting the “Estate of Susan Nakagama” (“Estate”) in place of
defendant Susan Nakagama (“Defendant”) in this action on the ground that
Defendant is now deceased.
 “[A] cause of action against a
decedent that survives may be asserted against the decedent’s personal
representative or, to the extent provided by statute, against the decedent’s
successor in interest.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 377.40.)  “On motion, the
court shall allow a pending action or proceeding against the decedent that does
not abate to be continued against the decedent’s personal representative or, to
the extent provided by statute, against the decedent’s successor in interest,
except that the court may not permit an action or proceeding to be continued
against the personal representative unless proof of compliance with Part 4
(commencing with Section 9000) of Division 7 of the Probate Code governing
creditor claims is first made.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 377.41.)  
Plaintiffs have presented evidence establishing that Defendant passed
away on November 10, 2022.  (Pacheco
Decl., Ex. A, p. 2 [Defendant’s Death Certificate].)  However, Plaintiffs have not (1) presented authority
establishing that the court may substitute the Estate in place of Defendant, or
(2) submitted evidence showing that Plaintiffs have complied with the Probate
Code, such that Plaintiffs may substitute Defendant’s personal representative
(i.e., Harold T. Payne) as defendant pursuant to section 377.41.
The court therefore denies Plaintiffs’ motion without prejudice to
Plaintiffs filing a motion that complies with Code of Civil Procedure sections
377.40 and 377.41.
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiffs AWI
Builders, Inc., Construction Contractors Corporation, Zhirayr “Robert” Mekikyan,
and Anna Mekikyan’s motion to substitute estate in place of deceased defendant
without prejudice.
            The court orders plaintiffs AWI
Builders, Inc., Construction Contractors Corporation, Zhirayr “Robert” Mekikyan,
and Anna Mekikyan to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
