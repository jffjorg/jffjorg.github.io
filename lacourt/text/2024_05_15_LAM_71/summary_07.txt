English-text summary:

The tentative ruling sustains Defendant's demurrer to Plaintiff's 6th and 7th causes of action, with 20 days' leave to amend. The Plaintiff brought a complaint alleging intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, as well as breach of contract. The Court finds that the 6th and 7th causes of action fail to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action against the Defendant. The Plaintiff's allegations of intentional infliction of emotional distress are deemed insufficient, as the Defendant's conduct, although alleged to be "outrageous," does not rise to the level required by law. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's allegations of negligent infliction of emotional distress fail, as the Defendant owes no duty of care to the Plaintiff. The Court holds that damages for mental suffering are not recoverable in a Marvin action, and emotional distress damages are not usually available in breach of contract cases.
