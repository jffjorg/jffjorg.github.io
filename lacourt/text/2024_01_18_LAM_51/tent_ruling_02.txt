Reference to “Plaintiff” herein refers to the Plaintiff Irene Przebinda and
Decedent/Plaintiff Sophia Gross.


[2]
Plaintiff also argues that Liu’s records submitted in support of the motion
have not been properly authenticated or shown to qualify for a hearsay
exception (particularly, the business records exception). 
 


[3]
The court is unaware of, and the parties did not cite to, authority requiring
Liu to provide such a declaration in relation to whether Liu is a care
custodian. Liu would likely require such a declaration to support his argument
that his conduct did not constitute abuse. However, since this is as an
alternative argument to defeat the second cause of action, the court declines
to develop the argument as to whether he met the standard of care.


[4]The
Kruthanooch panel noted that Winn had earlier reached the same conclusion noting that even a
facility that meets the definition of a “ ‘care custodian’ under Welfare & Institutions Code section
15610.17 , does not  “as a matter of law,
always satisfy the particular caretaking or custodial relationship required to
show neglect under section 15610.57.”(Id.
at p. 1131.) 
 


[5]The
court recognizes that in Kruthanooch, the Court of Appeal was
reviewing the trial court’s granting of a JNOV under the substantial evidence
standard. 
 


[6]
Liu’s monthly visits also appear more like Winn’s
intermittent care rather than substantial custodial care.
 


[7]
The court notes that Plaintiff provides argument but does not actually dispute
any of Liu’s facts in the SSUMF.


[8]
The court notes that while Mahan was
on demurrer, the reasoning aptly applies here at the summary
judgment/adjudication stage.
