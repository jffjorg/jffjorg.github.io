And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Irene Przebinda and Sophia Gross, argues that the defendant, Liu, has not properly authenticated his records and that his conduct constitutes abuse. The court notes that Liu's monthly visits to the plaintiff appear to be intermittent care rather than substantial custodial care. The court also finds that Liu's records are not properly authenticated and that he has not met the standard of care. The court declines to develop the argument as to whether Liu met the standard of care and instead, the case will proceed to a hearing.
