FACTUAL
BACKGROUND
 
This is a breach of contract action. Plaintiff Tpine Leasing
Capital L.P. filed a complaint against Defendant Andre Robert Polk, Lamont
Antonio Lacefield, and Book & Go Inc. for breach of contract and common
counts. Plaintiff alleges Defendants entered into a Motor Vehicle Lease
Agreement with Plaintiff whereby Plaintiff agreed to lease a 2014 Freightliner
Cascadia. However, Defendant defaulted on the terms of the Lease Agreement. 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: GRANT/CONTINUE
 
Counsel contends the client did not voluntarily consent to
counsel's request to be relieved. Irreconcilable differences have arisen
between client and attorney making it unreasonably difficult to carry out the
employment effectively. 
 
Counsel has complied with the requirements of CRC Rule 3.1362 by
filing forms MC-051 and MC-052 and lodging with the court a copy of the
proposed order on form MC-053. Counsel confirmed client’s last known mailing
address within the last 30 days via the client’s discovery responses. 
 
However, MC-053 Form is blank. Counsel must provide a completed
form prior to the hearing in order to be granted. 
 
Trial is not yet set.
