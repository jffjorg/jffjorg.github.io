  Case Number:  22SMCV01661    Hearing Date:   December 2, 2024    Dept:  P Tentative Ruling
Ferguson v. Volkswagen Group of
America, Case no. 22SMCV01661
Hearing date December 2, 2024
Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorney’s Fees
Plaintiff
sued defendants under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The parties
settled 4/18/24; plaintiff seeks fees and costs of $85,622.88, per the
settlement agreement. The motion is not opposed.
Plaintiff’s
request for judicial notice of 20 orders and rulings in unrelated Song-Beverly
cases is granted, as they are court records. However, orders in unrelated matters
are irrelevant to the ruling here. 
Plaintiff
offers declarations of counsel Shahian and Baker in support of the request for 111.90
hours of attorney and law clerk work, totaling $55,543, plus $7,139.83 in
costs. Shahnian decl. Plaintiff provides an itemized billing summary. Id.
The hours requested are reasonable, as are the fees.
Plaintiff
requests a 1.35 multiplier, totaling $19,440.05, arguing counsel accepted risk
by taking the case on a contingency fee basis. It is common for Song-Beverly
matters to be accepted on a contingency fee basis. Further, this case was not
heavily litigated; plaintiff’s counsel took one deposition, defended one
deposition, opposed a summary judgment motion and prepared pretrial documents.
There is no indication any issues presented were unusual for plaintiff’s
counsel, which handles many similar matters. There is no basis for the court to
grant a modifier. 
Plaintiff
requests $3,500 for reviewing the opposition, drafting a reply and appearing at
the hearing. As the motion is unopposed, the court grants an additional $500
for appearance at the hearing. The motion is GRANTED as stated; plaintiff may
submit an order for the court’s signature.
