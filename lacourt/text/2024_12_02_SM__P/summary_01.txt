And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees. The plaintiff, Ferguson, sued the defendant, Volkswagen Group of America, under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The parties settled on April 18, 2024, and the plaintiff is seeking fees and costs of $85,622.88, as per the settlement agreement. The motion is not opposed.

The court has granted the plaintiff's request for judicial notice of 20 orders and rulings in unrelated Song-Beverly cases. However, orders in unrelated matters are irrelevant to the ruling here. The plaintiff provides declarations from counsel Shahian and Baker in support of the request for 111.90 hours of attorney and law clerk work, totaling $55,543, plus $7,139.83 in costs. The court finds that the hours requested are reasonable, as are the fees.

The plaintiff also requests a 1.35 multiplier, totaling $19,440.05, arguing that counsel accepted risk by taking the case on a contingency fee basis. The court finds that this is a common practice in Song-Beverly matters and that there is no basis for the court to grant a modifier.

Finally, the plaintiff requests $3,500 for reviewing the opposition, drafting a reply, and appearing at the hearing. As the motion is unopposed, the court grants an additional $500 for appearance at the hearing. The motion is granted as stated, and the plaintiff may submit an order for the court's signature.
