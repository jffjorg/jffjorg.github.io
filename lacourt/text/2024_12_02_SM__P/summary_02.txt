Summary in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of plaintiff ACRL 100, LLC, granting their motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiff claims a prescriptive easement over the defendant's parking lot, which has been used by the plaintiff since 2018. The defendant, J.J. Pacific Investment Co., installed bollards, chains, and fences to prevent the plaintiff's use of the parking lot. The judge finds that the plaintiff has a likelihood of proving its claimed prescriptive easement and that the interim harm to the plaintiff is greater than to the defendant. The judge also notes that the defendant's arguments regarding the permissive nature of the plaintiff's use of the parking lot and unclean hands are speculative and do not outweigh the current harms described by the plaintiff. The preliminary injunction is intended to preserve the status quo pending determination on the merits.
