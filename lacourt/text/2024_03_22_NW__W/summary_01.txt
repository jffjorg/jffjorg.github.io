And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the second amended complaint filed by Defendant Cochran, Inc. The court has found that the allegations of fraud and breach of contract are sufficient to state a claim against Cochran, Inc. Specifically, the court has found that the allegations of misrepresentation and concealment by Eliezer Appel and Broederlow, as officers and/or owners of Cochran, Lockhart, and Roshmore, are sufficient to support a claim against Cochran, Inc. under an alter ego theory.

The court has also found that the allegations of breach of contract are sufficient to state a claim against Cochran, Inc. The court has noted that the complaint alleges that the parties entered into a contract whereby Liker agreed to invest $250,000 of his own money into the Cass Property and transfer the funds, and in return, would receive ownership and be made an officer of Lockhart. The Defendants are alleged to have breached that agreement by never providing ownership or making Plaintiff an officer of Lockhart.

The court has ruled that the demurrers to the second and third causes of action are OVERRULED.
