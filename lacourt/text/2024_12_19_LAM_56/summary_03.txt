And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motions of the plaintiffs to set aside the dismissal of Park, without prejudice. The plaintiffs claim that the dismissal was based on the excusable mistake, inadvertence, and neglect of their counsel, Azin Barzin. The court finds that the motions are denied because they are not accompanied by the request for entry of default, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). However, if the plaintiffs lodge the proposed request for entry of default prior to the hearing, the motions will be granted. The court relies on various case law and statutes, including Graham v. Beers, Martin Potts & Associates, Inc. v. Corsair, LLC, and Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi.
