And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to set aside the default. The defendant, Rebecca Minda Zimmerman, alleges that she was never served with the summons and complaint, and has filed an affidavit stating this fact. The plaintiff, Gabriella Emma Cagliari, has filed a proof of service stating that the defendant was served on February 17, 2024. The court finds that while the proof of service is presumed to be valid, the defendant has shown that she lacked actual notice of the lawsuit in time to defend against it. Therefore, the court grants the motion to set aside the default. The defendant has 20 days to file a responsive pleading.
