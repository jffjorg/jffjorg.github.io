BACKGROUND
            
On December 15, 2023, Plaintiff Gabriella Emma
Cagliari filed the complaint against Rebecca Minda Zimmerman, alleging a single
cause of action for conversion arising from the alleged conversion of a 2023
Jeep UT.
 
On June 21, 2024, The Court entered the default of
Defendant.
 
On December 10, 2024, Defendant filed the
instant Motion to Set Aside Default.
 
No Opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just,
relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal,
order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect…¿ [The application]¿shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §¿473 subd.
(b).) “‘[W]hen relief under section 473¿is¿available, there is a
strong¿public¿policy¿in¿favor¿of granting relief and allowing the requesting
party his or her day in court…[Citation.]” (Rappleyea v. Campbell¿(1994)
8 Cal. 4th 975, 981-82.) 
¿ 
Although a trial court has the discretion to
vacate the entry of a default or subsequent judgment, this discretion may be
exercised only after the party seeking relief has shown that there is a proper
ground for relief and that the party has raised that ground in a procedurally
proper manner, within any applicable time limits.”¿(Cruz
v.¿Fagor¿America, Inc. (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 488, 495.) “The defendant
must … demonstrate a satisfactory excuse for not responding to the original
action in a timely manner.”¿(Id.¿at 504.) Moving parties have the
initial burden to prove excusable neglect by a preponderance of competent
evidence.¿(Kendall v. Barker¿(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 619, 624.)
¿ 
Code Civ. Proc.,¿§ 473 subd. (d) provides in
relevant part that “[t]he court may,¿upon motion of the injured party…set aside
any void judgment or order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473 subd. (d.))¿ 
 
Code Civ. Proc., section 473.5 permits the
Court to set aside a default and default judgment when the service of a summons
has not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action. Code
Civ. Proc., section 473.5 requires the motion to be accompanied by an affidavit
showing under oath that the party's lack of actual notice in time to defend the
action was not caused by the party's avoidance of service or inexcusable
neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5.)¿The notice of motion shall be served and
filed within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the earlier of the
following:¿ 
¿ 
1) two years after entry of a default judgment
against him or her; or¿¿ 
2) 180 days after service on him or her of a
written notice that the default or default judgment has been entered. ¿¿ 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5.)
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            Defendant requests that the Court
set aside the default under Code Civil Procedure section 473.5, as Defendant argues
they were never served the Summons and Complaint. In the alternative, Defendant
asks the Court to set aside the default under Code Civil Procedure section 473
subdivision (b).
 
            Plaintiff filed no opposition to
this motion.
 
“The
filing of a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that the service
was proper. However, the presumption arises only if the proof of service
complies with the applicable statutory requirements.” (Floveyor International
Ltd. v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 795.) “Evidence Code
section 647 provides that a registered process server’s declaration of service
establishes a presumption that the facts stated in the declaration are true.” (Rodriguez
v. Cho (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 742, 750.)
 
 
            Defendant has filed an affidavit
stating that she was never served the Summons and Complaint. (Zimmerman Decl. ¶
7.) However, Plaintiff has filed a Proof of Summons of Service that states
Defendant was served by Rachel Ruddock on February 17, 2024, at 11:24 am at
4712 E. 2nd Street, Long Beach, CA, 90803. While Defendant has not overcome the
presumption that the proof of service was improper, A party may seek relief
from default when the party lacked actual notice of the lawsuit in time to
defend against the action and the party seeks relief within a reasonable time
not to exceed two years from entry of default. (Code Civ. Proc. § 473.5.) Relief
from default may be granted even if service was proper if the party had no
actual notice of the action. (Ramos v. Homeward Residential, Inc. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 1434, 1444-1445.) Where there is any doubt about setting aside
a default, such doubt should be resolved in favor of setting aside the default.
(Rosenthal v. Garner (1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 891, 898.) Therefore, because
Defendant states, in their declaration, that they lacked actual knowledge in
time to defend the action, Defendant is entitled to relief from default. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 473.5; Ramos, 223 Cal.App.4th 1434, 1444-1445.) 
 
            Therefore, the Court grants the
Motion to Vacate Default. Defendant has 20 days to file a responsive pleading.
