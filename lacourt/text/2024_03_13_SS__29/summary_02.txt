The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to continue the trial, as filed by defendants James Pierre, Shana Pierre, and Courtney Pierre. The trial was originally scheduled for April 11, 2024, but the defendants request a continuance to August 12, 2024, citing the need for additional discovery and pending discovery motions. The Court finds that the defendants have shown good cause for the continuance and grants the motion. The trial date is advanced and continued to mid-August 2024, and the final status conference and all deadlines are reset accordingly.
