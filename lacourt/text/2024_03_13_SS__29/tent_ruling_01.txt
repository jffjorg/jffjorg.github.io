  Case Number:  19STCV16639    Hearing Date:   March 13, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Tolling and Extending the Five-Year Statute of
Limitation filed by Plaintiffs.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
According to the Complaint, Plaintiffs Angela Pope-Morgan,
Asia Morgan, Alma Morgan, Kirk Morgan, and Sarah Morgan (“Plaintiffs”) were injured
on May 12, 2017, in a collision with a motor vehicle driven by Defendant Leilei
Chen on Interstate I-40 in New Mexico. 
On May 13, 2019, Plaintiffs filed the Complaint against Defendants
Leilei Chen and FBM Group Corporation (“Defendants”) and Does 1 through 25.  Plaintiffs filed the First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) on August 13, 2019.  Defendants
filed their Answer to the FAC on September 6, 2019.
After several trial continuances, the Court conducted a Final
Status Conference on September 1, 2023, determined that the matter was long cause,
and directed the parties to submit a Long Cause Trial Package to Department
1.  On September 20, Department 1 issued
an order that stated that the parties were “not trial ready” and identified a
number of deficiencies. 
 
The parties resubmitted their long cause documents to
Department 1 on or about October 20, 2023. 
On November 8, 2023, Department 1 issued an order that stated that the
parties were still “not trial ready” and identified a number of deficiencies.
 
On February 2, 2024, the parties filed a “Notice of Joint
Submission for Long Cause Trial.”  It
does not appear, however, that any documents were received by Department 1.
 
On February 23, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this motion for an
order “tolling and extending” the five-year requirement of Code of Civil
Procedure section 583.310.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
An
action shall be brought to trial within five years after the action is
commenced against the defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.310.) 
Failure to proceed to trial requires dismissal by the court on its own motion
or motion by any party.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.360.)
 
Dismissal
is mandatory if the action is not brought to trial within five years and is not
subject to extension, excuse, or exception, except as expressly provided by
statue.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.360.)  The statutory exceptions
include:  
 
(1)  Written
stipulation.  (Code Civ. Proc., §583.330, subd. (a).)  
 
(2)  Oral
agreement made in open court, if entered in the minutes of the court or a
transcript is made.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.330, subd. (b).)  
 
(3)
The jurisdiction of the court to try the action was suspended, or prosecution
or trial of the action is stayed or enjoined.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
583.340, subds. (a), (b).)  
 
(4) 
Bringing action to trial, for any other reason, was impossible, impracticable,
or futile. (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.340, subd. (c).)  
 
Additionally,
Emergency Rule 10, subdivision (a), extends the time in which to bring a civil
action to trial by six months, notwithstanding any other law.  (Emergency
Rules Related to COVID-19, Emergency rule 10.)  
 
If
fewer than 6 months remain to bring the action to trial at the end of a
statutory period of tolling or extension, the action may not be dismissed if it
is brought to trial within 6 months after that period has ended.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 583.350; Him v. Superior Court (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d
35.)  However, the six-month grace period under Code of Civil Procedure
section 583.350 does not apply in addition to the six-month extension of time
to bring a civil action to trial provided by Emergency Rule 10, subdivision (a). 
(Ables v. A. Ghazale Bros. (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 823.) 
 
Discussion
Plaintiffs
contend, in essence, that they have proceeded with diligence, that they opposed
Defendants’ motion to continue the trial date from June 2023 to September 2023,
that the delays since September 2023 have been as a result of the process for determination
of long cause status, and that even after the case is determined to be a long
cause matter there is likely to be a significant delay in starting trial.
The
Court finds that Plaintiffs’ request is, at this point, premature.  Department 1 has determined (twice) that the
case is not yet ready for trial.  The
five-year period (as extended by Emergency Rule 10) does not run until November
2024.  There is still plenty of time for
the parties to complete their trial preparations and begin the trial.  
Plaintiffs
are concerned that even once the parties are determined to be ready for trial,
there may not be a courtroom available for some time.  That may occur.  Or it may not.  And if in the future that does occur, then
Plaintiffs could well have a strong argument that the absence of an available
courtroom constitutes circumstances under which it is “impossible” or “impracticable”
to bring the action to trial within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure
section 583.340.  But at this point, this
is a hypothetical question, depending on facts and circumstances that may or
may not arise or occur in the future. 
The issue is premature and not ripe for determination at this time.
Accordingly,
the motion is denied without prejudice.
Conclusion
The
Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ motion without prejudice.
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
