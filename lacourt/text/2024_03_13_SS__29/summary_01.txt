And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to toll and extend the five-year statute of limitation without prejudice. The court finds that the motion is premature, as Department 1 has twice determined that the case is not yet ready for trial. The five-year period as extended by Emergency Rule 10 does not run until November 2024, and there is still plenty of time for the parties to complete their trial preparations and begin the trial. The court notes that while there may be delays in the future, it is impossible to predict whether these delays will be significant enough to warrant an extension of the statute of limitation. Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice, and the parties are encouraged to continue working towards trial readiness.
