 Case Number:  22STCV16157    Hearing Date:   March 13, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion for Terminating and Monetary Sanctions

 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
This matter arises from an alleged slip and fall
on May 18, 2020, at an Albertson’s store on Crenshaw Boulevard in Los
Angeles.  On May 16, 2022, Plaintiff Anthony Renee Beamon
(“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this action against Defendants Albertsons
Safeway, LLC, Albertson’s LLC, Manager Precious, and Does 1 through 50,
asserting causes of action for general negligence and premises liability. 
On August 10, 2022, Defendant Albertsons LLC
(erroneously sued as Albertsons Safeway, LLC and as Albertson’s LLC)
(“Defendant”) filed its Answer to the Complaint.
On February 20, 2024, Defendant filed a
cross-complaint for indemnity against Source Refrigeration and HVAC, Inc.,
Coolsys, Inc., and Roes 1 through 10. 
Back in December 2022, Defendant moved to compel
responses to interrogatories and requests for production.  After the motion was filed, but prior to the
hearing, Plaintiff provided the requested responses.  On July 17, 2023, Defendant’s motions came on
for hearing; the Court denied as moot Defendant’s request for an order
compelling responses and granted Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff’s counsel in the sum of $1,680, payable by August 16, 2023.
Plaintiff’s counsel did not pay the sanctions.
On February 6, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for
terminating sanctions based solely on the failure of Plaintiff’s counsel to pay
the monetary sanctions ordered in July 2023. 
Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions. Plaintiff filed an opposition
on February 29, 2024, along with his own request for sanctions. Defendant filed
a reply on March 6, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice
to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing,
may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a
misuse of the discovery process: ... (d) The court may impose a terminating
sanction …."  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) “Misuses of the
discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following: ... (d)
Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. ... (g)
Disobeying a court order to provide discovery."  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010.)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
A
“terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary
discovery sanction is never justified.” 
(Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.) 
Discussion
As the Court of Appeal has squarely held, terminating
sanctions are not available based solely on the failure to pay an award of
monetary sanctions.  (Newland, supra, 40
Cal.App.4th at p. 615.)  “[M]any
attorneys seem to be unaware that monetary sanction orders are enforceable
through the execution of judgment laws.  …
These orders have the force and effect of a money judgment, and are immediately
enforceable through execution ….”  (Ibid.)
 
Defendant has not shown any basis for a terminating sanction.  The request for a terminating sanction is
DENIED.
 
Defendant’s request for a monetary sanction is also DENIED.  This motion was unnecessary to enforce the order
for sanctions.
 
Plaintiff’s request for a monetary sanction is also
DENIED.  Plaintiff has shown no
sufficient basis for the request.
 
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion in its
entirety.
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions.
Defendant
is ordered to give notice.
