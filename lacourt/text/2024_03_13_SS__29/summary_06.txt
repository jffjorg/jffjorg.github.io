And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, CJ Logistics America, LLC, granting its motion to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in the Requests for Admission served on October 26, 2023. The plaintiff, James Shaff, failed to respond to the requests, and the defendant need show nothing more to support its motion. The judge has ordered that the plaintiff is deemed to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests. The judge has not imposed a monetary sanction, as the defendant did not request one. The court's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2033.250, 2033.280, and 2023.010, as well as case law, including Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants and St. Mary v. Super. Ct.
