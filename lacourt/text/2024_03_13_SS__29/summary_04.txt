Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for terminating and monetary sanctions. The defendant sought to impose terminating sanctions against the plaintiff's counsel for failing to pay a previous order for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,680. The court has also denied the defendant's request for a monetary sanction. Additionally, the court has denied the plaintiff's request for a monetary sanction.

The court has ruled that terminating sanctions are not available solely based on the failure to pay an award of monetary sanctions. The court has also stated that monetary sanction orders are enforceable through the execution of judgment laws and are immediately enforceable through execution.

The court has concluded that the defendant has not shown any basis for a terminating sanction and has denied the motion in its entirety. The court has also denied the plaintiff's request for a monetary sanction.
