And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the defendant has moved to compel the plaintiff to respond to written discovery, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and a request for production. The defendant served the plaintiff with the discovery requests on February 1, 2023, but the plaintiff has not responded. The judge grants the defendant's motions to compel and orders the plaintiff to provide verified, code-complaint written responses to the discovery requests within 21 days. The judge also denies the defendant's requests for sanctions against the plaintiff or the plaintiff's counsel, citing the California Code of Civil Procedure and a recent Court of Appeal decision, City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC.
