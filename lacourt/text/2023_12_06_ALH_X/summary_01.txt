And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to strike Plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages. The court finds that the allegations in the third amended complaint do not plead sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The court notes that Plaintiffs failed to file an opposition to the motion and that the allegations are general and conclusory. The court orders Plaintiffs to demonstrate a reasonable possibility of curing this defect at the hearing on December 6, 2023.
