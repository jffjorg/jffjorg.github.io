```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the defendant without prejudice. The plaintiff must resubmit the motion with a code-compliant separate statement within 10 days. The court finds that the plaintiff's separate statement fails to adequately establish a proper reason for compelling further responses as to the specific discovery requests. The defendant had responded to the discovery requests with boilerplate objections, and the plaintiff's separate statement also included boilerplate language claiming that the objections are meritless. The court requires the plaintiff to provide a more detailed statement of the factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses as to each matter in dispute.
