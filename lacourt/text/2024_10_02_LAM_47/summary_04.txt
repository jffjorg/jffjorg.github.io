And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied eBay Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration in a wrongful death and products liability action brought by the family of the decedent, Jerry Moss. The court found that defendant eBay Inc. failed to demonstrate that plaintiff Kelly Moss was on notice of the arbitration agreement and therefore did not consent to arbitration. The court ruled on several evidentiary objections raised by both parties and denied eBay Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration.
