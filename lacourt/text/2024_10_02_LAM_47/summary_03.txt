Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the demurrer to the fifth amended complaint filed by defendants Justin White, Applied Approach Services, Inc., Deena Manion, David Bifulco, and Gerry & Lisa Van Nortwick. The demurrer challenged the ninth cause of action for dissolution of Elysian Health, LLC, alleging that the corporation's management is deadlocked or subject to internal dissension, or that those in control of the corporation have engaged in persistent and pervasive fraud, mismanagement, or abuse of authority.

The court finds that the allegations in the pleadings are sufficient to constitute a cause of action for dissolution and that the demurrer is without merit. The court also overrules the joinder to the demurrer filed by Gerry & Lisa Van Nortwick.

The court notes that the defendants' arguments are based on an unsupported contention that the allegations in the pleadings are insufficient to warrant dissolution, and that the court is not persuaded by this argument. The court also finds that the defendants have not demonstrated a misjoinder of parties or a lack of standing to assert the ninth cause of action.
