STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            In this action, Plaintiff
alleges Defendants engaged in retaliation and harassment against her based on
her use of medical leave and/or her perceived disability. On May 30, 2024, the
jury returned a verdict for Defendants and against Plaintiff, finding that
Plaintiff was not subjected to an adverse employment action and was not
harassed based on a perceived disability. 
 
Plaintiff moves for new trial and
for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion for New Trial is DENIED. 
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict is DENIED.

DISCUSSION:
 
Motion for New Trial
 
            Plaintiff
moves for a new trial. 
 
            A motion
for new trial must be served and filed either “(1) After the decision is
rendered and before the entry of judgment” or “(2) Within 15 days of the date
of mailing notice of entry of judgment by the clerk of the court pursuant to
Section 664.5, or service upon him or her by any party of written notice of
entry of judgment, or within 180 days after the entry of judgment, whichever is
earliest.” (Code Civ Proc. § 659.) The Court’s authority to rule on a motion
for new trial expires “75 days after the mailing of notice of entry of judgment
by the clerk of the court pursuant to Section 664.5 or 75 days after service on
the moving party by any party of written notice of entry of judgment, whichever
is earlier, or if that notice has not been given, 75 days after the filing of
the first notice of intention to move for a new trial.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
660.) 
 
Judgment was entered on the jury
verdict on August 8, 2024. (Judgment; see also August 8, 2024 Minute Order.)
Plaintiff served and filed her Notice of Intent to Move for New Trial on August
22, 2024, exactly 14 days later. Plaintiff therefore gave timely notice of intent
to move for new trial. However, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
659a, Plaintiff was required to serve and file her papers in support of that
motion within 10 days, i.e., no later than September 2, 2024. (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 659a; see also Code Civ. Proc. § 12 [extension of time when deadline falls on
holiday].) The 10-day period for filing may be extended a further 10 days by
stipulation or by order of the Court upon good cause shown by affidavits. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 659a.) Here, however, Plaintiff filed and served her supporting
papers on September 4, 2024, unsupported by any affidavit seeking an extension
of the time to file the papers and without a stipulation by the parties to
extend the time to respond. Although the timing requirements of section 659a
are not jurisdictional (Kabran v. Sharp Memorial Hospital (2017) 2
Cal.5th 330, 342), the Court has discretion to disregard materials which are
not timely filed. (Fernandez v. Consolidated Fisheries, Inc. (1953) 117
Cal.App.2d 254, 264.) As Plaintiff did not request an extension and has not
demonstrated good cause for any retroactive extension, the Court refuses to
consider Plaintiff’s supporting papers. 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for New Trial is
therefore DENIED.
 
Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict
 
            Plaintiff
moves for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the grounds that the jury’s
findings that Plaintiff was neither subjected to an adverse employment nor harassed
on the basis of a disability were unsupported by substantial evidence. 
 
//
 
 
Legal Standard
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 629 states that “[t]he court, before the expiration of
its power to rule on a motion for a new trial, either of its own motion, after
five days’ notice, or on motion of a party against whom a verdict has been
rendered, shall render judgment in favor of the aggrieved party notwithstanding
the verdict whenever a motion for a directed verdict for the aggrieved party
should have been granted had a previous motion been made.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
629.)
 
            A JNOV
motion ordinarily challenges whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the
claims or defenses asserted by the opposing party and now embodied in the
jury’s verdict. (Moore v. San Francisco (1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 728, 733-34;
see Martin v. Ideal Packing Co. (1957) 156 Cal.App.2d 232, 235 [a
JNOV motion is “in the nature of a demurrer to the evidence”].) It thus has the
same function as a motion for nonsuit or directed verdict, the only difference
being that the JNOV motion lies after a verdict for the opposing party has been
rendered. (Beavers v. Allstate Ins. Co. (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 310, 327; CC-California
Plaza Assocs. v. Paller & Goldstein (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 1042, 1050.)   
 
            All
evidence supporting the verdict is presumed true, so the issue is whether the
facts then constitute a prima facie case or defense as a matter of law.  (Fountain
Valley Chateau Blanc Homeowner's Ass’n v. Department of Veterans Affairs (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 743, 750.) “The court may not weigh evidence, draw inferences
contrary to the verdict, or assess the credibility of witnesses. The court must
deny the motion if there is any substantial evidence to support the verdict.” (Begnal v.
Canfield & Assocs., Inc. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 66, 72.  
 
            A JNOV
motion is governed by the same rules that govern a motion for directed verdict
or nonsuit. (Hauter v. Zogarts (1975) 14 Cal.3d 104, 110; Rollenhagen v. City of
Orange (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 414, 417 [disapproved on other grounds in Brown
v. Kelly Broadcasting Co. (1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 738].) Further, a JNOV
motion “may be granted only if it appears from the evidence, viewed in the
light most favorable to the party securing the verdict, that there is no
substantial evidence in support.” (Sweatman v. Department of Veterans
Affairs (2001) 25 Cal.4th 62, 68; Wolf v. Walt Disney Pictures &
Television (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1107, 1137-38.) A JNOV in favor of a plaintiff
is proper “only where, disregarding conflicting evidence on behalf of the [plaintiff]
and giving to [defendant]'s evidence all the value to which it is legally
entitled, therein indulging in every legitimate inference which may be drawn
from that evidence, the result is a determination that there is no evidence of
sufficient substantiality to support a verdict in favor of the [defendant].” (See
Reynolds v. Wilson (1958) 51 Cal.2d 94, 99.)  
 
Jurisdiction to Rule on Motion
 
            The
purpose of a JNOV motion “is to allow a party to prevail as a matter of law
where the relevant evidence is already in.”  (DLI Properties LLC v.
Hill (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th Supp. 1, 6; see Sukoff v. Lemkin
(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 740, 743 [“The purpose of a motion for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict is not to afford a review of the jury’s
deliberation but to prevent a miscarriage of justice in those cases where the
verdict rendered is without foundation.”].)  Nonetheless, a trial court's
discretion in granting a JNOV motion is severely limited.  (Garretson
v. Harold I. Miller (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 563, 568.)
 
            A motion
for JNOV must be decided by the trial court within 75 days after the clerk’s
service of notice of entry of the judgment. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 629(b), 659,
660(c); see Palmer v. GTE California, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 1265,
1277.)  
 
[Code of
Civil Procedure section 629] specifically limits a trial court’s power to rule
on the motion in the following ways: First, the trial court must enter j. n. o.
v. ‘before . . . expiration of its power to rule on a motion for a new trial,’
otherwise the judgment is invalid.  Section 660 indicates that ‘the power
of the court to rule on a motion for a new trial shall expire [75] days from
and after the mailing of notice of entry of judgment by the clerk of the court
. . .’ Second, on the trial court's own motion it can grant j. n. o. v., but
only after giving five days
notice to the parties and only in accordance
with the procedure just noted.  Third, the trial court is precluded from
ruling on a motion for j. n. o. v. ‘until the expiration of the time within
which a motion for a new trial must be served and filed . . .’ which according
to section 659 is 15 days ‘of the date of mailing notice of entry of judgment .
. .’    
 
(Sturgeon v. Leavitt (1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 957, 963
[decided before January 1, 2019, amendment extending time period for court to
rule on new trial motion to 75-day period].)  Thus, a trial court “can
grant j. n. o. v. so long as it acts before expiration of its power to rule on
a motion for a new trial, [75] days, and¿after expiration of the time within
which a motion for a new trial must be served and filed, 15 days.” (Id.
at 964.)
 
            In this
matter, notice of entry of judgment was given on August 8, 2024 on the date of
entry. (See August 8, 2024 Minute Order.) Thus, by operation of law, the Court
has power to rule on Plaintiff’s motion through October 22, 2024, which is 75
days from that date. (Code Civ. Proc. § 660(b)-(c).) Plaintiff’s motion, filed
and served on August 20, 2024, before the Notice of Intention, is therefore
timely.
 
Defendants’ Untimely Opposition
 
            Plaintiff
served and filed her motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on August
20, 2024. Defendants filed and served their opposition to this motion on
September 13, 2024. Any papers in opposition to a motion for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict must be served and filed within 10 days of service
of the moving papers. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 629(b); 659a.) The 10-day period for
filing may be extended a further 10 days by stipulation or by order of the
Court upon good cause shown by affidavits. (Code Civ. Proc. § 659a.) No
stipulation appears in the record, and Defendants, like Plaintiff on the new
trial motion, do not account for their untimely filings. The Court therefore refuses
to consider the untimely opposition to the motion for judgment notwithstanding
the verdict and will confine its ruling to the moving papers and the Court’s
own knowledge of the proceedings in this case. 
 
Retaliation
 
            Plaintiff
first argues that the jury’s finding that Plaintiff was not subjected to an
adverse employment action, and, therefore, that Defendants were not liable on
the first cause of action for retaliation, was not supported by substantial
evidence. 
 
To prevail on a claim for
retaliation under the Fair Employment and Housing Act, a Plaintiff must
establish that “(1) he or she engaged in a 'protected activity,' (2) the
employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a
causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action.” (Yanowitz
v. L'Oreal USA, Inc. (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1042 [internal citations
omitted].) An adverse employment action must materially affect the terms,
conditions, or privileges of employment to be actionable. (Id. at 1052.)
However, a pattern of systematic injuries that do not individually affect the
terms, conditions, or privileges of employment and that may not, individually,
constitute adverse employment actions may constitute an adverse employment
action collectively. (Id. at 1055-56.) 
 
After trial, the jury found that
Plaintiff engaged in protected activity by taking medical leave in January 2020
and by submitting a Uniform Complaint against Defendant Norwood to Defendant
Pomona Unified School District on August 24, 2020. (Special Verdict Form Nos.
1A-1B.) The jury concluded, however, that Defendant Norwood did not engage in
conduct which, taken as a whole, materially and adversely affected the terms
and conditions of Plaintiff’s employment. (Id. No. 2.) Plaintiff argues
that this finding was not supported by substantial evidence because she elicited
testimony of numerous events which, taken as a whole, materially and adversely
affected the terms and conditions of Plaintiff’s employment. Specifically,
Plaintiff contends that the evidence showed that Defendant Norwood:
 
(1)  
interfered with Plaintiff’s remote classroom by keeping
the substitute teacher’s classroom active (Plaintiff’s Exh. 10 p.14:28-15:6;
19:25-20:3 [Testimony of Plaintiff; May 28, 2024 Trial Transcript]), 
(2)  
did not give Plaintiff supplies for distance learning (Id.
p.109:7-14), 
(3)  
excluded Plaintiff from a staff meeting in May 2020
(Exh. 6 p.74:12-23 [Testimony of Defendant Norwood; May 21, 2024 Trial
Transcript]), 
(4)  
repeatedly insisted that Plaintiff required support (Exh.
8 p.26:15-17, 122:8-13 [Testimony of Defendant Norwood; May 23, 2024 Trial
Transcript]; Exh. 10 p.15:26-16:10, 18:16-18, 20:4-16),
(5)  
repeatedly observed Plaintiff on Zoom (Trial Exhs.
75-1-3),
(6)  
issued a written warning against Plaintiff on October
6, 2020 stating that the District had received several complaints from parents
regarding the conduct of Plaintiff’s Zoom classes (Trial Exhs. 96 [complaints],
102-001 [Warning]; Plaintiff’s Exh. 7 p.34:26-37:28, 40:27 [Norwood Testimony;
May 22, 2024 Trial Transcript]; Exh. 8 p.130:14-19 [Norwood Testimony; May 23,
2024 Trial Transcript]) and,
(7)  
violated the District’s Progressive Discipline Policy
and the Memorandum of Understanding between the District and its teachers by not
giving a verbal warning before giving a written warning. (Exh. 8 p.164:5-13
[Norwood Testimony, May 23, 2024 Trial Transcript). 
 
            While the
evidence identified in the motion could arguably support a finding in
Plaintiff’s favor, that same evidence could also support the finding that the
jury reached—i.e., that, even taken collectively, the evidence did not
establish that the terms and conditions of Plaintiff’s employment were
materially and adversely affected. Much of the conduct described, including repeated
observation of remote classes, failure to provide supplies for distance
learning, insistence that Plaintiff needs support, and keeping a substitute’s
remote classroom active, could fairly be described as “negligeable,” at best.
Moreover, although Plaintiff argues that the written warning is premised on
false assertions or events beyond Plaintiff’s control, Plaintiff offers no
explanation for that conclusion. Further still, Plaintiff’s description of the
testimony and evidence as to the calls from parents is highly misleading, as
the testimony produced by Plaintiff describes numerous issues with remote
classrooms reported by the parents. (See Trial Exh. 96.) It is not a false
statement to characterize these calls as “complaints,” as they are labeled in
the Warning and in Defendant Norwood’s testimony. (Exh. 102-001; Plaintiff’s
Exh. 7 p.34:26-37:28, 40:27 [Norwood Testimony; May 22, 2024 Trial Transcript];
Exh. 8 p.130:14-19 [Norwood Testimony; May 23, 2024 Trial Transcript].) 
 
As to the impact of the Warning
itself, the Court’s August 11, 2022 finding that the Warning could constitute
an adverse employment action by itself in ruling on Defendants’ Motion for
Summary Judgment is of no significance here. (See August 11, 2022 Minute
Order.) That prior ruling applied the operative standards for ruling on a
motion for summary judgment, where all evidence was required to be construed in
the light most favorable to Plaintiff as the non-moving party. (See August 11,
2022 Minute Order; Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384,
389.) Here, however, the Court is required to apply the opposite construction,
construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Defendants as the
prevailing parties at trial. Applying that construction, the Court cannot
conclude that there is no substantial evidence supporting the jury’s implicit
verdict that the Warning does not establish an adverse employment action
standing on its own. 
 
Plaintiff’s argument, in essence,
is that the jury erred in finding that this conduct did not collectively
constitute an adverse employment action. That contention is insufficient on a
motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict where the evidence could at
best be considered ambiguous. The Court is not empowered to disregard the
findings of the jury as to the proper weight of the evidence presented. For
that reason, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that the jury’s finding as to an
adverse employment action was unsupported by substantial evidence.
 
//
Harassment
 
            Plaintiff
also contends that the jury’s finding as to the issue of harassment was not
supported by substantial evidence. 
 
To prevail on a claim for
disability harassment, Plaintiff must establish that (1) she was a member of a
protected class; (2) she was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the
harassment was based on disability; and (4) the harassment unreasonably
interfered with her work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, or
offensive work environment. (Thompson v. City of Monrovia (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 860, 876.) 
 
Here, the jury found that Plaintiff
was not subjected to harassing conduct based on a perceived disability.
(Special Verdict No. 6.) Plaintiff contends, for the same reasons addressed
above, that the jury’s finding was not supported by substantial evidence. For
the reasons stated above, the Court finds this contention unpersuasive. 
 
As both of Plaintiff’s challenges
to the jury’s verdict are without merit, the Court finds that Plaintiff is not
entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict. 
 
Conclusion
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for
Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict is DENIED. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion for New Trial is DENIED. 
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
