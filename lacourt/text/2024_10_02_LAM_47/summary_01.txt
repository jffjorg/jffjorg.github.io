Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions for new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict filed by the plaintiff, Ozelia Harris. The plaintiff had alleged retaliation and harassment based on her use of medical leave and perceived disability, but the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants. The plaintiff argues that the jury's findings were not supported by substantial evidence, but the court has denied both motions.

The court found that the plaintiff's motion for new trial was untimely and that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate good cause for any retroactive extension. The court also found that the plaintiff's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was insufficient because the evidence could be construed as supporting the jury's findings.

The court noted that the plaintiff's claims of retaliation and harassment were based on a pattern of systematic injuries that did not individually affect the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. The court found that the jury's findings were supported by substantial evidence and that the plaintiff had not demonstrated that the jury's findings were erroneous.

The court denied both motions and entered judgment in favor of the defendants. The court's decision is final unless any party submits on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email.
