And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling on the motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by both the plaintiff, Dermot Damian Givens, and the defendants, Formosa Gardens HOA, Alexsei Durack, and Kevin Khuat. The Judge finds that both motions were not properly served on the opposing parties, as the plaintiff's motion was served by mail but did not include a proof of service, and the defendants' motion was served electronically but did not include a manifestation of affirmative consent from the plaintiff. The Judge notes that the parties have not stipulated to an earlier hearing date, and therefore denies both motions for improper notice. The case is set for trial on January 21, 2025, and the parties are ordered to give notice of the tentative ruling.
