STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for fraud and
enforcement of governing documents for a homeowner’s association under the
Davis-Stirling Act. Plaintiff sued Formosa Gardens HOA (“Defendant HOA”) and
Alexsei Durack and Kevin Ngoc Khuat (“Individual Defendants”) alleging breach
of governing documents, multiple violations of the Davis-Stirling Act (Civ.
Code § 5200 et seq.), fraud, theft in violation of Penal Code section 496,
conversion, intentional interference with contractual relations, and
declaratory relief. 
 
            The parties
filed cross-motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication.  
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            The parties
in this action filed cross-motions for summary judgment or summary
adjudication. Defendants’ motion, filed on May 30, 2024, states in its proof of
service that it was served via electronic service on Plaintiff, who is a
self-represented litigant. (Defendants’ POS.) Electronic service may only be
made on a self-represented litigant who manifests affirmative consent to
receive electronic service pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6
subdivision (c). No such manifestation is on file. While Defendants have
submitted a reply to a putative opposition to the motion, Plaintiff’s
opposition has not been filed with the Court. Moreover, Plaintiff’s putative
opposition does not remove this defect, as any deficiency in notice of a motion
for summary judgment or summary adjudication may only be cured by re-noticing
the motion with 75 days’ notice from the new notice date, or by express consent
of the parties. (Robinson v. Woods (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1268.) 
 
            Plaintiff’s
motion faces similar issues. Plaintiff’s moving papers, according to the proof
of service, were served by mail on Defendants on June 18, 2024, the date those
papers were filed. (See Plaintiff’s POS.) Defendants’ counsel, Christopher G.
Kerr, states under penalty of perjury that his office was never served with the
moving papers and did not discover the motion was filed until August 2024.
(Declaration of Christopher G. Kerr ISO Opp. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff’s reply papers do
not address this contention. It therefore appears that Plaintiff’s motion was
also not properly served on Defendants. 
 
            As trial in
this matter is currently set for January 21, 2025, it is not possible, in light
of the Court’s calendar, to continue the hearing in such a manner as to satisfy
both the 75-day notice period and the requirement that the hearing be at least
30 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c subd. (a).) Therefore, absent a
stipulation by the parties to have the motions heard on an earlier date, both
motions must be denied for improper notice.
 
            Accordingly,
Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication is DENIED.
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion for Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication is DENIED. 
            
Moving Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
