**Background**

* Dispute over residential lease
* Fire damaged the garage and laundry room, and gas leaks and mold were discovered
* Plaintiff is seeking a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction to prevent eviction

* Plaintiff argues that the notice was retaliatory and did not specify a "just cause" listed in section 1946.2

**Intentions**

* Plaintiff intends to continue occupying the premises pending remediation of the damage
* Defendant intends to evict Plaintiff, citing abandonment and no-fault damage

**Facts in Dispute**

* "To the extent defendant is attempting to evict plaintiff on the basis of abandonment, plaintiff is likely to prevail."
