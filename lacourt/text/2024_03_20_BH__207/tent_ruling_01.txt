background
 
On April 17, 2020, Plaintiffs Craig
Ross and Natalie Operstein (“Plaintiffs”) brought suit against Defendants
Seyfarth Shaw LLP and Colleen Regan (“Defendants”), alleging eleven causes of
action.  (See Complaint.)  On June 4, 2020, Defendants responded by
filing a Special Motion to Strike under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16
(“Anti-SLAPP motion”).  The day before
the hearing on the Anti-SLAPP motion, Plaintiff filed a dismissal of the entire
case.  (See October 27, 2020 Minute
Order.)
 
On December 17, 2020, Defendants
moved for attorneys’ fees.  On February
18, 2021, the Court granted Defendants’ motion, but reduced the amount from the
requested $79,779 to $63,911, on the basis that the fifth, eighth, and ninth
causes of action were properly subject to strike, but the first, second, third,
fourth, sixth, seventh, tenth, and eleventh causes of action are “mixed” and
arise in part from unprotected activity. 
(See February 9, 2021 Minute Order & February 18, 2021 Minute Order.)  
 
Plaintiffs appealed the partial
award of attorneys’ fees and Defendants cross appealed the partial denial.  The appellate court held in favor of
Defendants, determining all causes of action arise entirely from protected
activity, and remanded to the trial court with instructions to award the full
$79,779 Defendants had originally requested. 
The appellate court also held “Defendants shall recover their costs on
appeal.”  (See Ross v. Seyfarth Shaw
LLP (2023) 96 Cal.App.5th 722, 747.)
 
Defendants now request $95,640.66
in attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in connection with the appeal and in bringing
the instant motion.  Plaintiffs oppose the
motion and Defendants reply.
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            Plaintiffs
request judicial notice of the following:
 
1.      Court of
Appeal’s Stay Order on Plaintiff’s Petition for a Writ of Mandate (Case B280532)
 
2.      Court of
Appeal’s Alternative Writ and Order to Show Case [sic] on Plaintiffs’ Petition for
a Writ of Mandate (Case B280532) 
 
3.      Court of
Appeal’s Alternative Writ and Order to Show Case [sic] on Plaintiff’s Petition
for a Writ of Mandate (Case 320316)
 
4.      Order in
Plaintiff’s favor denying defendant’s anti-SLAPP motion in the Case SC125558,
Ross e al. v. Board of Trustees of California State University
 
5.      Plaintiffs’
Petition for Review filed in the California Supreme Court.
 
Evidence Code
section 451, subdivision (a) provides judicial notice shall be taken of “[t]he
decisional, constitutional, and public statutory law of this state and of the
United States[…]”  Similarly, Evidence
Code section 452 provides judicial notice may be taken of 
 
(a) [t]he
decisional, constitutional, and statutory law of any state of the United States
and the resolutions and private acts of the Congress of the United States and
of the Legislature of this state 
 
[…] 
 
(c) Official
acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial departments of the United
States and of any state of the United States 
 
[…] 
 
(d) Records of
(1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record of the United States or
of any state of the United States.
 
            Thus, the Court grants Plaintiffs’
request and takes judicial notice of all five exhibits as decisional law,
official acts of the judicial departments, and/or court records.
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiffs
argue that (1) the requested fees are not mandatory, and should be rejected on
public policy grounds; and (2) the attorneys’ fees requested are unreasonable.
 
            Availability
of Fees
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c)(1) provides that, except for certain
cases brought pursuant to various sections of the Government Code, not relevant
here, “a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled
to recover that defendant's attorney's fees and costs.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16.)
 
“The appellate
courts have construed section 425.16, subdivision (c), to include an attorney
fees award on appeal.”  (Rosenaur v.
Scherer (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 260, 287, as modified (Apr. 5, 2001).)
 
Section 425.16,
subdivision (c) also includes “fees on fees” or “all hours reasonably spent,
including those necessary to establish and defend the fee claim.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1141.)
 
As such, the
Court rejects Plaintiffs’ public policy arguments, which contradict clear
precedent on the issue.
 
Plaintiffs also cite
to Carpenter v. Jack in the Box Corp. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 454, where
the Court of Appeal denied plaintiff’s request for attorney fees on appeal
because “Resolution of this issue, however, proved to be neither simple nor
straightforward[.]”  (Id. at p.
458.)  But here, the Appellate Court
expressly held that Defendants shall recover their attorneys’ fees on appeal.  (See Ross v. Seyfarth Shaw
LLP (2023) 96 Cal.App.5th 722, 747.)
 
Therefore, the
Court finds that Defendants are generally entitled to recover their attorneys’
fees incurred on appeal and in connection with bringing the instant motion.
 
Reasonableness
of Fees
 
Plaintiffs
argue the fees requested are unreasonable because (1) they are excessive and
duplicative of the work and research done in connection with the underlying fee
motion; (2) the $8,000 incurred for research and opposition of Plaintiffs’
request for relief from the undertaking requirement because that opposition was
“meritless[,]” “unnecessary” and “unreasonable”; and (3) the requested fees
should be denied or reduced for violations of the California Rules of Court.
 
1.     
Duplicative Fees
 
Plaintiffs
first contend that Defendant’s appellate briefs “repeat the argument and
authorities presented in their trial court motions” and therefore Defendants
were already adequately compensated by virtue of the award of $79,779 in
attorneys’ fees for that work done in the trial court.  (Opp. at pp. 12-13.)  However, a review of the billing entries
demonstrates that most of the entries were spent on things unique to the
appeal, and the entries do not demonstrate a large amount of time was spent
researching or drafting the same issues briefed in connection with the original
anti-SLAPP motion.  Moreover, Plaintiffs
do not point out any specific entries that they believe are impermissibly
duplicative.  Therefore, the Court does
not reduce any fees on the basis that they are duplicative.
 
2.     
Undertaking
 
Plaintiffs
next contend that the $8,000 incurred in connection with opposing Plaintiffs’
request for relief from the undertaking requirement should be denied, because
that opposition was “meritless” “unnecessary” and “unreasonable.”  However, Plaintiffs provide no legal support
for their contention that such fees are not awardable.  To the contrary, the attorneys’ fee provision
of Section 425.16, subdivision (c) encompasses fees incurred “for litigating
the adequacy of the plaintiff's undertaking.” 
(Wanland v. Law Offices of Mastagni, Holstedt & Chiurazzi
(2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 15, 21-23.)
 
Therefore,
the Court does not reduce any fees incurred in connection with litigating the
adequacy of the undertaking.
 
3.     
Violations of California Rules of Court
 
Plaintiffs
argue that Defendants’ requested fees should be reduced or denied because (1)
Defendants violated California Rules of Court, rule 8.216(b)(2) by failing to
separate in their combined brief the issues on appeal and on cross-appeal; (2) Defendants
violated California Rules of Court, rule 8.278 by failing to file a Memorandum
of Costs; and (3) Defendants violated California Rules of Court, rule 2.109 by
beginning their numbering on the second page, restarting it several times
within their motion.
 
In support
of Plaintiffs’ argument that the fee request may be reduced due to failure to
comply with California Rules of Court, Plaintiffs cite to Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.  The Court is
unable to find a portion of Ketchum, on page 1132 or otherwise, standing
for such a proposition.
 
Therefore,
Defendants’ purported violations of the California Rules of Court do not
provide a basis for the Court to reduce or deny Defendants’ requested
attorneys’ fees.
 
Costs
 
Although
not challenged by Plaintiffs, the Court additionally analyzes the costs sought,
as though Defendants had submitted a memorandum of costs.
 
California
Rules of Court, rule 8.278(d) provides as follows:
 
(d)
Recoverable costs
 
(1)  A party may recover only the following costs,
if reasonable:
 
(A)  Filing fees;
 
(B)  The amount the party paid for any portion of
the record, whether an original or a copy or both. The cost to copy parts of a
prior record under rule 8.147(b)(2) is not recoverable unless the Court of
Appeal ordered the copying;
 
(C)  The cost to produce additional evidence on
appeal;
 
(D)  The costs to notarize, serve, mail, and file
the record, briefs, and other papers;
 
(E)  The cost to print and reproduce any brief,
including any petition for rehearing or review, answer, or reply;
 
(F)  The cost to procure a surety bond, including
the premium, the cost to obtain a letter of credit as collateral, and the fees
and net interest expenses incurred to borrow funds to provide security for the
bond or to obtain a letter of credit, unless the trial court determines the
bond was unnecessary; and
 
(G)  The fees and net interest expenses incurred
to borrow funds to deposit with the superior court in lieu of a bond or
undertaking, unless the trial court determines the deposit was unnecessary.
 
            Most of the expenses sought are for
filing fees, mail/messenger service fees, and for “printing & assembly of
hard copy of plaintiff’s record (appellants’ appendix) submitted to court of
appeal,” all of which are permitted under Rule 8.278(d).  However, Defendants also seek $850 for “First
Legal Investigations Asset search[es]” for Craig Ross and Natalie Operstein ($425
each), $15 in a remote appearance fee (Jassy Decl., Ex. A, Invoice # 2894 at p.
3.)  These amounts are not permitted by
the Rule.  Therefore, the Court deducts $865
from the requested $1,322.66 in costs.
 
Conclusion
 
Finding no
legal or factual basis to deny or reduce Defendants’ requested attorneys’ fees,
the Court grants, in part, Defendants’ Motion for attorneys’ fees and awards
Plaintiff a total of $94,775.66, representing $94,318.89 in attorneys’ fees and
$456.77 in costs incurred in connection with the appeal and in bringing this
motion to recover fees and costs. 
 
Defendants
shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service
regarding the same.
