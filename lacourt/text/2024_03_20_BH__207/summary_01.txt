And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules in favor of the defendants, Seyfarth Shaw LLP and Colleen Regan, granting them attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of $94,775.66. The defendants had requested $95,640.66 in attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with the appeal and in bringing the instant motion. The judge finds that the defendants are generally entitled to recover their attorneys' fees incurred on appeal and in connection with bringing the instant motion, and that the fees requested are reasonable. The judge also finds that the defendants' request for fees is not excessive or duplicative, and that their opposition to the plaintiffs' request for relief from the undertaking requirement was reasonable.

The judge rejects the plaintiffs' arguments that the fees requested are not mandatory and should be denied on public policy grounds, and that the fees requested are unreasonable. The judge also finds that the defendants did not violate any California Rules of Court and therefore did not reduce or deny the requested fees on that basis.

The judge notes that the defendants' requested fees include $850 for "First Legal Investigations Asset search[es]" for Craig Ross and Natalie Operstein, which is not permitted by the California Rules of Court, and deducts $865 from the requested $1,322.66 in costs.
