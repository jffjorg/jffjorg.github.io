And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service of summons and dismiss filed by defendant Ty Warner Hotels & Resorts, LLC. The plaintiff, Michelle Stornetta, opposes the motion, arguing that the court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant due to its contacts with California.

The judge finds that the current record is insufficient to grant or deny the motion and grants the plaintiff's request for limited jurisdictional discovery to determine the extent of the defendant's involvement with its California properties and the proportion of its business derived from these properties.

The judge also continues the hearing on the motion to June 27, 2024, and allows the parties to file supplemental memoranda of points and authorities in support of their positions.

The key issues in the case are whether the court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant and whether the defendant's contacts with California are sufficient to establish jurisdiction. The judge's tentative ruling suggests that the court may have jurisdiction over the defendant, but the issue is not yet fully resolved.
