And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a medical malpractice lawsuit brought by Thomasina White against Debra Stafford, M.D. The judge has overruled the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's second amended complaint, which alleges medical battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge has found that the plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts to support her claims and that the defendant's actions could be considered extreme and outrageous.

The judge has also granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for attorney fees, finding that there is no basis for such fees in this case. The judge has ordered the defendant to file and serve an answer to the second amended complaint within 10 days of the order's entry.

The judge's ruling is based on the facts and laws presented in the case, including the California Code of Civil Procedure and relevant court decisions. The judge has carefully considered the arguments presented by both sides and has made a decision that is consistent with the law and the facts of the case.
