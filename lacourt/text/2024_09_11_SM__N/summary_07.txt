And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Lyft, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The judge found that Lyft has demonstrated the existence of an arbitration agreement that may be invoked against David Brantley, the plaintiff. The arbitration clause in Lyft's Terms of Service requires submission of claims arising out of or relating to the agreement, the Lyft platform, or any other goods or services made available through the Lyft platform. The plaintiff has accepted Lyft's Terms of Service on four occasions, including when he created his account with Lyft and when Lyft updated its Terms of Service and required him to affirmatively accept the revised terms. The judge did not find any arguments from the plaintiff that would invalidate the application of the arbitration provision. Therefore, the proceedings are hereby stayed pending the outcome of arbitration.
