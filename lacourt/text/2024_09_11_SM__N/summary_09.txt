And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Nigel Lythgoe's motion to strike Plaintiff Jane Doe's First Amended Complaint. The judge has also granted Defendant's request for judicial notice of six news articles, but only to confirm that they were published, not to verify the facts stated in them. The judge has not struck Plaintiff's complaint as irrelevant, false, or improper, and has instead allowed Plaintiff to proceed anonymously. The judge has found that Plaintiff has a sufficient basis for maintaining her anonymity, as she has alleged sexual assault by Defendant and may be subject to harm and retaliation if her name is publicly revealed. The judge has also rejected Defendant's contention that anonymity will prejudice his defense, finding that it is Defendant's responsibility to contact witnesses to mount a defense, not the other way around. The judge has ordered Defendant to file and serve an answer to Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint within 10 days of the entry of this order.
