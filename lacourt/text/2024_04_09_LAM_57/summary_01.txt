And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has granted Cazares' motion for attorney's fees and costs in part and denied it in part. GM argued that the motion was untimely and that the amount of fees and costs sought by Cazares was unreasonable. The court disagreed with GM on both points. The court reduced the amount of fees and costs awarded to Cazares by $2,116.50, $3,195.50, and $1,245, respectively, due to the unreasonableness of certain tasks performed by Cazares' attorneys. The court awarded Cazares a total of $48,751.23 in fees and costs.
