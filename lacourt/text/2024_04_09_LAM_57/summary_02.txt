And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Mansouri's motion to compel Shy to comply with section 2031.280(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court finds that section 2031.280(a) does not authorize motions to compel compliance, and that Mansouri should have moved under section 2031.310 to compel further responses to the Requests for Production of Documents (RFPs). Additionally, the court finds that Mansouri failed to meet and confer with Shy before filing the motion, as required by section 2031.310. As a result, the court imposes sanctions on Mansouri in the amount of $5,400, which Shy incurred in defending against the motion.
