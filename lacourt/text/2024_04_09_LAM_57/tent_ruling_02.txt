 Case Number:  22STCV09756    Hearing Date:   April 9, 2024    Dept:  57 Defendant Pedram Mansouri moves for an order compelling Plaintiff
Barry Shy to comply with section 2031.280(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure in connection
with Shy’s  production of documents in
response to Mansouri’s  first set of Requests
for Production of Documents (“RFPs”).   Section 2031.280(a) provides that “[a]ny documents or category of documents produced in response
to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall be identified
with the specific request number to which the documents respond.” (See Pollock
v. Superior Court (Schuster) (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 1348, 1352
[“Section 2031.280 prescribes the form in which items must be produced.  As newly amended, it requires that a document
be identified with the specific request number to which it pertains . . .
.”].  According to Mansouri, Shy’s
production of documents failed to comply with that requirement.
Mansouri’s motion is made under Section 2031.280(a)
itself.  The problem is that Section
2031.280(a) does not authorize motions to compel compliance with that section.  (The Pollock case, cited above, does
not state otherwise.)   Accordingly, the Court lacks authority to
entertain Mansouri’s motion and the motion must be denied.  Correspondingly, Mansouri’s request in the
motion for the imposition of sanctions against Shy is denied as well.
It would appear that Mansouri should have moved under
Section 2031.310 to compel Shy to provide further responses to the RFPs based
on the proposition that Shy’s statement of compliance with the RFPs was
incomplete in that Shy failed to comply with Section 2031.280(a)’s manner of
identification requirement.  It was
somewhat puzzling that Mansouri’s motion disclaims reliance on Section
2031.310, and yet, the motion is accompanied by a “separate statement” setting
forth why further responses to the RFPs are required.
Another problem with Mansour’s motion is that it appears
from his papers and Shy’s opposition thereto that Mansouri failed to meet and
confer with Shy about the asserted failure of Shy to comply with Section
2031.280(a) before Mansouri filed the motion. 
Section 2031.280(a) does not contain a meet and confer requirement.  But that absence only underscores that Section
2031.280(a) does not itself authorize motions to compel compliance.
By contrast, Section 2031.310 contains a meet and confer
requirement.  Shy contends that Mansouri’s failure to meet
and confer constitutes an abuse of the discovery process for which sanctions
against Mansouri in the amount of the attorney’s fees and costs Shy incurred in
defending against Mansouri’s  motion is
warranted under Section 2023.020. (Schuman Decl., ¶ 16.)   The amount of sanctions that Shy requests is
$5,400.   Section 2023.020 states:         
  Notwithstanding the outcome of the
particular discovery motion, the court shall impose a  monetary sanction
ordering that any  party or
attorney  who fails to confer as required pay  the reasonable
expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
 conduct.
 (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020.)   
As indicated above, Section 2031.280(a), the provision on which
Mansouri’s motion rests, does not contain a meet and confer requirement.  Thus, it could be argued that sanctions
against Mansouri for failing to meet and confer are not authorized.  On the other hand, as indicated above, it
would appear that Mansouri should have moved under Section 2031.310, which does
contain a meet and confer requirement. 
Mansouri’s failure to comply with that requirement means that sanctions
are warranted.  In the Court’s view, the
amount of sanctions that Shy requests, $5,400, is reasonable.   Mansouri shall pay that amount to Shy within
45 days of the hearing on Mansouri’s motion.
