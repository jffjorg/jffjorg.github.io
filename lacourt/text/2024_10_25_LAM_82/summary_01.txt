Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Adeshola Helen Adegoroye v. Director of DPSS Los Angeles County. The court sustains Respondent's demurrer, which means that the court agrees with Respondent that the petition filed by Petitioner is insufficient and should be dismissed. The court also denies Petitioner's request to amend the petition, as Petitioner lacks standing to challenge Respondent's decision and is not authorized to represent Claimant in court. The court grants leave to amend for Claimant or counsel representing Claimant to file a petition/complaint. The court orders that if no amended petition is filed within 60 days, the case will be dismissed without prejudice.
