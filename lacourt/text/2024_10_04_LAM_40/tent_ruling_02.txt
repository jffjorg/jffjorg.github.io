I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Liddie Bythwood (Bythwood)
sues Defendants Los Angeles County Department of Social Services (LA County), Gary
Aviles (Aviles), and Does 1 through 10 (collectively Defendants), pursuant to an
October 26, 2022, Complaint alleging causes of action for (1) Hostile Work
Environment Harassment in Violation of FEHA and (2) Failure to Prevent and Remedy
Harassment. 
Defendant LA County hired Bythwood as
an Eligibility Worker on September 13, 2000. Beginning in July 2021, Bythwood
began experiencing sexual harassment from Defendant Aviles. Between July 2021
and February 2022, Aviles repeatedly made sexually inappropriate comments and
gestures to Bythwood. On March 9, 2022, Bythwood lodged a complaint about Aviles
with the District Director. Aviles retired in April 2022. 
B. Motion Before the Court
On July 16, 2024, Defendants filed
the instant motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary
adjudication. 
On September 20, 2024, Bythwood
filed an opposition to the motion. 
On September 30, 2024, Defendants
filed a reply. 
 
II. Motion
A. Evidentiary Objections
In granting or denying a motion for
summary judgment or summary adjudication, the court need rule only on those
objections to evidence that it deems material to its disposition of the motion.
Objections to evidence that are not ruled on for purposes of the motion shall
be preserved for appellate review. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (q).)
Evidentiary objections not made either in writing or orally shall be deemed
waived. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (b).) 
Plaintiff’s Objections to
Declaration of Gary Aviles
No 1: OVERRULED 
Plaintiff’s Objections to
Declaration of Ben Stormer
            Nos
1-5: Not ruled on as not material to disposition of ruling
Defendant’s Objections 
            Nos
1-6, 9, 12-20: Not ruled on as not material to disposition of ruling
Nos 7-8, 10-11: OVERRULED 
B. Legal Standard
A motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the
papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact
for trial or that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of
law. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) 
A party may also seek summary adjudication of select causes
of action, affirmative defenses, claims for damages, or issues of duty, which
may be made by a standalone motion or as an alternative to a motion for summary
judgment and proceeds in all procedural respects like a motion for summary
judgment, but which must completely dispose of the challenged cause of action,
affirmative defense, claim for damages, or issue of duty. (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subds. (f)(1)-(2), (t).) 
The moving party bears the initial burden of production to
make prima facie showing no triable material fact issues. (Aguilar v.
Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850.) This burden on summary
judgment or adjudication “is more properly one of persuasion rather than proof,
since he must persuade the court that there is no material fact for a
reasonable trier of fact to find, and not to prove any such fact to the
satisfaction of the court itself as though it were sitting as the trier of
fact.” (Id. at p. 850, fn. 11.) 
If the moving party meets this burden, the burden shifts to
the opposing party to make a rebuttal prima facie showing that a triable issue
of material fact exists. (Id. at p. 849.) 
“[I]n ruling on motions for summary judgment courts are to
‘“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.”’
[Citations].” (Cheal v. El Camino Hospital (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 736,
760.) 
C. Analysis
                          
i.         
Issue One 
LA County moves for summary judgment on the first cause of
action for sexual harassment on the basis that it must fail because Bythwood
did not suffer harassment after LA County had notice of the alleged harassment.
 
An employer may be strictly liable for harassment of an
employee by an agent or supervisor. (State Dept. of Health Services v. Superior Court (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1026, 1034 (State Dept. of Health Services); Fiol
v. Doellstedt (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1318, 1331; John Doe
v. Capital Cities (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1052.) 
Under FEHA, a supervisor is “any individual having
the authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay
off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees,
or the responsibility to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively
to recommend that action, if, in connection with the foregoing, the exercise of
that authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the
use of independent judgment. (Govt.
Code §12926
subd. (t).)
Alternatively, an employer is only
liable for harassment by a nonsupervisory employee if “if the employer (a) knew
or should have known of the harassing conduct and (b) failed to take immediate
and appropriate corrective action.” (Myers v. Trendwest Resorts, Inc. 
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1419-1420; accord Roby v. McKesson Corp.
(2009) 47 Cal.4th 686, 707 [“When the harasser is a nonsupervisory
employee, employer liability turns on a showing of negligence (that is, the
employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take
appropriate corrective action.”)].)
LA County argues that Aviles was
not Bythwood’s supervisor, and thus strict liability does not apply. Bythwood
testifies that Aviles was her immediate supervisor in the early 2000’s but that
between June 2021 and February 2022 her direct supervisor was Trinidad
Buenrostro. (MSJ, Ex. 2, Bythwood Depo. pp. 54:20-25, 57:4-7.) Bythwood further
testified that between June 2021 and February 2022, Aviles did not have the
power to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, discharge, discipline, or promote
her, nor did he prepare her performance evaluations. (MSJ, Ex. 2, Bythwood Depo.
pp. 56:20-25, 59:9-60:2.) LA County thus argues that the negligence, rather
than strict negligence standard applies, and it is only liable if the County
knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take appropriate
corrective action. 
Bythwood first reported Aviles’ behavior
to a supervisor on March 9, 2022, and she testified that after that date, she
did not experience any further sexual harassment and did not see Aviles again. (MSJ,
Ex. 2, Bythwood Depo. pp. 82:1-8.) Aviles retired from his position in April
2022. (Aviles Decl. ¶ 2.) Thus, LA County argues that it only knew of the
behavior as of March 9 and it did not fail to take appropriate corrective
action because the behavior did not continue after the County had notice, and
Aviles subsequently retired. 
Thus, LA County has met its prima
facie burden of production to show that Aviles was not in a supervisory role
when he harassed Bythwood, and that she did not experience harassing conduct
after LA County was aware of the behavior. 
The burden then shifts to Bythwood
to show that a triable issue of material fact exists. 
Bythwood argues that there are
triable issues of fact as to whether Aviles was a supervisor under FEHA. Bythwood
argues that Chapman v Enos illustrates that a harasser need not be a
direct supervisor for FEHA employer liability. In Chapman v. Enos (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 920, 930 (Chapman), the Court of Appeal recognized that
an individual who did not have the authority to hire, fire, promote or transfer
could qualify as a “supervisor” where he had the responsibility to direct the
plaintiff employee’s day-to-day duties. The parties do not dispute that Aviles
was a supervisor in the Medi-Cal department where Bythwood worked. (UMF No. 2) Bythwood
argues that Aviles had “supervisory authority and responsibility” for her work.
(Opp. p. 10:1-2.) Bythwood testified that she would sometimes go into Aviles’
office to ask questions if she needed help on a case or let him know when she arrived
at work because her “supervisor gets in late and he might have been the only
supervisor there.” (Opp,. Ex. A, Bythwood Depo. 72:11-23.) Aviles clearly had
supervisory authority, ratified by LA County, over the department in which
Bythwood worked during the time he was harassing Bythwood. 
In reply, LA County cites State Dept. of Health
Services for the assertion that an employer is only strictly
liable when the harasser “is the victim’s supervisor…” (State Dept. of Health Services, supra, 31 Cal.4th 1026, 1040-1041.) However, when read in context,
this phrase does not support LA County’s argument. The full sentence is as
follows: “The FEHA imposes two
standards of employer liability for sexual harassment, depending on whether the
person engaging in the harassment is the victim's supervisor or a
nonsupervisory coemployee.” (State Dept. of Health Services, supra, 31 Cal.4th 1026, 1040-1041.) The Supreme Court was not differentiating
between a victim’s direct supervisor and another supervisor, but rather was
distinguishing a supervisory position from a “nonsupervisory coemployee” position.
Aviles was not Bythwood’s nonsupervisory colleague. He was a supervisor, in her
department. 
Further, the plain language of Government Code section 12926 subdivision (t) defines a
supervisor as an individual with the authority to “hire, transfer, […] assign,
reward or discipline other employees, or the responsibility to direct them… (Govt. Code §12926 subd. (t).) Aviles had such supervisory authority over employees
in Bythwood’s department.  
Thus,
Bythwood has met her burden to show that a triable issue of material fact
exists as to whether Aviles is a supervisor under the FEHA. 
                        
ii.         
Issue Two 
LA County moves for summary judgment on the second cause of
action for failure to prevent harassment on the basis that it must fail because
there was no actionable harassment, and the County took steps to prevent it. 
LA County argues that “[w]here there has been no
harassment, the employer cannot be liable for failure to prevent such actions
from occurring. (Trujillo v. North County Transit Dist. (1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 280, 289.) 
However,
as described above, there is a triable issue of material fact as to whether
there was actionable harassment. 
Accordingly,
LA County has not met its burden to show no triable material fact issues. 
III. Conclusion
Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, or in
the Alternative, Summary Adjudication is DENIED.
