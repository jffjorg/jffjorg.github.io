  - "The party asserting the lack of good faith, who has the burden of proof on that issue (ยง 877.6, subd.

And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling regarding a motion contesting the application for determination of good faith settlement between the plaintiffs, JNP Enterprise, Inc., Eileen Panosian, and Armen Panosian, and Security National Insurance Company. The parties involved are the plaintiffs, the Landlord Defendants, including Suzanne Yee, Elena Chang, Robert Ip, RT Property Management Services Corp., and Am Trust Financial, Inc., as well as Security National Insurance Company and Legacy Realty Advisory, Inc.

The dispute centers around the good faith of the settlement between the plaintiffs and Security National, which was entered into on June 5, 2024. The Landlord Defendants are contesting the settlement, arguing that it was not made in good faith because the plaintiffs are settling for a fraction of their alleged damages and Security National's liability is far greater than the settlement amount.

The court will consider the following factors in determining whether the settlement was made in good faith: a rough approximation of plaintiffs' total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and a recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than they would if they were found liable after a trial.

The court has reviewed the evidence and finds that the Landlord Defendants have failed to meet their burden to provide enough evidence to show that the settlement was not entered in good faith. Therefore, the motion to contest the application for determination of good faith settlement is denied.
