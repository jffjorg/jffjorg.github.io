And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The motion was filed by the Los Angeles County Department of Social Services, Gary Aviles, and Does 1 through 10, in response to a complaint filed by Liddie Bythwood alleging hostile work environment harassment and failure to prevent harassment.

The court finds that there is a triable issue of material fact as to whether Aviles was a supervisor under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), despite the defendants' argument that he was not a direct supervisor. The court also finds that there is a triable issue of material fact as to whether the defendants took adequate steps to prevent harassment.

As a result, the court denies the motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The case will proceed to trial on November 12, 2024.
