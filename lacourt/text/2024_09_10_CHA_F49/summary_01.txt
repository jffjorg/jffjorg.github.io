And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to join the underinsured motorist claim with the pending superior court action. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, Julian Manasseh, who seeks to join American Family Connect Property and Casualty as a defendant and consolidate the underinsured motorist claim with the present case. The judge found that the two accidents, one on November 4, 2019, and the other on September 13, 2021, do not arise from the same transaction or series of related transactions. The judge distinguished the case from Mercury Ins. Group v. Superior Court (1998) 19 Cal.4th 332, where the Supreme Court of California upheld the trial court's joinder of a UIM arbitration proceeding with a related personal injury action arising from a single motor vehicle accident. The judge also found that the facts in this case are distinguishable from Prudential Property & Casualty Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 275, where the plaintiff was involved in two separate collisions that caused indivisible injuries. The judge denied the motion as the accidents do not meet the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2.
