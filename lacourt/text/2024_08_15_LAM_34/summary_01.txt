Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint, which sought punitive damages for alleged oppression, fraud, or malice. The plaintiff, Henry David Holloway, alleged that the defendant, Iris M. Whiting, as Trustee of the Iris M. Whiting 2006 Revocable Trust, failed to maintain a habitable living condition at the rental property located at 1864 Cordova Street, Pomona, California. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant's conduct was intentional, willful, and fraudulent, and sought punitive damages. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's complaint did not meet the burden of alleging affirmative conduct on the part of the defendant and solely focused on the lack of adequate abatement of the alleged housing conditions. The judge noted that the plaintiff's reliance on a prior case, Penner v. Falk, was not relevant to the current case, as it focused on a different issue. The judge granted the defendant's motion to strike the portions of the complaint seeking punitive damages, but will inquire whether the plaintiff can seek leave to amend the complaint to meet the pleading requirements.
