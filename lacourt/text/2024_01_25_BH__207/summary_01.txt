Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the second cause of action for premises liability is sustained without leave to amend. The plaintiff's government claim alleges that the defendant's agents failed to maintain, inspect, and/or repair the utility hole/vault/cover and/or sidewalk, which caused the plaintiff's injuries. However, the complaint alleges that the plaintiff tripped on an uneven and displaced portion of the sidewalk, which is not present in the government claim. The court finds that this variance is fatal, as it constitutes a complete shift in allegations.

The court also notes that the plaintiff failed to meet the burden of showing how the complaint could be amended to cure the defects. The defendant's demurrer is sustained due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with the Government Claims Act (GCA) presentation requirements.
