BACKGROUND
 
On
May 9, 2022, Plaintiff Cielo Guzman (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants Dial Transport Inc. (“Dial”) and Venerando
Bautista (“Bautista”) for damages related to a motor vehicle accident. 
 
On December 27, 2022, Defendant Bautista propounded Form
Interrogatories, Set One on Plaintiff. Plaintiff served verified responses on August
7, 2023. (Joseph Decl. ¶ 4.) Bautista now moves to compel further responses to
numbers 8.6–8.8, 11.1, 17.1, 20.3, 20.7, 20.8, and 20.11. 
 
Defendants also bring a separate motion to compel initial responses to
Form Interrogatories propounded by Defendant Dial. 
 
Plaintiff opposes and Defendants reply.[1] 
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
On December 4, 2023, the parties appeared for a scheduled Informal
Discovery Conference (IDC) pursuant to the Court’s Eighth Amended Standing
Order. Prior to the IDC being held with the Court, Plaintiff disconnected and
did not participate. Therefore, because Defendants, as the moving parties,
complied with their obligation, the IDC requirement has been met. (Min. Order,
12/4/23.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Compel
Further Responses
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300(a) provides that “on
receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an
order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of
the following apply: 
 
(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete. 
(2) An
exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. 
(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or
too general.” 
 
The motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(b)(1).) “Unless notice of this motion is given
within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the
propounding party waives any right to compel a further response to the
interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(c).) 
 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(d).)  
 
The Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal
Injury Hub Courts requires that the parties engage in an IDC. (See Order at ¶
9E.)
 
Form
Interrogatory, Set One, numbers 8.6–8.8 request information about dates
Plaintiff did not work due to the incident, income lost to date, and whether
Plaintiff will lose income in the future. Plaintiff responded to 8.6 and 8.7 as
follows:
 
“Plaintiff is in
process of obtaining information responsive to this Form Interrogatory.
Discovery and investigation are ongoing. Responding Party reserves the right to
supplement this response.” 
 
To number 8.8
regarding future income, Plaintiff responded: “Unknown at this time. Plaintiff
has not recovered from her injuries. Discovery and investigation are ongoing.
Responding Party reserves the right to supplement this response.” 
 
The
Court orders Plaintiff to serve a code-compliant response to these
interrogatories. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.220 (“(b) If an interrogatory
cannot be answered completely, it shall be answered to the extent possible. (c)
If the responding party does not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond
fully to an interrogatory, that party shall so state, but shall make a
reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other
natural persons or organizations, except where the information is equally
available to the propounding party.”)[2] 
 
Form
Interrogatory, Set One, number 11.1 requests information about previous
claims of personal injuries, including the date, location, place, and contact
information of people involved. Plaintiff responded: “Yes. In 2012 and 2013.
Claims were resolved.” However, Plaintiff did not provide any of the remaining
information. Therefore, because the response is deficient, Plaintiff must
provide further responses. 
 
Form
Interrogatory, Set One, number 17.1 asks if Plaintiff’s responses to each
request for admission is an unqualified admission. Defendant attached proof
that Plaintiff answered the request for admissions. (See Joseph Decl., Exh. 4.)
Plaintiff did not respond to number 17.1. Accordingly, Plaintiff must serve
further responses. 
 
Form
Interrogatory, Set One, number 20.3 requests the address and location where
Plaintiff’s trip began and the destination. Plaintiff responded: “Plaintiff
does not recall.” 
 
Plaintiff
is ordered to serve a code-compliant response to this interrogatory, including
whether a reasonable and good faith effort was made to obtain the information.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.220.)
 
Form
Interrogatory, Set One, number 20.7 asks: “Was there a traffic signal
facing you at the time of the INCIDENT? If so, state: (a) your location when
you first saw it; (b) the color; (c) the number of seconds it had been that
color; and (d) whether the color changed between the time you first saw it and
the INCIDENT.” 
 
Form
Interrogatory, Set One, Number 20.8 asks: “State how the INCIDENT occurred,
giving the speed, direction, and location of each vehicle involved: (a) just
before the INCIDENT; (b) at the time of the INCIDENT; and (c) just after the
INCIDENT.”
 
Plaintiff
responded to each: “Refer to police report. Further, pursuant to Civ. Proc.
Code § 2030.210, Responding Party elects to produce writings responsive to this
request that are in the possession or control of Responding Party, which are
attached as Exhibit “A” to Plaintiff’s responses to the Demand for
Identification and Production of Documents, Set 1, incorporated by reference
herein, served concurrently herewith. Discovery and investigation are ongoing.
Responding Party reserves the right to supplement this response.”  
 
The
interrogatories call for information within Plaintiff’s personal knowledge.
Therefore, Plaintiff must provide a further response. 
 
Form
Interrogatory, Set One, number 20.11 asks: “State the name, ADDRESS, and
telephone number of each owner and each PERSON who has had possession since the
INCIDENT of each vehicle involved in the INCIDENT.” 
 
Plaintiff
responded: “Defendants' vehicle is unknown to Plaintiff.” Plaintiff did not
provide any information about her vehicle, which is alleged to be involved in
the incident. Therefore, Plaintiff must provide further responses. 
 
Therefore,
based on the above, Defendants’ motion to compel further responses to
Bautista’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, numbers 8.6–8.8, 11.1, 17.1, 20.3,
20.7, 20.8, and 20.11, is granted.
 
Sanctions
 
Defendants
request $1,275 in monetary sanctions representing a $255 hourly rate for two
hours preparing the motion and one hour drafting a reply. (Joseph Decl. ¶ 7.) Sanctions
are mandatory against the unsuccessful party that makes a motion to compel
further discovery. However, because the declaration states that three hours
were spent on this motion, the Court will award $765 in monetary sanctions (3
hours of attorney time at an hourly rate of $255).  
 
Compel
Initial Responses
 
Defendants also move to compel initial responses to Form
Interrogatories propounded by Defendant Dial. 
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a
timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290 (b).) Failure to timely respond waives
all objections, including privilege and work product, unless “[t]he party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance” and “[t]he
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290 (a)(1),
(a)(2).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no
responses have been served and no meet and confer is required when a party does
not respond to discovery requests. All that need be shown in the moving papers
is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party,
that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been
served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
Here, Defendants contend that Plaintiff failed to respond to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, propounded by Dial on December 27, 2022. (Joseph
Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. 2.) 
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues it served code-compliant, verified responses on
February 21, 2023. (Hawatmeh Decl. ¶ 8, Exh. A.) However, Plaintiff does not
attach proof that the responses were verified on February 21, 2023. 
 
Therefore,
because responses have not been served, the motion to compel is granted.
 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendant Venerando Bautista’s motion to compel
further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, numbers 8.6–8.8, 11.1,
17.1, 20.3, 20.7, 20.8, and 20.11. Plaintiff shall serve further responses
within 10 days. 
 
The Court GRANTS Defendant Dial Transport Inc.’s motion to compel
initial responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. Plaintiff must serve
verified responses, without objections, within 10 days. 
 
The Court further GRANTS Defendants’ request for monetary sanctions
against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel in the reduced amount of $765. Said
monetary sanctions are to be paid to counsel for Defendants within 30 days of
the date of this order.
 
Defendants
to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.

The motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(b)(1).) “Unless notice of this motion is given

The Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal
Injury Hub Courts requires that the parties engage in an IDC. (See Order at ¶
9E.)
 
Special
Interrogatory, Set One, numbers 12–13 request information about health care
providers Plaintiff has sought treatment with five years prior to the incident
and also health insurance policy information at the time of the incident.[4] 
 
Plaintiff made
various objections, then responded: “Subject to and without waiving the
foregoing objection, Responding Party responds as follows: Plaintiff is in
process of gathering the information responsive to this Special Interrogatory.
Discovery and investigation are ongoing. Responding Party reserves the right to
supplement this response.” 
 
            In opposition, Plaintiff argues the
responses are code-compliant.[5]
The Court disagrees. The Court orders Plaintiff to serve a code-compliant
response to these interrogatories. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.220 (“(b) If an

Special
Interrogatory, Set One, Numbers 26–35 request information related to
Plaintiff’s loss of earnings claim.[6] 
 
Plaintiff
again made various objections, then stated: “Pursuant to Civ. Proc. Code §
2030.210, Responding Party elects to produce writings responsive to this
request that are in the possession or control of Responding Party, which are
attached as Exhibit “A” to Plaintiff’s responses to the Demand for
Identification and Production of Documents, Set 1, incorporated by reference
herein, served concurrently herewith. Discovery and investigation are ongoing.
Responding Party reserves the right to supplement this response.” 
 
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff has not produced any records relevant to the loss of
earnings claim. 
 
Plaintiff
is ordered to serve code-compliant responses to these interrogatories. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.220.)
 
Special
Interrogatory, Set One, Numbers 32–35 request Plaintiff’s gross income from
the years 2019 to 2022. 
 
Plaintiff
made various objections, then responded: “Subject to and without waiving the
foregoing objection, Responding Party responds as follows: Plaintiff is in
process of obtaining information responsive to this Special Interrogatory.
Discovery and investigation are ongoing. Responding Party reserves the right to
supplement this response.” 
 
Plaintiff
is ordered to serve code-compliant responses to these interrogatories,
including whether a reasonable and good faith effort was made to obtain the
information. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.220.)
 
Special
Interrogatory, Set One, number 53 asks: “State the date YOU first retained
an attorney regarding the INCIDENT.” 
 
Plaintiff
responded with various objections, then stated: “Subject to and without waiving
the foregoing objection, Responding Party responds as follows: Plaintiff does
not recall.” 
 
Plaintiff
is ordered to serve a code-compliant response to this interrogatory, including
whether a reasonable and good faith effort was made to obtain the information.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.220.)
