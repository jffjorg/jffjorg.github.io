TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


January
  4, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


20STCV31209




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Vacate Dismissal




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Israel Mendez, by and through his
  guardian ad litem, Crystal Spencer 




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed



 
BACKGROUND
 
On June 20, 2023, this case was called for an Order to Show Cause Re:
Dismissal (Settlement). Counsel for Plaintiff Israel Mendez, by and through his
guardian ad litem, Crystal Spencer (Plaintiff), did not appear. As a result,
the Court ordered the complaint dismissed without prejudice. (Minute Order
Dated 6/20/23.) 
 
On November 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to vacate the
dismissal. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473(b), the Court may relieve a party from a
dismissal taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.  This application must
be filed no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is
sought, and must contain an affidavit of fault demonstrating the moving party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
 
A mistake
is a basis for relief under section 473 when by reason of the mistake a party
failed to make a timely response.  Surprise occurs when a party is
unexpectedly placed in a position to his injury without any negligence of his
own. Excusable neglect is a basis for relief when the party has shown some
reasonable excuse for the default.  (Credit Managers Association of
California v. National Independent Business Alliance (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d
1166, 1173; Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892, 905.)  Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, the moving party bears the burden of
demonstrating an excusable ground, such as fraud or mistake, justifying a
court’s vacating a judgment.  (Basinger v. Roger & Wells (1990)
220 Cal.App.3d 16, 23–24.)   
 
Relief under
this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault;
otherwise, it is discretionary. (Id.) However mandatory relief is only
available when a party fails to oppose a dismissal motion (“which are
procedurally equivalent to a default”). (Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89
Cal.App.4th 603, 620.) The mandatory relief provision
does not apply to dismissals for “failure to prosecute [citations omitted], dismissals
for failure to serve a complaint within three years [citations omitted],
dismissals based on running of the statute of limitations [citations omitted],
and voluntary dismissals entered pursuant to settlement [citations omitted].”
(Id.) 
 
JUDICIAL
NOTICE
 
The Court grants Plaintiff’s requests for judicial notice pursuant to
Evidence Code section 452(d). 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Procedurally,
the present motion is timely because it was filed within six months after the
case was dismissed. The Declarations of Eric Canton and John Stenson state that
due to a miscommunication among counsel, the June 20, 2023 hearing was not
calendared. (Canton Decl. ¶ 3–6; Stenson Decl. ¶ 3–6.) A calendaring
error constitutes excusable neglect. (Nilsson v. City of Los Angeles
(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 976, 980.) Based on counsels’ declarations,
the Court grants the motion to vacate the dismissal. 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the dismissal.  
 
The Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re Dismissal (Settlement) for March
4, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
 
Plaintiff to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
