And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the plaintiff's untimely filing of an opposition and the defendant's request for further responses. The judge notes that the opposition was filed one day late, but will still consider it. The plaintiff argues in their Sur-Reply that they have waived their loss of earnings claim, but failed to make this argument in their initial opposition. Without proof or a declaration that the claim is waived, the plaintiff must provide further responses to numbers 8.6-8.8. The judge also denies the defendant's motion to compel further response to number 14, as it is not included in the Separate Statement. Finally, the judge notes that the plaintiff's declaration references an attachment, but no responses are attached as an exhibit, and the defendant's reply does not confirm that amended responses were served.
