And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the petition for minors compromise filed by Petitioner Angelica Alvarez on behalf of Claimant Juan Marchan, Jr. without prejudice. The petition does not meet the requirements, specifically regarding attachments, values, and clarification of reimbursement requests. The Court orders the Petitioner to include specific attachments, match values, and clarify the reimbursement request. The Petitioner must also provide a more detailed discussion of the factors in California Rules of Court, rule 7.955(b) in the attorney declaration. The proposed order must also attach attachment 8b(2). The Court will review the revised petition and may deny it again if the requirements are not met.
