And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the petition for minors' compromise by Petitioner Jonathan Hernandez Amaro on behalf of Claimant Alan Gio Hernandez. The Court denies the petition without prejudice. The petition was filed on behalf of a 10-year-old Claimant who allegedly suffered unspecified injuries in a motor vehicle accident. The Claimant did not receive medical treatment following the incident, and the Petitioner claims that the Claimant is now completely recovered. The Court requires a medical report or declaration from a parent verifying Claimant's current condition. The Petitioner is also ordered to provide a breakdown of the filing fees asserted as costs. Additionally, the Court approves 33.33% of the attorney fees requested by Petitioner, rather than the 40% requested. The Court orders the Petitioner to give notice.
