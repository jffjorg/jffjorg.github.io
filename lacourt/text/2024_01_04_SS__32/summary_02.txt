And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion for attorney fees and costs filed by the defendants, CalPortland Company, CalPortland Construction, and Homer Phillip Banks, Jr. The defendants are seeking $12,579.75 in attorney fees and costs related to their motion for summary judgment. The judge orders the plaintiffs, Guadalupe Del Carmen Andrade and Maria Andrade, and their counsel to pay this amount within 30 days. The judge's decision is based on the court's previous order granting the plaintiffs' motion to withdraw admissions, which was conditioned on the payment of attorney fees and costs. The judge finds that the amount requested by the defendants is reasonable and that the condition of paying attorney fees and costs is proper under the law.
