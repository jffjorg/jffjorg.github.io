```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the Plaintiff's motion to vacate and set aside the order sustaining Defendant's demurrer without leave to amend and resultant dismissal/judgment. The Plaintiff argued that the motion should be granted due to the Plaintiff's attorney's mistake in not calendaring the new hearing and opposition dates and error in filing an opposition to the Defendant's demurrer heard on February 15, 2024. However, the Court finds that the February 15, 2024 demurrer was sustained without leave on its merits, thereby rendering Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b) without application. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's counsel had the opportunity to argue against the demurrer on its merits on February 15, 2024.
