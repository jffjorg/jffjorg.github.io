  Case Number:  23LBCV01099    Hearing Date:   October 9, 2024    Dept:  S25 BackgroundOn June 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Borba Investment Realty, Inc. (“Defendant”), Charles B. Roselli, and Does 1 through 100. On October 25, 2023, Defendant filed a demurrer with a hearing date of June 11, 2024. On November 17, 2024, the Court, on its own motion, advanced the hearing date of the demurrer to February 15, 2024. (November 17, 2024 Minute Order.) On February 15, 2024, the Court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to Defendant. (February 15, 2024 Minute Order.) On March 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”). On March 14, 2024, the Court entered judgment and dismissed the action for Defendant with prejudice. (March 14, 2024 Judgment.) On March 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to vacate and set aside order sustaining demurrer without leave to amend and resultant dismissal/judgment.On June 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint (“SAC”), alleging the following causes of action:1. Violation of California Civil Code § 1942.4;2. Tortious Breach of the Warranty of Habitability;3. Private Nuisance;4. Business and Professions Code § 17200, et seq.;5. Negligence;6. Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment;7. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress;8. Negligence Per Se;9. Violation of Consumer Legal Remedies Act, California Civil Code § 1750, et seq.;10. California Fair Employment and Housing Act, Gov. Code § 12955, et seq.; and11. Violation of Long Beach Tenant Harassment Ordinance.Plaintiff alleges that this action arises out of Plaintiff’s alleged tenancy at Defendant Roselli’s property located at 535 W. Third Street, Unit 12, Long Beach, California (“Subject Property”). (SAC ¶ 1.) Plaintiff alleges he resided at the Subject Property from October 2018 to February 2023 and that it was unhabitable due to cockroaches, plumbing issues, weatherproofing and an inoperable electric garage door opener. (SAC ¶¶ 22, 25.) Plaintiff alleges that repair requests communicated to Defendant Roselli were ignored or only partially repaired. (SAC ¶¶ 33-35.) On July 31, 2024, Defendant Roselli filed an answer. On September 30, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition. As of October 7, 2024, no reply has been filed.Legal StandardCode Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b), provides that: “[t]he court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken…. Notwithstanding any other requirements of this section, the court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)Discussion“Section 473 cannot be used to remedy attorney mistakes, such as the failure to provide sufficient evidence in opposition to a summary judgment motion. There is nothing in section 473 to suggest it 'was intended to be a catch-all remedy for every case of poor judgment on the part of counsel which results in dismissal.' (Wiz Technology, Inc. v. Coopers & Lybrand (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1, 17, citations omitted.) “Mandatory relief is available only where the attorney failed adequately to oppose a motion to dismiss, not where the dismissal results from the attorney's conduct preceding the motion to dismiss. Section 473(b) is not ‘the perfect escape hatch from the dismissal statutes.’” (Graham v. Beers (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1656, 1661; Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2024) ¶ 5:300.20)Plaintiff moves the Court to vacate and set aside its February 15, 2024 Order sustaining Defendant’s demurrer without leave to amend and resultant dismissal/judgment. Plaintiff argues that the instant motion should be granted due to Plaintiff attorney’s mistake in not calendaring the new hearing and opposition dates and error in filing an opposition to the Defendant’s demurrer heard on February 15, 2024. Plaintiff counsel admits fault for the error and provides a copy of a proposed opposition to the demurrer. (See Partiyeli Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. 1.) Plaintiff also asserts that Defendant will not be prejudiced if the instant motion is granted.Defendant opposes the instant motion, contending that (1) the Court, on February 15, 2024, sustained the demurrer because of a “purely legal issue”, (2) Plaintiff’s counsel appeared at the hearing date of the demurrer and had the opportunity to argue the merits of the demurrer on February 15, 2024 and (3) Defendant will be prejudiced if the instant motion is granted. Moreover, Defendant points out that Plaintiff’s counsel has not explained how he happened to attend the February 15, 2024 hearing date if Plaintiff counsel’s office never calendared the dates from the new dates set at the November 17, 2024 Case Management Conference.No reply has been filed.Here, Plaintiff received notice that Defendant had filed a demurrer and received additional time to prepare and file an opposition to the demurrer when the Court continued the hearing date at the November 17, 2024 Case Management Conference. (Day Decl., ¶¶ 3, 4.) Moreover, even though the Court did not continue the hearing on the demurrer on February 15, 2024 per Plaintiff counsel’s request, the Court afforded Plaintiff counsel the opportunity to argue against the demurrer on its merits. (Day Decl., ¶¶ 8, 9.) On February 15, 2024, the Court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to Defendant on the grounds that Defendant is not the owner of the Subject Property and “each and every cause of action pled against [Defendant] . . . can only be pled against the owner, not manager, of the property”, finding it a “purely legal issue”. (February 15, 2024 Minute Order at p. 3.) The Court denies the instant motion because the February 15, 2024 demurrer was sustained without leave on its merits, thereby rendering Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b) without application.Tentative RulingPlaintiff’s motion to vacate and set aside order sustaining demurrer without leave to amend and resultant dismissal/judgment is denied.
