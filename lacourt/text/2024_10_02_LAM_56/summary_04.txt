And here is a brief summary in English text:

This is a Tentative Ruling in the case of Coleen L. Johnson vs. Sheldon Park Condominium Owners Association, et al. The Association has filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction seeking exclusive access to Unit 302 for up to 15 business days to make necessary repairs. The Court has considered the moving papers and has granted the Motion, issuing a Mandatory Preliminary Injunction as requested. The Association claims that Unit 302 owner Maria B. Rivera Henriquez has refused to allow repairs, citing concerns about safety and mental health challenges. The Court has determined that there is a high probability that the Association will prevail on the merits and that Johnson will continue to suffer damage to her own unit if the injunction is not issued.
