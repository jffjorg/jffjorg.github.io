Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton LLP (SMRH) to withdraw as counsel for Center Int'l Investments, Inc. (CII). The court has discretion on whether to allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the client. The court has found that the motion sets forth an adequate basis for withdrawal due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship between SMRH and CII. The court will hold an order to show cause regarding CII's representation on October 23, 2024, to discuss the status of mediation and the possible setting of trial.
