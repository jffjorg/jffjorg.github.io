And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary adjudication on the plaintiff's claims of harassment and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge found that there were triable issues of fact regarding the defendant's conduct, including allegations of harassment and discrimination based on the plaintiff's age and national origin, and that the defendant's conduct was severe and pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment. The judge also found that the plaintiff's claims of emotional distress were supported by evidence, including allegations of sleeplessness, crying, and feelings of humiliation, stress, and destruction. Therefore, the case will proceed to trial.
