(3) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing – Development

            On August 13, 2024,
Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton LLP (“SMRH”), counsel for Plaintiff
Center Int’l Investments, Inc. (“CII”), filed the instant Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel (the “Motion”), seeking to withdraw as counsel for CII.  On September 18, 2024, Defendant City of
Monterey Park (“City”) filed a Response to Plaintiff Center Int’l Investment’s
Counsel’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel and Request for Dismissal for
Failure to Engage in Mediation per Court’s Minute Order (“Response”).  SMRH filed a reply on September 24, 2024.
 
            The case has not been
set for trial.
 
DISCUSSION
The
court has discretion on whether to allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion
to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  Withdrawal is generally permitted unless there
is a compelling reason to continue the representation.  (Heple v. Kluge (1951) 104 Cal.App.2d
461, 462.)
 
The Motion is compliant with California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362.  In connection with
the Motion, SMRH declares that “[a] complete break down in the attorney client
relationship has occurred and resulted in the inability for Sheppard Mullin to
effectively participate in this case. This forces Sheppard Mullin to seek
withdrawal.”
 
In
its Response, the City does not oppose the Motion, but requests that the Court
dismiss the case for failure to pursue mediation, citing the Court’s July 31,
2024 Minute Order.  The July 31, 2024
Minute Order set a Non-Appearance Case Review for August 22, 2024, and ordered
that CII file a declaration by August 14, 2024, or the case would be dismissed
or sanctions would be issued.  In
response to the July 31, 2024 Minute Order, Paul Seeley, CII’s counsel, filed a
declaration on August 14, 2024 explaining that “[d]uring the month of June
2024, there was a complete breakdown in the attorney-client relationship
between Sheppard Mullin and CII.  This
resulted in the inability for Sheppard Mullin to effectively participate in
this case”, including the failure to agree on a mediation date.  (Declaration of Paul Seeley in Response to
Minute Order Dated July 31, 2024.)  The
Court accepts CII’s counsel’s explanation as sufficient to avoid the dismissal
of the case.
 
The
Court finds that the Motion sets forth an adequate basis for withdrawal.  The Court, therefore, GRANTS the Motion. The
Court will hold an OSC regarding CII’s representation on October 23, 2024 at
8:30 a.m. in this department.  At that
time, the Court will discuss the status of mediation and the possible setting
of trial.
 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 2nd day of October 2024
