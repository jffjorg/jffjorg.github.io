  CASE NO.:  22STCV36603
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Date: October 2, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
BACKGROUND
            In this eminent domain action, the City of Monterey Park (the “City”)
seeks to acquire property located at 1688 Garvey Avenue belonging to Center
Int’l Investments, Inc. (“CII”).   
             
            On August 19, 2024,
Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton LLP (“SMRH”), counsel for CII, filed the
instant Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (the “Motion”), seeking to withdraw as
counsel for CII.  The Motion is
unopposed. Trial in this action was taken
off-calendar based upon counsel’s representation that the parties intended to
mediate.
 
DISCUSSION
The
court has discretion on whether to allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion
to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the client.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  Withdrawal is
generally permitted unless there is a compelling reason to continue the
representation.  (Heple v. Kluge
(1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 461, 462.)
 
The Motion is compliant with California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362.  In connection with
the Motion, SMRH declares that “[a] complete break down in the attorney client
relationship has occurred and resulted in the inability for Sheppard Mullin to
effectively participate in this case. This forces Sheppard Mullin to seek
withdrawal.”  (Declaration in Support of Attorney’s
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed 8/19/2024.)
 
The
Court finds that the Motion sets forth an adequate basis for withdrawal.  The Court, therefore, GRANTS the Motion. Because
CII cannot represent itself, the Court will hold an OSC regarding CII’s
representation on October 23, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in this department.
 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
