Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrers filed by the County, LASD, and Sheriff, as well as the State, with leave to amend. The Judge concludes that the First Amended Complaint (FAC) is seriously flawed and fails to properly notify the defendants of the claims against them. The FAC lists fifty-two causes of action, but fails to separately set forth the particular causes of action and the defendant(s) against whom they are being asserted. The Judge declines to rule on the specific grounds raised by the demurring parties attacking the viability of certain causes of action, as Plaintiff has not identified what causes of action are asserted against a particular defendant. The Judge grants Plaintiff leave to amend the FAC by July 31, 2024, and failure to do so may result in the dismissal of the case. The motion to strike filed by the State is moot, as the demurrers have been sustained with leave to amend.
