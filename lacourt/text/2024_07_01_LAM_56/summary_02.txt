And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion for stay of proceedings or alternatively, to continue trial filed by the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District. The defendant is seeking a stay of the trial pending the resolution of a writ petition filed in the Second District Court of Appeal concerning the constitutionality of Assembly Bill 218. The judge notes that the writ petition relates to the same issue as the case at hand, but sees no reason to stay the proceedings. However, due to the proximity of the current trial date, the judge will continue the trial for 8 months to April 21, 2025, and advance the Final Status Conference to April 7, 2025.
