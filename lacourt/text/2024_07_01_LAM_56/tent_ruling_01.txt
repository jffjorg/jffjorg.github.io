BACKGROUND
            On August 30, 2023, Plaintiff Doe
Williams (“Plaintiff”) filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)
against Defendants State of California (“State”), County of Los Angeles
(“County”), Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (“LASD”), and County of Los
Angeles Sheriff James McDonnell (“Sheriff”), among other defendants
(collectively, “Defendants”).   The FAC asserts fifty-two (52) causes of
action arising out of a physical altercation with another inmate at the LASD’s
Men’s Central Jail, while the Plaintiff was in his wheelchair.            

 
            The County, LASD and the Sheriff
filed a demurrer on April 9, 2024.  On
April 15, 2024, the State also filed a demurrer and a motion to strike.
 
            Plaintiff has not filed any
opposition to the demurrers and motion to strike.
 
DISCUSSION
Legal Standard
            “The primary function of a pleading is to give the
other party notice so that it may prepare its case [citation], and a defect in
a pleading that otherwise properly notifies a party cannot be said to affect
substantial rights.”  (Harris v. City
of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.)  “A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of
the factual allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v. Bank of America, N.A. (2017)
9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.)  The Court looks
to whether “the complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action
or discloses a complete defense.” (Id.)  The Court does not “read passages from a
complaint in isolation; in reviewing a ruling on a
demurrer, we read the complaint ‘as a whole and its
parts in their context.’ [Citation.]” (West v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 804.)  The Court “assume[s] the truth
of the properly pleaded factual allegations, facts
that reasonably can be inferred from those
expressly pleaded and matters of which judicial notice
has been taken.” (Harris, supra, 56 Cal.4th p. 240.) “The
court does not, however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions or
conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell v. Sharp
Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350,
1358.)
 
            As a general matter, in a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  “The only issue a demurrer is concerned with
is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)
 
Where
a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on
the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.)  However, “[i]f there is any reasonable
possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to
sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.”  (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
Demurrer
            In their respective demurrers, the
County, LASD and the Sheriff, as well as the State, have objected to the FAC on
the basis of uncertainty regarding the causes of action and factual allegations
in the FAC.  They argue that the pleading
is ambiguous, unintelligible and fails to state a cause of action.  Additionally, the demurring parties have
raised specific grounds challenging the individual causes of action listed in
the FAC.
 
As
an initial matter, the Court notes that the FAC is seriously flawed.  Although it lists fifty-two (52) causes of
action in the caption, the body of the complaint fails to separately set forth
the particular causes of action asserted by Plaintiff.  The FAC does not identify the nature of the
claims or the defendant(s) against whom the specific causes of action are being
asserted as required by California
Rules of Court, rule 2.112.  The FAC
therefore does not properly notify Defendants of the claims against them so as
to effectively respond to Plaintiff’s allegations.  Thus, at this time, the Court declines to rule on
the specific grounds raised by the demurring parties attacking the viability of
certain causes of action, since Plaintiff has not even identified what causes
of action are asserted against a particular defendant.  (Craig v. City of Los Angeles, 44 Cal. App. 2d
71, 111 P.2d 977 (1941) (Complaint which attempted to state numerous causes of
action in very loose manner without any attempt at separately stating them was
demurrable on ground that several causes of action were improperly united and
not separately stated, and on ground of unintelligibility).) 
 
Accordingly,
because Plaintiff fails to state a cause of action and the FAC is uncertain,
the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer with leave to amend.  Plaintiff has until July 31, 2024 to amend the
FAC.  Failure to do so may result in the
dismissal of this case.
 
Motion to Strike
The
court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any
pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436(a).)  The
court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Id., § 436(b).) The grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading has
irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in
conformity with laws. (Id., § 436.) The grounds for moving to strike
must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Id.,
§ 437.)
 
            The State moves to strike portions
of the FAC pertaining to claims for punitive damages, exemplary damages, treble
damages, attorney’s fees, and pre-judgment interest against the State.
Because the
demurrers above have been sustained with leave to amend, the motion to strike
is MOOT. 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
