Legal
Standard
 
If a nonparty disobeys a deposition subpoena, the
subpoenaing party may seek a court order pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
(CCP) section 1987.1 compelling the nonparty to comply with the subpoena within
60 days after completion of the deposition record. (CCP § 2025.480(b); see also
UnzippedApparel, LLC v. Bader (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 123, 127.) The motion must be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration. (CCP § 2025.480(b).) 
 
Under CCP section 1987.1(a), “If a subpoena requires … the production
of … documents, [or] electronically stored information …, the court, upon
motion reasonably made by any person [including a party] … may make an order
quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it
upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective
orders.” The court may also “make any other order as may be appropriate to
protect the person from unreasonable or oppressive demands, including
unreasonable violations of the right of privacy of the person.” (CCP § 1987.1(a).)

 
Sanctions are available under both CCP § 1987.2 and CCP §
2025.480. CCP § 1987.2 states: “[T]he court may in its discretion award the
amount of the reasonable expenses incurred in making or opposing the motion,
including reasonable attorney’s fees, if the court finds the motion was made or
opposed in bad faith or without substantial justification . . .” CCP §
2025.480(j) states: “The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel an answer or production,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” Further, per CCP § 2020.240, “[a] deponent who disobeys a
deposition subpoena in any manner described in¿subdivision (c) of Section
2020.220¿may be punished for contempt under Chapter 7 (commencing with¿Section
2023.010) without the necessity of a prior order of court directing compliance
by the witness. The deponent is also subject to the forfeiture and the payment
of damages set forth in¿Section 1992.” 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Plaintiffs Sanaz Afsar, MSK, AK, and Saied Kashani move for an
order compelling third-party Vollmer-Gray Laboratories Inc. to produce all
documents responsive to the subpoena for business records issued on April 17,
2024. Plaintiffs also seek monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,450 against Vollmer-Gray.
Plaintiffs contend that Vollmer-Gray failed to respond or object to the subpoena
and thereby waived all objections. 
 
Plaintiffs
fail to show proper service of the third-party deposition subpoena. A business
records subpoena requires personal service of the subpoena to any officer,
director, custodian of records, or to any agent or employee authorized by the
organization to accept service of a subpoena. (CCP sec. 2020.220(b)(2).) On
April 19, 2024, Plaintiffs served the subject subpoena on Vollmer-Gray for
production of Vollmer-Gray's report (if any) and communications, photos, etc.
of the fire vehicle. (Kashani Decl., Ex. A.) The server, Amir Akbari, provides
a declaration which shows he hand-served the person at the front “apparently in
charge of the office” at Vollmer-Gray's address. (Akbari Decl.) However, the
person “apparently in charge of the office” is not a proper person to serve personally
on behalf of the corporation. As noted above, the personal service must be on a
person authorized by the organization to accept service of a subpoena.
The record contains no evidence that the “lady” was authorized to accept service.
Further, the record does not suggest she was an officer, director, or custodian
of records. In light of this, Plaintiff fails to show proper service. Therefore,
the court lacks jurisdiction over third party Vollmer-Gray.
 
The
Court further notes that the discovery was premature, and gave
a too-short date for production. (CCP 2020.410; 2025.210 et seq.)
 
Accordingly,
the motion is DENIED.
