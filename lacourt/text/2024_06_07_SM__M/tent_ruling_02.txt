Holdings LLC, et al., v. CAS Construction, et al.
CASE NO.:                21SMCV01401
MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Compliance/Production
HEARING DATE:   6/7/2024
 
Legal
Standard
If a party permits inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of
documents in response to a request for production of documents, but thereafter
fails to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in accordance
with that party's statement of compliance, the demanding party may move for an
order compelling compliance. (CCP § 2031.320(a).) The court “shall” impose a
monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel compliance with a demand, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (CCP §
2031.320(b).)
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Plaintiff
Haig Tacorian moves the Court for an order compelling Defendant City of Los
Angeles (“City”) and Defendant City of Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power (“DWP”) (collectively, “Defendants”) to comply and produce all documents
responsive to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents (Sets One) Nos.
21-23, 28-32, and 34-56 within 10 days. (CCP § 2031.320.)
 
On
December 22, 2023, Plaintiff propounded each Defedant certain Requests for
Production of Documents (Set One), which consisted of 56 requests. (Cowles Decl.,,
Exs. A, B.) On March 15, 2024, following meet and confer efforts, Defendants provided
supplemental responses, agreeing to allow inspection of the documents
responsive to Request Nos. 21-23, 28-32, and 34-56. (Id., Exs. G, H.) There is no
dispute that Defendants agreed to provide the responsive documents. Plaintiff
met and conferred regarding the outstanding production, but received no
response. (Id., ¶¶ 8-9.) As of April 24, 2024, Defendants have not produced a
single responsive document. (Id., ¶ 9.) 
 
Defendants
do not provide a reason why compliance with their statement should not be
compelled. They assert that this motion fails to meet the requirements of a
motion to compel further responses. However, this is not such a motion. Defendants
also raise issues regarding the facts of the underlying dispute, which are not
relevant to this motion to compel compliance. Defendants admit that they are in
the process of providing documents “as quickly as it can given staffing and
budgetary limitations” at the City. With this statement, they admit that they
owe production. Moreover, Defendants neither cite any evidence of their
staffing issues or budget, nor any authority which shows that their staffing
and budget issues justify their failure to comply with their statement of
compliance. For instance, Defendants do not show that production would be
overly burdensome or oppressive. Defendants also do not explain their
reasonable efforts to comply in order to justify their rate of production. As such, there is no reason to deny the motion. For the same
reasons, Defendants are also subject to sanctions. 
 
Accordingly, the motions to compel compliance are GRANTED. Production
must be completed within 15 days of this order. 
 
Plaintiff request $9,270.00 in sanctions against Defendants.
As a result of Defendants’ failure to comply with their discovery obligations, Counsel
claims 9 hours preparing the two motions to compel and the supporting papers
($475.00 x 9 = $4,275.00), 1.5 hours to review and revise the moving papers
($595.00 x 1.5 = $892.50), an anticipated 3 hours to review any oppositions and
to prepare replies ($475.00 x 3 = $1,425.00), an anticipated 4.5 hours to
prepare for the hearing and to attend the hearing in Santa Monica ($595.00 x
4.5 = $2,677.50). (Cowles Decl., ¶ 11.) Considering this record, the court is
not inclined to grant the full sanctions request. The motions are relatively
routine motions to compel compliance. The court finds that a reasonable fee in
this instance would be $4,217.50, accounting for 7 hours of attorney time at
$475 per hour, and 1.5 hours of attorney time at $595 per hour, plus $120.00 in
costs. Accordingly, sanctions are imposed against Defendants the City of Los
Angeles and the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, jointly and
severally, in the amount of $4,337.50. Sanctions are to be paid within 30 days.
