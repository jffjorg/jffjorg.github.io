Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by General Motors (GM) in a lawsuit brought by Perla Alamillo. The lawsuit alleges that GM's conduct, including fraudulent concealment and breach of warranty, caused damages to the vehicle purchased by Alamillo.

The judge has sustained GM's demurrer, meaning that the lawsuit's allegations do not state a valid cause of action. The judge has also determined that the motion to strike is moot, as the demurrer has been sustained.

The judge has concluded that the lawsuit's allegations of fraudulent concealment and breach of warranty are insufficient to state a valid cause of action. The judge has also determined that the economic loss rule bars the lawsuit's claims, as the alleged injuries were within the contemplation of the parties at the time they entered into the sales contract.

The judge has ordered GM to give notice of the tentative ruling and has granted leave to amend the lawsuit. The judge has also emphasized that the argument for punitive damages as to fraud are predicated on the same arguments made in the demurrer, and that the motion to strike is moot.
