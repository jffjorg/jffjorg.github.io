And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies defendant Dorfman's motion for an undertaking for costs, which would require plaintiff Hale to post a bond of $47,546.95. The defendant argues he has a reasonable possibility of obtaining a judgment in his favor, citing the opinion of expert witness Dr. Garabedian. However, the plaintiff argues that requiring a bond would deprive her of her ability to bring the suit, as she is indigent and receives Social Security benefits. The court may waive the bond requirement if the plaintiff is indigent, citing Alshafie v. Lallande (2009). The judge rules that requiring a bond in these circumstances would be contrary to the California Code of Civil Procedure.
