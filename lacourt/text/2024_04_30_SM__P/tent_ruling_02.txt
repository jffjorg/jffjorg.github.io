Estate Investment v. Ann Turkel, Case No. 23SMCV04805
Hearing Date April
30, 2024
Defendant Ann
Turkel’s Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint
 
In this unlawful
detainer failure to pay rent action, defendant Turkel demurs to the first
amended complaint, arguing plaintiff landlord seeks eviction due to termination
of a fixed term lease, which defendant alleges is not a proper basis for
eviction under the Tenant Protection Act, para. 7(b). This is similar to the
argument defendant raised in her unsuccessful motion to quash.
 
Plaintiff seeks
possession due to defendant’s alleged failure to pay rent and failure to vacate
upon expiration of a properly served three-day notice. 
 
For purposes of
demurrer, the court must treat as true the complaint’s allegations. The court
must construe liberally the claims made by the complaint. 
 
Plaintiff argues
the unlawful detainer claim fails because “[m]ere expiration of lease is not
just-cause under the Tenant Protection Act,” so the summons did not confer
jurisdiction upon the court. 
 
The underlying
unlawful detainer action is properly pleaded via a form complaint. The first
amended complaint is not based on “mere expiration of lease,” as defendant
argues. Rather, it is based on the failure to pay rent, which constitutes just
cause under the Tenant Protection Act. FAC ¶19. OVERRULED. Defendant to answer
within 5 court days.
