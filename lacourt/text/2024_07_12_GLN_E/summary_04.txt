And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is to deny the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories 45-48. The defendant has justified its objections to the interrogatories. However, the court will hear argument from the parties since the requests were difficult to decipher. The judge notes that the plaintiff's separate statement did not provide sufficient information for the court to understand each request at issue. The judge also notes that the defendant's argument that the requests are not limited to a specific claim or repair, to any specific or alleged malfunction, problem or concern, or to the allegations in the plaintiff's complaint seems to justify the defendant's objections on irrelevancy and overbreadth. The judge will hear argument on sanctions, as the plaintiff has requested monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,695.00 against the defendant Ford Motor Company and its attorney of record.
