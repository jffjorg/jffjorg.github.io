ANALYSIS
On
9/15/2023, the Court granted HSBC’s motion deeming admitted the truth of the
matters specified in requests for admission, set one, propounded on Tracey L.
Baumert because Plaintiff did not provide responses to the RFAs.
On March 22, 2024, this Court granted Plaintiff’s
motion to set aside/vacate the dismissal.
Now, Plaintiff seeks withdrawal of her admissions that
were deemed admitted on September 15, 2023.
CCP § 2033.300
“A
party may withdraw or amend an admission made in response to a request for
admission only on leave of court granted after notice to all parties.” (CCP §
2033.300(a).)
“The court may permit withdrawal or amendment of an
admission only if it determines that the admission was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and that the party who obtained the
admission will not be substantially prejudiced in maintaining that party’s
action or defense on the merits.” (CCP § 2033.300(b).)
Baumert Declaration
Plaintiff
argues that failing to respond to the RFAs, and thus the motion to deem
admitted being granted, was a result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.
Plaintiff’s provides the declaration of Tracey Baumert
which states in relevant part:
2. From on or about September 15, 2022 to
February 28, 2024, I was representing myself, in pro per in this action and/or
attorney Mark Goodfriend has represented me on one or more occasions under a
Notice of Limited Scope Representation. Because of illness and unemployment
(see below) and because I am not familiar with or knowledgeable about the law
or legal procedures, even with Mr. Goodfriend’s assistance to a limited extent
until he substituted in on February 28, 2024, which he mostly provided and is
providing to me without charge, Defendant’s requests for admission were
admitted. 
3. Although I apparently received
Defendant’s Requests for Admission in or about April 2023 and Defendant’s
Motion that Requests for Admission be deemed admitted in or about July 2023, I
did not understand that I needed to respond to them or how to do so. 
4. Starting in June 2023 and continuing
for several months, I was in and out of the hospital and suffered and have
continued to suffer from serious health issues, including bleeding ulcers,
gallstones, liver issues that might require a liver transplant as soon as early
2024, breathing issues, jaundice and my losing about 60 pounds over about 2
months (about a third of my body weight). In addition to debilitating health
issues, I have been unemployed and have had substantially no income since at
least about April of last year due to strikes by writers and actors – I work in
the entertainment industry – which has multiplied the stress I have been under.
Although the strikes ended in or about November 2023, I have still not been
able to return to work. Also, in or about early December 2023, I got Covid for
the first time, and did not recover quickly. 
5. I also had been sick starting on or
about August 31, 2023, and was hospitalized from September 8 to 15, 2023 (as
reflected by Exhibit 1 hereto), the date of the hearing where the court granted
Defendant’s Motion that Requests for Admission be deemed admitted. I did not
attend that hearing both because I was hospitalized and because I was not even
aware of it.
6. Attached hereto as Exhibit 2 are
verified responses to Defendant’s Requests for Admission that I request that
the Court allow me to use in this action.
(Baumert Decl. ¶¶ 2-6.)
Dailey Declaration
In
Opposition, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not demonstrated mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
Defendants submit the
declaration of its counsel, Steven M. Dailey. In relevant part, the Dailey
declaration states:
2. On April 12, 2023, on behalf of HSBC,
my office served written discovery including First Sets of Requests for
Production, Special Interrogatories, Form Interrogatories and Requests for
Admission upon Plaintiff TRACEY L. BAUMERT and Plaintiff’s counsel, Mark E.
Goodfriend, who has appeared for her on a limited basis at various times in
this case. 
3. Plaintiff’s responses to the discovery
were due on May 15, 2023. Plaintiff did not provide responses by that date. 
4. On May 30, 2023, I provided an
extension for Plaintiff to respond to the outstanding discovery up until and
including June 14, 2023. 
5. On June 21, 2023, I sent correspondence
via email to Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, Mark E. Goodfriend, requesting
the responses, without objections, and all requested documents, no later than
June 28, 2023. 
6. Despite these efforts, my office did
not receive the discovery responses or responses to the Requests for
Admissions. On July 12, 2023, I caused Motions to Compel/Deem Requests Admitted
to be filed and served relating to the deficient discovery. The hearing on the
Motions to Compel/Deem Requests Admitted was scheduled for September 15, 2023. 
7. Loan Defendants also filed an Ex Parte
Application to Continue Trial to be heard on September 15, 2023, requesting a
continuance of the February 20, 2024 trial date.
8. On September 15, 2023, the Court
granted Defendants’ Motions to Compel and attendant requests for monetary
sanctions. The Court vacated certain dates, including the then-scheduled
February 20, 2024 trial date. The Court set a hearing on an Order to Show Cause
Re Dismissal for Plaintiff’s failure to prosecute for October 9, 2023, at 10:00
a.m. in Department “E” of the above-captioned Court. The Court ruled that if
Plaintiff fails to appear at the October 9, 2023 hearing, the Court may dismiss
the matter. On September 19, 2023, I caused a Notice of Ruling on Motions to
Compel/Deem Requests Admitted and Ex Parte Application to Continue Trial to be
filed and served on Plaintiff and her counsel Mark E. Goodfriend. 
9. Plaintiff did not appear at the October
9, 2023 hearing that the Court scheduled on September 15, 2023. At the October
9, 2023 hearing, the Court ordered Plaintiff’s Third Amended Complaint
dismissed, without prejudice. 
10. On December 21, 2023, HSBC filed an
Unlawful Detainer Complaint, Case No. 23STUD16481 seeking possession of the
Property. 
11. On March 22, 2024, the Court set aside
the October 9, 2023 dismissal. 
12. On March 28, 2024, a Judgment was
entered in favor of HSBC and against Plaintiff TRACEY BAUMERT in the unlawful
detainer case. 
13. On April 1, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel
Mark Goodfriend and I met and conferred about the case, including the
outstanding discovery. Mr. Goodfriend represented that he would provide
answers, without objection, to the Special Interrogatories, Form Interrogatories
and Requests for Production and produce all responsive documents no later than
April 17, 2024. 
14. More than two months after the
dismissal was set aside, on May 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served the
instant Motion for Withdrawal of Deemed Admissions and served the proposed
Responses. 
15. To date, Plaintiff has not served the
remaining discovery responses despite Mr. Goodfriend’s representation that they
would be provided by April 17, 2024. 
16. The Property at issue in this case
sold at a trustee’s sale on October 4, 2019, reverting to HSBC.
17. Plaintiff’s disregard of the discovery
rules impedes HSBC’s rights in this case. It has been unable to obtain
Plaintiff’s substantive responses and documents relating to the facts she claim
support her causes of action. It is unable to frame a summary judgment motion
or prepare for trial absent responsive discovery. 
18. Plaintiff’s dilatory inaction has been
prejudicial and costly to HSBC. Because of the non-responses, HSBC has filed
the Motions to Compel, met and conferred, had many communications and provided
extensions, all incurring substantial costs and fees relating to discovery
served in April 2023.
(Dailey Decl. ¶ 18.)
TENTATIVE RULING
“The
court may permit withdrawal or amendment of an admission only if it determines
that the admission was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect, and that the party who obtained the admission will not be
substantially prejudiced in maintaining that party’s action or defense on the
merits.” (CCP § 2033.300(b).)
“Section
2033.300 eliminates undeserved windfalls obtained through requests for
admission and furthers the policy favoring the resolution of lawsuits on the
merits.” (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th
1403, 1418.)
Further:
The statutory language “mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect” (§ 2033.300, subd. (b)) is identical to
some of the language used in section 473, subdivision (b). Section
473, subdivision (b) states that a court may *1419 “relieve a
party ... from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against
him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect.” The use of identical terms in two different statutes serving similar
purposes suggests that the Legislature intended those terms to have the same
meaning in both statutes.
(New Albertsons, Inc.
v. Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1418-1419.)
Additionally:
The trial court's discretion in ruling on
a motion to withdraw or amend an admission is not unlimited, but must be
exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner that serves
the interests of justice. Because the law strongly favors trial and
disposition on the merits, any doubts in applying section
2033.300 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking
relief. Accordingly, the court's discretion to deny a motion under the
statute is limited to circumstances where it is clear that the mistake,
inadvertence, or *1421 neglect was inexcusable, or where it is
clear that the withdrawal or amendment would substantially prejudice the party
who obtained the admission in maintaining that party's action or defense on the
merits.
(New Albertsons, Inc.
v. Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1420-1421.)
The court may permit
withdrawal or amendment of an admission only if it determines that the
admission was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect
Here, the Court does not
find that Plaintiff demonstrated the admissions were the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
The Court’s primary
concern is the apparent unjustifiable delay in the Plaintiff seeking this
relief.
            
Party who obtained the
admission will not be substantially prejudiced in maintaining that party’s
action or defense on the merits
Here, the Court does not find that the party who
obtained the admission will not be substantially prejudiced in maintaining that
party’s action or defense on the merits.
Overall Tentative Ruling
Plaintiff’s
motion to withdraw admissions of Defendant HSBC Banks Requests for Admissions
is DENIED.
“The court may permit withdrawal or amendment of an
admission only if it determines that the admission was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and that the party who obtained the
admission will not be substantially prejudiced in maintaining that party’s
action or defense on the merits.” (CCP § 2033.300(b).)
TENTATIVE RULING MJOP
On
1/9/2023 a Third Amended Complaint (TAC) was filed. Although the caption of the
TAC indicates there are three causes of action: (1) Wrongful Foreclosure, (2)
Recission/Cancellation, and (3) Declaratory Relief, the body of the TAC alleges
a fourth cause of action titled “Fourth Cause of Action for Damages for
Wrongful Foreclosure.”
On 3/17/2023, the Court ruled on Defendants’ demurrer
to the TAC. The Court overruled the demurrer as to the first and third causes
of action. The Court sustained with leave to amend the second cause of action,
but Plaintiff never filed a fourth amended complaint. Further, as to the fourth
cause of action in the TAC, the Court explained how the Defendants did not
demur to the fourth cause of action, and that the Court considers the
allegations of the “fourth cause of action” 
to be part of the first cause of action.
Moving Defendants here, the same Defendants that
Opposed the motion to withdraw admissions, now move for judgment on the
pleadings to the remaining causes of action in the TAC, the first, third, and
fourth causes of action.
The Court will hear argument.
