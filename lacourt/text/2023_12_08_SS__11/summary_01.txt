And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the California State Controller's Office's motion for judgment on the pleadings in a case involving allegations of overcharging by the Los Angeles County Recorder. The Controller claims that it is immune from suit under Government Code section 815, but the judge finds that this section does not apply to the refund and conversion claims. The judge also denies the Controller's motion to dismiss the injunctive relief claim, finding that it states a valid claim.

The judge grants the Controller's motion in part, finding that the Los Angeles County Recorder is an indispensable party and that Plaintiff should be allowed to amend the complaint to add allegations regarding sections 12410, 12418, and 12422.5(a). The judge also denies the Controller's motion to possess the alleged overcharges, finding that this is a factual issue.

The judge notes that the possession issue is a factual issue and that Plaintiff should be allowed to add allegations regarding sections 12410, 12418, and 12422.5(a). The judge also finds that the Los Angeles County Recorder is an indispensable party and that Plaintiff should be allowed to add allegations regarding sections 12410, 12418, and 12422.5(a).
