The Controller is the only named Defendant. 
The 58 county recording offices are not named.

CSAC and CRAC argue that Plaintiff’s construction is incorrect.  (See Amicus Brief, pp. 5-9.)  The Court declines to analyze the
argument.  The Controller does not
contest Plaintiff’s interpretation in the motion (see Motion, pp. 9-15 [merely
arguing (1) immunity, (2) that injunctive relief is unavailable, (3) that
Plaintiff failed to join an indispensable party, and (4) that Plaintiff fails
to allege that the Controller possesses the alleged overcharges]; see also
4/17/23 Ruling Re: Demurrer to First Amended Complaint, p. 2 [stating that the
Controller “does not challenge Gateway’s interpretation of section 27388.1”]),
and it cannot raise the issue for the first time in reply.  (See Reply, pp. 11-12.)  In terms of the interpretation question, the
amicus brief goes beyond the issues proffered in the motion.
