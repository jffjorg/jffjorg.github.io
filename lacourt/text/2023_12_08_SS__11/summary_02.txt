And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Gateway, the plaintiff, and has decided not to analyze the argument presented by CSAC and CRAC, amici curiae, regarding the interpretation of section 27388.1. The Controller, the sole named defendant, has not contested Gateway's interpretation of the section and cannot raise the issue for the first time in reply. The judge has declined to consider the amicus brief's argument on interpretation, as it goes beyond the issues presented in the motion. The ruling sets the stage for the upcoming court hearing, where the parties will present their arguments and evidence to the judge.
