And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has ruled that Dacheng's demurrer is sustained, with 15 days leave to amend, as to the first and second causes of action. The Court does not consider Dacheng's demurrer to the third cause of action. The Court has reviewed the allegations made by Cross-Complainants and has determined that they have failed to adequately state a claim for fraud or conspiracy against Dacheng. The Court has also determined that Dacheng's belief that Cross-Complainants signed the Sales Contracts is not a fraudulent misrepresentation, but rather a question of breach of contract. The Court has granted Cross-Complainants leave to amend to clarify their allegations and address the uncertainty surrounding the forgery of the documents.
