  Date:  May 20, 2024




 
Plaintiff’s
motion to vacate the dismissal, reinstate this case, and enter a money judgment
is GRANTED. 
 
            On
5/15/2023, Plaintiff UTF Enterprises, LLC filed suit against International
Developers and Engineering Group, Inc. dba IDEG Construction, International
Government Services, Inc dba IDEG Construction, IDEG Supply LLC dba IDEG
Construction, alleging unlawful detainer. 
 
            On

            Now,
Plaintiff seeks an order vacating the 7/25/2023 dismissal, reinstating this
action, and entering a money judgment against Defendants, and each of them, in
the total amount of $80,175.86 ($68,015.86 remaining principal balance owing +
$12,040.00 attorneys’ fees + $120.00 costs.) 
 
Discussion  
 
            Plaintiff
argues that Defendants have breached the settlement agreement and that they are
entitled to judgment under CCP section 664.6. 
 
Section
2.5 of the Agreement provides in relevant part as follows: 
 
2.5 UTF
agrees to refrain from entering the judgment pursuant to said STIPULATION FOR
MONEY and refrain from collection activities so long as the IDEG PARTIES pay

$15,000.00 on or before June 30, 2023; 
 
2.5.3
$10,000.00 on or before the last day of each month (unless the last day is a
Saturday, Sunday or holiday, then such payment is due on the next business day)
commencing July 31 through November 30, 2023); and 
 
2.5.4
$59,710.86 on or before December 31, 2023. 
 
2.6 All

(Emphasis added)
 
                        Section

4.
COURT RETENTION OF JURISDICTION AND PROCEDURE.
 
4.1 The PARTIES
shall also execute a stipulation for dismissal of the ACTION pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure Section 664.6 with the Court retaining jurisdiction to
enforce the terms of this AGREEMENT and/or the STIPULATION FOR MONEY (the
“STIPULATION TO DISMISS”). The PARTIES also authorize their counsel to execute
the STIPULATION TO DISMISS the ACTION pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
Section 664.6 with the Court retaining jurisdiction to enforce the terms of
this AGREEMENT and/or the STIPULATION FOR MONEY.
 
4.2 UTF shall
file the STIPULATION FOR POSSESSION and have judgment entered pursuant to said
stipulation if IDEG PARTIES have failed to comply with any one of the following
Sections above: 2.3.1., 2.3.2, and/or 2.3.3.
 
4.3 After
IDEG PARTIES have vacated the SUBJECT PROPERTY (whether by compliance with the
terms of this AGREEMENT or pursuant to the filing of the STIPULATION FOR
POSSESSION, whatever the case may be), UTF shall file the STIPULATION TO
DISMISS. (Emphasis added)
 
Section 17,
page 5 of the Agreement also provides: 
 
ATTORNEY’S
FEES. In the event of any action, suit or other proceeding concerning the
interpretation, validity, performance or breach of any of the terms and
conditions of this AGREEMENT, the prevailing PARTY shall recover reasonable
attorney’s fees, costs and expenses incurred in each and every such action,
suit or other proceeding, including any and all appeals and/or petitions
relating thereto.
 
On June 16,
2023, the parties executed the Stipulation For Money which provided in relevant
part as follows: 
 
1. Defendants
agree to pay UTF $126,015.86 representing the stipulated balance due as is more
fully set forth in the parties’ move-out agreement dated June 9, 2023 (the
“Agreement”).
 
2. Defendants
do not dispute the amount due being $126,015.86, and further acknowledge that
the amount of $126,015.86 is due and owing. 
 
3. Defendants
agree that a judgment may be rendered against them, jointly and severally, in
the amount of $126,015.86 plus interest, costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees
which accrue, less credit for payments tendered by Defendants in accordance
with the Agreement. 
 
4. Judgment
shall be entered on an ex parte basis upon the filing of a declaration by UTF
or UTF’s attorneys if Defendants fail to make payments in a timely manner
pursuant to the Agreement. 
 
5. Defendants
waive their right to a hearing upon the entry of judgment and notice of the
application for entry of judgment, as set forth in Rooney v. Vermont
Investments (1973) 10 Cal.3d 351, 110 Cal.Rptr. 353. 
 
            The
Court entered this stipulation to dismiss on September 25, 2023. 
 
As such,
under the term and conditions of the Agreement, among other things, the IDEG
Parties agreed to vacate the Property on or before June 26, 2023 and make
certain payments to UTF for rent owing in the amount of $126,015.86. In
exchange for the same, UTF agreed to file a dismissal without prejudice of the
Action with the Court retaining jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the
Agreement under Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6.
 
Plaintiff
submitted evidence that the IDEG Parties have only paid $58,000.00 since June
2023 towards the Payments Owing despite the total amount due and owing December
31, 2023. No payments have been made since January, 2024, despite repeated
demand and modifying the repayment schedule to accommodate UTF.
 
In
opposition, Defendants do not dispute their failure to abide. Rather, they
request a continuance given that “Defendants reasonably anticipate one or
various liquidity events that would permit them to pay off the balance to occur
within the next ninety (90) days.” (Opp., 1:9-11.) 
 
However,
noticeably absent from Defendants’ brief opposition is any legal authority
which would allow the Court to grant the requested relief. (“This failure to
cite pertinent legal authority is enough reason to reject the argument”); Akins
v. State of California (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1, 50, 71 (contention waived
by failure to cite legal authority). Indeed, Defendants’ opposition does not
include a citation to a single case. 
 
Defendants do
not dispute that they are in clear breach of the Settlement Agreement, and that
the Settlement Agreement sets forth clear provisions as to what is to happen in
the event of breach. Defendants’ argument that they should be spared the
consequences of their breach, and be granted a continuance based on a belief
that they will soon have the available funds, needed to be supported by legal
authority and analysis showing that such relief could be granted. 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the dismissal, reinstate this
case, and enter a money judgment is granted. 
 
 
 
It is so ordered.
