And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge, Michael E. Whitaker, denied the petition to compel arbitration filed by WIB Holdings LLC (Petitioner) against Kristi Pinocchio (Defendant). The Petitioner seeks to compel arbitration of a dispute arising from a rental agreement. The judge found that the Petitioner failed to demonstrate the existence of a valid and binding arbitration agreement between the parties. The judge also noted that the Petitioner's belated decision to sign the arbitration agreement did not demonstrate a mutual intent to arbitrate at the time the agreement was signed. As a result, the judge denied the petition and vacated the Case Management Conference set for June 27, 2024, and dismissed the action with prejudice.
