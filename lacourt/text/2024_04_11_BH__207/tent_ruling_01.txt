MOTIONS
 
            Plaintiff Allstate Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) moves to deem admitted the matters specified in Requests for
Admission, set one (RFA) propounded to Defendant Onsite Complete Plumbing and
Drain, individually and dba Chino Standard, Inc. (“Defendant”) and for monetary
sanctions.   The motion is unopposed. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
           
Pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (a), “[i]f a party to whom requests
or admission are directed fails to serve a timely response . . .  [t]he party to whom the requests for
admission are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product[.]”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)  Where a party fails to respond to
requests for admissions, the propounding party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
 
1.    
RFA 
 
Here, Plaintiff electronically served Defendant the RFA on November 29,
2023.  (Vales Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. A.)  Thirty days following November 29, 2023 is
December 29, 2023, and electronic service extends Defendant’s time to respond
by two court days (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).)  Monday, January 1 was a court holiday, thus,
the responses were due no later than January 3, 2024.  
 
On January 12, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendant’s counsel
to meet and confer, requesting that Defendant serve verified responses, without
objections, by Thursday, January 18, 2024. 
(Vales Decl. ¶¶ 6-7 and Ex. B.)  Plaintiff
did not receive a response.  (Vales Decl.
¶¶ 8-9.)  As of the date the motion was
filed, Plaintiff had still not received any responses to the RFA.  (Vales Decl. ¶ 9.)
 
Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant has failed to serve timely
responses to the RFA.
 
2.    
Monetary Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions in connection with the motion.
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under [Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010, et seq.] on the party or attorney, or both,
whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated
this motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (c).)  
 
Thus, the Court will impose monetary sanctions against Defendant in
the amount of $760, which represents two hours of attorney time to prepare the
motion and attend the hearing at $350 per hour, plus the motion filing fee of
$60.00.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court
grants Plaintiff’s motion to deem admitted the matters specified in the RFA per
Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280,
and orders the matters specified in the RFA deemed admitted.
 
The Court further orders Defendant to pay monetary sanctions in the
amount of $760.00 to Plaintiff, by and through counsel for Plaintiff, within 30
days of notice of this order.
 
            Plaintiff
is ordered to provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of service
of such.
