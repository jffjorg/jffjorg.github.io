And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on a motion filed by attorney Masoud Masjedi to be relieved as counsel for defendant Ali Mirghaffari. The motion has been placed off calendar due to several issues with the proof of service. Specifically, the proof of service indicates that the motion and supporting documents were electronically served on four email addresses, but it is unclear who the two unknown email addresses belong to. Additionally, the proof of service does not show service of the motion on the client at the street address listed for the client. Furthermore, the supporting declaration for the motion has not been filed with the court. As a result, the judge has denied the motion for lack of sufficient proof of service.
