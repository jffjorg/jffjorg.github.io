SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Darlene Freeland’s (Plaintiff)
default on a loan secured by real property (the Loan) located at 8449 Melvin
Avenue, Northridge, California 91324 (the Property).  Plaintiff alleges that she acquired the Property
after her mother died.  (FAC ¶15).  At the time Plaintiff acquired the Property,
it had a loan attached to it in the amount of approximately $668,000.00.  (FAC ¶16). 
Plaintiff alleges that at the time the Property was valued at
$1,400,000.00.  Id.  
 
Plaintiff alleges that she fell behind on the mortgage
due to the collapse of her industry and the failure of tenants on the Property
to pay rent.  (FAC ¶17).  As a result, Plaintiff obtained the Loan from
Defendant Civic Financial Services, LLC (Civic) in the amount of $805,000.00
secured by a Deed of Trust on the Property. 
(FAC ¶¶19-21).  Defendant Fay
Servicing, LLC (Fay) serviced the Loan for Civic.  (FAC ¶5). 
Plaintiff contends that Defendants should have known she could not
afford the monthly payments on the Loan. 
(FAC ¶22). 
 
On 7/6/23, after Plaintiff defaulted on the Loan from
Civic secured by the Property, Defendants recorded a Notice of Default.  (FAC ¶26). 
On 3/20/24, Defendants conducted a Trustee Sale and purchased the
Property for $901,907.00.  (FAC ¶27).
 
On 4/17/24, Plaintiff filed this action against Civic and
Fay (collectively, Defendants) for: 
(1) Wrongful Foreclosure, (2) Violation of Civil Code
2924.17, (3) Negligence, (4) Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing and (5) Violation of California Business & Professions Code 17200,
et seq. and 17500, et seq.  In response
to Defendants’ demurrer to the original complaint, on 7/5/24, Plaintiff filed
the operative First Amended Complaint which alleges causes of action for: (1)
Quiet Title, (2) Violation of Business & Professions Code 17200, et seq.
and 17500, et seq., (3) Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing,
(4) Misrepresentation and (5) Violation of California Homeowner Bill of Rights
(HBOR) and Truth In Lending Act (TILA). 
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues Defendants have with the First Amended Complaint, on 7/25/24, Defendants
filed and served the instant demurrer to the entire First Amended Complaint.  (See Wilkinson Decl.).  The demurrer was originally scheduled for
hearing on 10/17/24. With regard to the 10/17/24 hearing date, Plaintiff failed
to file an opposition to the demurrer with the Court.  However, on 10/10/24, Defendants filed a
reply to Plaintiff’s opposition to the demurrer which established that an
opposition to the demurrer was served on Defendants.  Therefore, the hearing on the demurrer was
continued to 11/6/24 and Plaintiff was ordered to file the opposition to the
demurrer so that the Court could consider all arguments before ruling on the
merits of the demurrer.  Plaintiff filed
the opposition to the demurrer on 10/15/24.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Defendants’ request that the Court take judicial notice of
Exhibits A, B, C, D and F (documents filed by Civic and/or Fay in Plaintiff’s
bankruptcy case) attached to their Request for Judicial Notice is granted only
as to the existence of such documents in the court file, not to the truth of
the contents of such documents.  
 
Defendants’ request that the Court take judicial notice
of Exhibit E, the Recorded Order Granting Motion for Relief From Stay is
granted.  
 
Grounds for Demurrer
 
Among others, a demurrer may be based on the grounds that
a complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action
and/or is uncertain or ambiguous.  CCP
430.10(e), (f).  
 
Misrepresentation (4th cause of action)
 
All of the causes of action in the First Amended
Complaint arise from the assertion that Defendants knew Plaintiff could not
make payments on the Loan when it was made, conspired to take Plaintiff’s
equity in the Property by not providing Plaintiff with a loan modification, and
by not allowing Plaintiff to finalize a refinance loan.  (See FAC ¶¶10, 22-25).  
 
The elements of a fraud/misrepresentation cause of action
are: (1) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or
nondisclosure), (2) knowledge of falsity, (3) intent to defraud, (4)
justifiable reliance and (5) resulting damage. 
Lazar (1996) 12 C4th 631, 638. 
Fraud claims must be pled with specific facts showing how, when, where,
to whom and by what means the misrepresentations were made.  Id. at 645; Small (2003) 30
C4th 167, 183-185.  Additionally, when
fraud is alleged against a corporate defendant, a plaintiff must allege the
names of the persons who made the alleged misrepresentations, their authority
to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or
written.  Lazar, supra at 645;
Tenet Healthsystem Desert, Inc. (2016) 245 CA4th 821, 838.
 
Plaintiff has failed to plead the fraud claim with the
requisite factual specificity.  Plaintiff
does not allege who made any alleged misrepresentation, their authority to
speak, when the misrepresentation was made, or how it was made.  Additionally, the exhibits attached to the
First Amended Complaint, which take precedence over any contradictory
allegations in the pleading, establish that Plaintiff represented that she did
not live at the Property, that it was a rental that the Loan was for the
purpose of increasing rents, increasing credit score and to refinance into a
conventional loan with lower rates.  (See
FAC, Ex.B, C); Modisette (2018) 30 CA5th 136, 142 fn.3; Hoffman
(2009) 179 CA4th 390, 400; Holland (2001) 86 CA4th 1443, 1447; Sarale
(2010) 189 CA4th 225, 245. 

 
Plaintiff is essentially attempting to impose duties on
Defendants which do not exist. 
Generally, a financial institution owes no duty of care to a borrower
when the financial institution’s involvement in a transaction does not exceed
the scope of its conventional role as a lender of money.  Sheen (2022) 12 C5th 905, 930-931; Ragland
(2012) 209 CA4th 182, 206.  Additionally
a lender does not have a duty to grant a loan modification to a borrower.  Lueras (2013) 221 CA4th 49, 67.  A lender has no duty to ensure that a
borrower can pay on a loan or to provide a loan modification.    
 
The facts in the exhibits attached to the First Amended Complaint
show that Plaintiff obtained a short term business loan to increase her tenant
income and to obtain long term financing. 
(See FAC, Ex.A-C).  As
such, Plaintiff cannot establish that she acted in reliance on any purported
misrepresentation by Defendants.  Plaintiff’s
conclusory allegations are insufficient to support the fraud claim.  See Berger (2005) 128 CA4th
989, 1006.
 
Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing (3rd cause of action)
 
An implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing cannot
contradict the express terms of the underlying contract.  Carma Developers (Cal.), Inc. (1992) 2
C4th 342, 374; Storek & Storek, Inc. (2002) 100 CA4th 44, 55.
 
Here, the contracts between the parties, the Promissory
Note and Deed of Trust, allow Civic to proceed with its loan default remedies.  The bankruptcy court also allowed Defendants
to proceed with its default remedies and Plaintiff points to no viable contract
which precluded Defendants from doing so. 
(See RJN, Ex.E).
 
Violation of California Homeowner Bill of Rights
(HBOR) and Truth In Lending Act (TILA) (5th cause of action)      
         
The HOBR and TILA only apply to loans for personal,
family or household purposes, not business purpose loans.  See Miller & Starr, 5 Cal. Real
Estate §13:181 (4th ed.); 15 U.S.C. 1602(h), 1603(l).  As noted above, Plaintiff represented to
Defendants that the Loan was a business purpose loan (i.e., rental property)
and provided evidence to support such claim. 
(FAC, Ex.A-C).  Defendants are
entitled to rely on such representations. 
See Financial Code 22203, 22204.
 
Quiet Title (1st cause of action)
 
A rebuttable presumption exists that all required acts to
conduct a proper foreclosure sale were complied with.  See Melendrez (2005) 127 CA4th
1238, 1258-1259.  Since all of
Plaintiff’s other claims fail, she cannot establish that the foreclosure sale
process was improper.
 
Violations of Business & Professions Code 1700, et
seq. & 17500, et seq. (2nd cause of action)
 
Plaintiff’s claims for violations of the unfair
competition law (UCL) are dependent on Plaintiff’s other claims.  (See FAC ¶¶37-40, 42).  A claim for violation of the UCL cannot be
used as an end-run around the requirements of other statutes.  See Glenn K. Jackson, Inc.
(2001) 273 F.3d 1192, 1203; Krantz (2001) 89 CA4th 164, 178; Chabner
(2000) 225 F.3d 1042, 1048.  Since
Plaintiff’s other causes of action fail, so does this cause of action.  
 
No Leave to Amend
 
Plaintiff has now had two opportunities to plead her
claims against Defendants and has failed to adequately do so.  Additionally, Plaintiff fails to establish
how she can cure the defects in the First Amended Complaint as is her
burden.  See Goodman (1976)
18 C3d 335, 349-350.  Further, based on
the exhibits attached to the First Amended Complaint, it does not appear that
Plaintiff can cure the defects in her pleading by amendment.   
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.

RULING: The motion is granted.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Darlene Freeland’s (Plaintiff)
default on a loan secured by real property (the Loan) located at 8449 Melvin
Avenue, Northridge, California 91324 (the Property).  Plaintiff alleges that she acquired the Property
after her mother died.  (FAC ¶15).  At the time Plaintiff acquired the Property,
it had a loan attached to it in the amount of approximately $668,000.00.  (FAC ¶16). 
Plaintiff alleges that at the time the Property was valued at
$1,400,000.00.  Id.  
 
Plaintiff alleges that she fell behind on the mortgage
due to the collapse of her industry and the failure of tenants on the Property
to pay rent.  (FAC ¶17).  As a result, Plaintiff obtained the Loan from
Defendant Civic Financial Services, LLC (Civic) in the amount of $805,000.00
secured by a Deed of Trust on the Property. 
(FAC ¶¶19-21).  Defendant Fay
Servicing, LLC (Fay) serviced the Loan for Civic.  Plaintiff contends that Defendants should
have known she could not afford the monthly payments on the Loan.  (FAC ¶22). 
 
On 7/6/23, after Plaintiff defaulted on the Loan from
Civic secured by the Property, Defendants recorded a Notice of Default.  (FAC ¶26). 
On 3/20/24, Defendants conducted a Trustee Sale and purchased the
Property for $901,907.00.  (FAC ¶27).
 
On 4/17/24, Plaintiff filed this action against Civic and
Fay (collectively, Defendants) for: (1) Wrongful Foreclosure, (2) Violation of
Civil Code 2924.17, (3) Negligence, (4) Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith
and Fair Dealing and (5) Violation of California Business & Professions
Code 17200, et seq. and 17500, et seq.  In
response to Defendants’ demurrer to the original complaint, on 7/5/24,
Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint which alleges causes of
action for: (1) Quiet Title, (2) Violation of Business & Professions Code
17200, et seq. and 17500, et seq., (3) Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and
Fair Dealing, (4) Misrepresentation and (5) Violation of California Homeowner
Bill of Rights (HBOR) and Truth In Lending Act (TILA).  
 
On 7/25/24, Defendants filed and served the instant
Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens whereby Fay on behalf of Civic seeks an order
expunging the notice of pendency of action (lis pendens) recorded on or about
4/18/24, Instrument Number 202402767l4, against the real property commonly described
as 8449 Melvin Avenue, Northridge, California 91324.  Additionally, Fay requests that the Court
award Civic its attorney’s fees incurred in filing this motion in the amount of
$9,565.00.  If the Court does not grant
the motion to expunge, Fay requests that the Court require Plaintiff to post an
undertaking in the amount of at least $350,000.00 to protect Defendants against
the loss and diminution in the value of the Property and for accruing fees and
costs and lost interest that Civic must pay while this action is resolved.
 
The hearing on the motion was originally scheduled for
10/16/24. With regard to the 10/16/24 hearing date, Plaintiff failed to file an
opposition to the motion with the Court. 
However, on 10/7/24, Defendants filed a reply to Plaintiff’s opposition
to the motion which established that an opposition to the motion was served on
Defendants.  Therefore, the hearing on
the motion was continued to 11/6/24 and Plaintiff was ordered to file the
opposition to the motion so that the Court could consider all arguments before
ruling on the merits of the motion. 
Plaintiff filed the opposition to the motion on 10/15/24.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendants’ request that the Court take judicial notice
of Exhibits A, B, C and D (documents filed by Civic and/or Fay in Plaintiff’s
bankruptcy case) attached to their Request for Judicial Notice is granted only
as to the existence of such documents in the court file, not to the truth of
the contents of such documents.  
 
Defendants’ request that the Court take judicial notice
of Exhibit E, the Recorded Order Granting Motion for Relief From Stay is
granted.  
 
 
After a notice of pendency of action/lis pendens has been
recorded, a party with an interest in the real property affected by the
recording may apply to the court in which the action is pending to expunge the
notice.  See CCP 405.30.  The court shall order the notice expunged if
it finds that the pleading on which the notice is based does not contain a real
property claim.  CCP 405.31.
 
If the pleading contains a real property claim, upon
motion, the court shall order the notice to be expunged if it finds the
claimant has not established by a preponderance of the evidence the probable
validity of the real property claim.  CCP
405.32.
 
Since the First Amended Complaint includes a claim for
quiet title, Plaintiff was required to record a notice of lis pendens.  See CCP 761.010(b); CCP 405.4.  However, as set forth in the ruling on the
demurrer, Plaintiff’s claims, including the claim for quiet title, fail.  The evidence submitted in support of the
instant motion only further supports the finding that Plaintiff was not
defrauded into entering the Loan as she was well aware that the Loan was for
business purposes because she represented the Property was a rental property
and she did not reside at the Property. 
(See  Younger Decl. and
exhibits attached thereto).  The evidence
submitted in support of the instant motion also shows that after obtaining the
Loan and in efforts to obtain refinancing of same, Plaintiff continued to
represent that she did not reside at the Property.  (Id. ¶7-B, Ex.I, I-1).    This
evidence also shows that in her attempt to refinance the Loan, Plaintiff was
seeking a new loan at a higher interest rate which belies her claim that
Defendants should have known that she could not afford the Loan.  (Id. ¶7-C, Ex.F, J).
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff cannot meet her burden
of establishing the probable validity of any real property claim in her First
Amended Complaint.  See CCP 405.3;
CCP 405.32.
 
As the prevailing party on this motion, Defendants are
entitled to recover the reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of making the
motion.  CCP 405.38.  In the original (late filed) opposition to
the motion, Plaintiff did not challenge the reasonableness of the $9,565.00 in
attorneys’ fees requested.  (See
Opposition, generally); (Wilkinson Decl. ¶6). 

 
On 11/1/24, well after the reply was filed, Plaintiff
filed and served a late “Response to Defendants’ Request for Attorney Fees
Under CCP 405.38.”  Plaintiff argues that
the amount of fees requested is excessive. 
Due to the late filing and service of the document, Defendants did not
have the opportunity to respond to the argument contained therein.  In fact, because this document was served by
regular U.S. Mail, defense counsel may not even receive it before the hearing.  (See Proof of Service attached to
Response).  Regardless, the Court finds
that the amount of time claimed is reasonable because the time Defendants’
counsel had to expend in relation to the demurrer was also essential to
establishing that Plaintiff cannot establish the validity of any real property
claim.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Defendants are awarded $9,565.00 in attorneys’ fees and costs as the
prevailing party on this motion, payable within 30 days.
