And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by attorney Arthur Corona on behalf of defendants K12 School Services and Fresh Start Healthy School Meals, Inc. The motion was filed on September 11, 2024, and the hearing was originally set for March 5, 2025, but was advanced to November 6, 2024, and continued to the same date. Despite the court's order to provide proof of service and notice, attorney Corona failed to do so. Additionally, the declaration filed in support of the motion did not indicate who confirmed the address of the corporate clients, and the proposed order did not include the clients' addresses and phone numbers as required. The court has placed the motion off calendar due to the defect in notice and service.
