Case #21CHCV00956
 
MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Motion filed on 4/2/24.
 
MOVING ATTORNEY: Masoud Masjedi
CLIENT: Defendant Ali Mirghaffari

 
RULING: The motion is placed off calendar.  
 
On 4/2/24, attorney Masoud Masjedi filed a Notice of
Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant Ali Mirghaffari along
with a proposed Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.  
 
The motion fails for the following reasons:
 
(1) The proof of service attached to the notice of motion
indicates that it, along with a declaration in support of the motion and the
proposed order were electronically served on 4 email addresses.  While one of the email addresses is the email
address of record for opposing counsel and another seems to be for another
attorney in opposing counsel’s office, it is not clear who the other 2 email
addresses belong to.  If one of the other
email addresses is that of the client, there must be a declaration stating that
the electronic service address is the client’s current electronic service
address.  CRC 3.1362(d)(2).  The proof of service also does not show
service of the motion on the client at the street address listed for the client
in the notice of motion.  (See
Notice of Motion, p.1); CRC 3.1362(d).
 
(2) Although the proof of service indicates that a
declaration in support of the motion was served, no such declaration has been
filed with the court.  See CRC
3.1362(c).
