And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for trial preference. The plaintiff, Rhonda Rudolph, has leukemia and other medical conditions that could significantly shorten her lifespan. The plaintiff asked for a trial date later than 120 days from the date of the motion, which is not allowed under the law. The court notes that the plaintiff has failed to provide dates for her deposition and has noticed several other depositions which have given rise to discovery disputes. The court also notes that the plaintiff's request is not really a request for a trial preference, but rather an order barring further continuances. Despite this, the court agrees that the plaintiff's request is appropriate. The court denies the plaintiff's motion for trial preference under section 36 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. However, the court expects the already-set December 16, 2024 trial date to remain firm.
