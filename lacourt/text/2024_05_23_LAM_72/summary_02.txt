And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court denies St. Clair Plastics, Inc.'s motion to dismiss the action against it. St. Clair Plastics, Inc. argued that Alamilla and Pirate Holdings are necessary parties to the action, but the court finds that they are not. The court notes that Alamilla and Pirate Holdings have settled out of the action and are not claiming an interest in the litigation, making it unlikely that they will claim an interest in the litigation that produces inconsistent liabilities. The court also finds that St. Clair Plastics, Inc.'s concerns about indemnification are not sufficient to justify dismissing the action against it.
