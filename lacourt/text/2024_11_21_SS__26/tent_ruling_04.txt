ANALYSIS:
 
On June 6, 2024, Petitioner Teamsters Local Union 572 (“Petitioner”) filed the instant
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (the “Petition”) against Respondent
Ralphs Grocery Company (“Respondent”). No response has been filed to date.
 
Legal Standard
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made
may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  The petition shall name as respondent all
parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound
by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly
served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered
in this state or another state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects
the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the
proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1286.)
 
A response to a
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award that seeks to vacate or correct the award
must be served and filed no later than 100 days after the date of the service
of a signed copy of the award on the respondent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.2.)
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil
Procedure, section 1290.4 requires that the Petition and Notice of Hearing be
served on Respondent “in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for
the service of such petition and notice” or “[i]f the arbitration agreement
does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made . . . [s]ervice
within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service
of summons in an action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subds. (a), (b).) 
 
Petitioner has not
shown that the parties’ arbitration agreement provides for the manner of
service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing. It follows that the Petition and
Notice of Hearing must be served in the manner provided by law for service of a
summons, which is set forth at Code of Civil Procedure sections 415.10 to
415.95. Petitioner has filed proof of personal service of the Petition and
Notice of Hearing. (Proof of Personal Service, filed 06/14/24.) Therefore, the
Court finds that service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing conforms to Code
of Civil Procedure section 1290.4.  
 
Service of the Arbitration Award and Timing of Service
of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4)
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 1283.6 requires that “[t]he neutral arbitrator shall serve a
signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by registered
or certified mail or as provided in the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1283.6.) This requirement may be satisfied by service by the arbitrator,
or upon proper service of the Award with the Petition. (See Murry v. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 796, 799-800.) The
arbitration award is not accompanied by a proof of service but Petitioner has
demonstrated that the award was served on Respondent with the instant Petition.
(Pet., Attachment 4(b).)
 
Also, a party seeking a court judgment confirming an
arbitration award must file and serve the petition no more than four years, but
not less than 10 days, after the award is served.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) Petitioner has demonstrated
compliance with Code of Civil Procedure
sections 1288 and 1288.4 by serving the instant Petition eight months
after the award was issued on October 11, 2023. 
 
 
 
Confirmation of the Arbitration Award
 
An arbitration award
is not directly enforceable until it is confirmed by a court and judgment is
entered.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1287.6; Jones
v. Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.) The court must confirm the award
as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses the
proceeding.  (CCP § 1286; Valsan
Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25
Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) Code of Civil Procedure, section 1285.4 states a
petition under this chapter shall:
 
a)     
Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such
an agreement.
 
b)     
Set forth the names of the arbitrators.
 
c)     
Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the
written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) The Petition complies with the
above requirements. It sets forth the nature of the arbitration agreement and
the name of the arbitrator. (Pet., ¶¶4-6 and Attachment 8(c).) A copy of the
arbitration agreement is also attached. (Id. at Attachment 4(b).)
Substantively, the Petition demonstrates that Respondent is required to make
whole those employees who were laid off or lost wages and benefits when
Respondent transferred the work of producing paychecks, printing identification
tags, and processing Vestcom price tags and materials. (Id. at
Attachment (4)(b), p. 16.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Petitioner Teamsters Local Union 572’s Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award is
GRANTED. RESPONDENT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE WHOLE THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO WERE
LAID OFF OR LOST WAGES AND BENEFITS WHEN RESPONDENT TRANSFERRED THE WORK OF
PRODUCING PAYCHECKS, PRINTING IDENTIFICATION TAGS, AND PROCESSING VESTCOM PRICE
TAGS AND MATERIALS. 
 
 
Petitioner to give notice.
