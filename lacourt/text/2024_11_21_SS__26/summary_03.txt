And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying an expedited petition to approve a compromise of a disputed claim on behalf of plaintiff Bohdan Bahlaievskyi. The petition was filed by non-party Petitioner Natalya Kocheshevia on May 28, 2024, but numerous problems with the petition were identified by the court. Despite an order requiring the Petitioner to correct the defects by October 24, 2024, no additional papers were filed, and the petition is therefore denied.
