TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED; (CCP
§ 2033.280)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            
Plaintiff Unify Financial Federal
Credit Union’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted is GRANTED. 
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On August 16, 2024, Plaintiff Unify Financial Federal Credit
Union (“Plaintiff”) served Requests for Admissions on Defendant Guillermo
Gutierrez (“Defendant”). (Motion, D’Anna
Decl., Exh. A.) To date, Defendant has not served verified responses to the
Requests for Admission. (Id. at ¶3.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion
to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted (“the Motion”) on October 16, 2024. No
opposition has been filed to date. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Due to Defendant’s failure to timely serve verified responses and resultant
waiver of objections, Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the Requests
for Admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Unify Financial Federal
Credit Union’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted is GRANTED. 
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
