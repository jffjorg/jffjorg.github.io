The Court considers the moving papers,
oppositions, and replies.
 
Plaintiff
moves for an award of attorney’s fees to enforce the parties’ settlement
agreement and to enforce the judgment entered by the Court on August 1, 2024.
Defendants oppose and move to compel Plaintiff to file an acknowledgement of
full satisfaction of judgment. 
The
parties reached a settlement in May 2024, agreeing that Defendants would pay
Plaintiff $15,000.00 within 30 days. A notice of settlement was filed on May
23, 2024. Defendants sent a formal agreement. Plaintiff’s counsel returned a copy
signed not by Plaintiff, but by Plaintiff’s brother Steven Melville. Defendants
objected to this signature. Plaintiff’s counsel informed Defendants’ counsel
that Plaintiff had died several months prior, and that Steven Melville was
Plaintiff’s successor-in-interest. Defendants again objected, stating that
Melville had not filed a successor-in-interest declaration as required by CCP §
377.32. 
Two
days later, on July 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed an ex parte application to
enforce the settlement and enter judgment, claiming Defendants had breached the
agreement by failing to pay the settlement within 30 days. The Court granted
the ex parte and entered judgment on August 1, 2024. 
On
September 16, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel received a check for $15,000.00 from
Defendants. On September 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed the motion for attorney’s
fees.
Plaintiff
seeks $18,000.00 in attorney’s fees and $2,716.16 in costs to enforce the
judgment under CCP § 685.040. In opposition, Defendants assert that the motion
is untimely under CCP § 685.080 because judgment was satisfied before Plaintiff
filed the motion. Defendants also argue that they did not breach the settlement
because Plaintiff did not sign the agreement. In reply, Plaintiff asserts the
motion is timely because Defendant did not satisfy the judgment in full, having
failed to include an additional $189.06 in interest that accrued on the
judgment between August 1, 2024 and September 16, 2024.
Code
of Civil Procedure § 664.6 allows the Court enter judgment according to a
written settlement “signed by the parties outside of the presence of the
court.” “[A] writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the
following: (1) The party. (2) An attorney who represents the party.” (CCP §
664.6(b).) Here, the agreement was not signed by Plaintiff, who was deceased
before the parties settled, nor by a successor-in-interest who had filed the
necessary declaration, nor by counsel. Additionally, the agreement attached to
the ex parte application to enforce the settlement does not include Defendants’
signatures or Defendants’ counsel’s signature. 
The
Court believes it may not have had authority to enforce the settlement and
enter judgment under CCP § 664.6. Code of Civil Procedure § 473(d) and the
Court’s inherent authority allow the Court set aside void judgments. (See e.g. Sec.
Pac. Nat. Bank v. Lyon (1980) 105 Cal.App.3d Supp. 8, 13, “A judgment or
order that is void on its face can be set aside on motion or on the court's own
motion at any time after its entry by the court that rendered the judgment or
made the order.”) If the judgment is void, Plaintiff is not entitled to recover
attorney’s fees and costs to enforce it, and Defendants are not required to pay
interest on it. 
The
Court requires additional briefing from the parties as to whether the judgment
should be set aside. 
The
motions are CONTINUED.
