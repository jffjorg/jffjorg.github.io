And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the complaint is overruled. The defendants had argued that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to support a claim for professional negligence. However, the Judge finds that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to support a claim, including that the defendants' representation of the plaintiffs fell below the standard of care and led to the employee filing a complaint against the plaintiffs, resulting in extensive legal fees and costs. The Judge has ordered the defendants to file and serve answers to the complaint within 30 days of the ruling.
