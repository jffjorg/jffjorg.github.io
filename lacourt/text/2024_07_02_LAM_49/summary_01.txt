Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Amend the complaint. The motion was opposed by Defendants, who argued that the proposed amendments are unnecessary and would cause them prejudice. The Judge found that while the parties can reasonably argue the necessity and timeliness of the amendments, there is little evidence that Defendants will be unfairly prejudiced if leave to amend is given. The Judge notes that the amendments do not present any new issues and should require little, if any, additional discovery. The court's policy is to allow amendments at any stage of the proceeding to dispose of cases upon their substantial merits. The Judge grants the motion and orders Plaintiffs to file and serve a standalone copy of the Fourth Amended Complaint within 10 days.
