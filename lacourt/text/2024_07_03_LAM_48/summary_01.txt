And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ciro R. Pineda vs. Los Angeles Unified School District. The defendant has filed an answer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint, but the judge has found that many of the affirmative defenses asserted by the defendant are not properly pleaded. The judge has ordered the striking of certain affirmative defenses, including those that are not truly affirmative defenses or do not contain ultimate facts.

The judge has also denied the defendant's motion for leave to file an amended answer, which sought to add new affirmative defenses under Education Code sections 35330 and 44808. However, the judge has granted the defendant leave to file an amended answer that remedies the defects identified in the order, and has given the defendant 30 days to do so.

The judge has also ordered that the parties who intend to submit to the tentative ruling must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit. If all parties submit, no appearances before the court are required unless a companion hearing is also on calendar.
