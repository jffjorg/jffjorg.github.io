The judge has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to quash service of summons. The plaintiff, Montano Investments, Inc., filed a complaint against the defendants, including Marc Mendez, alleging fraud and wrongful foreclosure. The defendant Mendez moved to quash service of summons, arguing that the plaintiff failed to effectuate valid service of process by publication. The plaintiff failed to oppose the motion, and the defendant rebutted the presumption that service was proper. As a result, the court has granted the motion and dismissed the action without prejudice.
