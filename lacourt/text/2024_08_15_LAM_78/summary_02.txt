And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees in part. The motion is granted in the amount of $30,620.00, and costs in the amount of $2,569.09. The judge reduced the attorney fees because the rates of $695.00 per hour for Mr. Saeedian and Ms. Ostoia, and $525.00 per hour for Mr. Urner, were found to be excessive. The judge also found that the hours incurred by the plaintiff's attorneys were reasonable and not duplicative. The motion was opposed by the defendants, but the judge did not find any compelling reason to reduce the amount of time billed by half or by three quarters as argued by the defendants.
