And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendant, Malle, to the plaintiff's complaint. The judge has found that the plaintiff has failed to properly plead the type of contract she wishes to enforce, and has not specified whether she wishes to plead breach of the implied covenant in tort or contract, nor has she met the requirements to do either. Additionally, the plaintiff has failed to properly allege that the defendant acted out of animus against a protected class in the fourth cause of action. Therefore, the judge has sustained the demurrer to the first, second, and fourth causes of action, with 10 days leave to amend. The judge has also overruled the demurrer to the third cause of action, intentional infliction of emotional distress.
