And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the request for judicial notice and has sustained the demurrer filed by defendants Orwig and Fiesta. The demurrer was filed on the grounds that the plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action against the defendants. The judge has determined that the plaintiff's claim is based on fraud and that the policy was rescinded due to the plaintiff's own fraud. Therefore, the plaintiff cannot sue the defendants and the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. The defendants are ordered to submit a judgment of dismissal within 5 days.
