 Case Number:  23STCV03246    Hearing Date:   October 12, 2023    Dept:  14 Instant Motion
 
Attorneys Christopher R. Chapman
and Claudia Borsutzki (“Borsutzki”) now seek to be relieved as counsel of record
for Plaintiff Genaro Aviles Reyes. They will remain as counsel for the other
Plaintiffs

Governing Rule
 
            California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 requires that counsel fill out forms MC-051, MC-052,
and MC-053. These forms serve two basic functions: (1) ensuring that notice is
given to the client and (2) providing the court with an adequate explanation of
why the matter is being handled via motion rather than mutual consent. See Code
of Civil Procedure § 284; California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362.
 
Decision
 
            Counsel Borsutzki
has completed the required forms. Those forms indicate that the client, when
reached on the telephone, has refused to provide counsel with his address, instructing
instead that counsel leave documents with a Ms. Fabiola Frausto. Counsel have followed
those instructions. 
 
            Counsel Borsutzki
indicates that Plaintiff Genaro Aviles Reyes has expressed a desire not to prosecute
this suit any further.
 
            Counsel has
complied with the requirements of Rule 3.1362, and relief is appropriate under
the circumstances of this case. The motion is GRANTED, effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed
orders upon the client.
 
            The court
also sets an OSC re: dismissal of the claims of Plaintiff Genaro Aviles Reyes
for December 15, 2023, at 8:30 am.
