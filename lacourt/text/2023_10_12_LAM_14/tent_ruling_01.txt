Discussion
 
            The FAC tells a relatively simple story in which Plaintiff
used a “straw buyer” to get auto insurance at a discount.
 
            Plaintiff
was given a power of attorney by a Mr. David Dawson, who is not a party to this
lawsuit. Plaintiff went to the offices of Defendant Fiesta, where he spoke with
Defendant Orwig, who assisted him in procuring insurance for Mr. Dawson.
Defendant Aspire ultimately issued a policy to Mr. Dawson. However, Mr. Dawson
was never the owner or the driver of the vehicle (a 2010 Prius) that Aspire insured
– Plaintiff was.
 
            Plaintiff
has submitted a declaration from Mr. Dawson admitting that he allowed Plaintiff
to use his name and driver’s license number to obtain the policy because the
two of them are friends. (Declaration of David Dawson filed May 1, 2023).
Plaintiff’s name appears nowhere on the policy, which is attached to the FAC.
 
            Plaintiff
has no viable claim against Defendants Orwig and Fiesta. Nor can one be stated. Plaintiff cannot sue the broker because a policy based on his
own fraud was rescinded. ConclusionThe demurrer is SUSTAINED, without leave to amend. Defense is to submit a judgment of dismissal within 5 days.
