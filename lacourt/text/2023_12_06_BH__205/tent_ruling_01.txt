  Case Number:  23SMCV00536    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2023    Dept:  205 CASE NAME: Bliss Media US, LLC v. S.P. Das Films LLC,
et al.
CASE NUMBER: 23SMCV00536PROCEEDINGS: REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENTMOVING PARTY: Bliss Media US, LLCRESPONDING PARTY: S.P. Das Films LLC, SPD Productions LLC, SPD Intellectual
Property LLC, DasFilms Ltd, Sriram DasBACKGROUNDThis case arises from a breach of a settlement agreement. Plaintiff Bliss Media US, LLC
obtained judgment against Defendant S.P. Das Enterprises LLC d/b/a Das Films, in the original
principal amount of $1,249,284. Das Films did not satisfy the judgment. During Plaintiff’s efforts to enforce the judgment, Plaintiff and Das Films entered into a
“Resolution Agreement.” The Resolution Agreement required Defendants Das Films to make
certain payments to Plaintiff. Das Films’ obligations under the Resolution Agreement were
guaranteed by S.P. Das Films, LLC, SPD Productions LLC, SPD Intellectual Property, LLC and
DasFilms Ltd. (collectively “Guarantors”). Sriram Das wholly owns and controls Das Films and
the Guarantors. Das Films defaulted under the terms of the Resolution Agreement by, among other
things, failing to make required payments to Plaintiff. Plaintiff demanded that Das Films,
Guarantors and Sriram Dass cure the default. They failed to do so. On February 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant. The Complaint
alleges a single claim for breach of the guaranty. The Complaint seeks $1,498,372.12 plus
interest. Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing S.P. Das Films and Siriam Das were served
personally on February 8, 2023 and Defendants SPD Intellectual Property, LLC, SPD
Productions LLC, DasFilms Ltd. were served by substitute service on February 8, 2023.
Defendants were obligated to respond within 30 days. Defendants did not do so. Plaintiff
successfully requested the entry of Defendants’ default, which was entered by the Clerk’s Office
on March 27, 2023 and April 11, 2023. Plaintiff requested a default judgment on August 11,
2023. Plaintiff served Defendants by mail with both the Request for Entry of Default and
Request for Default Judgment. Defendants have not appeared. RELIEF REQUESTEDDefault judgment against Defendants for a total of $1,580,499.19, which is comprised of:
(1) $1,498,372.12, for damages, (2) $81,692.07 in interest, and (2) $435, for costs. ANALYSISCode of Civil Procedure section 585 sets forth the two options for obtaining a
default judgment. First, where the plaintiff’s complaint seeks compensatory damages
only, in a sum certain which is readily ascertainable from the allegations of the complaint
or statement of damages, the clerk may enter the default judgment for that amount.
However, if the relief requested in the complaint is more complicated, consisting of either
nonmonetary relief, or monetary relief in amounts which require either an accounting,
additional evidence, or the exercise of judgment to ascertain, the plaintiff must request
entry of judgment by the court. In such cases, the plaintiff must affirmatively establish his
entitlement to the specific judgment requested. (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011)
201 Cal.App.4th 267, 287.) Section 585 also allows for interest, costs and attorney fees,
where otherwise allowed by law. (Code of Civ. Proc. 585(a).) Multiple specific documents are required, such as: (1) form CIV 100, (2) a brief summary of
the case; (3) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (4) interest
computations as necessary; (5) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (6) a proposed form of
judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as
necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.
(CRC Rule 3.1800.)
Here, except for Sriram Das and S.P. Das Films, Plaintiff has not properly served the
other defendants. As to Defendants SPD Intellectual Property, LLC, and SPD Productions LLC,
DasFilms Ltd., the declaration of reasonable diligence attached to the proofs of service do not
show that two or three attempts were made prior to substitute service. (See 1 Cal. Affirmative
Def. § 2:14 (2d ed.) (“The requirement that the plaintiff attempt personal service with reasonable
diligence before use of substituted service is mandatory . . . [if] the requirement is not satisfied,
the substituted service will be ineffective.”); Espindola v. Nunez (1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1389,
1392 (two or three attempts at personal service will satisfy the requirement of reasonable
diligence). Accordingly, the request for default judgment as to these Defendants is denied.As to Sriram Das and S.P. Das Films, Plaintiff has not properly complied with all the
requirements for a default judgment. Specifically, while Plaintiff declares via declaration it is
owed interest of $81,692.07, it has not provided the interest calculation as required under Rules
of Court Rule 3.1800(a)(3). CONCLUSION AND ORDER  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Bliss Media US, LLC’s Request for Default Judgment
is DENIED without prejudice.
