And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for a writ of attachment against the defendants. The plaintiff, A&M Engineering, Inc., made three short-term loans totaling $14 million to two defendants, Global Automotive Solutions LLC and Stelaro LLC. The plaintiff claims that only $1 million of the loans have been repaid and that the defendants may form a new entity to shield their assets.

The plaintiff's application for a writ of attachment is defective because it is verified by the plaintiff's counsel, not the plaintiff. Additionally, the plaintiff has not shown that it has a probability of prevailing on its alter ego claims against the defendants. The alter ego claims require two elements: unity of interest and ownership, and whether adherence to the fiction of separate existence would promote fraud or injustice. The plaintiff has not shown that these elements are present in this case.

The judge also notes that the Attachment Law statutes are subject to strict construction and that the plaintiff's application is defective. Therefore, the judge denies the plaintiff's motion for a writ of attachment.
