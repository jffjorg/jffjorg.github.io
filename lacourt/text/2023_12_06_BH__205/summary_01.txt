And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment against the defendants, except for Sriram Das and S.P. Das Films. The plaintiff obtained a judgment against the defendant Das Films for $1,249,284, but the defendant did not satisfy the judgment. The parties entered into a "Resolution Agreement" requiring the defendant to make certain payments to the plaintiff, which the defendant defaulted on. The plaintiff demanded that the defendant cure the default, but the defendant did not do so. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant, and the defendant did not respond. The plaintiff successfully requested the entry of the defendant's default, and then requested a default judgment. However, the judge found that the plaintiff did not properly serve the other defendants, and therefore denied the request for default judgment as to those defendants. The judge also found that the plaintiff did not comply with the requirements for a default judgment as to Sriram Das and S.P. Das Films, and therefore denied the request for default judgment as to those defendants as well.
