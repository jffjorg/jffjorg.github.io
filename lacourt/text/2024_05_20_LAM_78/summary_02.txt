And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the demurrer filed by Santa Paula Post Acute, LLC (SPPA) to the first cause of action for elder abuse, but overrules it on the second cause of action for violation of residents' rights. The demurrer is overruled on the ground that the Complaint states sufficient facts to state a cause of action for elder abuse and violation of residents' rights.

The motion to strike the Complaint's demands for attorney's fees, costs, and punitive damages is denied on all grounds. The motion to strike the demand for punitive damages is denied because the Complaint states sufficient facts to show that SPPA's conduct was malicious and willful.
