English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the Court's order dismissing the case. The Court notes that the plaintiff, Tamarin Lindenberg, is unrepresented and that her corporate co-plaintiff, Sett Management, LLC, may not appear pro se. The motion is denied as the plaintiff fails to present new facts, circumstances, or law that would justify reconsideration. The Court previously dismissed the case under Code Civ. Proc., section 583.410 on the grounds that it had been more than two years since the case commenced and the plaintiff had not served the defendant. The plaintiff argues that the delay in service was due to the incompetence of her previous counsel and that she has since been diligent in attempting to serve the defendant despite being self-represented. The Court finds that the plaintiff's arguments are not new and do not warrant reconsideration of the Court's order.
