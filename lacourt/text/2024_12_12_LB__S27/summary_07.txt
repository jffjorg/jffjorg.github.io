And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Michelle Broza v. City and State. The case involves a petition for order from relief from claim statute, which was filed by Michelle Broza. The petition was filed on July 24, 2024, and was accompanied by an attorney declaration and civil case cover sheet. A second petition for relief was filed on September 26, 2024, with a hearing date of February 18, 2025.

However, the Court has found that the service of the petition is defective. Specifically, there is no summons in the file, and the proof of service documents do not indicate that the respondents were served with a summons. Additionally, it is unclear which petition was served, and there is no evidence that notice was given for the rescheduled hearing.

Based on these defects, the Court has summarily denied the petition. The parties are reminded to appear remotely at the hearing on the petition, which is now scheduled for December 12, 2024, as well as the OSC and CMC.
