Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages and related allegations in a case brought by Kareron Theus against Hof's Hut Restaurants, Inc. for negligence, negligent training, hiring, and retention, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and respondent superior. The case arose when Kareron dined at the restaurant and ordered a fish entree, but was served a dish with a sauce that was simmered with bacon, despite his severe allergy to pork. Kareron experienced a severe allergic reaction and was hospitalized.

The Judge granted the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages and related allegations, finding that the defendant's server's conduct, although negligent, did not rise to the level of malice, fraud, or oppression as defined by Civil Code ยง3294. The Judge also denied leave to amend the complaint to add additional facts to support the prayer for punitive damages.

The Judge ordered the defendant to file an answer to the complaint, with the prayer for punitive damages and related allegations deemed stricken, within ten days. The Judge also ordered the defendant to give notice of the ruling to the parties.
