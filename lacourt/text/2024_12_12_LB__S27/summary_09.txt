And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has ruled that the parties in a lemon law case must meet and confer in good faith to resolve their discovery disputes. The Court has seen a dramatic increase in motions to compel further responses and motions to compel PMK depositions in lemon law cases, and the parties have failed to meet and confer in good faith to resolve these issues. The Court finds that the attorneys in these cases are acting in a way that does not benefit their clients, constantly incurring attorneys' fees in connection with discovery disputes when they are already aware of how the Court will rule on the motions. The Court is continuing the hearing on this motion for one month to require the parties to meet and confer in good faith. If the parties are unable to resolve their issues, they must file a joint statement of items that remain in dispute and briefs and declarations detailing their efforts to meet and confer. The Court may award sanctions against attorneys who fail to meet and confer in good faith.
