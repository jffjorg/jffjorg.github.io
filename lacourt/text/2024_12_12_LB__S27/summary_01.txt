And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike a memorandum of costs filed by plaintiffs seeking $95,000 in attorneys' fees. The defendant correctly argued that the memorandum of costs is not sufficient to seek attorneys' fees, and the judge agrees. The judge grants the motion to strike the memorandum, but does not adjudicate the right to recover fees, which will be done at a later hearing. The ruling does not affect the ultimate outcome of the case. The parties are ordered to give notice, and those who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court.
