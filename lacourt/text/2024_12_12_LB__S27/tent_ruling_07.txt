 Case Number:  24LBCP00231    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2024    Dept:  S27  
1.     Procedural
History
Petitioner, Michelle Broza
commenced this action on 7/24/24 by filing a petition for order from relief
from claim statute (sic).  On the same
day, she filed an attorney declaration and civil case cover sheet.  
 
On 9/26/24, Petitioner filed a
second petition for relief.  The second
petition appears to be substantially similar to the first petition, but it
includes a hearing date (2/18/25) in the caption.  The same day, she filed another attorney
declaration, which appears to be substantially similar to the 7/24/24 attorney
declaration.  
 
On 10/03/24, she filed proof of
service of the petition and related papers on the City.  The POS indicates Petitioner’s registered
process server served the City with the petition, attorney declaration, and
attorney declaration on 10/01/24 by personal service.  On 10/08/24, she filed proof of service of
the same papers on the State; the POS indicates the papers were personally
served on 10/02/24.  
 
On 10/14/24, the Court held an OSC
re: proof of service.  The Court noted
that not all parties had been served. 
The Court continued the OSC to 12/12/24, rescheduled a CMC for 12/12/24,
and rescheduled the 2/18/25 petition hearing for 12/12/24.  The Court ordered Plaintiff (Petitioner) to
give notice.
 
2.     Petition
The petition is summarily denied
due to defective service.  First, there
is no summons anywhere in the file, and the proof of service documents do not
indicate any respondent has been served with a summons.  Second, it is not clear, from the proof of
service documents, whether the respondents were served with the petition that
included a hearing date or the one that did not.  Third, there is no evidence in the file that
Petitioner gave notice that the hearing on the petition was rescheduled from
2/18/25 to 12/12/24.  
 
Because service of the petition is
defective in all the above regards, the petition is denied.  
 
3.     OSC
and CMC
The parties are reminded that there
is an OSC and CMC on calendar concurrently with the hearing on the
petition.  The Court asks the parties to
make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on the petition, OSC, and
CMC.
