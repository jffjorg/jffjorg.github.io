Summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge is considering a motion to quash filed by the defendants, Matson Navigation Co., Sargeant Marine, Inc., Point Shipping Corp., Vulcan Carriers, Ltd., Sheridan Transportation, Atlandic Tankships, and Hess Corp. (Moving Defendant). The plaintiff, Kirk Cully, is seeking to establish jurisdiction in California based on his exposure to benzene while working on container ships. The defendants argue that jurisdiction cannot be established and that the Court should rule in their favor.

The Judge notes that the Court previously continued the hearing to permit the plaintiff to conduct jurisdictional discovery. The plaintiff has filed supplemental opposition papers, and the defendants have filed supplemental reply papers. The Judge is considering the discovery motions in connection with its ruling on this motion and has continued the hearing to 1/21/25, to be heard concurrently with the scheduled discovery motion on that date.

The Judge asks the parties to focus their briefing on the issue of whether the defendants would be subject to specific jurisdiction if they were shipping natural gas, through their subsidiaries, from California onto ships at sea, including the Plaintiff's ship. The Court notes that the defendants had natural gas plants in California in the 1990s and that products from those plants were sold in state or transported out of state. The Court is considering the Hardell v. Vanzyl decision, which holds that general jurisdiction can only be imposed based on acts that occur between the time of filing of the case and the time of service of the summons and complaint on the defendant.
