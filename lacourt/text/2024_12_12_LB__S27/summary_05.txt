And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion for summary judgment and adjudication. The Defendant had sought to have three issues adjudicated as a matter of law, but the Court found that the facts presented by the Defendant were not sufficient to support their claims. The Court also found that the Defendant had not properly authenticated the Plaintiff's discovery responses, which were used to support the Defendant's claims. The Judge noted that the Defendant had two options to shift the burden of proof: either present affirmative evidence of the required facts or show that the Plaintiff lacks evidence to establish an essential element of their case. The Judge found that the Defendant had not met their burden and therefore denied the motion.
