And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Alizia Dotson vs. Ceasar Melgar, Aaron Cummings, and Krystle Cummings. The case involves a settlement agreement between Dotson and the Cummingses, in which they agree to settle all claims for $12,500. Dotson is seeking an order from the court finding that the settlement is in good faith. Since the opposing parties did not file timely opposition to the motion, the court will not consider any late-filed opposition. As a result, the court grants the motion and orders the moving defendants to give notice. The parties who intend to submit on the tentative ruling must notify the court by email and identify the party submitting. If a party does not submit on the tentative, they should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing.
