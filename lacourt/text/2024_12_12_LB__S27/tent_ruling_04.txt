 Case Number:  23LBCV01687    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff, Alizia Dotson filed this
action against Defendants, Ceasar Melgar, Aaron Cummings, and Krystle Cummings
for damages arising out of a three-car automobile accident.  There are cross-complaints pending among the
parties.  
 
Dotson has agreed to settle all
claims with the Cummingses for $12,500. 
They seek an order finding their settlement in good faith.  Pursuant to CCP §877.6(d), the burden of proof
on this motion is squarely on the party opposing the motion.  Any opposition to the motion was due on or
before 11/27/24.  The Court has not
received timely opposition and will not consider late-filed opposition.  In light of the lack of opposition, no party
has met the burden to oppose the settlement, and the motion is granted.  
 
Moving Defendants are ordered to
give notice.
 
Parties who intend to submit

the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify
the party submitting on the tentative. If any party does not submit on the
