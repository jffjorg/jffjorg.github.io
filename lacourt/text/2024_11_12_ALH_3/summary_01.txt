And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The County of Los Angeles has filed a demurrer to Plaintiff Greg Lewis' first amended complaint (FAC), arguing that he failed to comply with the Government Tort Claims Act and did not timely present a claim. The FAC alleges that the County wrongfully removed Greg's daughter, Charlotte, from his custody on November 4, 2020, and that he filed a prelitigation claim on March 24, 2022.

The Court has considered the demurrer and finds that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts demonstrating compliance with the Government Tort Claims Act or excusing his noncompliance. Specifically, the FAC does not allege any facts demonstrating why no reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing could exist until September 28, 2021, when the Los Angeles County Superior Court issued a final order in Greg's favor regarding custody of Charlotte.

The Court also finds that the principles of equitable tolling that may apply to statutes of limitations do not apply to the time periods within which claims must be filed with a governmental agency. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
