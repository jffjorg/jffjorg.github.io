Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving papers and finds that Respondent is entitled to attorney's fees and costs in this action. The Court notes that the failure to oppose a motion creates an inference that the motion is meritorious. However, the Court finds that Respondent has not presented any billing records or invoices substantiating the work done by counsel in connection with the instant action. Therefore, the Court CONTINUES the hearing on Respondent's motion for attorney's fees and costs to Tuesday, May 28, 2024, and ORDERS counsel for Respondent to file and serve a supplemental declaration or declarations setting forth the reasonableness of the claimed attorney's fees and to provide the Court with billing records for the work done in this case.
