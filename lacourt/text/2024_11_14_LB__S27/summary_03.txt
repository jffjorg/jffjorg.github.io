And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that a hearing on a petition to approve a settlement agreement will be continued to January 7, 2025. The settlement provides for payment of $131,250 to the plaintiff, A.D., who is autistic and nonverbal and was subjected to physical and verbal abuse by his teacher. The settlement amount will be distributed as follows: $0 for medical expenses, $32,812.50 for attorneys' fees, and $29,526.18 for costs. However, the court has concerns about the reasonableness of the costs and has ordered the plaintiff's counsel to provide a declaration explaining the costs and to file the retainer agreement. The court also notes that the costs appear to be high and requires further information to determine whether they were reasonable.
