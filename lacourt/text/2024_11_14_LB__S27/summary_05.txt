  - "A determination by the court that the settlement was made in good faith shall bar any other joint tortfeasor or co-obligor from any further claims against the settling tortfeasor or co-obligor for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault."
  - "The ultimate determinant of good faith is whether the settlement is grossly disproportionate to what a reasonable person at the time of settlement would estimate the settlor's liability to be."

Note: There are several instances where the text uses abbreviations such as "LBCV" and "STCV", which are likely abbreviations for court case numbers. I did not include these in the YAML summary as they are not explicitly stated as part of the case details.
