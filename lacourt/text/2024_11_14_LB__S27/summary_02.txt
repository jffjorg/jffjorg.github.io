And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a habitability action brought by Leslie Ungar and her minor daughter Sophia against several defendants. The parties have agreed to settle the action, with Leslie Ungar receiving $30,900 and Sophia receiving $10,000. The settlement also includes costs of $3,318 for Sophia, which will be split between the two plaintiffs. The judge notes that the reason for the apportionment of the settlement payments is not explained in Attachment 12, and that the parties have not explained why they wish to purchase insurance premiums for Sophia when they already have a Medi-Cal plan. The judge requires the parties to file a declaration attesting that the $4,152 settlement amount for Sophia will be used to purchase insurance for her. The judge also notes that there is no proposed order granting the petition, nor is there an order to deposit the settlement funds into a blocked account. As a result, the hearing on the expedited petition is continued to January 16, 2025, to allow the parties to provide further explanation and to file the necessary documents.
