 Case Number:  23LBCV02177    Hearing Date:   November 14, 2024    Dept:  S27 Rodolfo Gaba Jr.
(“Counsel”) moves to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff Mediterranean
Shipping Company USA. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.)
            CRC, Rule
3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and
motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to
Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in
general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under CCP § 284(2) is brought instead
of filing a consent under CCP § 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service
of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who
have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel
(prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-053).)
            Here,
Counsel has not complied with CRC, Rule 3.1362. Counsel filed his declaration
(MC-052) for the case named Team DGD Inc. dba Freight Hub Group v. Grunanda
LLC but includes information for the instant case. (MC-052.) Additionally, Order
Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel MC-053 Item 6 (a) fails to
include Plaintiff’s telephone number. 
            Thus, the
Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel. 
Counsel Rodolfo Gaba Jr. is ordered
to give notice.
