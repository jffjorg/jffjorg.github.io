And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Martha Valdez vs. Martha Diaz. The case arises from a complaint filed by Martha Valdez against her daughter, Martha Diaz, alleging that the daughter fraudulently transferred her property to herself. The plaintiff filed a second amended complaint, which includes claims for quiet title, declaratory and injunctive relief, intentional misrepresentation, willful concealment, elder abuse, negligence, and civil conspiracy to commit fraud. The defendant's counsel, Fredric W. Trestor and Charles A. Mollis, have moved to be relieved as counsel due to a breakdown in communication and cooperation with their client. The judge granted the motion, finding that the defendant has sufficient time to obtain new counsel before trial, which is set to take place in two months. The judge ordered that counsel give notice of the ruling and that parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so.
