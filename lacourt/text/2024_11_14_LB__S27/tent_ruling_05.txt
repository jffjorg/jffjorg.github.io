 Case Number:  23STCV08230    Hearing Date:   November 14, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.     Case
No. 21LBCV00329
On June 16, 2021, Plaintiffs,
Robert Lord and Broadband Service Group, Inc. filed 21LBCV00329 against
Defendants, Christopher M. Sandu, Dennis Phan, Legacy Communications, LLC, and
Legacy Communications for breach of contract, fraud, and related claims. The
crux of the complaint is that Defendants agreed to purchase vehicles and
equipment from Plaintiffs, and made a series of representations about their
ability to repay the loans, but Defendants were neither willing nor able to
make the payments when they made the representations. 
 
On August 31, 2021, Plaintiffs
filed proof of service on each of the defendants. The POS documents showed
service on Sandu and Phan by personal service, and on Legacy by substitute
service. On November 12, 2021, Plaintiffs dismissed Legacy Communications, Inc.
from the action. On December 3, 2021, the Clerk, at Plaintiffs’ request,
entered defaults as to Sandu, Phan, and Legacy Communications, LLC. 
 
On April 12, 2022, after a default
prove-up hearing, the Court entered judgment against Defendants; on April 14,
2022, the Court entered an amended judgment. The amended judgment obligates
Defendants, and each of them, to pay Plaintiffs, and each of them, the
principal amount of $954,247.91, plus interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs, for
a total judgment of $1,100,988.40. 
 
On December 6, 2022, the Court
heard and granted Defendant Phan’s motion to vacate the default and default
judgment entered against him. 
 
On April 29, 2024, non-jury trial
commenced. After the presentation of evidence and testimony, the Court found in
favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendant Phan. The Court awarded damages in
the amount of $590,000.00, according to the evidence presented. On May 9, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed a proposed final judgment, to which Defendant Phan objected on
May 21, 2024. On May 31, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a response to Defendant Phan’s
objections to the proposed judgment. 
 
On June 25, 2024, after hearing, the
Court ordered Plaintiffs to submit a new proposed judgment that was in
conformity with the Court’s ruling at trial. (06/25/24 Minute Order.) The Court
ordered Plaintiffs to remove language regarding pre-judgment interest.
(06/25/24 Minute Order.) Plaintiffs were ordered to file a proposed amendment
judgment by June 28, 2024. (06/25/24 Minute Order.) 
 
On July 8, 2024, the Court entered
final judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendant Phan on the first
and second causes of action in the principal sum of $590,000.00 plus interest
at the rate of 10 percent per annum from and after the date the final judgment
is entered. The Court also incorporated the default judgment in favor of
Plaintiff Lord and against Defendants Sandu and Legacy Communications, LLC into
the final judgment. The final judgment also awarded Plaintiffs costs and
attorneys’ fees in an amount to be determined. Defendant Phan took nothing from
Plaintiffs pursuant to the final judgment. 
 
On July 15, 2024, Defendant Phan
filed a notice of appeal, which indicates that he is appealing the Court’s July
8, 2024 judgment. 
 
On July 16, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
a memorandum of costs, in which Plaintiffs seek costs in the amount of
$95,000.00. 
 
On July 31, 2024, Defendant Phan
filed a motion to tax costs, which is set for hearing on December 12, 2024. 
 
On September 5, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed a motion for attorneys’ fees, which is set for hearing on January 23,
2025. 
 
2.     Case
No. 23STCV08230
On April 13, 2023, Plaintiff
Broadband Service Group, Inc. filed the instant action, LASC Case No. 
23STCV08230, against Defendants Legacy Communications, LLC,
Legacy Communications*, Cable Brothers, Inc., L&G Cable Construction
Company, Inc., CSP Fiber Services, Panoramavision Inc.*, Performance Auto,
Christopher Sandu, Dennis Phan, Eddie Alcaraz Nava, Cesar Solorzano, William
Young, Sofina Preap, Tony Bushala, Daniel Agullar Becerril, Tyrol M. Mitchell*,
Firstline Capital*, Capitalplus Construction Services*, LLC, State of
California Department of Motor Vehicles, and Steven Gordon in his capacity as
Director of State of California DMV. 
 
            Each of the
starred defendants above has been dismissed from the action. Defendants Sandu,
Bushala, Nava, and Mendoza are in default. 
 
            The crux of
23STCV08230 is that the defendants conspired to hide assets so that Plaintiff
could not collect on the judgment against Sandu and/or any potential future
judgment against Phan in 21LBCV00329. The complaint alleges causes of action
for: (1) civil conspiracy to defraud by concealing assets; (2) aiding and
abetting the unlawfully (sic) concealment of assets from creditors and/or
fraudulent transfer of assets; (3) conversion; (4) recovery and possession of
personal property; (5) fraud; (6) preliminary injunction; and (7) declaratory
relief. 
 
            On July 20,
2023, the Court deemed 23STCV08230 related to 21LBCV00329 with 21LBCV00329
being the lead case. (07/20/23 Minute Order.) Both cases were assigned to the
Honorable Mark C. Kim in Department S27 at Governor George Deukmejian
Courthouse for all purposes. (07/20/23 Minute Order.) 
 
            Defendants
CSP Fiber Services, Phan, and Preap filed a demurrer to the complaint on, among
others, grounds that there was another action pending between the parties
arising out of the same nucleus of operative facts. The demurrer was opposed by
Plaintiff and Defendants CSP Fiber Services, Phan, and Preap filed a reply. 
 
            In its
March 21, 2024 order concerning the demurrer, the Court opined that “the two
actions do not have identical parties, and while the second action expands the
issues to be ruled upon (to include conspiracy theories), the Court is very
concerned about the potential res judicata or collateral estoppel effect of the
first lawsuit. The parties are scheduled to try the first action to a jury on
4/22/24, only a month after the hearing on this motion. If the jury were to
conclude that Phan did NOT convert the assets that form the basis of the
instant lawsuit, then it would be difficult to see how this action, which is
for conspiracy to convert those assets, could go forward.” (03/21/24 Minute
Order at p. 5.) The Court sustained the demurer pursuant to CCP § 430.20(c) and
declined to rule on the remaining issues raised in the demurrer. (03/21/24
Minute Order at p. 5.) The Court abated this action pending trial in
21LBCV00329. (03/21/24 Minute Order at p. 5.) The Court continued the hearing
on the demurrer, as well as another demurrer filed by Defendant L&G Cable
Construction Company, Inc. in 23STCV08230, to June 4, 2024, which was six weeks
after the trial in 21LBCV00329 was set to commence. (03/21/24 Minute Order at
p. 5.) 
 
            On May 20,
2024, Plaintiff filed a supplemental opposition to the demurrer and argued that
it had prevailed in 21LBCV00329 against Phan, which rendered the action ripe
for prosecution. (06/04/24 Minute Order at p. 6.) Defendants did not file any
supplemental reply papers and, on June 4, 2024, after hearing, the Court found
the case was ripe for resolution and the Court overruled the demurrer on the
res judicata ground. (06/04/24 Minute Order at p. 6.) The Court overruled
Defendants’ demurrer to the first and fifth causes of action. (06/04/24 Minute
Order at p. 6.) The Court also overruled Defendants’ demurrer to the seventh cause
of action for declaratory relief. (06/04/24 Minute Order at p. 6.) The Court
thus overruled the demurrer filed by Defendants Phan, CSP Fiber Services, and
Preap in its entirety. (06/04/24 Minute Order at p. 7.) The demurrer filed by
Defendant L&G Cable Construction Company, Inc. was placed off-calendar due
to a settlement of the claims between them and the parties’ effectuation of a
stipulation thereto. (06/04/24 Minute Order at p. 7.) 
 
            On June 24,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant application to determine good faith
settlement with Defendants Cable Brothers Inc. and L&G Cable Construction
Company, Inc. 
            
            On July 18,
2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement, which indicates that Plaintiff
Broadband Service Group Inc. has entered into a settlement with Defendants
L&G Cable Construction Company, Inc. and Cable Brothers Inc.
 
            On August
6, 2024, Defendants CSP Fiber Services, Phan, and Preap (collectively,
“Defendants”) filed the instant motion for enforcement of interlocutory
judgment entered March 21, 2024. Defendants seek an order “for enforcement of
the interlocutory judgment effectively entered on March 21, 2024, vacating the
present trial date until such time as a final judgment is entered in . . . Case
No. 21LBCV00329 . . . .” (Not. of Mot. at p. 2:8-11.) 
 
            On October
31, 2024, Plaintiff Broadband Service Group filed and served a notice of
non-opposition indicating that it does not oppose the motion to stay
proceedings pursuant to CCP § 597 filed by Defendants. 
 
            Also, on
October 31, 2024, Defendants filed and served an opposition to the application
for determination of good faith settlement. 
 
            As of
November 7, 2024, no reply brief has been filed concerning the application for
determination of good faith settlement. Any reply brief was required to have
been filed and served at least five court days prior to the hearing. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
 
            Initially,
the Court notes that the jury trial date in this action has been vacated by the
Court. Thus, no trial date is currently scheduled in this action. 
 
3.     Motion
to Enforce Interlocutory Judgment
a.         Legal Standard
“The
pendency of another action growing out of the same transaction is ground for
abatement of the second action.” (Lawyers Title Ins. Corp. v. Superior Court
(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 455, 458.) “The purpose of [an] interlocutory
judgment . . . is to permit the trial court to retain jurisdiction over the
subsequent action so that when a final determination is had in the prior
pending action the court will be empowered to determine the issues in the
subsequent suit.” (Lord v. Garland (1946) 27 Cal.2d 840, 851.) “An order
of abatement issues as a matter of right not as a matter of discretion where
the conditions for its issuance exist.” (Lawyers Title Ins. Corp. v.
Superior Court, supra, 151 Cal.App.3 597 d 455, 460.) CCP § 597
provides that “where the defense of another action pending or a demurrer based
upon subdivision (c) of Section 430.10 is sustained (and no other special
defense is sustained) an interlocutory judgment shall be entered in favor of
the defendant pleading the same to the effect that no trial of other issues
shall be had until the final determination of that other action, and the
plaintiff may appeal from the interlocutory judgment in the same manner and
within the same time as is now or may be hereafter provided by law for appeals
from judgments.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 597.) “Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 597, when such a judgment is entered, no trial of other issues shall be
had until the final determination of the other action.” (Leadford v.
Leadford (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 571, 574.) 
 
b.         Judicial
Notice 
The Court GRANTS Defendants’ request for
judicial notice and the Court takes judicial notice of the complaint in
21LBCV00329. (Evid. Code §§ 452, 453.) 
 
            c.         Analysis 
Defendants
contend that their motion should be granted because: (1) the Court properly
abated this matter pending final resolution of 21LBCV00329 and an interlocutory
judgment issued; and (2) the Court has jurisdiction to enforce the
interlocutory judgment. Plaintiff does not oppose the granting of the instant
motion. 
 
Defendants’
counsel, Jeffrey R. Klein (“Klein”), provides a declaration. Mr. Klein states
the following: trial in 21LBCV00329 was held on April 29, 2024. (Klein Decl. ¶
4) The initial proposed judgment filed in 21LBCV00329 was not entered until
July 8, 2024, and notice was served on July 9, 2024. (Klein Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. B.)
The time for Defendants in 21LBCV00329 to file their notice of appeal will not
expire until September 9, 2024, and a notice of appeal was filed by Defendant
Phan on July 14, 2024. (Klein Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. C.) Trial in this action is set to
commence on September 23, 2024, and should an appeal be filed, a final
determination will not be made until a remittitur issues from the Court of
Appeal. (Klein Decl. ¶ 7.) The judgment entered in 21LBCV00329 is not final as
required by CCP § 597. (Klein Decl. ¶ 8.) Counsel states that “issues of res
judicata, claim preclusion (collateral estoppel), the single judgment rule or
the prohibition of Plaintiff’s splitting of a cause of action, will not be
settled until long after the date of trial in this matter.” (Klein Decl. ¶ 8.) A
trial in this action prior to a final judgment in 21LBCV00329 would create a
substantial risk of irreparable harm to Defendants given the overlap of issues
between the matters. (Klein Decl. ¶ 9.) This action merely expands upon those
presented in 21LBCV00329 to include additional theories of liability and is, in
fact, premised on a nearly identical set of facts. (Klein Decl. ¶ 9.) The
lifting of the stay prematurely places Defendants in undue jeopardy for a
double recovery and the parties of conflicting judgments. (Klein Decl. ¶ 8.) Mr.
Klein attests that “Defendants will be irreparably harmed if the issue
presented is not resolved prior to the commencement of trial in this [a]ction.”
(Klein Decl. ¶ 10.) 
 
The
Court finds that the judgment in case number 21LBCV00329 is not final given
that Defendant Phan is currently appealing such judgment. The appeal has not
been ruled upon by the Court of Appeal. Defendants request that this action be
stayed pending a final judgment in 21LBCV00329. (Memo. of Ps and As at p.
8:12-15.) Given that 21LBCV00329 is still pending and is related to this action
as both actions involve overlapping issues, the Court finds that enforcement of
the Court’s March 21, 2024 order is appropriate. The Court finds that this action
should be stayed pending a final resolution of 21LBCV00329. Moreover, Plaintiff
consents to the granting of the instant motion. 
 
Therefore,
the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for enforcement of the interlocutory
judgment entered on March 21, 2024, pursuant to CCP § 597. The Court therefore
STAYS the instant action—Case No. 23STCV08230—until such time as 21LBCV00329 is
completely resolved. 

 
4.     Application
for Determination of Good Faith Settlement 
a.         Parties’ Positions
Plaintiff asserts that (1) there is
a good faith basis for settlement and (2) any party opposing the application
has the burden of showing that the settlement was not made in good faith. 
 
In opposition to the application,
Defendants raise the following arguments: (1) the pending settlement is not in
good faith; (2) the instant action and 21LBCV00329 are premised upon the same
nucleus of operative facts an the same alleged misappropriation of vehicles and
equipment; and (3) there has been an interlocutory judgment and this
action—including the application for determination of good faith
settlement—should be stayed. 
 
 
 
b.         Legal Standard

Any party to an action in which it is alleged
that two or more parties are joint tortfeasors or co-obligors on a contract
debt shall be entitled to a hearing on the issue of the good faith of a
settlement entered into by the plaintiff or other claimant and one or more
alleged tortfeasors or co-obligors, upon giving notice in the manner provided
by subdivision (b) of Section 1005.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (a)(1).) 
 
“In the alternative, a settling party may give
notice of settlement to all parties and to the court, together with an
application for determination of good faith settlement and a proposed order.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (a)(2).) “The application shall indicate the
settling parties, and the basis, terms, and amount of the settlement.” (Ibid.) “The notice,
application, and proposed order shall be given by certified mail, return
receipt requested, or by personal service.” (Ibid.) “Proof of
service shall be filed with the court. Within 25 days of the mailing of the
notice, application, and proposed order, or within 20 days of personal service,
a nonsettling party may file a notice of motion to contest the good faith
settlement.” (Ibid.) “If none of the nonsettling parties files a
motion within 25 days of mailing of the notice, application, and proposed
order, or within 20 days of personal service, the court may approve the
settlement.” (Ibid.) 
 
“The issue of the good faith of a settlement
may be determined by the court on the basis of the affidavits served with the
notice of hearing, and any counteraffidavits filed in response, or the court
may, in its discretion, receive other evidence at the hearing.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 877.6, subd. (b).) “A determination by the court that the settlement
was made in good faith shall bar any other joint tortfeasor or co-obligor from
any further claims against the settling tortfeasor or co-obligor for equitable
comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity, based on
comparative negligence or comparative fault.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd.
(c).) 
 
When determining whether a settlement was made
in good faith, the following factors are considered: (1) a rough approximation
of plaintiff’s total recovery and the settlor’s proportionate liability; (2)
the amount paid in settlement; (3) the allocation of settlement proceeds among
plaintiffs; (4) a recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than
he would if he were found liable after a trial; (5) the financial conditions
and insurance policy limits of settling defendants; and (6) the existence of
collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of the
non-settling defendants. (Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates
(1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, 499.) 
 
“The ultimate determinant of good faith is
whether the settlement is grossly disproportionate to what a reasonable person
at the time of settlement would estimate the settlor’s liability to be.” (City
of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1262
[citation omitted].) “[A] good faith settlement does not call for perfect or
even nearly perfect apportionment of liability.” (Abbott Ford, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 858, 875 [internal quotations omitted].)
“[O]nly when the good faith nature of a settlement is disputed, it is incumbent
upon the trial court to consider and weigh the Tech-Bilt factors.” (City
of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court, supra, 192 Cal.App.3d 1251,
1261.) 
 
c.        Judicial Notice 
The Court GRANTS Defendants’ request for judicial notice in support of
their opposition to the application to determine good faith settlement. (Evid.
Code, §§ 452, 453.) The Court therefore takes judicial notice of its March 21,
2024 minute order concerning Defendants’ demurrer to the complaint, as well as
the complaint filed in 21LBCV00329. 
 
d.        Declaration of
Plaintiff’s Counsel 
In support of the motion, Robert Lord (“Lord”) provides a declaration.
Mr. Lord is the President of Plaintiff. (Lord Decl. ¶ 1.) Plaintiff and
Defendants Cable Brothers Inc. and L&G Cable Construction Company
(collectively, the “Settling Defendants”) entered into a Settlement Agreement
and Release of Claims (the “Settlement Agreement”), effective June 5, 2024.
(Lord Decl. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff and the Settling Defendants are parties to the
Settlement Agreement. (Lord Decl. ¶ 4.) As part of the Settlement Agreement, it
was agreed that the instant application for determination of good faith
settlement would be filed. (Lord Decl. ¶ 5.) 
 
 The Settlement Agreement provides
that following the Court’s order granting the application, Defendant Cable
Brothers Inc. will make monetary payments to Plaintiff totaling $98,000.00 in
four installments and will return a certain Trailer (as such term is defined in
the Settlement Agreement) to Plaintiff. (Lord Decl. ¶ 6.) Once the monetary
payment is complete, the Trailer is physically returned to Plaintiff, and all
documents necessary to transfer the Title of the Trailer to Plaintiff have been
completed, Plaintiff will file a request for dismissal with prejudice as to
Defendant Cable Brothers Inc. only. (Lord Decl. ¶ 6.) Defendant L&G Cable
Construction Company, Inc. will be dismissed once the Court has granted the
application per the terms of the Settlement Agreement. (Lord Decl. ¶ 7.)  The Settlement Agreement contains a full and
complete mutual release of only any and all claims and causes of action between
the parties to the Settlement Agreement. (Lord Decl. ¶ 9.) Plaintiff is the
only plaintiff and will therefore receive the entire settlement payment from
Defendant Cable Brothers Inc. on account of the interest of Plaintiff in that
certain Vermeer Drill which, other than the Trailer, is the only vehicle or
equipment that Plaintiff believes is in possession of Defendant Cable Brothers
Inc. (Lord Decl. ¶ 10.) There is no evidence of fraud or tortious conduct
between the Settling Parties. (Lord Decl. ¶ 11.) The parties engaged in
multiple, arms-length settlement negotiations, which ultimately led to the
mutually agreeable settlement. (Lord Decl. ¶ 11.) The $98,000.00 settlement
figure and the return of the Trailer having a value between $10,000.00 and
$15,000.00 likely far exceeds the Settling Defendants’ proportionate liability.
(Lord Decl. ¶ 12.) Counsel states that the settlement is fair and reasonable.
(Lord Decl. ¶ 13.) 
e.        Analysis  
Pursuant to the Court’s discussion
above, the Court has granted Defendants’ motion to enforce
interlocutory judgment and has stayed this action pending
resolution of 21LBCV00329. The Court therefore cannot rule on Plaintiff’s
application for determination of good faith settlement at this time. Moreover,
even if the Court was empowered to rule on the instant application, the Court
would not grant the application given that neither the moving papers nor
declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel articulates the financial condition and
insurance policy limits of the settling defendants. 
 
            The Court
therefore deems the instant application for determination of good faith
settlement as MOOT given that the Court has stayed the instant action pending
resolution of 21LBCV00329. 
 
5.     Conclusion
Defendants’ motion to enforce
interlocutory judgment is GRANTED and the Court STAYS this action pending final
resolution of 21LBCV00329. 
 
Plaintiff Broadband Service Group
Inc.’s application for determination of good faith settlement is MOOT and the
Court will not rule upon such an application at this time. Plaintiff may
re-file and serve an application for determination of good faith settlement
once a final judgment is entered in 21LBCV00329.
