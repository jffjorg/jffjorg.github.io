And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant Tesla, Inc. has carried its burden to show that an enforceable arbitration agreement exists between the parties. The agreement in question is the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC), which contains an arbitration clause. The Judge has also ruled that the dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement and that Plaintiffs refuse to arbitrate.

The Judge has disregarded the Motor Vehicle Order Agreement (MVOA) for purposes of this ruling, as the RISC carries the burden. The Judge has also found that Defendant is not equitably estopped from enforcing the RISC and that the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable.

The Judge has granted the motion to compel arbitration and has stayed the action in its entirety pending completion of arbitration or further order of the Court. The parties are ordered to submit their dispute to binding arbitration according to the terms of the RISC.
