  Case Number:  22LBCV01086    Hearing Date:   November 14, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff, Martha
Valdez filed this complaint against her daughter, Defendant, Martha Diaz on 12/29/22,
arising out of Defendant’s alleged fraudulent transfer of Plaintiff’s property
to Defendant.
Plaintiff filed
the operative Second Amended Complaint on 12/18/23. The SAC includes causes of
action for quiet title, declaratory and injunctive relief, intentional misrepresentation (fraud), willful
concealment, elder abuse, negligence, and civil conspiracy to commit fraud.
Fredric W.
Trestor, and Charles A. Mollis, attorneys of record for Defendant, Martha Diaz,
seek to be relieved as counsel, declaring there has been a breakdown in
communication and cooperation with the client and that continued representation
is not possible. Counsel declares he served the moving papers on Plaintiff at a confirmed address. Counsel also
gave proper notice of the hearing date on this motion, as well as the FSC and
trial dates. The court notes that trial in this matter is in two months, which provides
Defendant sufficient time to obtain new counsel, and thus, Defendant will not
be prejudiced.
As such, the
unopposed motion to be relieved as counsel is granted, effective upon filing
proof of service on the client of the signed order.
Counsel is ordered
to give notice.
