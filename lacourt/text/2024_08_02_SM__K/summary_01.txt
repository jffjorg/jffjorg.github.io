Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to strike or tax the defendant's costs. The court granted the motion in part, denying it in part. The court found that the defendant is entitled to his § 998 costs, but only to the extent that the plaintiff did not receive a verdict in excess of the offer. The court also granted the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's opposition brief, which was filed late due to a ransomware attack on the Los Angeles Superior Court system.

The court then analyzed the defendant's cost memorandum and awarded costs to the defendant in the net amount of $43,846.35, subtracting the $15,000 credit from the jury's award to the plaintiff. The court also awarded the defendant a net judgment in costs in the amount of $28,846.35. The court rejected the plaintiff's claims that the defendant's expert witness fees were unnecessary or excessive, and awarded the defendant expert fees in the amount of $42,937. The court also taxed the defendant's costs in full for certain items, including filing and motion fees, jury fees, deposition costs, service of process costs, and interpreter fees.
