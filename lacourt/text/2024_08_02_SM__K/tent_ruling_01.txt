NAME:           JANIK
GALSTIAN v. RAJIV THANARATNAM 
CASE
NUMBER:     22STCV10002                                               
HEARING
DATE:    8/2/24
TRIAL
DATES:        5/6/24 to 5/13/24                      
 

 

 
TENTATIVE RULING
                                             
MOTION: 
    Plaintiff’s Motion To Strike or
Tax Defendants’ Costs 
HELD:           GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART
 
 
I.               
Background
 
              This
was a car accident whereby defendant Arun Ryan Thanaratnam (“D”) rear ended
Plaintiff Janik Galstian (“P”) at a red light. 
D admitted liability but contested damages.  After a 5 day jury trial, on 5/13/24, the
jury awarded judgment in favor of P in the amount of $15K.
 
              However,
on 4/29/24, D offered a CCP 998 offer to compromise in the amount of
$50,001.  Since P did not receive a
verdict in excess of that offer, D is entitled to his § 998 costs.  On 7/15/24, D filed a cost memorandum seeking
$95,507.70 in costs.  P now seeks to strike
D’s Cost Memorandum or in the alternative to tax D’s requested costs.
 
              Hearing
on this matter was originally set for July 26, 2024.  As such, D’s opposition brief was due 9 court
days before, that is, no later than July 15, 2024.  D’s Opposition was filed on July 23, 2024,
more than 8 days late.  However, there
was a ransomware attack on the LASC system and no e-filings were possible from
7/19 thru 7/23.  So, giving D the benefit
of the doubt that he intended to file on 7/19 but was precluded from doing so
due to the system outage, P’s Opp Brief was only 4 days late.  P accordingly moves to strike D’s Opp. Brief
for being untimely.  This Court agrees
and GRANTS such motion.  As such, this
Court will not consider D’s arguments regarding the prior 12/15/22 § 998 offer
to compromise for $25,000.  In any event,
that offer was made by prior defendant RAJIV THANARATNAM only and therefore did
not apply to eventual trial defendant Arun
Ryan Thanaratnam.
 
 
 
II.       ANALYSIS
 
A.     P’s Motion to Strike D’s Cost Memo
 
              As
a threshold matter, P gives no basis to strike D’s Cost Memorandum in its entirety
and therefore such motion is DENIED.  
 
 
 
B.  SPECIFIC CHALLENGED COSTS 
 
Item 1: Filing and Motion Fees ($1,028.15)   
 
P is correct in that both D’s
answer (filed on 5/3/22) and demurrer (filed on 4/25/23) were 
incurred
prior to D’s the § 998 motion and therefore not awardable.  These costs will be taxed by $930, leaving an
award of $98.15.
 
 
Item 2: Jury fees ($688.63)
 
$150 of these fees sought were
pre-998 offer and therefore will be taxed. 
The net jury 
fees
awardable to D is $538.63.
 
 
Item 4: Deposition Costs ($1,673.20) 
 
All these deposition costs were
incurred pre-§ 998 offer and will therefore be taxed in 
full,
leaving no award to P’s for this item.  
 
Item 5:  Service
of Process Costs ($1152.41))

 
All these costs were also incurred
pre-offer and will also be taxed in full, leaving no 
award
for this item.
 
            Item 8:  Expert Witness Fees ($64,511.34)
 
            $21,574.34 of these fees were
incurred pre-offer (including non-recoverable Hodson PI services) and will therefore
be taxed.  P’s claims that the remaining
expert witness fees should be taxed as unnecessary and/or excessive are all rejected.  Expert fees in the amount of $42,937 shall be
awarded to D.
 
            Item 9:  Court Ordered Transcripts ($25,686.40)
 
            Although this is a recoverable
expense under CCP § 1033.5(a)(9), this Court ordered no trial transcripts and
so this amount shall be taxed in full and none awarded to D.
 
            Item 13:  Interpreter Fees ($495)
 
            This item was also incurred pre-offer and shall
therefore be taxed in full and no amount awarded to D.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
III.  CONCLUSION
 
            P’s motion to tax D’s Cost
Memorandum is GRANTED in the amount of $51,661.35.  As such, costs are awarded to D in the net
amount of $43,846.35 [$95,507.70 - $51,661.35 = $43,846.35].  Subtracting the $15,000 credit from the jury’s
award to P, the net judgment in costs awarded to D is $28,846.35.
