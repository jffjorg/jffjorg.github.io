Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award
Moving Party: Defendant Keenan & Associates
Responding Party: None
 
T/R:     THE PETITION TO CONFIRM ARBITRATION
AWARD IS GRANTED.
 
PETITIONER TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the
tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing counsel
(or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving
papers.  No opposition has been
received.  
 
Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition
the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  (CCP § 1285.) 
Defendant has complied with CCP § 1285.4: it has set forth the name of
the arbitrator (Hiro Aragaki), attached documents evidencing an agreement to
arbitrate, and attached a copy of the arbitration award. 
 
The Court file reflects that Plaintiff
filed no response to the petition.  (See
CCP § 1290.6 [“A response shall be served and filed within 10 days after
service of the petition”].)  As Plaintiff
has not filed a timely response, the allegations of the petition are deemed
admitted by Plaintiff.  (CCP § 1290.) The
petition is GRANTED.
