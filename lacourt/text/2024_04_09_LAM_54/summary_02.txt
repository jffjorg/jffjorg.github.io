And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's Pitchess motion, which seeks the disclosure of peace officer personnel records. The plaintiff, a helicopter pilot and LAPD officer, alleges that the defendant, the City of Los Angeles, discriminated against her based on her sex. The plaintiff seeks records related to the qualifications and employment history of individuals selected for the Instructor Pilot position instead of her, as well as documents related to the Department's rationale for selecting these other individuals. The judge has found that these records are relevant and discoverable.
