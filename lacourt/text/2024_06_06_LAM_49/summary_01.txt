```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denied the defendant's motion for summary adjudication because the defendant failed to provide sufficient statutory notice. The defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint was granted, and the cross-complaint must be filed within 10-days of the ruling. The cross-complaint will add new parties, including the seller, listing agent, and title company, as cross-defendants. The judge noted that the defendant's motion for summary adjudication was borderline frivolous and advised the defendant to ensure that any future motions follow all procedural requirements and contain competent and admissible evidence.
