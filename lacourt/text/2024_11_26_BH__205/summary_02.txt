And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Allen Ashkenazi v. Drewella Selan McLennon, et al. The case arises from a motor vehicle v. pedestrian accident on July 25, 2023, in which Plaintiff Ashkenazi was injured. Defendant McLennon was driving in the course and scope of her employment with co-defendants Stepping Stones Group and Center for Behavioral Education and Social Therapies.

Plaintiff Ashkenazi propounded discovery requests, which were not timely responded to by the defendants. As a result, Plaintiff filed motions to compel and requested sanctions.

The judge has denied Plaintiff's motions to compel as moot, since the defendants have since served their responses. However, the judge has granted in part and denied in part Plaintiff's request for sanctions. The judge has awarded sanctions in the amount of $3,200.92 jointly and severally against Defendant McLennon and her counsel's law firm Zelm, Erlich & Mack.

The judge has also awarded sanctions in the amount of $2,287.96 for the defendants' failure to timely respond to Plaintiff's special interrogatories and $912.96 for their failure to timely respond to Plaintiff's document demands.

The judge has denied Plaintiff's request for issue and evidentiary sanctions, as Plaintiff has not specified what issues he seeks to be admitted or evidence he seeks to preclude.

The case is set for a hearing on November 26, 2024, in Department 205 of the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, West District, Beverly Hills Courthouse.
