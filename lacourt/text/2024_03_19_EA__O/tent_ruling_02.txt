[1] Per the court’s
previous tentative, Doe Defendants have now been dismissed. 


[2] Though the form
does not clearly indicate, the court intended to dismiss Kim’s cross-complaint.
(See 11/17/21 minute order.) 
 


[3] A review of the
complaint, which governs the damages, indicates that attorney fees are not
sought. Additionally, it is unclear how Plaintiff’s Counsel would be entitled
to attorney fees absent an agreement/contract, statute, or other exception to
the American Rule.
