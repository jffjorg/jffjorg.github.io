Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The court requests that the Plaintiff file a proposed order (JUD-100) and provide courtesy copies of the default judgment material at least 16 court days before the next hearing date. The court's reasoning is that the Plaintiff has not provided a complete JUD-100 form and has failed to notify the court of related cases. The court also expresses concerns that the Plaintiff may be attempting to circumvent claim or issue preclusion defenses.
