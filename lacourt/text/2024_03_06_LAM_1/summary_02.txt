And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Plaintiff's motions for reconsideration of the court's order granting Defendant's motion for attorneys' fees. The court found that Plaintiff's initial motion was procedurally defective and did not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1112(a). The subsequent motion was also denied because it did not demonstrate new or different facts or circumstances warranting reconsideration. The court also exercised its discretion not to consider a supplemental declaration filed by Plaintiff because it was untimely. The court concluded that Plaintiff failed to meet their burden of demonstrating a basis for reconsideration and that their arguments regarding the merits of the underlying litigation were not properly before the court on a motion for attorneys' fees.
