MARTINS vs HOWARD LONG, et al.
Plaintiff
Antonio Martins’ Motion to Relate Cases
 
TENTATIVE
RULING:   Plaintiff Antonio
Martin’s Motion to Relate Cases is DENIED. Counsel for Defendants Howard Long
and Long Odyssey, Inc. to give notice.
 
Background of 21STCV33424 Martins
v. Long
 
On September 10, 2021, Plaintiff
Antonio Martins filed 21STCV33424 against Howard Long and Long Odyssey, Inc.
asserting claims for motor vehicle negligence and negligence per se. The
complaint alleges Defendant Howard Long caused an automobile collision on
September 30, 2019 near Wilshire and Rodeo Drive that resulted in Plaintiff’s
injury. Plaintiff alleges Howard Long was acting within the course and scope of
his employment for Defendant Long Odyssey, Inc. when the collision occurred. 
 
On January 12, 2022, Defendant
Howard Long filed an answer. Defendant Long Odyssey, Inc. filed an answer on
February 3, 2022. 
 
On April 28, 2022, Plaintiff
filed a Notice of Related Case involving 21STCV33424 and 22STCV13942 Martins
v. Lee. Commissioner Paul Bruguera issued an order on June 2, 2022 denying
the Notice on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to file the Notice in
22STCV13942 and noting the cases involved separate accidents. 
 
On June 23, 2022, Plaintiff
submitted a new Notice of Related Case. On July 12, 2022, the court served a
Notice of Rejection of Electronic Filing dated June 23, 2022, which stated the
Notice “was returned based on the following reason(s): Other - Denied
without prejudice to filing of noticed motion.”
 
On August 29, 2023, Plaintiff
submitted a third Notice of Related Case. On September 7, 2023, the court
served a Notice of Rejection of Electronic Filing dated August 29, 2023, which
again stated the Notice “was returned based on the following reason(s): Other -
Denied
without prejudice to filing of noticed motion.”
 
On October 18, 2023, non-party Gibran Lee, who is the
Defendant in 22STCV13942, filed a Motion to Deem Cases Related and to
Consolidate for All Purposes Including Trial with the hearing set in Department
31 of the Spring Street Courthouse. On January 25, 2024, the Judge Michelle C.
Kim denied this motion, stating: “[t]he two cases arise from separate
automobile accidents occurring nearly one year apart from each other, at
different locations, and do not warrant relating the two. Even if the Court
were to consider Lee’s arguments that Plaintiff sustained similar injuries in
both accidents with overlapping treatments, each automobile accident is an
independent action involving different parties, witnesses, and circumstances of
the incident. (CRC, Rule 3.300.) Further, the Court notes the proximity of the
trial date in the instant action, currently set for March 12, 2024. Based on
the foregoing, the request to deem the two cases related is denied.”
 
This case is currently pending in
Department 31 of the Spring Street Courthouse with trial set for July 18, 2024.
 
Background
of 22STCV13942 Martins v. Lee
 
On April 27, 2022, Plaintiff
Antonio Martins filed 22STCV13942 against Gibran Lee asserting claims for motor
vehicle negligence and negligence per se. The complaint alleges Defendant Lee
caused an automobile collision on July 10, 2020 near Tremaine Avenue that
resulted in Plaintiff’s injury.
 
Defendant Lee filed an answer on
August 29, 2022. On April 3, 2023, Defendant Lee filed a motion to consolidate,
which Judge Kerry Bensinger took off-calendar on August 2, 2023 citing
procedural defects. 
 
This case is currently pending in
Department 27 of the Spring Street Courthouse with trial set for April 9, 2024.

 
Defendants’
Evidentiary Objections
 
Objection Nos. 1, 3, and 4 are
OVERRULED. Objection No. 2 is SUSTAINED. 
 
Motion to Relate Cases
 
Standard 
 
In the event that the pertinent judge under California
Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1) does not relate any of the cases set forth in
a Notice of Related Case, Department 1 may relate the matters on noticed
motion. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D); LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3).) 
 
The Court Declines to Relate the Two
Cases  
 
The court denied Plaintiff’s request to relate the two
cases on June 2, 2022, June 23, 2022,
and on August 29, 2023. The court also denied a motion to relate filed by
Defendant Lee on January 25, 2024.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is properly before Department 1. (Cal.
R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D), LASC Local Rule 3.3(f)(3).)   
 
Cases
are related when they (1) involve the same parties and are based on the same or
similar claims, (2) arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or substantially
identical questions of law or fact, (3) involve claims against, title to,
possession of, or damages to the same property, or (4) are likely for other
reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by
different judges. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a).)
 
Plaintiff contends the cases “should be related because:
(1) they require the determination of the same or identical questions of law
and fact; and/or (2) are likely for other reasons to require substantial
duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges.” (Mot. at
6:5-7.) Specifically, Plaintiff contends “[t]here is a substantial overlap in
injuries and medical treatment in relation to the first and second accidents,”
(id. at 7:10-11), and cites potential commonalities in determining causation
and damages in both cases. 
 
To be related pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule
3.300(a)(2), the cases must “arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact.” Plaintiff’s motion contends
the cases are related based solely upon the second portion under this
subsection: that the cases “require[e] the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact.” (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(2).)
As Plaintiff acknowledges, the cases “arise from two automobile accidents
occurring approximately ten months from one another.” (Mot. at 3:15-16.)
Accordingly, the cases are not related under Rule 3.300(a)(2) as they do not
arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or
events.
 
The cases also will not require a substantial duplication
of judicial resources if the cases are heard by different judicial officers,
(Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(4), and this Court agrees with the January 25, 2024
order declining to relate the two cases. 
The two cases involve entirely different alleged accidents, involving
different defendants, occurring at different times, and in different places.
The judicial officers in each case will be required to address different
factual and legal issues related to each incident, including the applicable
duty of care and breach thereof as well as the potential liability of the named
entity Defendant in 21STCV33424. The issues of causation and damages identified
by Plaintiff are not sufficient to demonstrate there will be a substantial
duplication of judicial resources if the cases proceed separately. Moreover,
both cases have been pending for a significant time and will soon proceed by
separate jury trials: 21STCV33424 on July 18, 2024 and 22STCV139412 on April 9,
2023. The Court finds the cases are not related within the meaning of
California Rules of Court, rule 3.300.
 
The Court separately finds good cause not to relate the
actions. (See Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(g) (permitting consideration of whether
there is good cause not to relate cases).) Plaintiff significantly delayed the
filing of the instant motion. The trial dates in both actions are approaching
and relation would likely substantially delay trial in both cases. 
 
Plaintiff’s motion is DENIED.
