And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Antonio Martins' motion to relate cases 21STCV33424 and 22STCV13942. The two cases involve separate automobile accidents at different times and locations, and the judge finds that they do not meet the criteria for relation under California Rules of Court, rule 3.300. The judge also notes that the cases have been pending for a significant time and will soon proceed to separate jury trials, and that relation would likely substantially delay trial in both cases.
