Background
 
On September 16, 2022, Plaintiff
Kimi Kim filed this unlawful detainer action against Toni Aguilar, Norma
Aguilar, Jose Aguilar, and Abi Aguilar related to real property located at 1651
E. 42 St. #2 Los Angeles, CA 90011. 
 
On April 24, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a second unlawful detainer action against Tony Aguilar, Norma Aguilar,
Taurino Aguilar, Jose Aguilar, Abi Aguilar, and Laura Velzqez related to the
same property in Los Angeles Superior Court case 23STUD04469.
 
On May 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
third unlawful detainer action against Taurino Aguilar, Laura Velzouez, Norma
Aguilar, Tony Aguilar, Jose Aguilar, and Abi Aguilar related to the same
property in Los Angeles Superior Court case 23STUD04875.
 
On June 2, 2023, the court issued
an order relating the three cases. On July 19, 2023, the court issued an order
consolidating the three cases for all purposes. 
 
On July 27, 2023, Judge Richard
J. Burdge, Jr. presided over trial on the consolidated cases. On July 28, 2023,
the court entered a minute order ordering judgment in favor of Defendants Toni
Aguilar and Norma Aguilar and ordering the dismissal of the complaints filed on
April 24, 2023 and May 2, 2023 without prejudice. On July 28, 2023, the court
also entered a corresponding judgment for Defendants Norma
Aguilar, Antonio Aguilar, Taurino Aguilar, and Laura Velasquez.
 
On January 18, 2024, due to the unavailability of Judge
Richard J. Burdge, Jr., Department 1 issued an order granting Defendants’
motion for attorneys’ fees.
 
Motion
and Reply
 
On January 25, 2024, Plaintiff
Kim filed a two-page pleading document entitled “Motion for Reconsideration,”
which was only a notice of motion indicating Plaintiff sought reconsideration
of the Court’s “Judgment for Attorney’s Fees.”
 
On January 29, 2024, Plaintiff
Kim filed a new “Motion for Reconsideration of Granting of Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees,” which was complete with a notice of motion, memorandum, and
declaration. 
 
While the two documents were
filed under different reservation numbers in the Court Reservation System, they
were noticed for the same date and seek the same relief. Accordingly, the Court
addresses the motions in a single order. 
 
On February 27, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a two-page pleading document entitled “Reply to the Opposition to Motion
for Reconsideration.” However, the Court did not receive a timely filed
opposition. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1005.) 
 
Motion for Reconsideration
 
Standard 
 
“When an application for an
order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part,
or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the
order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of written notice of
entry of the order and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or
law, make application to the same judge or court that made the order, to
reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. The party
making the application shall state by affidavit what application was made
before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new
or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1008(a).)  
 
Plaintiff’s
January 25, 2024 Filing is Procedurally Defective
 
On January 25, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a two-page notice of motion, which was not accompanied by any other
documents. Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1112(a), “the papers
filed in support of a motion must consist of at least the following: (1)  A notice of hearing on the motion; (2)  The motion itself; and (3)  A memorandum in support of the motion.” The
January 25, 2024 filing did not comply with this requirement and was not
accompanied by the requisite declaration when seeking reconsideration under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request
for reconsideration filed on January 25, 2024 is DENIED.
 
Plaintiff’s
January 29, 2024 Filing Does Not Demonstrate a Basis for Reconsideration 
 
On
January 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a new motion for reconsideration of the
Court’s order granting Defendant’s motion for attorneys’ fees. 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion was initially accompanied by two separate declarations by Plaintiff Kim.
In the declaration dated January 25, 2024, Plaintiff accuses Defendant’s
attorney of misrepresentation and malpractice during the litigation, contends
the building was well-maintained, and refers to Laura Velzquez as “a very
dangerous person.” In the declaration dated January 16, 2024, Plaintiff
summarily contends the Tenant Estoppel Certificate is the only governing
document and any Rental Agreement “is fraud and should not be part of this
action.” All the information provided by Plaintiff was known and available at
the first hearing. (In re Marriage of Herr (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1463,
1468 (“A motion for reconsideration must be based on new or different facts,
circumstances or law [], and facts of which the party seeking reconsideration
was aware at the time of the original ruling are not ‘new or different.’”).)
Neither of these declarations demonstrate new or different facts or
circumstances warranting reconsideration. 
 
On
February 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a “supplemental declaration” in support of
the motion. The Court finds this declaration untimely and exercises its
discretion not to consider it. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1005(b) (“all moving and
supporting papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court days before the
hearing.”); Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.1300(d).) On February 27, 2024, Plaintiff filed
another supplemental declaration, which is improper. (Jay v. Mahaffey
(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537 (“The general rule of motion practice, which
applies here, is that new evidence is not permitted with reply papers.”); Valentine
v. Plum Healthcare Group, LLC (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 1076, 1089 (“New
evidence is generally not permitted with reply papers.”).) However, even if the
Court were to consider these declarations, they do not provide any basis to
reconsider the Court’s order granting attorneys’ fees. Plaintiff’s arguments
regarding the merits of the underlying litigation are not properly before the
Court on a motion for attorneys’ fees and Plaintiff’s disagreement with the
Court’s determination that Defendants are entitled to attorneys’ fees is not a
basis for reconsideration. (See e.g. Gilberd
v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.)
 
In
the supporting memorandum, Plaintiff contends she is “disabled due to the
assault and battery by Defendant Tenant, Laura Velazquez” which allegedly
occurred on September 8, 2022. (Mot. at 2:23-3:8.) Plaintiff also contends she
filed three unlawful detainer cases “as defendant Laura Velazquez was a
dangerous person” and the police told plaintiff that the assault can be the
ground for another Unlawful Detainer Action.” (Mot. at 3:21-23, 4:1.) Plaintiff
also reasserts her prior contention that Defendant’s counsel “received
$1,000.00 each month from defendants.” (Mot. at 4:6-7.) Other than citing the
reconsideration statute, (Mot. at 2:12-21), Plaintiff’s motion is not supported
by any legal authority demonstrating reconsideration of the Court’s order granting
Defendant’s motion for attorneys’ fees is warranted. Accordingly, Plaintiff
failed to meet her burden as the moving party. (Finn v. G. D. Searle &
Co. (1984) 35 Cal.3d 691, 701–702 (“Neither a trial court nor a reviewing
court in a civil action is obligated to seek out theories plaintiff might have
advanced, or to articulate for him that which he has left unspoken.”); Fenton v. City of Delano (1984) 162
Cal.App.3d 400, 410 (“A point totally unsupported by argument and authority may
be rejected by the reviewing court without discussion.”).) 
 
Plaintiff
has not demonstrated any basis for reconsideration of the Court’s January 18,
2024 order and the January 29, 2024 motion is DENIED.
