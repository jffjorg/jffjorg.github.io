RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
Defendant Filippo Marchino moves “to seal and/or redact pleadings, trial
exhibits, and portions of trial transcripts containing any personal address formerly
affiliated with Defendant.” (Mot., 1:25-28.)
             
BACKGROUND
 
This
is a dog bite case. Plaintiffs Ik Hoon Choi and Hannah Choi sued defendant
Filippo Marchino on September 4, 2020, asserting a single cause of action for
negligence.
 
The
case was tried to a jury; the jury returned a verdict on May 6, 2024, finding
that Defendant’s dog did not bite plaintiff Ik Soon Choi as alleged.
(05-06-2024 Minute Order, p. 2.) The Court entered judgment for Defendant
against plaintiff Ik Soon Choi on June 7, 2024, and amended its judgment to
include plaintiff Hannah Choi on June 21, 2024.
 
On
June 6, 2024, after the verdict but before judgment was entered, Defendant
filed the instant motion to seal or redact references to his address that
appear in the record.
 
On
June 25, 2024, Plaintiffs opposed Defendant’s motion, and on July 1, 2024,
Defendant replied.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
The motion is DENIED.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Unless
confidentiality is required by law, court records are presumed to be open to the
public.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(c).)¿In order to seal court records, a
party must first obtain a court order via noticed motion. (Id., Rule
2.511(a), (b)(1).) In order to issue such an order, the court must find:
 
(1) There exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of
public access to the record; 
 
(2) The overriding interest supports sealing the record; 
 
(3) A substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be
prejudiced if the record is not sealed; 
 
(4) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and 
 
(5) No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest. 
 
(Id., Rule
2.550(d); NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court (Locke)
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1217-1218.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant has not
made the showing necessary for the Court to order records sealed or redacted.
 
Defendant argues
disclosure of his (former) personal address violates his right to privacy. The
Court is not convinced it does; regardless, Defendant’s right to privacy does
not, by itself, override the public’s right of access to Court records.
 
Defendant attests he
has been “followed, harassed, had websites put up about [him], stalked, and
robbed”, and “[g]oons were sent to [his] house” as a result of some of his work
as a consumer rights litigator. (Marcino Decl., ¶ 2.) This brief conclusory
testimony does not demonstrate a substantial probability that his safety will
be prejudiced if the record is not sealed.
 
Defendant has also
not proposed specific, narrowly tailored redactions. He seeks an order sealing
the entire trial transcript and multiple pages of twenty-five (25) other
filings, as well as seven deposition records and audio recordings in their
entirety. The proposal is not narrowly tailored, nor has Defendant demonstrated
it is the least restrictive means of achieving his objective.
 
Finally, perhaps
most importantly: Defendant had the opportunity to seek a protective order or
to move for an order sealing this information from public view at a prior time.
“[T]here
is no justification for sealing records that contain only facts already known
or available to the public.” (H.B. Fuller Co. v. Doe¿(2007) 151
Cal.App.4th 879, 898.)
 
Defendant’s motion is denied.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant’s motion is denied.
 
Moving party to give notice.
