And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most qualified. The plaintiff had served a notice of deposition on the defendant, but the defendant objected to the notice and did not appear for the deposition. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to meet and confer with the defendant and did not set forth specific facts showing good cause for the motion. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions. The parties are advised to give notice of their intentions to submit on this tentative.
