And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Patrick Kennedy v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, et al. The case arises from a personal injury dispute between the parties. The judge has sustained the demurrer filed by LACMTA, which means that the judge has ruled that the complaint filed by Plaintiff is defective and cannot proceed as filed. The judge has given Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint, which means that Plaintiff has the opportunity to revise and re-file the complaint.

The judge has also denied LACMTA's Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' punitive damages allegations. The judge has ruled that the allegations of punitive damages are not recoverable from LACMTA, a public entity, but that Plaintiff may still pursue punitive damages in connection with its second cause of action, which is against Doe Defendants.

The judge has ordered Plaintiff to file an amended complaint on or before October 18, 2024. The judge has also cautioned Plaintiff's counsel to comply with all meet and confer requirements going forward, as failure to do so may result in sanctions.
