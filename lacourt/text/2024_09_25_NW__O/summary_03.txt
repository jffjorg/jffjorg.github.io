And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for leave to amend its answer to the complaint. The defendant seeks to add a single affirmative defense under Bus. & Prof. Code §7507.13(b). The judge finds that the proposed amendment will not prejudice the plaintiff and is in the interest of justice. The judge also notes that the parties do not dispute the repossession of the Vehicle, which was carried out by "Lightning Recovery", and therefore, no further discovery or investigation is necessary. The plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion, and the judge deems this a consent to the granting of the motion. The defendant is ordered to file and serve its proposed amended answer on or before September 26, 2024.
