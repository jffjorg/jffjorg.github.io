I.

compel the deposition of Defendant’s Person Most Knowledgeable (“PMK”).

PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On May 30,
2023, Plaintiff filed his Complaint, alleging (1) Violation of Song-Beverly
Act- Breach of Express Warranty; (2) Violation of Song Beverly Act- Breach of
Implied Warranty; and (3) Violation of The Song Beverly Act Section 1793.2. 
On June 30,
2023, Defendant filed its answer. 
On February
5, 2024, the parties stipulated to a protective order, which this Court approved.

On June 25,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel the Deposition of
Defendant’s PMK (“Motion”). 
On July 29,
2024, Defendant filed its Opposition. 
On August 2,
2024, Plaintiff filed his Reply. 
On August 7,
2024, this Court continued the hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion, issued its Song-Beverly
Act Addendum, and ordered the parties “further meet and confer BY TELEPHONE, IN
PERSON, OR REMOTE VIDEO PLATFORM and file a Joint Status Update on or before
Wednesday, September 4, 2024. Written correspondence shall not be acceptable
except to memorialize what occurred in the conference.”
On August 8,
2024, Plaintiff filed a Third Amended Notice of Deposition of Defendant’s PMK. 
On September
4, 2024, the parties filed a Joint Trial Setting Conference Statement which was
silent as to their meet and confer efforts despite the Court’s order.
III.        
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.450(a)[1]
provides that, “[i]f, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action… without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it…, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”  
Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.410(a),
provides that, “[a]ny party served with a deposition notice that does not
comply with [the notice requirements in Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2025.210
through 2025.290] waives any error or irregularity unless that party promptly
serves a written objection specifying that error or irregularity at least three
calendar days prior to the date for which the deposition is scheduled, on the
party seeking to take the deposition and any other attorney or party on whom
the deposition notice was served.”
Finally, Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.290,
which provides for a limit of seven hours of total testimony of a witness, does
not apply to the deposition of a person designated as the person most qualified
to be deposed. (See Code. Civ. Proc. § 2025.290(b)(5).) 
IV.         
ANALYSIS
A motion set forth under Code
of Civil Procedure § 2025.450 must be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration or, when the deponent does not attend the deposition, a
“declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.” (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(b)(2).) 
Plaintiff noticed the deposition of
Defendant’s PMK on January 5, 2024, and again on March 8, 2024. (See Declaration
of Daniel Gopstein filed June 25, 2024 (“Gopstein Decl.”), ¶¶ 25, 27.) The
parties set the deposition for June 19, 2024. (See Declaration of Samantha
Geraghty filed July 29, 2024 (“Geraghty Decl.”), ¶¶ 5-7.) Defendant served
responses to Plaintiff’s notice on June 12, 2024. (See Geraghty Decl., ¶
7.) Plaintiff served a “meet and confer” letter on Defendant on June 19, 2024.
(See Gopstein Decl., ¶ 29; Geraghty Decl., ¶ 9.) 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion on
June 25, 2024, before Defendant responded to his meet and confer letter. (See
Geraghty Decl., ¶ 10.) Defendant attempted to set a deposition date of
November 1, 2024, after the filing of the instant Motion, but, after an initial
acknowledgement, Plaintiff did not respond. (See Geraghty Decl., ¶¶
11-18.)
Having observed the parties’ poor
attempts at meeting and conferring, the Court issued a Minute Order, dated
August 7, 2024, continuing the hearing
on Plaintiff’s Motion, issuing its Song-Beverly Act Addendum, and ordering the
parties “further meet and confer BY TELEPHONE, IN PERSON, OR REMOTE VIDEO
PLATFORM and file a Joint Status Update on or before Wednesday, September 4,
2024.” (Minute Order dated August 7, 2024, (emphasis in original).) 
The parties did not do as the Court directed.
Instead, Plaintiff filed a third amended notice of deposition of Defendant’s
PMK, setting the deposition for March 19, 2025. (See Plaintiff’s Third Amended Notice of Deposition of
Defendant’s PMK.) Because the parties did not do as this Court asked, the Court
is unsure why Plaintiff’s third notice was filed with this Court. Have
the parties met and conferred and decided upon a mutually agreeable date and
the Motion is now moot? Is this notice further proof of Defendant’s alleged
lack of cooperation and “stonewalling”? Plaintiff provides no explanation. 
At any rate, the Court finds Plaintiff
is not entitled to an order compelling the deposition of Defendant’s PMK. Plaintiff’s
single meet and confer letter,[2]
abject failure to obey this Court’s August 7th directive, and what
appears to be a general disinterest in actually setting a deposition date demonstrate
Plaintiff is not entitled to this Court’s intervention. 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion is
DENIED.
V.            
SANCTIONS 
Code of Civil
Procedure § 2025.450(g)(1) provides: “[i]f a motion under subdivision (a) is
granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition
and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated,
unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”
Plaintiff did
not request sanctions for his Motion until his Reply, where he requested
$3,175.00 in discovery sanctions. 
Plaintiff did
not prevail on his Motion, nor did he properly request sanctions in his Notice
of Motion. 
Defendant did
not request sanctions. 
Accordingly,
the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request for discovery sanctions. 
VI.         
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel the Deposition of
Defendant’s PMK.
The Court
also DENIES Plaintiff’s request for sanctions. 
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
DATED:      September 25, 2024
