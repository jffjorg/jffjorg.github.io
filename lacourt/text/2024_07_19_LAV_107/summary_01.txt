And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to quash service of summons is denied. The defendant, The Testing Company, LLC, argued that service was improper because the plaintiff used the company's Wyoming name instead of its California name when serving the summons. However, the court found that service was proper because the defendant acknowledges receiving actual notice of the summons and first amended complaint, and the plaintiff provided a declaration from its counsel stating that no response was received when attempting to serve defense counsel on behalf of "The Testing Company". The court also noted that there is a presumption of valid service when presented with a proof of service from a registered process server. Therefore, the defendant is ordered to file a responsive pleading to the first amended complaint within 30 days of the court's order.
