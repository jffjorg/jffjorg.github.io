The Judge's tentative ruling is a response to the Defendant's Motion to Strike references in the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC). The Plaintiff, Joshua Saeta, filed the FAC against the Defendants, West Hills Hospital and Medical Center and HCA Healthcare, Inc., alleging various claims including dependent adult neglect, medical battery, and negligence. The Defendant seeks to strike references in the FAC related to the nursing union, reporting duties, events at other HCA hospitals, and other instances of negligence. The Judge denies the Motion to Strike, ruling that it is an improper line-item veto. The Judge concludes that the subject references are not irrelevant or improper and allows them to remain in the FAC. Counsel are encouraged to submit on the tentative ruling and to use LACourtConnect rather than appearing in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
