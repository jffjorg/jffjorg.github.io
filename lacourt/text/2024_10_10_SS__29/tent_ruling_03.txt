 Case Number:  21STCV46993    Hearing Date:   October 10, 2024    Dept:  29 Tripolskiy v. Clubbizz, LLC
21STCV46993
Plaintiff’s Motion for Terminating, Issue, Evidence, and Monetary Sanctions
Tentative
The motion is denied as untimely.
Background
This is a personal injury case
that arises out of an alleged physical attack against Plaintiff Allen Leon
Tripolskiy (“Plaintiff”) that occurred at a New Year’s Eve event on December
31, 2019, at a club on Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles.
Plaintiff filed his Complaint on
December 27, 2021, asserting causes of action for negligence, premises
liability, and negligent hiring, training, and supervision against Defendants
Clubbizz.LLC (“Defendant”), Douglas C. MacLise, Alyce R. MacLise, and Does 1
through 50.
On December 2, 2022, Defendant filed
an Answer.  On the same day, Defendant
filed a Cross-Complaint against Roes 1 through 100.
On June 5, 2023, Plaintiff
amended his Complaint to name Salient Consulting Group Inc. (“Salient”) as Doe
1.
On August 1, 2023, Salient filed
a Demurrer.  On the same day, Salient
filed a Cross-Complaint against Defendant and Roes 1 through 10. 
On August 30, the Court overruled
Salient’s Demurrer to the Complaint.
On September 5, 2023, Defendant filed
an Answer to Salient’s Cross-Complaint. 
On September 29, 2023, Salient
filed an Answer to the Complaint.
On June 5, 2024, Defendant
amended its Cross-Complaint to name Salient as Roe 1.
On May 22, 2024, the Court, at
the request of Plaintiff, dismissed (with prejudice) the causes of action in
the Complaint against Salient.
On June 7 and 12, 2024, the
Court, at the request of Salient and Defendant, dismissed (without prejudice) the
causes of action in Salient’s Cross-Complaint against Defendant and the causes of
action in Defendant’s Cross-Complaint against Salient.
Before the Court at this time and
set for hearing on October 10, 2024, is Plaintiff’s motion, filed September 13,
2024, for terminating, issue, evidentiary, and
monetary sanctions against Defendant based on the alleged spoliation of
evidence.  Defendant filed an opposition
on September 30, and Plaintiff filed a reply on October 3, 2024. 
(A prior
motion filed by Plaintiff seeking similar relief was denied without prejudice,
on September 12, 2024, on procedural grounds.)
Legal
Standard
“The intentional destruction of evidence is a grave affront to the
cause of justice and deserves our unqualified condemnation.” (Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center v. Super. Ct. (1998) 18 Cal.4th 1, 4.)
“Destroying
evidence can destroy fairness and justice, for it increases the risk of an
erroneous decision on the merits of the underlying cause of action. Destroying
evidence can also increase the costs of litigation as parties attempt to
reconstruct the destroyed evidence or to develop other evidence, which may be
less accessible, less persuasive, or both.” 
(Id. at p. 8.)
Under the case law, spoliation is defined to include (among other
things) destroying evidence, altering evidence, or “the failure to preserve
evidence for another’s use in pending or future litigation.” (Williams v.
Russ (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1223.) “The duty to preserve relevant
evidence is triggered when the party is objectively on notice that litigation
is reasonably foreseeable, meaning litigation is probable and likely to arise
from an incident or dispute and not a mere possibility.” (Victor Valley
Union High School Dist. v. Super. Ct. (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 1121, 1133.)
The mere existence of a dispute or awareness of an underlying incident that subsequently
gives rise to litigation is not, in and of itself, sufficient. (Id. at
pp. 1153-1154.)
Spoliation, when it occurs, is a misuse of the discovery process.
(Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 12; Williams,
supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 1223.) The remedies under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030 for a misuse of the discovery process include (a) a monetary
sanction; (b) “an issue sanction ordering that designated facts shall be taken
as established in the action”; (c) “an evidence sanction by an order
prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from
introducing designated matters in evidence”; and, in the most serious cases,
(d) “a terminating sanction.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subds. (a)- (d).)
The discovery remedies set forth in section 2023.030 “provide a substantial
deterrent to acts of spoliation, and substantial protection to the spoliation
victim.” (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 17.)
As with all sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act, the purpose
of sanctions for spoliation is not to punish. (Newland v. Super. Ct.
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery sanction should not create a “windfall”
for a party or place a party in a better position than it would have been if
the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations under the law. (Rutledge
v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194; see also 2 Weil
& Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2024), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes v.
Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992; R.S. Creative,
Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.)
Nonetheless, a terminating sanction may be appropriate in the first instance,
without a violation of a prior court order, “in egregious cases of intentional
spoliation of evidence.” (Williams, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 1223.)
“[A] party moving for discovery sanctions based on the spoliation
of evidence must make an initial prima facie showing that the responding party
in fact destroyed evidence that had a substantial probability of damaging the
moving party’s ability to establish an essential element of his claim or
defense.” (Williams, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 1227.) Under some
circumstances, this may be sufficient to establish a “prima facie showing of
prejudice” from the loss of the evidence and to shift the burden to the party
who has destroyed the evidence to disprove the prejudice. (Ibid.) 
Request
for Judicial Notice
Defendant
requests judicial notice of a minute order from in Case No. 21STCV03729, Spikes
v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.  A minute order in another judicial proceeding
is within the scope of Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d), and so the
Court grants this request.
The
Court notes, however, that a superior court ruling is not binding authority or precedent.  The Court gives the ruling no weight.
Discussion
Plaintiff
requests terminating, issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions against Defendant
for alleged spoliation of evidence. 
Before considering the merits, the Court turns to a threshold issue raised
by Defendant.
When
this case was filed, the Court assigned a trial date of June 26, 2023.  In April 2023, on the stipulation of the
parties, the Court continued the trial date to October 25, 2023.  On Defendant’s unopposed motion, in August
2023 the Court continued the trial date to July 17, 2024.  On Defendant’s opposed motion, in June 2024
the Court continued the trial date to October 18, 2024, but the Court did not
extend any discovery deadlines (with one exception relating to Plaintiff’s
medical records); by Court order, the discovery deadlines remained, and remain,
in place with reference to the former trial date of July 17, 2024.
Defendant
argues that this motion is untimely under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020,
subdivision (a).  (Opp. at pp. 5-6.)  That statute requires that all “motions
concerning discovery” must be “heard on or before the 15th day” before
trial.  As applied here, the last day for
the Court to hear “motions concerning discovery” (with the one exception noted
above, which does not apply here) was months ago, on July 2, 2024.  
Is this
a motion “concerning discovery”?  Under
the plain language of section 2024.020, the answer is yes.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant committed
spoliation of evidence, failing to preserve and produce in discovery relevant
evidence regarding the events at issue.  The
California Supreme Court has described spoliation as a misuse
of the discovery process. (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, supra, 18
Cal.4th at p. 12; accord Williams, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 1223 [California
Court of Appeal].) The California Supreme Court has stated that the remedies
under the Civil Discovery Act, and specifically Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, for a misuse of the discovery process (include monetary, evidence,
issue, and terminating sanctions) apply to spoliation of evidence.  (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, supra,
18 Cal.4th at p. 12.)  And the California
Supreme Court has stated that the availability of remedies under the Civil
Discovery Act “provide a substantial deterrent to acts of spoliation, and
substantial protection to the spoliation victim.” (Id. at p. 17.)  
Moreover,
Plaintiff himself states in his motion that he seeks relief under “California Code
of Civil Procedure § 2023.010 et seq. [i.e., the Civil Discovery Act] and
relevant case law.”  (Notice of Motion,
at p. 2.)
Thus,
this motion alleging that spoliation occurred is a motion “concerning
discovery.”  
The
policies underlying the existence of discovery deadlines supports this
conclusion.  As the Court of Appeal has explained, the purpose of the discovery
deadlines “is to expedite and facilitate trial preparation and to prevent
delay.”  (Beverly Hosp. v. Super. Ct. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1289, 1295.)  “Without a cutoff date, the parties could tie
up each other and the trial court in discovery and discovery disputes right up
to the eve of trial or beyond.”  (Ibid.)  One could reasonably conclude that this is
precisely what is occurring here. 
Although trial is only eight days away, Plaintiff has brought this
motion and forced the parties to focus their attention on a discovery dispute
that could have a huge (and, indeed, potentially dispositive) effect on the
case, rather than spending their time and energy preparing for the trial.  (See Pelton-Shepherd Industries v. Delta
Packaging Products (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1586-1588 [holding that
trial court abused its discretion in granting motion to compel, and imposing sanctions,
after the statutory deadline without first requiring moving party to file
motion to reopen discovery].)
In his
reply, Plaintiff argues that that the discovery cutoff does not apply to this
motion, citing three cases in support of this argument.  (Reply, at pp. 5-6.)  None of these cases, however, ultimately
supports Plaintiff’s position.
First,
Plaintiff cites Valbona v. Superior Court (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525 (a
case that Defendant also cites in its opposition, although for a different
point).  In that case, the Court of
Appeal affirmed a ruling by the trial court precluding a defendant from presenting
evidence at trial when he had previously failed to produce the documents in
discovery, even stating under oath that the documents had been stolen from
him.  (Id. at p. 1545.)  In the opinion, the appellate court addressed
(and rejected) the defendant’s argument that an evidence sanction was improper
absent a violation of a prior court order compelling production, but the court
did not address the issue of timeliness. 
(Id. at pp. 1544-1546.) 
Appellate decisions are not authority for propositions that were neither
raised or addressed on appeal.  And, of
course, there is quite a difference between imposing spoliation sanctions and
the rather common situation in which a trial court orders that evidence
requested, but not produced, in discovery cannot be admitted at trial. 
Next,
Plaintiff cites Do It Urself Moving & Storage v. Brown, Leifer, Slatkin
& Berns (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 27. 
There, the Court of Appeal held that there are circumstances in which
non-monetary sanctions may be imposed for the misuse of the discovery process even
absent a violation of a prior discovery order. 
(Id. at pp. 34-36.)  This
decision also does not address the timeliness issue.
Finally,
Plaintiff cites Osborne v. Todd Farm Service (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 43,
a case in which the Court of Appeal affirmed a trial court order dismissing
plaintiffs’ case after counsel engaged in “pervasive misconduct” during trial,
including repeatedly violating the court’s rulings on motions in limine precluding
counsel from referencing certain evidence. (Id. at pp. 51-54.)  As the misconduct occurred during trial, there
was no opportunity to address the misconduct 15 or more days before trial.  And, again, this decision says nothing about
whether a spoliation motion, based on evidence occurring before trial (and in
certain respects before the complaint was filed) may be heard after the statutory
deadline for discovery motions.
In sum,
the Legislature has determined that motions “concerning discovery” must be
heard at least 15 days before trial. 
This rule serves an important purposes of allowing for the orderly proceeding
of a matter to trial.  Even if this Court
were to question the wisdom of this rule (which the Court decidedly does not), this
is a decision for the Legislature to make, and the Legislature has made it.  As Plaintiff’s motion concerns discovery, it
is untimely under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020.  On that basis, the motion is denied.  
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion as untimely. 
Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
