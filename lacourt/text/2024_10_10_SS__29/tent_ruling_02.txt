Background
On October 4, 2021, Soheil and Katherine
Sahimi (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Leonard Scheiner and Leonard Joseph Scheiner, III
(collectively “Defendants”) asserting causes of action for motor vehicle
negligence, general negligence, and loss of consortium arising out of an
automobile accident on October 3, 2019.
Defendants filed their answer on October 30,
2023.
On September 3, 2024, Defendants filed these three
motions to compel Plaintiff Katherine Sahimi (“Plaintiff”) to respond to
written discovery.  In each motion,
Defendants also seek monetary sanctions.
No opposition has been filed.
Legal
Standard
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide a
timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling response
to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate
statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party
moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party
moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
In these three
motions, Defendants seek orders compelling Plaintiff to respond to Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production
(Set One). 
On October 27,
2023, Defendants propounded the written discovery in question on Plaintiff. (Laudencia
Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A.) Plaintiff failed to respond. (Id., ¶¶ 5, 8-9.)
Defendants need not
show anything more.
Defendants’
motions to compel are granted.
Defendants’ requests for sanctions are denied.  In the chapters of the Civil Discovery Act
governing interrogatories and requests for production, the Legislature has
authorized sanctions in the context of a motion to compel initial responses “against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion to compel.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) &
2031.300, subd. (c).)  Here, however,
Plaintiff has not opposed the motion. 
Accordingly, the requests for sanctions are denied.
