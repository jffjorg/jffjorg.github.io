And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendants' motions to compel the plaintiff to respond to their form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production. The plaintiff failed to respond to these requests, and the defendants are entitled to a grant of their motions. The court orders the plaintiff to provide written, code-compliant, verified responses to the defendants' discovery requests within 15 days of notice. The court also denies the defendants' requests for sanctions, as the plaintiff has not opposed the motions.
