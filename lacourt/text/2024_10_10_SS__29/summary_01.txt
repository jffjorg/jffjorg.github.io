And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to continue the trial date and to compel a medical examination of the plaintiff. The Judge has denied the request to continue the trial date as moot, as the parties have already stipulated to continue the trial date to October 4, 2024, which has since been approved by the Court. The Judge has also denied the request to compel the medical examination of the plaintiff, but only on procedural grounds. The defendants had initially served a demand for the examination, but then changed the date of the examination without giving 30 days advance notice, which was a procedural error. The Judge has denied the request for sanctions as well, as the defendants did not successfully make or oppose a motion to compel response and compliance with a demand for a physical examination. The Judge has ordered the defendants to give notice of the ruling.
