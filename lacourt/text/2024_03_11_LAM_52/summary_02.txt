And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Arch Insurance Company's motion for an order permitting the deposit of $25,000 in bond funds with the court, dismissing it from the action, and restraining actions against it. Arch has shown good cause for the order, admitting it has no interest in the bond funds except for any remaining funds or attorney fees and costs. The court orders Arch to deposit the balance of $14,348.28 with the court within 20 days, and upon deposit, the bond shall be exonerated and Arch shall be discharged from all liability under the bond and dismissed from the action with prejudice. The court also restrains the parties to this action from prosecuting any further legal action against the bond, including cross-complainant Tywon White and cross-defendants Deocarlo Guirnela and Dawn Guirnela.
