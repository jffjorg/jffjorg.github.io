And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge regarding a motion in limine filed by Plaintiff Santos Laguna, S.A. de C.V. The motion seeks to exclude evidence regarding the purported intent of FLSA to seek Santos's consent to assign the International Agreement to Grupo Lauman or its affiliates. The Judge denies the motion, finding that it is not directed to a particular, identifiable body of evidence and would not provide meaningful guidance for the parties or witnesses. The Judge also finds that the motion improperly seeks an order summarily adjudicating a disputed issue and would circumvent procedural protections. The ruling notes that any inconsistency in the testimony of defendants' witnesses goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.
