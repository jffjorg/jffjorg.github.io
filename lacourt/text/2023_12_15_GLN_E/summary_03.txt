And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for determination of good faith settlement in a negligence action. Defendant Juan Jose Beltran moves the court to determine that the settlement between him and Plaintiff Vardan Baghdasaryan was made in good faith, thereby barring and dismissing any pending or future claims or cross-complaints against Beltran based on apportionment of fault, equitable indemnification, and declaratory relief. The settlement amount is $40,500.00, which includes attorney's fees and costs. The court grants Beltran's motion, finding that the settlement was made in good faith based on the Tech-Bilt factors, including the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling defendants, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and a recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial. The court also denies Hovsep Hovsepyan's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Beltran for comparative indemnity and declaratory relief as moot.
