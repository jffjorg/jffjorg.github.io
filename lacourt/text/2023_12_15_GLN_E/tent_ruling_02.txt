RELIEF REQUESTED¿ 
Defendant, Jones Lang Lasalle Americas, Inc., moves this Court for an order
compelling responses to its Demand for Inspection and Production of Documents
(Set No. One), as well as a request for sanctions in the amount of $560.00
against Plaintiff, Dane Stageberg, and his attorney of record, Joseph Virgilio.
 
This motion is being made pursuant
to CCP § 2031.300 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. This motion is
based on this notice, the memorandum of points and authorities, the declaration
of Alana C. Martinez, the exhibits attached hereto and served herewith, the
pleadings, records and papers on file herein, and upon such other evidence as
may be presented at the time of the hearing on this motion.
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff filed a Complaint on 03/27/2023 against Adventist Health,
Adventist Health Glendale, Doe Security Company, and Doe Security Guard. The
Complaint alleges five causes of action: (1) Negligence, (2) Negligent
Retention and Supervision, (3) Negligent Retention and Supervision, (4)
Assault, and (5) Battery surrounding allegations that Plaintiff was physically
attacked by Doe Security Company and Doe Security Guard while Plaintiff was at
AH and AHG’s facility while Plaintiff was a patient.


LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INSPECTION DEMANDS
Within
30 days after service of a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the original of
the response to it on the party making the demand, and a copy of the response
on all other parties who have appeared in the action, unless on motion of the
party making the demand, the court has shortened the time for response, or
unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been directed, the court
has extended the time for response. (CCP §2031.260(a).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand. (CCP § 2031.300(b).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with §
2018.010). (CCP § 2031.300(a).) “The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with §§ 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240,
and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result
of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP §2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)
Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion
to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding
party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a
“meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404
citing Weil and Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2006) ¶¶8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to 8:1489,
pp. 8H-29 to hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)
ANALYSIS
On August 29, 2023,
Defendant, Jones Lang Lasalle Americas, Inc.(sued as Does Security Company),
served Defendant’s Demand for Production of Documents, Set One, to Plaintiff.
(Martinez Decl. ¶2.) Defendant states that responses were due on October 2,
2023, Plaintiff did not request an extension to respond, and on October 11,
2023, a meet and confer was sent to Plaintiff requesting responses. (Decl.
Martinez ¶¶4-5.) Defendant states that to date, Plaintiff has not provided
responses. (Decl. Martinez ¶6.)

TENTATIVE RULING 
On
August 29, 2023, Defendant, Jones Lang Lasalle Americas, Inc.(sued as Does
Security Company), served Defendant’s Demand for Production of Documents, Set
One, to Plaintiff. (Martinez Decl. ¶2.) As of October 19, 2023, when
Defendant’s Counsel, Alana C. Martinez, signed their declaration, Plaintiff had
not provided responses. Since Plaintiff has not responded to this discovery
request within 30 days, Defendant’s motion is granted.
Defendant’s motion to compel responses to Demand for
Inspection and Production of Documents, Set No. One, is GRANTED. 
Sanctions
Here,
Defendant moves for sanctions in the amount of $560.00 against Plaintiff and
his attorney of record, Joseph Virgilio. 
In relevant part, 2031.300(c) states as follows:
Except as provided
in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP
§2031.300(c).)
 
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
Defendant’s counsel, explains the sanctions request as
follows:
I have spent one
and a half hours preparing all components of this motion. I anticipate that an
additional one hour will be spent preparing for and attending the hearing on
this motion. My regular and customary billing rate in this matter is $200.00
per hour. Therefore, the total fees the court should award defendant Jones Lang
Lasalle Americas, Inc. is $560.00 including the $60.00 filing fee.
 
(Decl. Martinez
¶7.)
 
The issue of sanctions will be taken up at the
hearing.
