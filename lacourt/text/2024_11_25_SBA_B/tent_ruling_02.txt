Motion
to Tax Costs
 
            The Court considered the moving,
opposition, and reply papers.
RULING
            Prevailing party American
Honda Motor Company filed a barebones 1 page Memorandum of Costs (Summary)
seeking $25,424.98 as Costs.  It merely
provides amounts for the 16 categories of costs claimed.  No other information is provided to justify
any claimed costs.
            Plaintiff
filed a Motion to Strike Costs, essentially shooting in the dark at the unknown
costs.
            The motion is CONTINUED to December __, 2024 at 8:30 and Defendant is
ordered to prepare and submit a Memorandum of Costs Worksheet on MC-011,
itemizing each cost and is ordered to attach in an organized manner corresponding
to each category a copy of each invoice or other documentary evidence that
Defendant claims supports each item of cost claimed.
            Plaintiff
shall then be permitted to file a pleading detailing Plaintiff’s objections to
the various costs claimed.  Defendant may
then file a reply to those objections.
BACKGROUND
On December 8, 2022, plaintiff
Ibeth Jennifer Meza filed a complaint against American Honda Motor Company for
violations of statutory obligations under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act. 
            On March 24, 2023, the Court denied
defendant’s motion to compel arbitration.
            On June 12, 2024, the Court granted plaintiff’s
motion to compel deposition of defendant’s PMQ.
            Trial commenced on July 17, 2024 and
was held over several days.  
            On August 2, 2024, a special verdict
was entered.
            On August 23, 2024, judgment was
entered in favor of defendant and against plaintiff.
            On September 12, 2024, defendant
filed a memorandum of costs.
            On October 1, 2024, plaintiff filed
a motion to strike or tax defendant’s costs. 
LEGAL AUTHORITY
            “Except as otherwise expressly
provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs in any action or proceeding. 
This means that the prevailing party is entitled to all of his costs
unless another statute provides otherwise. 
Absent such statutory authority, the court has no discretion to deny
costs to the prevailing party.”  Nelson
v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal. App. 4th 111, 128-29 (citations and internal
quotations omitted); CCP §1032(b) (“Except as otherwise expressly provided by
statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs
in any action or proceeding”). 
CCP §1033.5(c) states, in relevant
part:  “Any award for costs shall be
subject to the following:  
            (1) Costs are allowable if incurred,
whether or not paid.  
(2) Allowable costs shall be
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation. 

(3) Allowable costs shall be
reasonable in amount.  
(4) Items not mentioned in this
section . . . may be allowed . . . in the Court’s discretion.” 
“If the items appearing in a cost
bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax
costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.  On the other hand, if the items are properly
objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party
claiming them as costs.”  Ladas v.
California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th 761, 774
(citation omitted).   Id.  “The court’s first determination, therefore,
is whether the statute expressly allows the particular item, and whether it
appears proper on its face.  If so, the
burden is on the objecting party to show them to be unnecessary or
unreasonable.”  Nelson v. Anderson
(1999) 72 Cal. App. 4th 111, 131 (citations omitted).  “[I]t is not enough for the losing party to
attack submitted costs by arguing that he thinks the costs were not necessary
or reasonable.  Rather the losing party
has the burden to present evidence and prove that the claimed costs are not
recoverable.”  Seever v. Copley Press,
Inc. (2006) 141 Cal. App. 4th 1550, 1557.
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
requests that the Court strike defendant’s memorandum of costs or, in the
alternative, strike Items 4 (deposition costs), 8 (witness fees), 11 (court
reporter fees), 12 (exhibits), and 14 (electronic filing and service fees).
            Plaintiff
argues that defendant’s memorandum of costs is untimely, contending that the
judgment was entered on August 23, 2024, and that the memorandum of costs was
not filed until September 12, 2024.
            In
the opposition, defendant argues that its memorandum was timely filed.
            The
Court finds that the memorandum was timely filed based on the clerk’s notice of
the ruling by mail.
            Item 4:  deposition costs of $8716.82
A
prevailing party is entitled to costs associated with “taking . . . and
transcribing necessary depositions, including an original and one copy of those
taken by the claimant and one copy of depositions taken by the party against
whom costs are allowed.”  CCP 1033.2(a)(3)(A).
            Plaintiff
argues that the amount requested is excessive because defendant took only two
depositions in this matter.  Plaintiff
also asserts that defendant has failed to substantiate the costs and
demonstrate that the costs are recoverable, reasonable, and necessary.
            Item
8:  witness fees of $800
Recoverable
costs include “[o]rdinary witness fees pursuant to Section 68093 of the 
Government Code.” 
CCP §1033.5(a)(7).  Except as
otherwise provided by law, witness' fees for each day's actual attendance, when
legally required to attend a civil action or proceeding in the superior courts,
are thirty-five ($35) a day and mileage actually traveled both ways, twenty
cents ($0.20) a mile.  Gov. Code §68093.
            Plaintiff
argues that amount claimed is in excess of what the Government Code permits and
thus not reasonable in amount.  Plaintiff
asserts that the mileage for one way is approximately $25 (125 miles x .20
mile) and that at most, the amount is $170 ($35 witness fee plus $50 mileage x
2 witnesses).  
            Item
11:  court reporter fees of
$14,005.10
Only
court reporter fees “as established by statute” are recoverable under CCP §1033.5(a)(11).
Costs of acquiring transcripts are not recoverable.  See CCP §1033.5(b)(5).
            Plaintiff
argues that defendant has failed to substantiate the fees and demonstrate that
they are permitted by statute, including whether they are court reporter fees and
reasonable and necessary to the litigation.
            Item
12:  photocopies of $176.84
Photocopies
of exhibits “may be allowed if they were reasonably helpful to aid the trier of
fact.”  CCP §1033.5(a)(13).  Where exhibits were never presented to the
trier of fact, they are not recoverable. 
Segal v. ASICS America Corp. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 651, 665.
Plaintiff
asserts that the only exhibits that defendant offered, and which were admitted
into evidence, were exhibits 200, 218, p. 72, 225 and 227.  Thus, plaintiff argues, to the extent that
Honda seeks recovery of exhibits not presented to the trier of fact, the costs
should be taxed.
            Item
14:  fees for electronic filing or
service of $1163.90
CCP
§1033.5(14) allows for recovery of “fees for electronic filing or service of
documents through an electronic filing service provider if a court requires or
orders electronic filing or service of documents.”
            Plaintiff
asserts that the amount is excessive because when services such as OneLegal
advertise and charge $14.95 per filing, to get to the amount claimed by
defendant, defendant would have had to have made 78 separate filings, which was
not done in this case.
            In
reply, defendant provides copies of several invoices.
            The
Court finds that it would be helpful if defendant provided a memorandum of
costs (worksheet) that is on form MC-011, which provides the
breakdown/itemization for each cost in each category.
             The motion is thus CONTINUED.   
ORDER
            The
motion is CONTINUED to December __, 2024 at 8:30 and Defendant is ordered to
prepare and submit a Memorandum of Costs Worksheet on MC-011, itemizing each
cost and is ordered to attach in an organized manner corresponding to each
category a copy of each invoice or other documentary evidence that Defendant
claims supports each item of cost claimed.
            Plaintiff
shall then be permitted to file a pleading detailing Plaintiff’s objections to
the various costs claimed.  Defendant may
then file a reply to those objections.
            The
Court intends to discuss with the parties the appropriate dates for the filing
of the various papers and the new hearing.
Defendant
is ordered to give notice of ruling.
