Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $61,874.51. The motion was filed in a partition action between the plaintiff, Phin Kheng, and the defendant, Juliana Wu, over a property in Torrance, California. The court found that the defendant is a co-owner of the property, owning a 50% interest, and that the plaintiff's claim for quiet title was not successful. The court concluded that the defendant did not incur fees for the "common benefit" of the co-owners, but rather for the benefit of establishing her own ownership interest. The court also found that the defendant failed to provide sufficient evidentiary support for the amount expended and that the quality of work did not reflect that the claimed hours were reasonable. The motion is denied on the merits with prejudice.
