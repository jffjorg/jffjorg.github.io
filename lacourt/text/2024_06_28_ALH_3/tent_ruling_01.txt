  ORDER RE: DEMURRER TO CROSS-COMPLAINT FILED BY TRUONG NGOC 
 
Dept.

  a.m.
June 28,
   2024



 
On October
18, 2022, plaintiff Lyco 1, LLC (“Lyco 1”) filed this action for partition
against defendant Michael Cheng (“Michael”) regarding real property at 3603
Vane Avenue, Rosemead, California 91770 (the “Property”). Lyco 1 is comprised
of Randy Cheng (“Randy”) and Alice Liu (“Alice”), who are husband and wife;
Randy and Michael are brothers. (As many of the parties in this action share
the same last name, the Court refers to them by their first names for clarity
and intends no disrespect.) 
On August 23,
2023, Michael filed the First Amended Cross-Complaint against Lyco 1, Randy,
Alice, Truong Ngoc (“Ngoc”), Steve Q. Cheng, Lydia Cheng, and Fiona Cheng. Ngoc
is the mother of Randy and Michael. 
On November
21, 2023, Ngoc filed a cross-complaint against Lyco 1, Randy, and Alice,
claiming an undivided 50% tenant in common fee title to the Property. Ngoc
seeks a declaratory judgment establishing a life estate in the Property for her
benefit. Ngoc also seeks a judicial determination to settle and establish a
resulting trust. 
On January
25, 2024, Lyco 1, Alice, and Randy (collectively, “Cross-Defendants”) filed
this demurrer to Ngoc’s Cross-Complaint. Cross-Defendants argue that the
cross-complaint fails to join Michael and that the court is unable to impose a
life estate on a property owner. 
Failure to Join Michael as a Party
A party may demur to a cross-complaint
on the ground that “[t]here is a defect or misjoinder of parties.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.10, subd. (d).) Code of Civil Procedure section 389 (a) provides: 
A
person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive
the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined
as a party in the action if (1) in his absence complete relief cannot be
accorded among those already parties or (2) he claims an interest relating to
the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action
in his absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to
protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject
to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent
obligations by reason of his claimed interest. If he has not been so joined,
the court shall order that he be made a party.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 389, subd. (a).) 
          Cross-Defendants
argue that it is necessary to join Michael because Ngoc’s cross-complaint
implicates his interests in the Property. But Ngoc’s cross-complaint only seeks
a judicial determination of Cross-Defendant’s one-half interest in the Property.
The controversy does not exist between Ngoc and Michael, but between Ngoc and
Cross-Defendants. Also, Michael is already a party to this action because he
has filed his own cross-complaint against Ngoc and Cross-Defendants. Therefore,
there is no risk that his ability to protect his own interests in the Property
are impaired or impeded. Accordingly, the demurrer to Ngoc’s entire
cross-complaint on this ground is OVERRULED. 
          Failure to
State Sufficient Facts
          Next,
Cross-Defendants demur to Ngoc’s cause of action for declaratory relief on the
grounds that Ngoc fails to state sufficient facts to support her claim to a
life estate in the Property. A party may demur to a pleading on the ground that
the pleading “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) 
“A life estate is an estate whose
duration is limited to the life of the person holding it or of some other
person.” (Peterson v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 844,
850–851.) “A life estate may be granted or reserved by a deed, or it may be
created by a will. If created by deed, it is created on the delivery of the
deed; if created by will, it is created on the death of the decedent. It also
may be created by implication, as when a grantor delivers a deed to a third
party to be given to the grantee on the grantor's death. (Miller and Starr, 4
Cal. Real Est. § 12:20 (4th ed.)) “It is not essential that the term “life
estate” be used in the instrument creating the estate nor that it be declared
expressly to be a life estate if adequate words are used describing its
characteristics and showing an intention to vest a life estate.” (Ibid.)

Ngoc does not allege the factual basis
for her claim that a life estate was created for her, nor does Ngoc explain how
the Court may create a life estate absent any written instrument. Ngoc does not
allege that Cross-Defendants are estopped from asserting the statute of frauds,
nor does she allege any facts supporting such a claim. 
Accordingly, Cross-Defendant’s demurrer
to the First Cause of Action is SUSTAINED with 20 days’ leave to amend. 
 
Moving party to give notice.

[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS
 
Dept.
  3
8:30
  a.m.
June 28,
   2024



 
I.           
INTRODUCTION
On April 18,
2024, plaintiff Lyco 1, LLC (“Lyco”) filed this motion for terminating, issue,
and/or evidentiary sanctions against cross-defendant Truong Ngoc (“Ngoc”). Lyco
seeks terminating sanctions due to Ngoc’s failure to attend her deposition as
ordered by the Court on February 9, 2024, in compliance with the nonparty deposition
subpoena issued on August 30, 2023, before Ngoc filed her cross-complaint on
November 21, 2023. Lyco also seeks monetary sanctions of $3,260 for the cost to
bring this motion and $2,898.20 incurred in a prior attempt to depose Ngoc. 
II.         
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
The Court
first rules on Lyco’s evidentiary objections and sustains Objection Nos. 1, 2,
and 3.  
III.       
LEGAL
STANDARD
If a party fails to obey an order
compelling attendance, testimony, and production, “the court may make those
orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) against that party deponent or against the party with whom the
deponent is affiliated.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (h).) The Court
may also impose monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions against
anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) Misuse of the discovery process includes
failure to respond to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying a court
order to provide discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (g).) 
Before imposing terminating sanctions,
the court should consider the totality of the circumstances, including conduct
of the party to determine if the actions were willful, the detriment to the
propounding party, and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain
discovery. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) Terminating
sanctions should not be ordered lightly, but are justified where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and there is evidence that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules. (Doppes v.
Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.)
IV.       
DISCUSSION
It is undisputed that Ngoc failed to
attend her deposition and disobeyed the Court’s previous order to do so. No
opposition brief was filed, but on May 6, 2024, Ngoc’s counsel, Dan Hogue,
filed a declaration stating that his client was unable to appear for her
deposition due to medical issues. Mr. Hogue attaches a letter from Ngoc’s
cardiologist stating that Ngoc recently underwent a generator change for her
pacemaker battery and will attend a follow-up exam on May 14, 2024, at which
point she would be evaluated for any physical restrictions. (Hogue Decl., Ex. E.)
More than a month has passed since the scheduled exam and there are no updates
with the Court regarding Ngoc’s medical status or purported inability to attend
and testify at a deposition, such a declaration from Ngoc herself. 
Nevertheless, there is no evidence that
lesser sanctions would not curb Ngoc’s pattern of discovery abuse. The Court
notes from the previous minute order that no monetary sanctions were imposed.
Therefore, the Court declines to order terminating sanctions at this time. Instead,
the Court GRANTS the motion in part and imposes monetary sanctions in the
amount of $1,660, consisting of four hours at counsel’s hourly rate of $400 and
a $60 filing fee to bring this motion, to be paid within 10 days of the date of
this motion. The Court does not preclude the possibility of imposing more
severe sanctions, such as issue, evidentiary, or terminating sanctions in the
future if Ngoc fails to appear for her deposition or fails to pay sanctions as
ordered.   
The Court denies the request for costs
incurred with the deposition noticed for September 28, 2023, because as the
Court previously found, Mr. Hogue already stated he was unavailable on that
date and there was “no indication of Plaintiff’s intent to proceed with the
deposition after this discussion.” (Feb. 9, 2024 Minute Order.)   
The Court disregards Hogue’s tangential
request for a stay of discovery based on Ngoc or defendant/cross-complainant
Michael Cheng’s medical conditions. Any such request must be made through
noticed motion. 
Lyco’s motion is GRANTED IN PART. Ngoc
is ordered to pay $1,660 within 10 days of the date of this order. 
Moving party to give notice.
