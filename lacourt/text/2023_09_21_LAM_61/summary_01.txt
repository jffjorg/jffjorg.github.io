Significant Statements:
  - "There exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record; ... The overriding interest supports sealing the record; ... A substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; ... The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; ... No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest." (CRC Rule 2.550, subd. (d))
  - "The merits of the controversy between the parties are not subject to judicial review. ... Further, a court may not review the validity of the arbitrator's reasoning. ... The general rule is that, [t]he merits of the controversy between the parties are not subject to judicial review."
  - "A liquidated damages clause will generally be considered unreasonable, and hence unenforceable under section 1671(b), if it bears no reasonable relationship to the range of actual damages that the parties could have anticipated would flow from a breach."
