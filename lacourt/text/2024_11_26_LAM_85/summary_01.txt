Defendant: Christian Llamas

Tentative Ruling: Granted in part

Summary:

* The case involves a dispute over ownership and control of Yellow Owl Properties Managements, Inc. (Yellow Owl)
* Christian Llamas, the defendant, claims to be the sole owner of Yellow Owl, while Jessica and Claudia Llamas, the plaintiff's sisters, claim to be the current directors and officers of the company
* Christian has been collecting rent from tenants on behalf of Yellow Owl and depositing the funds into his own bank account
* The plaintiff seeks a preliminary injunction to enjoin Christian from entering or trespassing on Yellow Owl's properties or purporting to take an action on behalf of the company
* The defendant claims that he is the true owner of Yellow Owl and that Jessica and Claudia are not authorized to act on behalf of the company

Facts:

* Arturo Llamas, the original incorporator of Yellow Owl, passed away in December 2021
* Jessica and Claudia were appointed as directors and officers of Yellow Owl by Arturo's trust

* Yellow Owl owns the Property, and Christian and his agents entered the Property by breaking through a security gate and depositing broken-down vehicles on the premises

Applicable Law:

* A preliminary injunction is an equitable remedy available in the protection or prevention of an invasion of a legal right
* To prevail on a motion for a preliminary injunction, the plaintiff must show a likelihood of success on the merits and a balance of hardships in its favor
* The court considers two factors in determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction: (1) the reasonable probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial, and (2) a balancing of the "irreparable harm" that the plaintiff is likely to suffer if the injunction is denied against the harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the court grants the injunction

Intentions:

* The plaintiff seeks to prevent Christian from entering or trespassing on Yellow Owl's properties or purporting to take an action on behalf of the company
* The defendant claims that he is the true owner of Yellow Owl and that Jessica and Claudia are not authorized to act on behalf of the company
