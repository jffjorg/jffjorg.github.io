And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling issued by the Judge in a case involving Christian, the plaintiff. The Judge notes that Christian filed a 128-page opposition without providing a courtesy copy, in violation of the Presiding Judge's First Amended General Order re: Electronic Filing. Despite this, the Judge has read and considered the opposition and supporting declarations, but not the exhibits. The Judge grants Christian's request for judicial notice of Yellow Owl's Articles of Incorporation, which were filed on October 30, 2014 with the California Secretary of State. The Judge also overruled most of Christian's written evidentiary objections. The Judge is considering issuing an injunction to maintain the status quo, which would require Christian to take affirmative action. The Judge notes that a mandatory injunction carries a heavy burden and is only granted in extreme cases.
