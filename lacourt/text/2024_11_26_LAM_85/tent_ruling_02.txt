[1] Christian filed a 128-page
opposition without providing the court with a courtesy copy in violation of the
Presiding Judge’s First Amended General Order re: Electronic Filing.  The court has elected to read and consider
the opposition and supporting declarations but not the exhibits.


            [2] The courts look to the
substance of an injunction to determine whether it is prohibitory or
mandatory.  Agricultural Labor
Relations Bd. v. Superior Court, (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 709, 713.  A mandatory injunction — one that mandates a
party to affirmatively act, carries a heavy burden: “[t]he granting of a
mandatory injunction pending trial is not permitted except in extreme cases
where the right thereto is clearly established.”  Teachers Ins. & Annuity Assoc. v.
Furlotti, (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 187, 1493.


            [3] However, a court may issue an
injunction to maintain the status quo without a cause of action in the
complaint.  CCP §526(a)(3).


[4] Plaintiff requests the court
to take judicial notice of Yellow Owl’s Articles of Incorporation, filed on
October 30, 2014 with the California Secretary of State (RJN, Ex. 1).  The request is granted.  Evid. Code §452(c).
The court has rule on Defendant Christian’s written
evidentiary objections, most of which were overruled.  The clerk is directed to scan and
electronically file the court’s rulings.
