[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS FOR ORDERS COMPELLING PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY
  AND REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS

          On July 19,
2021, Plaintiff Sandra Gonzalez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants
Larry Parker and Wanda Parker (collectively, “Defendants”) for injuries arising
from a motor vehicle accident. 
On July 27, 2023, Defendants served
Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of
Documents, Sets One, on Plaintiff. 
Having received no responses, Defendants proceeded to file these motions
compelling Plaintiff to provide responses. Defendants also requests monetary
sanctions.
          Compel
Responses
Where a party fails to serve timely
responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve
timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on
privilege or the protection of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a),
2031.300, subd. (a).)  Unlike a motion to
compel further responses, a motion to
compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit and the propounding
party has no meet and confer obligations. 
(Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at
p. 404.)
Plaintiff has not opposed the motion nor
sent responses to date. Accordingly, the motions to compel responses are
GRANTED. 
Monetary Sanctions
Where the court grants a motion to
compel responses, sanctions shall be imposed against the party who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with
substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)  
Defendants’ requests for sanctions are
GRANTED.  Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff
and counsel of record, jointly and severally, in the amount of $1,680 for 3
hours at Defendants’ counsel’s requested hourly rate of $500 and $60 in filing
fees for each motion, to be paid within twenty (20) days of the date of this
Order.
Moving party to give notice.
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating
intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided
on the court website at www.lacourt.org. 
Please be advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to
appear at the hearing, the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the
hearing and argue the matter.  Unless you
receive a submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume
that others might appear at the hearing to argue.  If the Court does not receive emails from the
parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling and there are no
appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the
tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
Dated
this 4th day of January 2024
