And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial date from March 15, 2024 to March 1, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 27. The motion was unopposed and the judge found good cause for the continuance, citing the need to permit the hearing on the defendants' motion for summary judgment, currently scheduled for January 24, 2025, to be heard before the trial date. The judge also noted that additional discovery needs to be conducted and additional time is needed for settlement negotiations. The final status conference is continued from March 1, 2024 to a date to be determined. All pretrial deadlines, including discovery and motion cut-off dates, are to be based on the new trial date.
