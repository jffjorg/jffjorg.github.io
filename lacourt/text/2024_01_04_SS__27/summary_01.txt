Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff, Warner Yang. The plaintiff failed to comply with the court's order to provide verified responses to written discovery and pay monetary sanctions. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure was willful and that lesser sanctions would not curb the abuse. As a result, the court dismisses the plaintiff's action as to the defendant. The court also declines to impose additional monetary sanctions. The parties are advised to indicate their intention to submit on the tentative and to assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.
