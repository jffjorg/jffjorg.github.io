significant statements:

```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the trial date will be continued to June 10, 2024, and the Final Status Conference will be continued to a later date. The motion to advance the hearing date for the motion for summary judgment is denied. The judge has made this decision based on the court's policy of not advancing or specially setting motion dates, and instead continuing trial dates when other motions must be heard before trial. The judge has also considered the proximity of the trial date, the need for a continuance, and the potential prejudice to the parties.
