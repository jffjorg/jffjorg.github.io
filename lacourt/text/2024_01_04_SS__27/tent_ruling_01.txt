[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS
 
Dept. 27
1:30 p.m.
January 4, 2024



 
I.       INTRODUCTION
On November 27, 2019, plaintiff Warner
Yang filed this action against defendant Morrine Bradford arising from a November
27, 2017 motor vehicle collision.  
Defendant moves for terminating
sanctions against Plaintiff based on 
Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the Court’s Order of October 9, 2023,
which ordered Plaintiff to provide verified responses, without objections, to
the written discovery within thirty (30) days and to pay monetary sanctions.
The motion is unopposed.
II.      LEGAL STANDARD

Where a party fails to obey an order
compelling answers to discovery, “the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.300; 2023.010, subd.
(c); R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th
486, 495.)  The Court may impose a terminating sanction against
anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)  Misuse of the discovery process
includes failure to respond to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying
a court order to provide discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds.
(d), (g).)  A terminating sanction may be imposed by an order dismissing
part or all of the action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(d)(3).)   
The court should consider the totality
of the circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine if the
actions were willful, the determent to the propounding party, and the number of
formal and informal attempts to obtain discovery.  (Lang v. Hochman
(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)  If a lesser sanction fails to curb
abuse, a greater sanction is warranted.  (Van Sickle v. Gilbert
(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.)  However, “the unsuccessful imposition
of a lesser sanction is not an absolute prerequisite to the utilization of the
ultimate sanction.”  (Deyo v. Killbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771,
787.)  Terminating sanctions should not be ordered lightly, but are
justified where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and
there is evidence that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
the discovery rules.  (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) 
Before any sanctions may be imposed the
court must make an express finding that there has been a willful failure of the
party to serve the required answers.  (Fairfield v. Superior Court for
Los Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.)  Lack of diligence
may be deemed willful where the party understood its obligation, had the
ability to comply, and failed to comply.  (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 787; Fred Howland Co. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles
County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605, 610-611.)  The party who failed to
comply with discovery obligations has the burden of showing that the failure
was not willful.  (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 788; Cornwall
v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500,
605.) 
III.     DISCUSSION
          Plaintiff filed no opposition to this motion
and it is undisputed he failed to respond to discovery, failed to pay monetary
sanctions, and disobeyed a Court Order to do so.  Defendant served a Notice of Ruling on
Plaintiff.  Therefore, the Court
concludes Plaintiff knew of the discovery obligations, knew of the Court Order
compelling compliance, and failed to show noncompliance was not willful. Given
Plaintiff’s prior failures to comply with discovery obligations, failures to
meet and confer with defense counsel, and apparent disinterest in prosecuting
this action, the Court finds lesser sanctions would not curb the abuse.
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for
terminating sanctions is GRANTED and Plaintiff’s action is hereby dismissed as
to Defendant.  As the Court is granting
terminating sanctions it declines to also impose monetary sanctions. 
Moving party to give notice.
