I.           
INTRODUCTION
On March 16, 2021, Plaintiff Alexander Cedillo (“Plaintiff”) filed this negligence action
against Defendants Trevor Simons and Larry Simons (“Defendants”) arising from a
motor vehicle collision.
Trial is currently scheduled for March 15, 2024. 
Defendants seek an order continuing the trial and related dates
to a date 30 days after the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, which
is currently set for January 24, 2025. The motion is unopposed.
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
Trial dates are firm to ensure prompt disposition
of civil cases. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(a).) Continuances are thus
generally disfavored. (See id. rule 3.1332(b).) Nevertheless, the trial
court has discretion to continue trial dates. (Hernandez v. Superior Court
(2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1246.) Each request for continuance must be
considered on its own merits and is granted upon an affirmative showing of good
cause. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c); Hernandez, supra,
115 Cal.App.4th at 1246.) Circumstances that may indicate good cause include:
(1) the unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness due to death,
illness, or other excusable circumstances; (2) the unavailability of a party
due to death, illness, or other excusable circumstances; (3) the unavailability
of trial counsel due to death, illness, or other excusable circumstances; (4)
the substitution of trial counsel where there is an affirmative showing that
the substitution is required in the interests of justice; (5) the addition of a
new party if (A) the new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct
discovery and prepare for trial, or (B) the other parties have not had a
reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to
the new party’s involvement in the case; (6) a party’s excused inability to
obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite
diligent efforts; or (7) a significant, unanticipated change in the status of
the case as a result of which the case is not ready for trial. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1332(c).) 
The court must also consider such relevant
factors as: (1) the proximity of the trial date; (2) whether there was any
previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial caused by any party;
(3) the length of the continuance requested; (4) the availability of
alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion or
application for a continuance; (5) the prejudice that parties or witnesses will
suffer as a result of the continuance; (6) if the case is entitled to a
preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need
for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; (7) the court’s calendar
and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; (8) whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial; (9) whether all parties have
stipulated to a continuance; (10) whether the interests of justice are best
served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing conditions
on the continuance; and (11) any other fact or circumstance relevant to the
fair determination of the motion or application. (Id., rule 3.1332(d).)
On motion of any party, the court may grant leave
to complete discovery proceedings, or to have a motion concerning discovery
heard, closer to the initial trial date, or to reopen discovery after a new
trial date has been set.  This motion
shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating a good
faith effort at informal resolution. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050, subd. (a).)   
The court shall take into consideration any
matter relevant to the leave requested, including, but not limited to: (1) the
necessity and the reasons for the discovery, (2) the diligence or lack of
diligence of the party seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery
motion, and the reasons that the discovery was not completed or that the
discovery motion was not heard earlier, (3) any likelihood that permitting the
discovery or hearing the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to
trial on the date set, or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar, or
result in prejudice to any other party, and (4) the length of time that has
elapsed between any date previously set, and the date presently set, for the
trial of the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2024.050, subd. (b).)
III.       
DISCUSSION
Defendants
move to continue trial and all related dates to a date 30 days after the
hearing on the motion for summary judgment, which is currently set for January
24, 2025. Defendants represent that good cause exists for a continuance in
order to permit the hearing on Defendant’s motion for summary judgment,
currently scheduled for January 24, 2025, to be heard before the trial date,
for additional discovery to be conducted, and for additional time for
settlement negotiations. 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court finds good cause to continue trial. Accordingly, the
motion is GRANTED.
IV.        
CONCLUSION
Defendants’ motion is GRANTED. Trial is
continued from March 15, 2024 to ___FATD  March 1, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 27. The
final status conference is continued from March 1, 2024 to _____________ at
10:00 a.m. in Department 27. All pretrial deadlines including discovery and
motion cut-off dates are to be based on the new trial date. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating
intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided
on the court website at www.lacourt.org. 
Please be advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to

appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the
tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
Dated this 4th day of January
