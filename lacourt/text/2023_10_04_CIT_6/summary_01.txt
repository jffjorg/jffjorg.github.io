And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend as to the fifth and sixth causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation, and the demurrer is otherwise overruled. The motion to strike is granted as to the requests for attorney's fees and punitive damages in the prayer for relief, and the motion to strike is otherwise denied.

The court finds that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a cause of action for breach of contract, but that the allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation. The court also finds that the complaint lacks the requisite particularity to state a claim for fraud and negligent misrepresentation.

The court orders the plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 10 days of the date of this order if it chooses to amend the fifth and sixth causes of action.

The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further argument or evidence presented at the hearing.
