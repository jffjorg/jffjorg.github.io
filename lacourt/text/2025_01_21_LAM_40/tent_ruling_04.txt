[TENTATIVE] ORDER OVERRULING DEMURRER TO
PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT
 
I.       
BACKGROUND
       The court
grants Defendant’s request for judicial notice of Plaintiff’s complaint filed
on October 1, 2024. The complaint alleges that Defendant employed Plaintiff as
a media buyer. Plaintiff suffered from a mental health condition for which his
physician placed plaintiff on medical leave. Defendant allegedly approved of
the medical leave. Defendant notified Plaintiff five months later that
Plaintiff’s position was being eliminated and that his employment would be
terminated while on medical leave. Plaintiff alleges five causes of action for
violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”) and a sixth cause of
action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy. 
       Defendant
demurs to all claims mostly on grounds of uncertainty and because Plaintiff’s
claims are duplicative. Plaintiff contends the allegations are sufficiently
alleged with facts to support the claims.  
II.     
LEGAL STANDARDS
       A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt
v. Foundation Health (1995) 35
Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.) In testing the complaint’s sufficiency, the court must
assume the truth of the properly pleaded factual allegations as well as facts
that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly pleaded facts. The court
may also consider matters properly subject to judicial notice. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.)
       The court may not consider contentions,
deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. (Moore
v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.4th
634, 638.) Plaintiff is required to allege facts sufficient to establish every
element of each cause of action. (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(e); Zelig
v. County of Los Angeles
(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1126.)
       Sufficient facts are the essential facts
of the case stated "with reasonable precision and with particularity that
is sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and
extent of his cause of action.” (Gressley
v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.)  Whether the
Plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant. (Stevens
v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.) 
III.   
DISCUSSION
A.     
The disability discrimination claim under FEHA
is not duplicative of the claim for wrongful termination 
      A
claim for disability discrimination in violation of FEHA, requires a showing
that the plaintiff “(1) suffered from a disability, or was regarded as
suffering from a disability; (2) could perform the essential duties of the job
with or without reasonable accommodations, and (3) was subjected to an adverse
employment action because of the disability or perceived disability." (Gov. Code, § 12940 subd. (a); Sandell v. Taylor-Listug, Inc. (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 297, 310.)
       A tort claim for wrongful discharge requires a showing
that the employer violated a public policy that is substantial, fundamental, and
grounded in statute or constitutional provision. (Holmes
v. General Dynamics Corp. (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1418, 1426.) The elements of this  claim are (1) an employer-employee
relationship, (2) the employer terminated the plaintiff's employment, (3) the
termination was substantially motivated by a violation of public policy, and
(4) the discharge caused the plaintiff harm.) (Nosal-Tabor
v. Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center (2015) 239
Cal.App.4th 1224, 1234–1235.)

       These
are separate claims. Defendant relies on Rodrigues v. Campbell Industries (1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 494 which found no abuse of discretion
where a trial court sustained demurrer without leave to amend where one cause
of action contained the same allegations supporting other claims and added
nothing to the complaint “by way of fact or theory of recovery.” (Rodrigues v. Campbell at 501.)  That case is not applicable here where
Plaintiff is alleging conduct in violation of separate sections of FEHA. 
       FEHA
claims are not Plaintiff’s exclusive remedy, rather Plaintiff is “entitled to
seek relief for injuries arising from discrimination in employment under any
state law, without limitation." 
(Rojo
v. Kliger (1990) 52 Cal.3d 65, 82, [“While the FEHA conferred certain
new rights and created new remedies, its purpose was not to narrow, but to
expand the rights and remedies available to victims of discrimination.”].) A
wrongful termination claim is grounded in the common law. A FEHA violation for
disability discrimination can support the “public policy” element necessary to
support the wrongful termination claim. (Angell
v. Peterson Tractor, Inc. (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 981, 987.)  
       Defendant
contends that FEHA discrimination claims cannot “coexist” with wrongful
discharge for violation of a public policy articulated by FEHA. (Dem. 3:27-4:1.)
Defendant’s case authority states the opposite. It states that “FEHA's
provisions prohibiting discrimination may provide the policy basis for a claim
for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.” (Phillips
v. St. Mary Regional Medical Center (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 218, 227.) Phillips
determined that there are exceptions to that rule; a plaintiff cannot assert a
wrongful discharge claim based on a violation of FEHA where the employer was statutorily
exempted from liability for example, because the employer does not have five or
more employees, or as in Phillips, where the employer was a nonprofit
religious corporation, which expressly falls outside the definition of an
“employer.” (Phillips
at 228; Gov.
Code, § 12926 subd. (d).) Phillips is factually distinguishable. 
       Defendant’s
reliance on Roby
v. McKesson Corp. (2009) 47 Cal.4th 686 is misplaced.  In Roby, two FEHA claims, and the wrongful
discharge claim arose in part from employee’s termination, “and therefore, the
damages necessarily overlapped.” (Roby
at 686.) At this stage of the proceedings, the court is not concerned with
whether Plaintiff’s ultimate recovery will overlap; that issue does not affect
the sufficiency of Plaintiff’s claims. 
 
B.     
The FEHA disability discrimination claim is
adequately alleged.  
       Defendant
argues that Plaintiff did not allege any direct evidence of disability
discrimination, that there are no facts to support discriminatory animus, and that
there is no insight into what Plaintiff’s condition was which deprives
Defendant of the opportunity to determine appropriate defenses. 
       In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that the allegations are sufficient and
unambiguous. 
       Contrary
to Defendant’s argument, general rules of pleading do not require that the
plaintiff plead evidentiary facts supporting the allegation of ultimate fact. (Careau
& Co. v. Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc. (1990) 222
Cal.App.3d 1371, 1390, [“It is both improper and insufficient for a
plaintiff to simply plead the evidence by which he hopes to prove such ultimate
facts."].) 
       The
elements of this claim may be established by inference or by circumstantial
evidence. (Sandell
v. Taylor-Listug, Inc. (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 297, 310, [“Generally an
employee need only offer sufficient circumstantial evidence to give rise to a
reasonable inference of discrimination.”], [italics in
original].) Here, the alleged facts are sufficient to infer discrimination.
Plaintiff alleges that while he was on medical leave for a mental health
condition, Defendant eliminated his position and terminated his employment.
(Complaint, ¶ 12, 15.) Plaintiff alleges that two weeks prior to his
termination and the day after it, Plaintiff saw advertisements for his position
with a slightly different title. (Complaint, ¶ 15.)
       The
element requiring that Plaintiff could do his job with or without accommodation
is supported by the allegation that Defendant hired Plaintiff as a Media Buyer
and later promoted him to Manager of Advertising Operations around June of
2023. (Complaint, ¶ 11.) Plaintiff’s duties included overseeing and
strategizing the planning of thought-provoking advertisements. (Id.)
Plaintiff earned an annual salary of $65,000 and typically worked forty (40)
hours per week. Plaintiff earned an honorary award from PETA for founding the
first vegan and cruelty free cosmetics company in 2004. (Id.)

       Despite
these accomplishments, Plaintiff alleges he was terminated while on medical
leave for a mental health condition. (Complaint, ¶ 15.) All elements are
adequately supported. 
 
C.     
Demurrer
to the claim for failure to engage in a good faith interactive process is OVERRULED.
       An
employer is liable for failure to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive
process with the employee to determine effective, reasonable accommodations, if
any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee with
a known disability or condition. (Gov.
Code, § 12940 subd. (n).) This is a separate cause of action as it is a
separate unlawful practice. (Swanson
v. Morongo Unified School Dist. (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 954, 964.)
       The
complaint supports this claim. Plaintiff alleges he requested medical leave as
recommended by his doctor. (Complaint, ¶ 12.) Defendant allegedly approved of
the leave up to a point. While Plaintiff’s doctor extended his medical leave to
September 22, 2024, and Defendant approved it, on July 30, 2024, Defendant
notified Plaintiff he was being terminated without further accommodation and
without any engagement in a timely, good faith, interactive process despite
their knowledge of Plaintiff’s mental condition, causing losses in earnings and
benefits among other damage.  (Complaint,
¶¶ 15, 32, 34-35.) 
       Defendant’s
argument relies on some alleged facts while ignoring others in an attempt to
create ambiguity where there is none. (Dem. 5:2-14.) When assessing the
adequacy of a complaint, the court reads the complaint as a whole. (Nede
Mgmt., Inc. v. Aspen American Ins. Co. (2021) 68 Cal.App.5th 1121.)
       Defendant
contends that Plaintiff did not provide any useful factual allegations from
which Defendant can base a defense and “sows confusion” by failing to state how
Defendant failed to so engage. (Dem. 12:16-19.) Again, Plaintiff is not
obligated to plead evidentiary facts.  The
allegations taken as a whole support the claim. 
D.    
Demurrer
to the claim for failure to provide reasonable accommodation  is OVERRULED.
       FEHA imposes an affirmative obligation on
the employer to reasonably accommodate a known disability of an employee. (Gov.
Code, § 12940 subd. (m).)
       Defendant
contends it cannot make out what Plaintiff believes Defendant failed to
provide. (Dem. 13:24-25.) That contention is not supported by the allegations
of the complaint, and further, any uncertainty complained of here is a matter
for discovery. Uncertainty exists
where a complaint’s factual allegations are so confusing, they do not sufficiently
apprise a defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet. (Williams
v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2; Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).) 
       Demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored
and are strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, “because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616;  Lickiss v. Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority (2012) 208
Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.)
Contrary to Defendant’s arguments, the complaint, reasonably construed, alleges
that Defendant failed to accommodate the last extension of Plaintiff’s medical
leave by eliminating his position and terminating Plaintiff’s employment.
(Complaint, ¶ 15.)
E.     
Demurrer
to the claim for retaliation is OVERRULED. 
       An employer is prohibited from retaliating against an employee who has
opposed any discriminatory action
or who has filed a complaint, testified, or
assisted in a FEHA proceeding.
(Gov.
Code, § 12940 subd. (h).)  To establish a prima facie case of retaliation
under the FEHA, the plaintiff must show “(1) he was engaged in a protected
activity; (2) the employer subjected him to an adverse employment action; and
(3) there was a causal link between the protected activity and the employer's
action.” (Taylor v.
City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water & Power (2006) 144
Cal.App.4th 1216, 1229.)
       The
protected activity in which Plaintiff engaged was to request an accommodation because
of his mental condition. FEHA prohibits discrimination based on an employee’s
protected status, which includes a medical condition and mental disability. (Gov. Code, §
12940 subd. (a).)The claim is adequately alleged.
Plaintiff requested accommodation for his mental disability, but Defendant
failed to accommodate when Plaintiff requested an extension of that leave, and Defendant
thereafter retaliated against Plaintiff by terminating Plaintiff’s employment.
(Complaint, ¶ 15.) 
       Defendant
contends that the allegations are rendered uncertain because Plaintiff used “him/her”
pronouns and because the allegations are “boilerplate”.  (Dem. 14:14-19.) The first contention is
flatly without merit. If by “boilerplate,” Defendant argues that Plaintiff
alleges ultimate facts, that is permitted. Defendant asserts Plaintiff is
required to “state exactly what right was asserted that he believes led to the
alleged retaliation,” and that Plaintiff doesn’t “narrow down any particular
part of the entire section on FEHA.” (Dem. 14:25-26.) This argument is not
supported by the allegations of the pleading taken as a whole, all as
previously discussed. 
F.      
Demurrer
to the claim for failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation is
OVERRULED. 
       The FEHA imposes liability against an
employer who fails to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent
discrimination and harassment from occurring. (Gov.
Code, § 12940 subd. (k).) Again, Defendant’s arguments here are contradicted
by Plaintiff’s allegations. Plaintiff clearly alleged his “supposed
disability,” described the manner in which he was discriminated against and how
he was retaliated against. (Dem. 15:14-20.) The claim is not fatally ambiguous.

G.    
The
claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy is adequately
alleged.
       To
reiterate, a tort claim for wrongful discharge requires a showing that the employer
violated a public policy that is substantial, fundamental and grounded in
statute or constitutional provision. (Holmes v. General Dynamics Corp. (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1418, 1426.) The elements of this  claim are (1) an employer-employee
relationship, (2) the employer terminated the plaintiff's employment, (3) the
termination was substantially motivated by a violation of public policy, and (4)
the discharge caused the plaintiff harm.) (Nosal-Tabor v. Sharp Chula Vista
Medical Center (2015)
239 Cal.App.4th 1224, 1234–1235.)
       As
previously discussed in Part III.A., above, Plaintiff adequately alleges facts
to support an inference that Defendant terminated him and violated his rights
protected by FEHA by failing to accommodate his mental condition, failing to
engage in the interactive process, and discriminating against him because of
his mental condition by terminating him from employment. (Complaint, ¶ 15.) This
claim is separate from the discrimination claim based on disability and is not
duplicative of any other claim, all as previously discussed. 
IV.   
CONCLUSION
       Based
on the foregoing, Defendant’s demurrer to all causes of action alleged in the
complaint is OVERRULED. Defendant is ordered to file an answer within 30 days.
