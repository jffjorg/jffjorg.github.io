[TENTATIVE]
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT AND DEFAULT JUDGMENT DATED MAY 16,
2024
 
I.       BACKGROUND
      The complaint alleges claims for violations of the Unruh Civil
Rights Act. The court entered Defendant’s default on March 11, 2024, and
entered judgment on May 16, 2024.
      Defendant filed this motion on November 8, 2024, to have the
default and judgment set aside due to Defendant’s mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect and because Plaintiff did not serve Defendant’s
agent for service of process. The service accomplished did not result in actual
notice to Defendant. 
      Plaintiff was timely served with the motion but did not file an
opposition.
II.     DISCUSSION
      The court can set aside any void judgment after notice to the
other party. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473 subd. (d). Lack of personal
jurisdiction renders a default judgment void, so that it may be vacated at
any time. (Strathvale
Holdings v. E.B.H. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1241, 1249 [“When a court
lacks jurisdiction in a fundamental sense, an ensuing judgment is void, and
‘thus vulnerable to direct or collateral attack at any time.’"].)
      Defendant is alleged to be a limited liability corporation.
(Complaint, ¶ 2.) Service must be made on the designated agent for service of
process or an officer of the corporation or anyone authorized to accept
service. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 416.10.)
      The proof of service indicates that service was accomplished by
substituted service on an unidentified person at the front desk of Defendant’s
office. (Mot.  Ex. A.) The designated
agent for service of process is Benjamin Botach as reflected in Secretary of
State records. (Botach Decl., Ex. A.) 
      Plaintiff bears the
burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that "all necessary
jurisdictional criteria are met." (Ziller Electronics Lab GmbH v. Superior
Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d
1222, 1233; Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1439-1440.) Plaintiff did not attempt to meet that burden.
      Accordingly, Defendant’s motion is
GRANTED. The court vacates the default entered on March 11, 2024, and the
judgment entered on May 16, 2024. Defendant is ordered to file its answer
within 10 days.
