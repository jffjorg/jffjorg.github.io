And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to compel the depositions of Yon Lai and Michael Florman. The plaintiff argues that Lai and Florman are self-represented and have a history of discovery abuse, and therefore the court should impose terminating, issue, or evidentiary sanctions or monetary sanctions. However, the judge finds that the motions are defective and denied for procedural reasons, including the lack of proper service on all parties. The judge also orders Lai and Florman to provide written notice of their current address and telephone number to the court and all parties, as required by California Rules of Court. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's two motions to compel deposition are denied.
