The tentative ruling grants the Motion to Consolidate the three cases: Case No. 23TRCV00315, 23TRCV04225, and 24TRCV00306. The cases involve the same parties and arise out of the same defendants' alleged breach of contract and tortious interference with the performance of that contract. The Court finds that good cause exists for granting this motion because all three cases involve the same parties and share common issues of law and fact. The Court notes that all parties stipulate to the consolidation and that the Plaintiffs have complied with the procedural requirements needed in a motion to consolidate. The Court concludes that the consolidation of the three cases is proper and in the interest of judicial economy.
