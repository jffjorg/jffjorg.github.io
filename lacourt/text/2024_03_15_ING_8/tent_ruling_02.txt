I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
On January 12, 2023, Plaintiff Elsa Feeny
(“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants, Valdovinos Transport, LLC,
Jose A. Valdovinos, Oscar Martin, and DOES 1 through 20. The Complaint alleges
causes of action for: (1) Motor Vehicle Negligence; and (2) General Negligence.

 
            On September 20, 2023, Defendant
counsel served counsel for Plaintiff Elsa Feeny with discovery including: Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One. Defendant notes that Plaintiff’s responses
were originally due on October 23, 2023, but that on October 18, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel requested an extension to November 7, 2023. Defendant notes that it
granted this extension. However, on November 14, 2023, Defense counsel
contacted Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the status of Plaintiff’s responses and
defense counsel never received a response. Plaintiff never served responses. 
 
On
November 22, 2023, defense counsel served counsel for Plaintiff with a meet and
confer letter requested responses without objections by December 6, 2023. On
December 18, 2023, after not having heard from Plaintiff’s counsel, defense
counsel sent another meet and confer letter requesting responses without
objections by December 26, 2023. After not hearing from Plaintiff’s counsel, on
January 2, 2024, defense counsel emailed again putting Plaintiff’s counsel on
notice that Defendant was scheduling a Motion to Compel. On January 30, 2024,
defense counsel emailed counsel for Plaintiff and advised that the Motion to
Compel was scheduled for March 15, 2024. 
 
On
February 9, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed that his client’s responses would
be served no later than February 13, 2024. Nonetheless, counsel for Defendant
notes that Plaintiff has still not served any responses. As such, Defendant has
filed these motions to compel.
 
B. Procedural¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
On February 20, 2024, Defendant filed the
motions to compel further. To date, no opposition has been filed.  
 
¿II.
ANALYSIS¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A.   
Legal
Standard
 
A party must respond to
interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260,
subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide
timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling responses
to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The party also
waives the right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or
work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) There is no
time limit for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories other than the
cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.020, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., 2030.290.) No meet and confer efforts are
required before filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 41
Further, where there has been no
timely response to a Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.010 demand, the demanding
party must seek an order compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300.) Failure to
timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product.
Thus, unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver,
he or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There is no
deadline for a motion to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to respond,
the moving party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before
filing the motion. Where the motion seeks only a response to the inspection
demand, no showing of "good cause" is required. 
B.   
Discussion
 
Here, Defendant has indicated that Plaintiff has
failed to respond to its propounded set of discovery. Per the moving papers, Defendant
has attempted to coordinate with Plaintiff’s counsel on numerous instances, but
despite this Plaintiff has provided no responses. The Court notes that there
has been no indication that Plaintiff’s counsel has filed a motion to be
relieved as counsel for record for Plaintiff. As such, the Court does not
understand Plaintiff’s failure to respond. With that being said, Plaintiff is
ordered to provide verified, code-compliant responses to each discovery request
propounded by Defendant, and to produce the responsive documents, without
objection on or before April 5, 2024. 
 
C.   
Sanctions
 
            Sanctions must be imposed against a
party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel unless the party
acted with a substantial justification or that other circumstances would make
the imposition of sanctions unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd.
(c), 2031.300, subd. (c); see also Code Civ. Proc., § 708.020, Law Revision
Commission Comments [“if the judgment debtor fails to answer interrogatories
without substantial justification, sanctions may include an award of attorney’s
fees”].) California Rules of Court, rule
3.1348, subdivision (a) states: “[t]he court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed.” 
 
            For each of the
three motions, Defendant has requested sanctions in the amount of $373/per
motion ($1,119 total) to be paid to Defendants by the Plaintiff and/or the
Plaintiff’s counsel. This amount is based on the declaration of Defendant’s  counsel, Koren Jozana who has represented her
hourly rate as $250/hour. She notes that she spent one hour on each of these
motions, spent $62.50 to reserve the hearing date per motion and $62.50 for
filing fees for each motion. The Court finds the hourly rate and time spent per
motion to be more than reasonable. As such, the Court GRANTS this request for
sanctions, and awards sanctions to Defendant to be paid by Plaintiff and/or
Plaintiff’s counsel to defense counsel on or before April 15, 2024 in the
amount of $373 per motion, totaling $1,119.
 
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice.
