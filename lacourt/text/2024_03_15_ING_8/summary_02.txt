And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motions to compel responses to discovery requests filed by the defendant, Valdovinos Transport, LLC, and has granted all four motions. The defendant had served discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents, but the plaintiff, Elsa Feeny, failed to respond. Despite multiple requests and extensions, the plaintiff still failed to serve responses. The court orders the plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant responses to each discovery request and to produce the responsive documents without objection by April 5, 2024.

The court also imposes sanctions on the plaintiff for their failure to respond. The defendant had requested sanctions in the amount of $373 per motion, totaling $1,119, and the court finds this amount to be reasonable. The court awards sanctions to the defendant to be paid by the plaintiff and/or their counsel to defense counsel on or before April 15, 2024.
