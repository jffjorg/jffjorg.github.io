I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
            On May 16, 2023, this Court entered
judgment against Judgment against Judgement Debtor, John Rodgers in favor of
Judgment Creditor, Nardiello Law Firm resulting from an arbitrator’s award, for
the principal sum of $82,952.62. 
 
            In its moving papers, Plaintiff/Judgment
Creditor states that on July 3, 2023, Judgment Creditor’s counsel served a set
of Post-Judgment Demands for Identification and Production of Documents upon Judgment
Debtor via U.S. First Class mail.  Judgment
Creditor also notes it sent the demand to Judgement Debtor’s counsel by email
on July 6, 2023. A few days prior to the due date of Judgment Debtor’s
responses, Debtor requested an extension of time to respond, which Judgment
Granted, allowing an additional two (2) weeks. However, per the moving papers Judgment
Debtor nonetheless failed to provide any responses as of the extended deadline,
nor any responsive documents as promised.  Judgment Creditor notes that it reached out to
Judgment Debtor’s new counsel and provided Judgment Debtor with additional time
to respond in hopes of resolving the discovery dispute amicably. However, after
further attempts to resolve the overdue discovery response on October 19, 2024
and November 7, 2023, no responses of productions of documents were made by
Judgment Debtor. 
            As such, Judgment Creditor has filed
this Motion to Compel Discovery Responses to Post-Judgment Demand for
Identification and Production of Documents, and Request for Monetary Sanctions.

 
B. Procedural¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
On February 7, 2024, Plaintiff/Judgment
Creditor, Nardiello Law Firm filed this Motion to Compel
Discovery Responses to Post-Judgment Demand for Identification and Production
of Documents, and Request for Monetary Sanctions. To date, no opposition has
been filed. 
 
¿II.
ANALYSIS¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A.   
Legal
Standard
 
A
judgment creditor may demand that any judgment debtor produce and permit the
party making the demand to inspect and to copy documents in the possession,
custody, or control of the party upon whom the demand is made and in the manner
provided by Section 2031.010, et seq. (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.030, subd. (a).)
Inspection demands served pursuant to this section may be enforced in the same
manner as demands in a civil action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.030, subd. (c).)  
 
A
party must respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd. (a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are
directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for
an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) The party also waives the
right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or work-product
protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel responses
to production of documents other than the cut-off on hearing discovery motions
15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2024.020, subd. (a), 2030.290; Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) No meet and confer efforts are required before filing
a motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290;
Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)   
 
B.   
Discussion
 
            Here, Judgment
Creditor’s counsel served Judgment Debtor with Post-Judgment Demand for
Identification and Production of Documents on July 3, 2023 via U.S. First Class
Mail and on Debtor’s counsel by email. 
There are 35 categories of documents sought in this Demand for
Identification and Production of Documents. Because Judgment Debtor has had over
eight (8) months to respond to this discovery, has failed to do so, and has
failed to oppose this motion, this Court GRANTS the motion and orders Judgment
Debtor’s verified, Code-compliant responses, without objection, to Creditor’s
propounded discovery by April 5, 2024, and to produce the responsive documents by
that same date. 
 
C.   
Sanctions
 
Sanctions must be imposed against a
party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel unless the party
acted with a substantial justification or that other circumstances would make
the imposition of sanctions unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd.
(c), 2031.300, subd. (c); see also Code Civ. Proc., § 708.020, Law Revision
Commission Comments [“if the judgment debtor fails to answer interrogatories
without substantial justification, sanctions may include an award of attorney’s
fees”].) California Rules of Court, rule
3.1348, subdivision (a) states: “[t]he court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed.” 
 
Here, Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor seeks
discovery sanctions in the amount of $782.50 against Judgment Debtor, John
Rodgers. This amount is based on counsel for Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor, Jerry
Jen, indicating that his hourly rate is $425, spent 1.70 hours on this motion,
and a filing fee of $60. The Court finds that this request is properly granted.
There is no indication that Judgment Creditor, or his counsel acted with
substantial justification or that there are other circumstances that would make
an imposition of sanctions unjust. The Court finds that the hourly rate, and
the amount of time spent on this motion are both reasonable. As such, the Court
GRANTS the awarding of $782.50 in monetary sanctions as against Judgment
Debtor, John Rodgers to be paid to Judgment Creditor on or before April 5,
2024. 
 
Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor is ordered to
give notice.
