Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a case between Nardiello Law Firm, PLC (the plaintiff/judgment creditor) and John Rodgers, et al. (the defendant/judgment debtor).

Additionally, the court grants the request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $782.50, which is based on the time spent by the plaintiff/judgment creditor's counsel on the motion and the filing fee.
