And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Kelly Gibbons, has moved for a protective order to avoid the discovery demands made by the plaintiff, Stewart Lucas Murrey. The defendant claims that the discovery is overbroad, unduly burdensome, irrelevant, privileged, and private. However, the motion is defective because it does not identify the specific discovery it is addressing and is not accompanied by a meet-and-confer declaration. As a result, the court denies the motion.
