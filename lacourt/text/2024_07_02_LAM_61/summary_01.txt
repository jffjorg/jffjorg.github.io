And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants Plaintiff John Doe's motion to compel deposition answers from Defendant Simone Young. Young had refused to answer questions during deposition, citing the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. However, the Judge finds that Young's privilege was no longer applicable after she was convicted of lewd and lascivious acts with the minor Plaintiff. The Judge also finds that Young's refusal to answer questions based on relevance was improper. The Judge awards sanctions against Young in the amount of $5,400.00, payable within 30 days, representing nine hours of attorney work at $600 per hour.
