 Case Number:  23STCV14890    Hearing Date:   July 2, 2024    Dept:  61 STEWART LUCAS MURREY vs KELLY GIBBONS, et al.TENTATIVEDefendant Kelly Gibbons’ Motion for Protective Order is DENIED.Plaintiff to provide notice.DISCUSSION“When an inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of documents, tangible things, places, or electronically stored information has been demanded, the party to whom the demand has been directed, and any other party or affected person, may promptly move for a protective order.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.060, subd. (a).) The party moving for the order must make a showing of good cause to spare them from “unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.060, subd. (b); see also §§ 2030.290; 2033.080.)Defendant Kelly Gibbons (Defendant) moves for a protective order on the grounds that discovery served upon her by Plaintiff Stewart Lucas Murrey (Plaintiff) is overbroad in scope and objectionable. (Motion at pp. 3–4.) Defendant writes nominally “in response to the motion for discovery” filed by Plaintiff, and argues that the discovery sought is overbroad, unduly burdensome, irrelevant, privileged, and private. (Ibid.)The motion is defective. It addresses a discovery motion which evidently has not been filed with this court, and does not identify the discovery with which it takes issue. Nor is the motion accompanied by a meet-and-confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.090, subd. (a).; 2031.060, subd. (a).)The motion is DENIED.
