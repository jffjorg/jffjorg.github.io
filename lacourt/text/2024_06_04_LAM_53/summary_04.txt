And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

"The Defendant has admitted or denied all allegations in the Third Amended Complaint, except for paragraph 132, where it appears to have been an oversight. The Judge interprets references to 'Defendants' as typographical errors, given the language referring to Defendant as a singular entity. The Judge will consider this in the upcoming Court Hearing."
