(Civil Code section 3295)
  - "While the statute refers only to evidence of the defendant's financial condition, in practice bifurcation under this section means that all evidence relating to the amount of punitive damages is to be offered in the second phase, while the determination whether plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages (i.e., whether the defendant is guilty of malice, fraud or oppression) is decided in the first phase along with compensatory damages." (Holdgrafer v. Unocal Corp. case)
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of AIDS Healthcare Foundation v. Annette Turner, et al. The judge granted the defendant's motion to bifurcate the trial, separating the issue of punitive damages from the issue of compensatory damages. The judge ruled that the defendant is entitled to an order bifurcating trial pursuant to Civil Code section 3295. The judge also denied the plaintiffs' motion to bifurcate and order separate trials of the plaintiffs. The judge found that the plaintiffs did not meet their burden to show that bifurcation was necessary to avoid prejudice to any party. The judge ordered that the trial will be bifurcated, with the jury first deciding the issues of liability and compensatory damages, and then deciding the issue of punitive damages.
