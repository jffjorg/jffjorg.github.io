Motion

The court considered the moving and opposition papers filed in
connection with the demurrer and motion to strike.  No reply papers were filed in connection with
the demurrer or motion to strike.
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The court grants plaintiff
Emilio Reyes’s request for judicial notice. 
(Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).)          
DEMURRER TO ANSWER
Plaintiff Emilio Reyes
(“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order sustaining his demurrer (1) to the answers
to Plaintiff’s 11th, 12th, 14th, and 17th causes of action, as alleged by defendant
Alexandra R. McIntosh, APC (“Defendant”) in its answer, and (2) to each of the
35 affirmative defenses alleged by Defendant. 
The court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s answer on the ground that Defendant did not
comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 431.30, subdivision (d)’s
requirement that “the denial of the allegations shall be made positively or
according to the information and belief of the defendant” because Plaintiff did
not cite authority establishing that a partial failure to comply with this
requirement is a ground for demurrer under section 430.20.  Thus, although it appears that Defendant
failed to respond to paragraph 132 of the Third Amended Complaint,[1] the court does not sustain
the demurrer to Defendant’s answer to the conversion cause of action on that
ground.  The court will grant Defendant
leave to amend its answer to cure this oversight. 
The court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s answer to the 11th, 12th, 14th, and 17th
causes of action because Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant’s responses,
denials, or answers to those causes of action (1) do not state facts sufficient
to constitute a defense, or         (2)
are ambiguous or unintelligible and therefore are uncertain.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subds. (a), (b).)  
The court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s second, third, fifth, seventh through 10th,
13th through 15th, 17th through 18th, 20th, 25th through 27th, and 31st
affirmative defenses because Plaintiff did not specifically address those
defenses in his memorandum of points and authorities and therefore has not met
his burden to show that they (1) do not state facts sufficient to constitute a
defense, or (2) are ambiguous or unintelligible and therefore are uncertain.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subds. (a),
(b).)  
The court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s first affirmative defense because Plaintiff
has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or unintelligible on the ground
that it states Plaintiff is “barred” from recovery under the doctrine of
comparative negligence.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.20, subd. (b); Answer, ¶ 93; Demurrer, p. 7:9.) 
The overrules Plaintiff’s
demurrer to Defendant’s fourth affirmative defense because Plaintiff has not
shown that this defense (1) does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
defense on the ground that Defendant does not identify the statute of
limitations on which it relies since Defendant does state that Plaintiff’s
operative complaint is barred by specific statutes of limitations (i.e., Code
of Civil Procedure sections 335.1, 338, and 340), or (2) is ambiguous or
unintelligible on the ground that it states Plaintiff’s claims are “barred” by
the statute of limitations.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 430.20, subds. (a), (b), 458.) 
The court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s sixth affirmative defense because Plaintiff
has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or unintelligible on the ground
that Defendant has alleged that Plaintiff is “barred” from recovering damages
based on his failure to mitigate his damages. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (b); Answer, ¶ 98; Dem., p. 7:9.) 
The court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s 11th affirmative defense of unclean hands
because Plaintiff has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or
unintelligible on the ground that (1) it does not “state which of Plaintiff’s
claims the defense applies to[,]” or (2) it states that Plaintiff is “barred”
by the doctrine of unclean hands.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (b); Dem., pp. 6:23-7:4; Answer, ¶ 103.)
The court sustains Plaintiff’s
demurrer to Defendant’s 12th affirmative defense because it does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a defense since Defendant has pleaded this
defense as a terse legal conclusion. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (a); Answer, ¶ 104 [alleging only that
“The Plaintiff’s claims are barred by laches”]; Quantification Settlement
Agreement Cases (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 758, 812-813 [affirmative defenses
must not be pled as terse legal conclusions].)  Although Defendant states, in its opposition,
that Plaintiff delayed in bringing this action against it, those facts are not
pleaded in its answer. 
The court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s 16th affirmative defense, which alleges
that Defendant is entitled to recover expenses, including attorney’s fees, on
the ground that Plaintiff’s action was brought and maintained in bad faith,
because Plaintiff has not shown, based on the face of the answer and judicially
noticed documents, that this answer does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a defense based on Plaintiff’s argument that granting attorney’s
fees to Defendant would be oppressive to Plaintiff.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.20, subd. (a),
430.30 [ground for objection on the face of an answer may be taken by a
demurrer to the pleading]; Answer, ¶ 108; Dem., pp. 9:5-10:6.) 
The court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s 19th affirmative defense because Plaintiff
has not shown that this defense does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
defense or that it is ambiguous or unintelligible and therefore is uncertain.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subds. (a), (b);
Answer, § 111.)
The court overrules Plaintiff’s
demurrer to Defendant’s 21st affirmative defense because Plaintiff has not
shown that this defense is ambiguous or unintelligible on the ground that it
states that Plaintiff is “barred” from bringing this action by virtue of his
own misconduct.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.20, subd. (b); Answer, ¶ 113; Dem., p. 7:9-14.)
The court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s 22nd affirmative defense because Plaintiff
has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or unintelligible on the ground
that it states that Plaintiff is “barred” from bringing this action by the
doctrine of waiver.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.20, subd. (b); Answer, ¶ 114; Dem., p. 7:9-14.)
The court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s 23rd affirmative defense because Plaintiff
has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or unintelligible on the ground
that it states that Plaintiff is “barred” from obtaining relief on the ground
that he consented to the acts of which he complains.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (b);
Answer, ¶ 115; Dem., p. 7:9-14.)
The court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s 24th affirmative defense because Plaintiff
has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or unintelligible on the ground
that it states that Plaintiff is “barred” from obtaining relief because
Plaintiff ratified the acts about which he complains.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (b);
Answer, ¶ 116; Dem., p. 7:9-14.)
The court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s 28th affirmative defense because Plaintiff
has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or unintelligible on the ground
that it states that Plaintiff’s claims are “barred” by Civil Code sections 47,
subdivisions (a) through (e), and 48, subdivision (a).  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (b);
Answer, ¶ 120; Dem., p. 7:9-14.)
The court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s 29th affirmative defense because Plaintiff
has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or unintelligible on the ground
that it states that Plaintiff’s claims are “barred” because the statutes, regulations,
and/or laws that he relies on are vague and ambiguous and therefore violate
Defendant’s statutory and constitutional rights, including its rights pursuant
to the First Amendment.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.20, subd. (b); Answer, ¶ 121; Dem., p. 7:9-14.)
The court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s 30th affirmative defense because Plaintiff
has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or unintelligible on the ground
that it states that Plaintiff’s claims are “barred” because Defendant’s statements,
if any, were true or substantially true. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (b); Answer, ¶ 122; Dem., p. 7:9-14.)
The court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s 32nd affirmative defense because Plaintiff
has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or unintelligible on the ground
that it states that Plaintiff is “barred” from maintaining this action because
Defendant’s conduct was protected under the First Amendment.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (b);
Answer, ¶ 124; Dem., p. 7:9-14.)
The court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s 33rd affirmative defense because Plaintiff
has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or unintelligible on the ground
that it states that Plaintiff’s claims are “barred” as a result of the court’s
order granting its special motion to strike. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (b); Answer, ¶ 125: Dem., p. 7:9-14.)
The court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s 34th affirmative defense because Plaintiff
has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or unintelligible on the ground
that it states that Plaintiff is “barred” from maintaining his conversion claim
because he has retained the subject documents. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (b); Answer, ¶ 126; Dem., p. 7:9-14.) 
The court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s 35th affirmative defense because Plaintiff
has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or unintelligible on the ground
that it states that Plaintiff is “barred” from maintaining this action pursuant
to the law of the case doctrine.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (b); Answer, ¶ 127; Dem., p. 7:9-14.)
 
MOTION TO STRIKE ANSWER
Plaintiff requests that the court strike (1) Defendant’s answer in its
entirety, or, in the alternative, (2) each affirmative defense alleged in
Defendant’s answer.  Plaintiff moves for
this relief on the ground that Defendant’s affirmative defenses are irrelevant,
false, improper, and not in conformity with the laws of this state, a court
rule, or an order of the court. 
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to strike Defendant’s answer, in
its entirety, because Plaintiff has not shown that all of Defendant’s
affirmative defenses include false, irrelevant, or improper matter, or are not
drawn in conformity with the laws of this state, an order of the court, or a
rule of the court.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
436.) 
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to strike the first, second,
fourth, sixth, 11th, 12th, 21st-25th, 28th-30th, 32nd, and 33rd-35th affirmative
defenses because Plaintiff has not shown that those defenses improperly combine
several defenses therein.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 436.)
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to strike the 23rd or 24th
affirmative defense as duplicative.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 436.)  The 23rd affirmative
defense alleges that Plaintiff is barred from obtaining relief because he “consented
to each and every act of which he has complained[,]” and the 24th affirmative
defense alleges that Plaintiff is barred from obtaining relief because he “ratified
each and every act of which he has complained.” (Answer, ¶¶ 115-116 [emphasis
added].)  Thus, the 23rd and 24th defenses
allege two separate defenses and therefore are not duplicative of each other. 
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to strike the 10th, 20th, 21st,
32nd, and 33rd affirmative defenses as improper on the ground that Defendant
“has provided responses on behalf of other Defendants” because Defendant has
not answered on behalf of the other defendants involved in this action in asserting
those affirmative defenses.[2]  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436; Answer, ¶¶ 102, 112,
113, 124, 125.)
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to strike the 16th affirmative
defense because Plaintiff has not shown, based on the face of the pleading or
matters of which the court has taken judicial notice, that this defense is
false, improper, or irrelevant.  (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 436, 437 [“The grounds for a motion to strike shall appear on
the face of the challenged pleading or from any matter of which the court is
required to take judicial notice”].) 
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to strike Defendant’s answer as a
“sham pleading” because Plaintiff has not shown, based on the face of the
pleading and matters of which the court has taken judicial notice, that its
answer is a sham pleading.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 436, 437.)  
ORDER
            The court overrules plaintiff Emilio
Reyes’s demurrer to the first through 11th and 13th through 35th affirmative
defenses alleged in defendant Alexandra
R. McIntosh, APC’s answer.
            The
court sustains plaintiff Emilio Reyes’s demurrer to the 12th affirmative
defense alleged in defendant Alexandra R. McIntosh, APC’s answer. 
            The
court denies plaintiff Emilio Reyes’s motion to strike. 
            The
court grants defendant Alexandra R. McIntosh, APC 5 days leave to file a First
Amended Answer that cures the defects set forth in this ruling.
            The court orders defendant Alexandra R. McIntosh, APC to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
