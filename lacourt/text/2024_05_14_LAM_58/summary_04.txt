And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to be relieved as counsel, filed by Frank D. Rubin, the attorney for Shaghal LTD, is granted. The motion is granted because the attorney has complied with the Rules of Court by filing the necessary forms and providing an adequate explanation for seeking to be relieved as counsel. The breakdown in communication between the attorney and the client, coupled with the inability to confirm the client's last known address, has made it necessary for the attorney to seek relief from the court. The court finds that no prejudice will result from granting the motion, as the next hearing is set for August 5, 2024, and the trial is not set until May 27, 2025.
