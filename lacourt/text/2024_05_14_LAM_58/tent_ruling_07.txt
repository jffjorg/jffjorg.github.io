[1]           Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s Fourth
Cause of Action also requires the identification of an adverse employment
action because that claim requires proving that the employer failed to prevent
an adverse employment action. (Dem., 5:9-12.) As noted above, Plaintiff has not
stated a claim for discrimination or retaliation. However, the Complaint also
alleges a claim for harassment; thus, Plaintiff’s claim for failure to prevent
can be based on this harassment claim. This underlying claim is sufficient to
meet the first element of this cause of action; that is, in addition to making
sexual harassment unlawful, the FEHA also demands that employers take all
reasonable steps to prevent harassment. 


[2]           Generally, “principal liability for
punitive damages [does] not depend on employees’ managerial level, but on the
extent to which they exercise substantial discretionary authority over
decisions that ultimately determine corporate policy.” (White v. Ultramar,
Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 563, 576–577.) Thus, to establish that an individual
is a managing agent, a plaintiff seeking punitive damages must show that “the
employee exercised substantial discretionary authority over significant aspects
of a corporation's business.” (Id. at p. 577.) In this context,
“corporate policy” refers to “ ‘formal policies that affect a substantial
portion of the company and that are of the type likely to come to the attention
of corporate leadership.’ ” (Roby v. McKesson Corp. (2009) 47 Cal.4th
686, 715; Cruz v. HomeBase (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 160, 167–168 [“
‘corporate policy’ is the general principles which guide a corporation, or
rules intended to be followed consistently over time in corporate operations,”
and thus “[a] ‘managing agent’ is one with substantial authority over decisions
that set these general principles and rules”].)
