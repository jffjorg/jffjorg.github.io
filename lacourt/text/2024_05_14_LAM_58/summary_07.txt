And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant argues that the plaintiff's fourth cause of action requires the identification of an adverse employment action. However, the plaintiff has not stated a claim for discrimination or retaliation. The complaint does allege a claim for harassment, which is sufficient to meet the first element of this cause of action. The plaintiff seeks punitive damages, which requires showing that the defendant exercised substantial discretionary authority over significant aspects of the corporation's business. The court notes that a plaintiff seeking punitive damages must show that the individual exercised substantial discretionary authority over decisions that ultimately determine corporate policy.
