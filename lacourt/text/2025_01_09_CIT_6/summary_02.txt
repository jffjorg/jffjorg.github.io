And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to strike and has reviewed the information presented by both parties. The judge notes that the plaintiff has referenced matters not alleged in the original complaint (FAC) and that the moving parties have done the same. The judge rules that the court cannot consider these arguments on a motion to strike, as they do not appear on the face of the pleading or are not subject to judicial notice. Specifically, the judge cannot consider statements made in the police report, a Notice of Restitution hearing, or other matters not alleged in the FAC.
