And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the motion of Jeffrey L. Fayngor to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Keanna Cecilia Camberos without prejudice. The motion was filed on December 17, 2024, which is after the deadline for filing and serving the motion. Additionally, the court notes that the declaration submitted by Counsel Fayngor does not set forth the efforts taken to confirm that Plaintiff's address is current or to locate a more current address. Despite these issues, the court finds sufficient grounds for permitting withdrawal based on the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. Counsel Fayngor is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
