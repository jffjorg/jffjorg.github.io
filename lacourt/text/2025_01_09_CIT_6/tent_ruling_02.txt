   [1] Moving Parties proceed to reference matters regarding the underlying incident  not alleged in the FAC, such as the statements made in the police report.  (Motion, 6:26-7:8; see generally, FAC.) The Court may not consider such  arguments on a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437, subd. (a) [grounds  for motion to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or on matters  subject to judicial notice].)    [2] Plaintiff also references matters regarding the underlying incident not alleged  in the FAC, such as a Notice of Restitution hearing. (Opp., 4:8-11; see  generally, FAC.) The Court may not consider this on a motion to strike. (Code  Civ. Proc., § 437, subd. (a).)   [3] Plaintiff refers to many matters here regarding Ferreira not alleged in the  FAC, such as Moving Parties’ having officers, directors, and/or managing  agents, Ferreira knowing that Protic was unfit to drive, and failing to follow  Ferreira’s own safety policies. (Opp., 6:1-7:13; see generally, FAC.) The Court  may not consider these arguments. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437, subd. (a).)
