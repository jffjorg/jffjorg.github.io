## English Summary:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment filed by two pension plans (DBPP and MPPP) in a lawsuit brought by Dr. Bruce Fishman and others. 

The lawsuit alleges that Dr. Fishman's former employer (MLA) made fraudulent transfers to the pension plans to avoid paying a court-ordered arbitration award to Dr. Fishman. The pension plans argue they are entitled to summary judgment because the transfers were made to satisfy legitimate debt obligations to them and not with the intent to defraud anyone. 

The judge agrees with the pension plans and grants their motion, finding that Dr. Fishman's lawyers failed to adequately oppose the motion. This means the case against the pension plans is dismissed.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in YAML format:

**Case Information**
```
Case Number: 20STCV34289
Hearing Date: September 27, 2023
Dept: 56
```
**Parties**
```
Plaintiffs:
  - BRUCE E. FISHMAN, M.D., et al.
Defendants:
  - PATRICK NAZEMI, et al.
Moving Party: MLA Defined Benefit Pension Plan and MLA Money Purchase Pension Plan, by and through their successor Administrator Med-Legal Associates, LLC (collectively, "Moving Defendants")
```
**Background**
```
On September 9, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging intentional fraudulent transfer, fraudulent transfer, transfer resulting in debtor's insolvency, common law fraudulent transfer, aiding and abetting fraudulent transfer, declaratory relief, and unjust enrichment.
On May 31, 2023, DBPP filed a cross-complaint seeking declaratory relief regarding the fraudulent transfers alleged in Plaintiffs' Complaint.
On May 31, 2023, Moving Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment and/or adjudication to the Complaint and XC on the grounds that there are no triable issues of material fact on the claims asserted in the Complaint and XC.
```
**Request for Judicial Notice**
```
Moving Defendants' Request for Judicial Notice is GRANTED.
```
**Discussion**
```
The Court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers.
The function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial.
The Court finds that Moving Defendants have satisfied their burden to show that they are entitled to judgment on the first through third causes of action of the Complaint.
```
**Claims in the Complaint and XC**
```
The Uniform Voidable Transfer Act permits defrauded creditors to reach property in the hands of a transferee.
A transfer of property by a debtor is voidable if the debtor made the transfer with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor.
The "badges of fraud" do not matter when value is given, such as satisfaction of antecedent debt.
```
**Procedural Issues with Plaintiffs' Opposition Papers**
```
The opposition, where appropriate, shall consist of affidavits, declarations, admissions, answers to interrogatories, depositions, and matters of which judicial notice shall or may be taken.
The opposition papers shall include a separate statement that responds to each of the material facts contended by the moving party to be undisputed, indicating if the opposing party agrees or disagrees that those facts are undisputed.
The statement also shall set forth plainly and concisely any other material facts the opposing party contends are disputed.
```
**Ruling**
```
Based on the foregoing, the Opposition fails to raise a triable issue of material fact with respect to any claim.
The Court therefore GRANTS the Motion.
```
**Significant Statements**
```
* The Court finds that Moving Defendants have satisfied their burden to show that they are entitled to judgment on the first through third causes of action of the Complaint.
* The Opposition fails to raise a triable issue of material fact with respect to any claim.
* The Court GRANTS the Motion.
```
**Intentions**
```
* To determine whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial.
* To grant judgment to Moving Defendants on the first through third causes of action of the Complaint.
```
**Facts**

* The complaint was filed on September 9, 2020.
* The cross-complaint was filed on May 31, 2023.
