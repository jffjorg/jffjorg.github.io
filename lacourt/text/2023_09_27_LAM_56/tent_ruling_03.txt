MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff
 
            RESPONDING PARTY:
Defendant Total Renal Care, Inc. (“Defendant”) 
 
            The Court has considered
the moving, opposition and reply papers. 

 
BACKGROUND
The currently
operative first amended complaint (the “FAC”) alleges 10 causes of action
arising from an employment relationship. 
 
On August 16,
2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses to Plaintiff’s
Requests for Production, Set Three (“RFPs”) and for monetary sanctions (the
“Motion”).  
DISCUSSION
Under California Code
of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 2031.310, a motion to compel further
responses to a demand for inspection or production of documents may be brought
based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or
incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized
objections.  (CCP § 2031.310, subd.
(c).)  A motion to compel further
production must set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the inspection demand. 
(See CCP § 2031.310 subd. (b)(1); Calcor Space Facility, Inc.
v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 234-35.)  To establish good cause, a discovery
proponent must identify a disputed fact that is of consequence in the action
and explain how the discovery sought will tend in reason to prove or disprove
that fact or lead to other evidence that will tend to prove or disprove the
fact.  (Digital Music News LLC v. Superior Court (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 216, 224.)  
 
If the moving
party has shown good cause for the requests for production, the burden is on
the objecting party to justify the objections. 
(Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002)
95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.)  The court shall
limit the scope of discovery if it determines that the burden, expense, or
intrusiveness of that discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood that the
information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  (CCP § 2017.020, subd. (a).)  To support an objection to a request for
production of documents, the objecting party must establish the validity of its
objections with supporting facts in order to meet its burden.  (Southern
Pac. Co. v. Superior Court (1969) 3 Cal.App.3d 195, 198.)  
 
 
            The
Motion concerns RFPs  66, 67, 69, 70, 75,
76, and 87-97.  The RFPs at issue were
served on March 30, 2023.  (Declaration
of Michael A. Levy (“Levy Decl.”) ¶ 4, Exhibit 3.)  Defendant provided responses on April 7, 2023
and provided supplemental responses on June 21, 2023.  (Levy Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.)  Plaintiff contends that these RFPs concern
requests for information regarding Plaintiff’s termination that are central to
the claims in the FAC.  
 
            Defendant
contends that its supplemental document production renders the Motion moot and
that its privilege log adequately supports its otherwise valid objections.  (See Declaration of Alexander W.
Rafuse (“Rafuse Decl.”) ¶ 8, Exhibits D-E.) 
Defendant also contends that after initially conferring with Plaintiff
about the sufficiency of its responses, it ran a comprehensive ESI search that
encompassed over 333,000 emails and documents. 
(Rafuse Decl. ¶ 7.)  
            
Several of the
documents produced by Defendant are redacted, and the redactions are not
reflected in the privilege log.  (See Levy
Decl. ¶ 2.)  In addition, documents in
the privilege log do not reflect the inclusion of any documents directly
related to the decision to terminate Plaintiff. 
(See Rafuse Decl., Exhibit E.) 
Further, although Defendant contends that it produced emails in their
native format, Plaintiff indicates that the documents were produced as PDFs,
rather than their native electronic format. 
(See Crews v. Willows Unified School Dist. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th
1368, 1372 n. 2.)  
 
Based on the
evidence presented in the Motion and Opposition, the Court finds it appropriate
to GRANT the Motion.  Defendant is
ordered to produce a supplemental privilege log that identifies any documents
regarding the decision to terminate Plaintiff, if any, that were withheld due
to attorney/client privilege and that states the bases for the redactions
contained in documents it has produced.  
Defendant is further ordered to provide Plaintiff with copies of the
emails it has produced in their native electronic format.  The Court finds it appropriate to limit RFP
No. 89 to records related to documents that are responsive to RFP No. 88.  Defendant is ordered to supplement its
production within 30 days of the date of this order. 
 
            The
Court therefore GRANTS the Motion. 
Defendant is ordered to provide further responses that contain
statements of compliance within 30 days of the date of this order. 
 
Monetary Sanctions
In connection with the Motion, Plaintiff
requests monetary sanctions which represent six hours preparing the Motion at a
rate of $695 per hour.  (Levy Decl.
¶¶ 16-17.)  
 
The Court exercises its discretion and
grants Plaintiffs monetary sanctions in the total amount of $4,170, which
represents six hours preparing the Motion at a rate of $695 per hour.  (Moran v. Oso Valley Greenbelt Assn. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1029,
1034.)  Defendant and counsel are jointly
responsible for paying this amount within 30 days of the date of this
order.  
 
Moving party is
ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to
the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on
the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive
an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed
off calendar. 
 
        Dated this 27th day of September 2023
