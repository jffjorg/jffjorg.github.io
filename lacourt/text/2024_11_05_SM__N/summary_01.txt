English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the motions to compel discovery responses from Cross-Complainant David Schwarcz, as they are deemed moot. The motions were filed by Cross-Defendant Rexford Manor Homeowners Association, who served Schwarcz with special interrogatories and a demand for production of documents, but Schwarcz failed to provide verified responses. The Court notes that Schwarcz did provide substantive responses, but not verified, and that the motions are intentionally vague about this point. The Court also denies Cross-Defendant's request for monetary sanctions, as it did not exhaust all avenues to obtain the verifications before filing the motions. The Court encourages resolution of issues without court intervention.
