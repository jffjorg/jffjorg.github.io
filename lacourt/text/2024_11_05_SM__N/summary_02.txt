The Court has granted Defendant VeoRide, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration in this action. The Court finds that the Defendant has demonstrated the existence of an arbitration agreement which may be invoked by Defendant against Plaintiff Michael Trump. The Court also finds that the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable. The agreement was presented to the Plaintiff on a "take it or leave it" basis, but the Court finds that there is no evidence of oppressive tactics or lack of opportunity for meaningful negotiation. The arbitration agreement is enforceable and the Court will stay the proceedings pending the outcome of arbitration.
