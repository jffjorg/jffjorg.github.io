The judge has given the plaintiff 30 days to file a Second Amended Complaint to cure the defects in the pleadings. The judge has noted that the parties met and conferred via email and phone, but that the defect is purely the result of a lack of detail in the allegations. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff has not demonstrated how the pleadings might be revised to cure the defects.
