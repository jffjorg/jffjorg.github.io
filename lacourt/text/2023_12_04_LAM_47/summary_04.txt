And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants in part the defendant's motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's individual claims as an aggrieved party under PAGA. The plaintiff's claims as a representative of other aggrieved parties under PAGA are stayed pending resolution of the arbitration.

The judge finds that the defendant has met its burden of producing prima facie evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate, and the plaintiff does not dispute the existence of the arbitration agreement. The judge also finds that the scope of the arbitration agreement covers the plaintiff's individual PAGA claims.

The judge concludes that the FAA does not preempt California law invalidating contractual prohibitions on arbitrating PAGA representative claims. Therefore, the representative claims cannot be dismissed for lack of standing.

The judge also finds that the representative claims should be stayed pending resolution of the arbitration, as the issue of whether the plaintiff herself is an aggrieved party should be decided before permitting her to pursue claims as a representative of others.

The judge orders that the plaintiff's individual claims be compelled to arbitration and the representative claims be stayed pending resolution of the arbitration.
