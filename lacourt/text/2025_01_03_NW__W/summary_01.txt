And here is a text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants' motion for an undertaking and stay. The defendants, NBC Universal, LLC and Octavio Fernandez, sought to require the plaintiffs, Amber Kissell and Ronald Barriault, to post a security for the defendants' costs in the amount of $182,798.00. The Judge found that the defendants have met the standard of "reasonable possibility" that they will obtain judgment in the action, as the accident involved a vehicle vs. vehicle collision and the defendants' version of events may be adopted by the jury. However, the Judge reduced the amount sought by $120,000.00, finding that the costs were grossly inflated, and ordered the plaintiffs to post an undertaking in the amount of $60,000.00. The case is stayed until the undertaking is posted.
