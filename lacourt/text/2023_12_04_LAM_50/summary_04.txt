English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is regarding a demurrer by 859 S. Bedford LLC to the complaint filed by Shlomo Gottlieb. The complaint alleges two causes of action: premises liability and violation of the Federal Fair Housing Act. The demurrer claims that Gottlieb failed to allege related causes of action and that the complaint does not state a cause of action. However, the court finds that Gottlieb has alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action for premises liability and that the demurrer did not meet the standards required by California Rules of Court and the Code of Civil Procedure. The court overrules the demurrer and orders 859 S. Bedford LLC to file and serve its answer to the complaint within 10 days.
