TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:
 
DEFENDANTS’
  MOTION TO STRIKE PORTIONS OF PLAINTIFFS’ FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
 




On June 13, 2022, Haller, LLC (“Haller”) and Shaun
Tan (“Tan”) filed the instant action (the “Haller Action”) against a number of defendants. 
Haller and
Tan filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) in the instant action
on June 8, 2023 against Defendants City of Los Angeles (the “City”), Hollywood
Arts Collective LP, Hollywood Arts Collective LLC, Thomas Safran and Associates
Development, Inc., Thomas Safran and Associates. Inc., Morley Construction
Company, and Benchmark Contractors Inc. (collectively, “Defendants”). The FAC
in the Haller Action alleges causes of action for (1) inverse condemnation, (2)
nuisance, (3) dangerous condition of public property, (4) trespass, and (5)
negligence. 
On April 7,
2022, Plaintiff Jayesh Kumar (“Kumar”) filed an action against a number of
defendants in the matter Jayesh Kumar v. The City of Los Angeles, et
al., Case No. 22STCV11937 (the “Kumar Action”). On June 8, 2023, Kumar
filed the operative Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) in the Kumar Action against
the City and a number of other defendants. The TAC alleges causes of
action for (1) breach of lease, (2) nuisance, (3) trespass, and (4) dangerous
condition of public property.  
The Court notes that on August 2, 2023,
the Court issued an Order in the Kumar Action indicating that “IT IS HEREBY
ORDERED that Case Nos. 22STCV11937 (Kumar Action) and 
22STCV19257 (Haller Action) be
consolidated for all pretrial, discovery, and motion purposes only. Case
No. 22STCV11937 (Kumar Action) will be the Lead Case. The operative pleadings
filed in the Kumar Action and the Haller Action will remain separate.
Defendants may file one (1) Joint Demurrer and/or Motion to Strike as to the
Third Amended Complaint in the Kumar Action and the First Amended Complaint in
the Haller Action to be noticed pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure
§ 1005 for and heard by the Court on September 26, 2023. If the issue of Haller
being both a plaintiff and a defendant is resolved, the parties may submit a
further stipulation to consolidate the cases for trial…” 
            After the Court issued the August 2, 2023 Order, Defendants
filed a motion to strike portions of the FAC in the instant Haller Action on
August 23, 2023. Defendants move to strike “Item 2 of Prayer on Page 11, Line
16, which reads: ‘2. Exemplary Damages…’” No opposition to this motion was
filed.  
As
an initial matter, it is unclear why Defendants filed a motion to strike
portions of the FAC in both the instant action and the Kumar Action. As set
forth above, the Court’s August 2, 2023 Order provides, inter alia, that
“Defendants may file one (1) Joint Demurrer and/or
Motion to Strike as to the Third Amended Complaint in the Kumar Action and the
First Amended Complaint in the Haller Action…” In any event, in light of the Court’s
tentative ruling on “Defendants’ Joint Motion to Strike Portions of Plaintiffs’
Haller LLC and Shaun Tan’s First Amended Complaint” filed in the Kumar Action,
the instant motion is moot.
