```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, The City of Los Angeles, has filed a motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint in the Haller Action. The motion seeks to strike a single sentence from the complaint, which requests exemplary damages. No opposition to the motion was filed. The court notes that this motion is essentially moot because the defendant has already filed a similar motion in the Kumar Action, and the court has issued a tentative ruling on that motion. The court will not entertain this motion as it is duplicative and unnecessary.
