TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:  
 
DEMURRER TO
  COMPLAINT 
 



 
Background
            Plaintiff
Shlomo Gottlieb (“Gottlieb”) filed this action on December 14, 2022
against Defendant 859 S. Bedford LLC (“859 S. Bedford”). The Complaint alleges
causes of action for (1) premises liability and (2) violation of Federal Fair
Housing Act. 
            On July 26, 2022, 859 S. Bedford filed
a Complaint against Gottlieb in the matter 859 S. Bedford LLC v.
Shlomo Gottlieb, et al., Case No. 22STCV24144. On January 6, 2023, the Court issued a minute order in
the instant action providing, inter alia, that “[t]he Court finds
that the following cases, 22STCV24144 and 22STCV38854, are related within the
meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).
22STCV24144 is the lead case. For good cause shown, said cases are assigned to
Judge Teresa A. Beaudet in Department 50 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse for all
purposes.” 
In Case No. 22STCV24144,
859 S. Bedford alleges
that “[o]n or about January 6, 1997, [Gottlieb] entered into a written
lease agreement with [859 S. Bedford’s] predecessor in interest for the subject
premises located at 859 S. Bedford Street, No. 5, Los Angeles, CA 90035...”
(Compl., ¶ 6.) 859 S. Bedford
alleges that “as a result of [Gottlieb’s] inability to properly maintain
the Subject Premises or to specially take care of his fish tank, the tank’s
pipes providing fresh water into the tank and/or to recycle water in the tank,
started leaking that was not attended to nor fixed by [Gottlieb]. As a result
the entire apartment where [Gottlieb] resided in as well as the apartments
below were flooded with water that had gathered in [Gottlieb’s] apartment and
which had traveled down to the units below.” (Compl., ¶ 13.) 
            859 S. Bedford now demurs to both causes of action of
the Complaint in the instant action. Gottlieb opposes.
Discussion
A.    Legal Standard
A demurrer can be used
only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack
or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a demurrer, the
complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each
evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need
not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart
Union High School Dist. (2012) 53
Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the
sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all
material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v.
Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2
Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) 
B.     Allegations of the Complaint 
In the Complaint, Gottlieb alleges that he “is and was at
all relevant times herein an individual residing at 859 S. Bedford Ave.,
Apartment Number 5, Los Angeles, CA 90035” (herein, the “Premises”). (Compl., ¶
1.) 859 S. Bedford is the
owner of the Premises as well as six other apartments at 859 S. Bedford, Los
Angeles, CA 90035. (Compl., ¶ 4.) 
In or about late December 2021 and January 2022 Gottlieb slipped and fell at the
Premises. (Compl., ¶ 9.) “At or about the same time [Gottlieb] experienced
water intrusion in his apartment, including water that had leaked from the fish
aquarium he kept at the Premises.” (Compl., ¶ 10.) 
Gottlieb alleges
that “[859 S. Bedford] had failed to keep the Premises in good repair and
condition prior to December, 2021. [Gottlieb] slipped and fell as a result of
such failure.” (Compl., ¶ 12.) Gottlieb alleges that “[859 S. Bedford] did not make appropriate
repairs until after ordered to do so by the City [o]f Los Angeles in or about
March, 2022.” (Compl., ¶ 12.)  
Gottlieb further alleges
that he “was forced to vacate the Premises for about a month while [859 S.
Bedford] repaired the Premises. [859 S.
Bedford] promised to compensate [Gottlieb] to defray the cost of an alternative
residence while the repairs were being made but [859 S. Bedford] has never compensated [Gottlieb] for the time
he had to live at an alternative residence. [859 S. Bedford] nonetheless
required [Gottlieb] to pay, and [Gottlieb]
continued to pay rent to [859 S. Bedford] at all times.” (Compl., ¶ 13.) 
In the first cause of action for “premises liability – negligence,”
Gottlieb alleges that 859 S. Bedford “failed to maintain and repair the
premises in violation of the law, including but not limited to city codes and
ordinances, and his Lease for the Premises, and in that the structure, carpet
and wooden floors of the premises were in poor and dangerous condition and
repair.” (Compl., ¶ 16.) Gottlieb alleges that “[i]n or about late December
2021 or early January, 2022 [Gottlieb] fell two times inside the Premises and
suffered and continues to suffer, physical, mental and emotional injury and
suffering as a result of the unsafe conditions at the Premises and according to
proof at the time of trial.” (Compl., ¶ 19.) 
In the second cause of action for violation of the “Federal Fair
Housing Act,” Gottlieb alleges that that 859 S. Bedford “discriminated and has
continued discriminate against [Gottlieb] on account if [sic] his disability in
that it provided inferior housing in comparison to the other apartment units at
the Property and in violation of the law; harassed him; disparaged him to the
public; threatened to evict him and failed to compensate him when forced to
vacate the Premises so the premises could be made lawfully habitable and then
initiated legal proceedings in bad faith.” (Compl., ¶ 23.) 
C.     Demurrer 
In the demurrer, 859 S. Bedford first asserts that “the two causes of action
have been asserted regarding events and claims addressed in Defendant’s
Action…Plaintiff was obligated and should have asserted his or her claims in
that action. Plaintiff clearly could have filed a cross-complaint and elected
not to do so.” (Demurrer at p. 9:2-5.) It appears 859 S. Bedford is referring
to the matter 859 S. Bedford LLC v. Shlomo Gottlieb, et al., Case
No. 22STCV24144. As set forth
above, on January 6, 2023, the Court issued a minute order in the instant
action providing, inter alia, that “[t]he Court finds that the
following cases, 22STCV24144 and 22STCV38854, are related within the meaning of
California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).
22STCV24144 is the lead case…” 
859 S. Bedford cites to Code of Civil
Procedure section 426.30, subdivision (a), which provides that “[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute, if
a party against whom a complaint has been filed and served fails to allege in a
cross-complaint any related cause of action which (at the time of serving his
answer to the complaint) he has against the plaintiff, such party may not
thereafter in any other action assert against the plaintiff the related cause
of action not pleaded.” 
In the opposition, Gottlieb asserts
that “the triggering action/transaction in Defendant’s Complaint
is the leakage of Plaintiff’s fish tank. Plaintiffs Complaint for Premises
Liability and Violation of the Federal Fair Housing Act, as explained above and
is apparent from the face of the Complaint, involves different and distinct
transactions/occurrences and alleged wrongful conduct of [859 S. Bedford] herein…”
(Opp’n at p. 5:2-5.) The Court notes that 859 S. Bedford did not file any reply
in support of the demurrer and thus does not dispute this point.  
The Court notes that Code of Civil Procedure
section 426.10,
subdivision (c) provides that “[r]elated cause of action” means “a cause of action which arises
out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or
occurrences as the cause of action which the plaintiff alleges in his
complaint.” 859 S. Bedford does not discuss this standard in the
demurrer or explain how the causes of action alleged in the Complaint in the
instant action purportedly “arise[] out of the same
transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences as the cause
of action which [859 S. Bedford] alleges in [its]
complaint.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 426.10, subd. (c).) The Court thus
does not find that 859 S. Bedford has demonstrated in its demurrer that Gottlieb “fails to allege in a cross-complaint any related cause of
action which (at the time of serving his answer to the complaint) he has
against [859 S. Bedford]…” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 426.30, subd. (a).) 
            859 S. Bedford also asserts that “the
complaint as asserted, fails to state a cause of action for the claims asserted
in either the first or the second cause of action.” (Demurrer at p. 9:7-9.) In
the “factual background” section of the demurrer, 859 S. Bedford argues that
Gottlieb has “failed to state any material and relevant facts in support of his
claims and has brought this action without any specific factual basis in
support any of the two claims/causes of action asserted herein.” (Demurrer at
p. 6:6-8.) However, the Court notes that 859 S. Bedford’s demurrer does not
appear to contain any discussion of the elements of Gottlieb’s causes of
action. Thus, it is unclear what facts 859 S. Bedford contends Gottlieb purportedly
failed to allege in the Complaint.  
In the opposition, Plaintiff cites to CACI No. 1000, which provides
that to establish a claim for premises liability, the plaintiff must prove all of
the following: 1. That defendant [owned/leased/occupied/controlled] the
property; 2. That defendant was negligent in the use or maintenance
of the property; 3. That plaintiff was harmed; and 4. That defendant’s
negligence was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff’s harm. 
Gottlieb asserts that here, he has alleged facts sufficient to state a
cause of action for premises liability. Gottlieb notes that the Complaint
alleges that 859 S. Bedford is the owner of the Premises, and that 859 S.
Bedford “had failed to keep the Premises in good repair and condition prior to
December, 2021. [Gottlieb] slipped and fell as a result of such failure.”
(Compl., ¶¶ 4, 12.) Gottlieb alleges that “[i]n or about late December 2021 or
early January, 2022 [Gottlieb] fell two times inside the Premises.” (Compl., ¶
19.) Gottlieb further alleges that 859 S. Bedford “knew or should have known
that the Premises were not being maintained in a safe condition and that the
Premises were being operated by [859 S. Bedford] in violation of city codes and
ordinances and the law and in breach of the Lease between [Gottlieb] and [859
S. Bedford].” (Compl., ¶ 17.) As set forth above, 859 S. Bedford did not file
any reply in support of the demurrer and thus does not address the foregoing
points. 
As to the second cause of action for violation of the Fair Housing Act
(42 U.S.C. section 3601 et seq.), Gottlieb
cites to 42 U.S.C. section 3604, subdivision (f)(2), which provides that “[a]s made applicable by section 803
[42 USCS § 3603] and except as exempted by sections
803(b) and 807 [42 USCS §§ 3603(b), 3607], it shall be unlawful…To discriminate against any person in the terms,
conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision
of services or facilities in connection with such dwelling, because of a
handicap of—(A) that person; or (B) a person residing in or intending to reside in
that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made available; or (C) any person associated with that person.”  Gottlieb notes that in the second cause of
action, he alleges that “[a]t all times mentioned herein [859 S. Bedford]
discriminated and has continued [sic] discriminate against Plaintiff on account
if [sic] his disability in that it provided inferior housing in comparison to
the other apartment units at the Property and in violation of the law; harassed
him; disparaged him to the public; threatened to evict him and failed to
compensate him when forced to vacate the Premises…” (Compl., ¶ 23.) As
discussed, 859 S. Bedford did not file any reply and does not respond to this
point. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court overrules 859 S. Bedford’s demurrer
to the first and second causes of action of the Complaint. 
Conclusion  
Based on the foregoing,
the Court overrules 859 S. Bedford’s demurrer to Gottlieb’s first and
second causes of action. 
The Court orders 859
S. Bedford to file and serve
its answer to the Complaint within 10 days of the date of this order.¿
