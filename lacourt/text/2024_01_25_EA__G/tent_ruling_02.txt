 Case Number:  23PSCV00321    Hearing Date:   January 25, 2024    Dept:  G Defendant General Motors, LLC’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s First
Amended Complaint
Respondent:  Plaintiff  Elizabeth Turriaga
Defendant General Motors, LLC’s Motion to Strike Portions of
Plaintiff’s First Amended
Respondent:  Plaintiff  Elizabeth Turriaga
RULING:
Upon review of the moving, opposing, and reply papers filed by the
parties, the court stays the action pending the California Supreme Court's
review of Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 209
(review granted July 13, 2022).
In this lemon law action, Defendant General Motors demurs to
Plaintiff's breach of express warranty causes of action on the grounds that
Plaintiff's vehicle is not covered by the Song-Beverly Act. Defendant argues it
is not covered because Plaintiff's vehicle is not new and is instead a certified
pre-owned vehicle. In so arguing, Defendant relies on Rodriguez. In
opposition, Plaintiff argues the court should not follow Rodriguez and
disputes its interpretation of the Song-Beverly Act.
Given the role of Rodriguez in both parties' respective arguments
and the fact that the California Supreme Court has granted review, the court stays
this action pending decision by the California Supreme Court.
At the hearing on January 25, 2024, the court intends to set a future
hearing 180 days out for an OSC re: Status of Stay and a Demurrer and Motion to
Strike Setting.
