And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled in favor of plaintiff Xue Ji's motion to amend the judgment to correct a clerical error. The judgment, entered on November 18, 2022, contained a misspelling of Ji's name. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d), the court has the authority to correct clerical mistakes in its judgments or orders. The court finds that the misspelling is a clerical mistake subject to correction and therefore grants Ji's motion. The plaintiff is to submit a new judgment with the correct spelling of the plaintiff's name. The hearing on the motion is set for January 25, 2024.
