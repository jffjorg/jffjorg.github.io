The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Elizabeth Turriaga vs. General Motors, LLC. The case involves a lemon law action, where the plaintiff is seeking damages for a defective vehicle. The defendant has filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's breach of express warranty causes of action, arguing that the vehicle is not covered by the Song-Beverly Act because it is a certified pre-owned vehicle, not a new one. The defendant relies on the case of Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC, which is currently under review by the California Supreme Court. The plaintiff disputes the interpretation of Rodriguez and the court's decision to stay the action pending the California Supreme Court's review. The judge intends to set a future hearing 180 days out to address the status of the stay and the demurrer and motion to strike.
