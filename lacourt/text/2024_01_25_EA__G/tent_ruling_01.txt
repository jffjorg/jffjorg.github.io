  Case Number:  21PSCV00337    Hearing Date:   January 25, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Xue Ji’s Motion to Amend Judgment to Correct
Clerical Error
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Xue Ji’s Motion to Amend Judgment to Correct
Clerical Error is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
On April 29, 2021, Plaintiff
Xue Ji filed a complaint against Defendants Zhili Song and Does 1-50, alleging
the following causes of action: (1) fraud, (2) breach of contract, and (3)
unjust enrichment.
On November 18, 2022, the
court entered judgment in favor of Ji against Song.
On November 22, 2023, Ji
filed the present motion and amended the motion on November 27. A hearing on
Ji’s motion is set for January 25, 2024.
ANALYSIS
Ji
moves to amend the judgment entered on November 18, 2022 by correcting a
misspelling of a Ji’s name. For the following reasons, the court GRANTS Ji’s motion.
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d), “[t]he court may, upon
motion of the injured party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in
its judgment or orders as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order
directed, and may, on motion of either party after notice to the other party,
set aside any void judgment or order.” In this case, Ji points to item 5(a) of
the judgment which lists the plaintiff as “Xue Jji.” Because this appears to be
a misspelling of Ji’s name, the court finds this to be a clerical mistake
subject to correction.
Accordingly,
Ji’s motion is GRANTED.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Ji’s
motion is GRANTED.  Plaintiff to
submit a new judgment with the correct spelling of Plaintiff’s name.
