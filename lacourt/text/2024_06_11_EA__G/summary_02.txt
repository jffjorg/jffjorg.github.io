And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendants, Diamond City Shopping Center, LLC and Bently Real Estate LLC, have filed a motion to set aside and vacate the default judgment against them. The court has reviewed the motion and has denied it. The reason for the denial is that the motion was filed more than six months after the entry of default, which is beyond the jurisdictional time limit for granting statutory relief. The court also notes that the defendants' answer was untimely, as it was submitted after the entry of default. The court concludes that the defendants did not timely request relief and therefore lacks jurisdiction to consider their request.
