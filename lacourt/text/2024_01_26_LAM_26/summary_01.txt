And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in a case involving Annette Zargaryan as the plaintiff and EDGAR AYRAPETYAN as one of the defendants. The plaintiff has filed proof of service of the Summons and Complaint, but certain defendants, including EDGAR AYRAPETYAN, have not responded despite the time for them to file a responsive pleading having lapsed. As a result, the judge has ordered the plaintiff to appear at a hearing on February 28, 2024, and explain why sanctions, including monetary sanctions of at least $500 and/or dismissal, should not be imposed for the failure to cause entry of default.

Additionally, the judge has ordered the plaintiff to file a declaration explaining the failure to obtain entry of defaults and any efforts undertaken to seek those defaults. The case management conference has been continued to February 28, 2024, and all parties are required to appear.

The judge has also considered a motion by Counsel, Ilya Alekseyeff, to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff, Annette Zargaryan. Counsel has filed a motion and amended proposed order, and has lodged a copy of the proposed order with the court. The judge is inclined to grant the motion, but requires Counsel to submit a corrected proposed order at the hearing. The judge has also ordered Counsel to serve a copy of the signed order on the plaintiff within three days and to file proof of service of the signed order.
