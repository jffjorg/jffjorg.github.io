 Case Number:  23LBCV01086    Hearing Date:   June 25, 2024    Dept:  S27 Defendant propounded supplemental
interrogatories and supplemental RPDs on Plaintiff on 2/07/24.  To date, despite an attempt to meet and
confer, Plaintiff has not served responses. 
Defendant therefore seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to respond,
without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions.
 
Defendant’s motions are
granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to serve
verified responses to supplemental interrogatories and supplemental RPDs,
without objections, within ten days.  CCP
§§2030.290(a),(b), 2031.300(a),(b).  
 
Sanctions are mandatory.  §§2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).  Defendant seeks sanctions in the amount of $572/motion.  Defense Counsel bills at the rate of $133/hour.  The Court awards one hour to prepare each
form discovery motion.  The Court
strongly encourages remote appearances, and therefore awards one hour for the
remote appearance in connection with the motions.  The Court therefore awards a total of three
hours of attorney time at the rate of $133/hour, or $399, in attorneys’
fees.  Defendant seeks to recover two
filing fees of $40 each.  The Court is
aware that filing fees are $60/motion, not $40/motion, and therefore awards
$120 in filing fees.  The Court therefore
awards a total of $519 in sanctions.  
 
Sanctions are sought and imposed
against Plaintiff and his attorney of record, jointly and severally; they are
ordered to pay sanctions to Defendant, by and through his attorney of record,
in the total amount of $519, within twenty days.     
 
Defendant is ordered to give
notice.
