 Case Number:  23LBCV02109    Hearing Date:   June 25, 2024    Dept:  S27 Defendant, Enterprise Rent-a-Car
Company of Los Angeles, LLC filed a motion to quash on 3/26/24, setting it for
hearing on 10/17/24.  It filed an amended
motion to quash on 3/28/24, again setting the motion for hearing on
10/17/24.  On 4/05/24, during a Case
Management Conference, the Court advanced the hearing on the motion to quash
and rescheduled it for 6/25/24.  On the
same day, the moving defendant filed an answer to the complaint.
 
On 6/05/24, Plaintiff’s attorney
filed a declaration indicating Defense Counsel had agreed that the motion is
moot because service issues were cured, and that Defense Counsel agreed to take
the motion off calendar.  To date,
Defendant has not taken the motion to quash off calendar.  Hearing the motion to quash, however, would
be inconsistent with the fact that Defendant filed an answer to the complaint.  The Court therefore takes the motion to quash
off calendar as moot in light of the fact that Defendant filed an answer to the
complaint.  The Court asks Defense
Counsel to use the online reservation management system to promptly take
matters off calendar in the future in connection with this and other actions
when matters become moot.  
 
Defendant is ordered to give
notice.  
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the
tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed
off calendar.  If a party submits on
the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify
the party submitting on the tentative.  If
the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear
remotely.
