Here is the summary in YAML format and a brief English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 23LBCV01025
* Hearing Date: June 25, 2024
* Dept: S27

**Allegations**

* Plaintiff 562 Discount Med, Inc. filed a complaint against Defendant Glass House Brands, Inc. for violating BPC ยง17200.
* Plaintiff alleges Defendant is a black market cannabis seller, profiting off illegal sales, and holds itself out as a licensed and legal operator.

**Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings**

* Defendant moves for judgment on the pleadings on three grounds: abstention, lack of standing, and safe harbor doctrine.

**Tentative Ruling**

The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend, dismissing the action based on the doctrine of equitable abstention. The court finds that issuing an injunction would be overly burdensome and that the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) is better equipped to enforce the cannabis regulations. The court declines to rule on Defendant's other arguments and orders Defendant to give notice.

**Key Points**

* The court takes judicial notice of various documents, including those related to Defendant's alleged illegal activities.
* The court finds that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring the action.
* The court grants Defendant's motion based on the doctrine of equitable abstention, citing Alvarado v. Selma Convalescent Hosp. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1292, 1298.
* The court declines to rule on Plaintiff's arguments and orders Defendant to give notice.

**Significant Statements**

* "Courts may abstain from adjudicating a lawsuit and issuing injunctive relief when the injunctive relief would place an unnecessary burden on the court because of the existence of other, more effective remedies." (Alvarado v. Selma Convalescent Hosp.)
