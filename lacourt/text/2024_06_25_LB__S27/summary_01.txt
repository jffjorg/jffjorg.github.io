And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute between Consuelo Almazan (Plaintiff) and American Honda Motor Company, Inc. (Defendant) over a violation of the Song-Beverly Act and breach of warranty of merchantability. The Defendant moved to compel arbitration under a third party beneficiary theory and an estoppel theory, but the judge has denied this motion.

The judge's ruling is based on the Ochoa decision, which held that a manufacturer cannot enforce a dealership's arbitration agreement under a third party beneficiary and/or estoppel theory. The judge finds that the Defendant's attempt to compel arbitration under the lease agreement is similarly invalid.

Additionally, the judge finds that the Defendant waived its right to compel arbitration due to its unreasonable delay in moving to compel arbitration. The Defendant answered the complaint almost a year before filing the motion to compel arbitration, fully participated in the litigation, and the case is scheduled for trial on July 15, 2024.

The judge has ordered the Defendant to give notice of the denial of the motion to compel arbitration. If the parties intend to submit on the tentative, they must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so.
