And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses Plaintiff Shabi Cohen's motion to seal the Complaint and parts of the First Amended Complaint. The court finds that the Plaintiff has not met his burden to show an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the entire original Complaint, and therefore denies the motion to seal the entire Complaint. However, the court grants the motion to seal portions of the First Amended Complaint that contain information from a settlement agreement with a confidentiality provision. The court orders that the unredacted version of the Complaint shall not be filed under seal, but the unredacted version of the First Amended Complaint shall be filed under seal.
