[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s demurrer to answer filed by
  defendant paul j. dougherty
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Shahnaz Bahadori     
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Demurrer to Answer filed by Defendant Paul J. Dougherty
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this demurrer.  No opposition papers were filed.  
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Shahnaz Bahadori (“Plaintiff”) filed the pending demurrer on
September 27, 2023, moving the court for an order sustaining her demurrer to
the answer filed by defendant Paul J. Dougherty (“Defendant”) on September 15,
2023. 
Thereafter, on November 2, 2023, Defendant (along with defendants Paul
J. Dougherty, M.D., Inc., Dougherty Laser Vision, DLV Vision, DLV Vision
Management, LLC, DLV Vision ASC, LLC, and Sharmini Asha Balakrishnan, M.D.)
filed the operative First Amended Answer to Plaintiff’s Second Amended
Complaint.  (Nov. 2, 2023 Answer, p. 1:23
[listing Defendant as an answering defendant].) 
The First Amended Answer supersedes the answer filed by Defendant on
September 15, 2023.  (State
Compensation Ins. Fund v. Superior Court (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1124, 1130
[“an amendatory pleading supersedes the original one, which ceases to perform
any function as a pleading”] [internal quotations omitted].)  Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff’s
demurrer, which is directed to the superseded answer, is moot.  (Id. at p. 1131 [“the filing of an
amended [pleading] moots a motion directed to a prior [pleading]”].)  The court therefore takes off calendar
Plaintiff’s demurrer as moot.
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
plaintiff Shahnaz Bahadori’s complaint to defendant Paul J. Dougherty’s answer
is taken off calendar as moot. 
            The court orders defendant Paul J.
Dougherty to give notice of this ruling.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  March 14, 2024
