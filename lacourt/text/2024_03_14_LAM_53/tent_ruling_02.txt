[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to seal
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Shabi Cohen  
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Seal
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Shabi Cohen (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
sealing (1) the Complaint filed by Plaintiff on June 8, 2023, and (2) portions
of the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff on February 8, 2024.  Specifically, Plaintiff requests that the
court seal (1) the original complaint in its entirety; (2) portions of paragraphs
12-17, 19-28, 31-33, 35-38, 40, and 42-43 of the First Amended Complaint, as
shown on the redacted First Amended Complaint filed on February 8, 2024; (3) portions
of paragraphs 2, 4, 6, and 8 of the prayer in the First Amended Complaint, as
shown on the redacted First Amended Complaint filed on February 8, 2024; and
(4) exhibit A to the First Amended Complaint in its entirety.  (Redacted FAC filed February 8, 2024.)  
Generally,
court records are presumed to be open unless confidentiality is required by
law.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd. (c).)¿ If the presumption of
access applies, the court may order that a record be filed under seal “if it
expressly finds facts that establish: (1) There exists an overriding interest
that overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2) The overriding
interest supports sealing the record; (3) A substantial probability exists that
the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) The
proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) No less restrictive means exist
to achieve the overriding interest.”¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd.
(d).)¿¿ 
First, the
court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden to show (1) that there exists
an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the entire
original complaint filed on June 8, 2023, and (2) that the proposal to seal the
entire original complaint filed on June 8, 2023 is narrowly tailored.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 2.550, subds.
(d)(1), (d)(4).)  The court therefore
denies Plaintiff’s motion to seal the original Complaint, without prejudice to
Plaintiff’s filing a motion to seal portions of the Complaint that is narrowly
tailored.
Second, the
court finds that Plaintiff has met his burden to show, as to the portions of
paragraphs 12-17, 19-28, 31-33, 35-38, 40, and 42-43, the
portions of paragraphs 2, 4, 6, and 8 of the prayer, and exhibit A of the First
Amended Complaint, as described above, that (1) there exists an overriding
interest that overcomes the right of public access to those records because
those portions of the First Amended Complaint include or refer to information set
forth in a settlement agreement that has a confidentiality provision; (2) the
overriding interest supports sealing the record so that the settlement
agreement remains confidential and to ensure that Plaintiff does not commit a
material breach thereof; (3) a substantial probability exists that the
overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) the
proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) no less restrictive means exist to achieve
the overriding interest.  (Cal. Rules of
Ct., rule 2.550, subd. (d); Lubin Decl., ¶¶ 3-5.)  The court therefore grants Plaintiff’s motion
as to those portions of the First Amended Complaint.  
ORDER
The court grants in part plaintiff Shabi Cohen’s motion to seal as
follows. 
The court orders that the unredacted version of plaintiff Shabi
Cohen’s Complaint, filed on June 8, 2023, shall not be filed under seal.        
The court orders that the unredacted version of plaintiff Shabi
Cohen’s “First Amended Complaint,” lodged with the court on or about February
8, 2024, shall be filed under seal. 
Pursuant
to California Rules of Court, rule 2.551, subdivision (e), the court directs
the clerk to file this order, maintain the records ordered sealed in a secure
manner, and clearly identify the records as sealed by this order.¿¿¿¿ 
            The court orders plaintiff Shabi
Cohen to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
