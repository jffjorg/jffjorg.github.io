And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the deposition excerpts and finds them troubling, particularly the frequent and improper speaking objections made by plaintiff's counsel. Despite this, the judge did not see any instances where the plaintiff was instructed not to answer a question. The judge has granted the application for an OST and will discuss an appropriate hearing date with counsel, likely later next week. The defendant must lodge the full transcript of the deposition by 4:00 pm on Monday. The judge will reserve ruling on whether the deposition should be continued. The judge also notes that while it is best practice for all attendees to identify themselves on the record, failure to do so is not a ground for terminating the deposition. Additionally, the judge reminds counsel that the human defendant is not allowed to have a representative attend the deposition and that counsel should tone down the level of hostility and advise their clients to do the same.
