And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 23SMCV01463. The unopposed motion to compel discovery has been granted, and sanctions of $1860 have been imposed against the defendant, but not against their counsel, for failing to comply with discovery obligations. The motions to deem RFA's to be admitted have also been granted, unless verified responses were served prior to the hearing. The defendant has been ordered to serve further responses to the RFP within 5 court days and produce responsive documents at that time. The Judge notes that there are 11 more discovery motions on the calendar and is concerned that this may be a tactic by the defendant and defense counsel to increase the cost of litigation. If this behavior continues, the Judge will take appropriate action against the defendant and defense counsel. The Judge also expresses surprise that the defense has not bothered to explain its failure to comply with discovery obligations.
