  Case Number:  22SMCV01060    Hearing Date:   March 15, 2024    Dept:  I The application for an OST is GRANTED.  The court will discuss with counsel an
appropriate hearing date, likely late next week as well as a date for the
opposition to be filed.  There will be no
right of reply.  The full transcript of
the deposition will be lodged by 4:00 pm Monday by defendant.
The court has reviewed the deposition excerpts.  They are troubling.  It does appear that plaintiff’s counsel
engaged in speaking objections frequently and improperly.  However, the court did not see an instance
where plaintiff was instructed not to answer a question.
As to the more salient question—whether the deposition
should be continued—the court will reserve ruling, of course.  Just a quick note.  While it is certainly the better practice for
all those attending the deposition to make themselves known on the record as
soon as practicable once they join, the failure to do so is not a ground to
terminate the deposition absent some prejudice. 
A second point: the defendant is entitled to be at the deposition, but a
human defendant is not allowed to have a “representative” attend.  It is not necessarily uncommon, but it is not
a “right” that one has.  That said, it
appears that defense counsel was willing to have those individuals leave if it bothered
plaintiff but plaintiff left anyway.
The level of hostility here is troubling to the court.  Counsel would be well advised to tone it down
immediately and tell their respective clients to do the same.
