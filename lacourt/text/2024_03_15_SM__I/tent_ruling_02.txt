 Case Number:  23SMCV01463    Hearing Date:   March 15, 2024    Dept:  I The unopposed
motion to compel discovery are GRANTED.  Sanctions
are imposed in the total amount of $1860 against defendant, but not counsel,
payable within 30 days, for each of the three motions.  The motions to deem RFA’s to be admitted is
GRANTED unless verified responses were served prior to the hearing, in which
case the substance of the motion is MOOT but the sanctions remain.  The further responses to the RFP will be
served within 5 court days and the responsive documents will be produced at
that time.  The responses will be
verified and without objection other than privilege concerning the RFP’s, but
any document withheld on the basis of privilege will be logged sufficient to
make out a prima facie case of privilege.  
The court
notes that there is a raft of discovery motions on the calendar—11 more to be
exact.  The quantity is such that the
court is concerned that this might be a tactic by defendant and defense counsel
to run up the cost of litigation.  If
this sort of unethical behavior continues, the court will take appropriate
action against defendant and defense counsel. 
The court can think of no reason why the defense is ignoring its
discovery obligations here and not bothering to explain itself.  The court also notes that if the court’s
suspicions are confirmed, further sanctions will be imposed on counsel as
well.
