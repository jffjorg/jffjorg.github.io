And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motions to compel responses to requests for production and form and special interrogatories from the defendants. The defendants are ordered to serve responses within 20 days without raising any objections. The judge has also awarded sanctions against the defendants in the amount of $1,650.00, payable to the plaintiff within 30 days. The judge's decision is based on the Code of Civil Procedure, which states that a responding party must respond to a production demand or interrogatories by complying, objecting, or representing that they lack the ability to comply. Since the defendants failed to serve timely responses, the plaintiff was entitled to move for an order compelling responses. The judge has reduced the sanctions award from $720 per motion to $550 per defendant due to the duplicity of the motions and the fact that they were unopposed.
