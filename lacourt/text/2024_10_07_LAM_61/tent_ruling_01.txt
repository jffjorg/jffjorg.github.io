Defendants are ordered to serve responses, without objections, to their respective motions within 20 days.  Sanctions are awarded against Defendants in the amount of $1,650.00, payable to Plaintiffs within 30 days.Plaintiffs to give notice.DISCUSSIONA propounding party may demand a responding party to produce documents that are in their possession, custody or control. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010.) A party may likewise conduct discovery by propounding interrogatories to another party to be answered under oath. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.010, subd. (a).) The responding party must respond to the production demand either by complying, by representing that the party lacks the ability to comply, or by objecting to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210.) The responding party must respond to the interrogatories by answering or objecting. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) If the responding party fails to serve timely responses, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses to the production demand and interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)A party who fails to serve a timely response to interrogatories or a demand for inspection waives any objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)Plaintiff Edaena Lovillo (Plaintiff) served requests for production and form and special interrogatories upon Defendants Sergio Flores, Graciela Flores, and German Galvez (Defendants) on April 3, 2024, with responses due on May 7, 2024. (Franco Decl. ¶ 2.) Despite attempts to meet and confer with Defendants and the provision of extensions of time to provide responses, no responses were served by the original due date, the extended due date of July 25, 2024, and none have yet been served as of the filing of the motion on July 30, 2024. (Franco Decl. ¶¶ 3–7.)Plaintiff has shown that discovery was served, and no timely response has been received. Defendants have filed no opposition to the motions.The motions are therefore GRANTED.II. SANCTIONSThe prevailing party on a motion to compel is generally entitled to monetary sanctions, unless the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) Sanctions are also mandatory against a party whose failure to serve responses to requests for admission makes the motion necessary. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c).)Plaintiff seeks $720 in sanctions for each of the nine motions at issue here, representing 1.2 hours of attorney work at $550 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee for each motion. (Franco Decl. ¶ 18.) Given the duplicity of the motions and the fact that these motions are unopposed, the court reduces the amount to one hour of attorney time for each set of motions.  This amounts to a total sanctions award of $1,650.00, or $550 per Defendant.Sanctions are awarded against Defendants in the amount of $1,650.00.
