And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the petition filed by Kimberly Jenner Kardashian, Jr. to change her name to Ken La Kardashian. However, the court finds that there are substantial and principled reasons to deny the petition. Specifically, the court notes that the petitioner's given name is not Kimberly Jenner Kardashian, Jr., but rather Jerome Eady, according to the Social Security Number provided. Additionally, the petition is inconsistent in that it requests a change of gender and sex identifier to "nonbinary", but also requests a change to "female". Furthermore, the petition fails to provide an explanation for the name change as required. Therefore, the court denies the petition for change of name.
