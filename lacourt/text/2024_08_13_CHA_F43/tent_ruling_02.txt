SUMMARY OF
ACTION
Plaintiff
Robert Aaron Stephens (Plaintiff) is a current prisoner at Sierra Conservation
Center in Jamestown, CA. Defendant Mrs. Gooch’s Natural Food Markets, Inc. dba
Whole Foods Market (Defendant) is seeking to orally depose Plaintiff at the
Sierra Conservation Center. In order to do so, Defendant needs an order from
the Court.
 
Defendant filed
its motion for leaving permitting the deposition of Plaintiff in prison on February
6, 2024. No opposition has been filed.
 
ANALYSIS
Discovery rules
are applied liberally in favor of discovery. (Gonzales v. Superior Court
(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.) Further, all doubts about discovery are
resolved in favor of disclosure. (Glenfed Dev. Corp. v. Superior Court
(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1119.) 
 
Any party may
obtain discovery by taking the oral deposition of any person, including a party
to the action. (CCP § 2025.010.) Penal Code § 2623 allows for the examination
by deposition of a prisoner in a civil action upon motion of the deposing party
if the Court orders as such. Similarly, CCP § 1995 also allows for the
deposition of a prisoner upon order of the Court. 
 
Defendant was
required to file this motion in order to obtain an order from the Court to
depose Plaintiff. Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s testimony is necessary for
Defendant to prepare its defense to Plaintiff’s slip and fall case. Defendant
argues that Plaintiff’s testimony is material to the matter at hand, making the
deposition in prison necessary and appropriate.
 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court grants Defendant’s motion for leave to permit the oral
deposition of Plaintiff at Sierra Conservation Center in Jamestown, CA.
 
Moving party to
give notice.
