And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by Matthew C. Mullhofer, the attorney for Plaintiff Jan Salamudin, to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff. However, the motion fails because it was not filed on the required forms (MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053). Despite this, the judge is denying the motion without prejudice, allowing the attorney to refile on the correct forms.
