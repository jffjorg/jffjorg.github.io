And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for leave to permit the oral deposition of the plaintiff, who is a current prisoner at Sierra Conservation Center in Jamestown, CA. The defendant seeks to take the deposition at the prison to prepare its defense in the plaintiff's slip and fall case. The judge's decision is based on the liberal application of discovery rules, which favor disclosure over nondisclosure. The judge notes that the defendant was required to file the motion to obtain an order from the court to depose the plaintiff, and that the deposition is necessary and appropriate to obtain the plaintiff's testimony. The judge orders the defendant to give notice of the deposition.
