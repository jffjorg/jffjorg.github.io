ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
            On April 1, 2022, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendants Kyle Lapesarde
(“Kyle”) and Mary Lapesarde aka Mary J Lapesarde (“Mary”) (collectively “Defendants”)
for subrogation, stemming from an automobile collision between Defendant Kyle,
on the one hand, and an individual insured by Plaintiff’s automobile insurance policy,
on the other hand.  (Compl.)  Defendant Kyle was alleged to have been
operating the vehicle with the express or implied permission of Defendant
Mary.  Plaintiff compensated the insured
for claimed damages in the amount of $3,850.89 and filed the instant claim
against Defendants for allegedly causing the damages.  (Ibid. pp. 2-3.)  On July 13, 2022, Defendants filed a joint
Answer.
 
On September 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a Stipulation for Dismissal with Reservation to Vacate and Enter Judgment Upon
Breach (“Stipulation”), signed by both parties, to dismiss the action on the
premise that Defendant Kyle would compensate Plaintiff for the settlement
amount of $3,381.17.  On November 2, 2023,
the Court dismissed the entire case without prejudice pursuant to the
Stipulation.
 
On May 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment (“Motion”).  Plaintiff has submitted the motion on the
moving papers and will not appear at the hearing.  (Mot. p. 2.)
 
No opposition has been filed.

Legal
Standard & Discussion 
 
CCP § 664.6, provides a summary
procedure that enables judges to enforce a settlement agreement by entering a
judgment pursuant to the terms of the parties’ settlement.  In particular, the statute provides:
 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed by a
party if it is signed by any of the following:
 
(1) The party.
(2) An attorney who represents the party.
(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is authorized
in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf.
 
CCP §
664.6(a)-(b) (emphasis added).

Discussion
 
A. Retention of Jurisdiction
 
“‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an
action or special proceeding terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the
matter.’  (Conservatorship of Martha
P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867) [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 142.) ‘If requested
by the parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain jurisdiction over
the parties to enforce [a] settlement until performance in full of the terms of
the settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)” 
(Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 33
Cal.App.5th 913, 917.)  “‘Because of its
summary nature, strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is
prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement
agreement.’”  (Ibid. (quoting Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37).)
 
“A request for the trial court to
retain jurisdiction under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three
requirements which the Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for
section 664.6 enforcement of the settlement itself: the request must be made
(1) during the pendency of the case, not after the case has been dismissed in
its entirety, (2) by the parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed
by the parties or orally before the court.’” 
(Ibid. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th
429, 440).)  “The ‘request must be
express, not implied from other language, and it must be clear and
unambiguous.’” (Ibid. (quoting Wackeen, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at
440).)
 
Here, the parties signed a
Stipulation for Dismissal with Reservation to Vacate and Enter Judgment Upon
Breach (“Stipulation”) containing the parties’ agreement for the Court to
retain jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §664.6 to enforce the
terms of the stipulation and enter judgment in the event of default.  (Stipulation ¶ 3.)  Prior to the dismissal of this action, the
Stipulation was signed by the parties and submitted to the Court.  (Ibid. at p. 3.)  The Court dismissed the entire case without
prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation and expressly stated that it “shall
retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6.” 
(11-2-23 Order.)
 
The Court finds that the
Stipulation complies with § 664.6 requirements and the Court has retained
jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant to the parties’ Stipulation in this
action.
 
B. Entry of Judgment
 
The Stipulation
Agreement filed on September 28, 2023, provides that Plaintiff and Defendant Kyle
agreed to dismiss the action on the premise that Defendant Kyle would
compensate Plaintiff for the settlement amount of $3,381.17.  (Stipulation ¶ 2.)  Pursuant to the Stipulation, Defendant’s
insurance, Farmers Insurance, would make an initial payment of $2,381.17 by September
28, 2023, and subsequently, Kyle would make two payments of $500, one on
November 1, 2023, and one on February 1, 2023 . 
(Ibid.) 
 
The Stipulation
also provides that in the event Defendant fails to make timely payments,
Plaintiff will mail a letter to Defendant regarding the default.  (Ibid. at ¶ 3.)  If Defendant does not remedy the default
within 14 days of receiving notice, “then plaintiff will be entitled to have
any dismissal in this action set aside and judgment entered for the settlement
amount, minus credit for payments received, plus any costs associated with
entering the judgment not to exceed $500.” 
(Ibid.)  The declaration of
Plaintiff’s counsel shall be sufficient proof for judgment to be entered.  (Ibid.)
 
On May 30, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for an order to vacate the dismissal and
enter judgment against Defendant Kyle.  (Memo.
p. 1.)  According to Plaintiff’s counsel,
Defendant’s insurance carrier made a one-time payment of $2,381.17; however,
Defendant failed to make any payments. 
(Reese Decl. ¶ 4) Around April 29, 2024, Plaintiff mailed Defendant a
letter regarding the missed payments; however, Defendant has not made any payments.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 5-6, Ex. C.)
 
Plaintiff seeks to have the
dismissal set aside and judgment entered against Defendant Kyle in the amount
of $1,365 as follows: $3,381.17 (settlement amount), minus $2,381.17 (payment
made by Defendant’s insurance carrier), plus $365 (court costs).  (Ibid. at ¶ 7.)  The court costs consist of $225 complaint filing
fee, $80 service of process fee, and $60.00 motion fee.  (Ibid.)
 
The Court finds the
Stipulation to be valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Proc. § 664.6.  Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant defaulted
on payments and has not made any additional payments after Plaintiff sent
notice.  Thus, a valid
and signed stipulation agreement was breached and the Court retained
jurisdiction to enter judgment upon breach.
