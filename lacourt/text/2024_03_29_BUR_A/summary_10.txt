And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the application for a writ of possession filed by Centra Funding, LLC (Plaintiff) against Anko Services and Andrii Bunk (Defendants). The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants defaulted on an Equipment Finance Agreement and remain in possession of a UTP160-P3 Silent Diesel Generator. The Plaintiff applied for a writ of possession to reclaim the generator.

The judge notes that the Plaintiff did not attach proof of service showing that the Defendants have been served with the application and notice of application and hearing, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) § 512.060. The judge also notes that the application does not contain a copy of the Equipment Finance Agreement, as required by C.C.P. § 512.010(1).

Based on these findings, the judge DENIED the Application for Writ of Possession without prejudice. The judge ordered the Plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
