And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash 11 subpoenas requesting medical records from Claimant David Minkin. The subpoenas were issued by Respondent United Financial Casualty Company, who is seeking damages from Claimant after an uninsured motorist accident on April 17, 2018. The parties previously agreed to limit the scope of the subpoenas to the relevant body parts, but Respondent is seeking medical records from a broader time period. The judge finds that Claimant has adequately demonstrated a privacy interest in his medical records and that the subpoenas are overbroad in both time and scope. Therefore, the motion to quash is GRANTED.
