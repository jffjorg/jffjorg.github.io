And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer and motion to strike filed by CP Custom Woodworks, Inc. (Defendant) against Simon Moshe (Plaintiff) on February 9, 2024. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant breached an oral agreement between the two regarding a joint business venture. The Defendant argued that the complaint should be dismissed, while the Plaintiff claimed that the agreement was valid. However, on March 22, 2024, the parties reached a joint stipulation regarding amendment, which includes a proposed order approving the stipulation and installing the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) as the operative complaint. As a result, the judge has ruled that the Demurrer and Motion to Strike are moot and will be taken off the court's calendar. The judge has also continued the Order to Show Cause regarding sanctions for failure to appear and the Case Management Conference to August 3, 2024.
