And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to vacate the default judgment and set aside the default without prejudice. The defendant, Leon Krous Drilling, Inc., had defaulted in the case and a default judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff, Creditors Adjustment Bureau. The defendant then moved to vacate the default judgment and set aside the default, arguing that it did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit. The judge found that service of process was proper and resulted in actual notice to the defendant, and that the defendant's neglect was not excusable. The judge also found that the defendant did not provide sufficient evidence to show that its neglect was caused by the mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect of its attorney. As a result, the judge denied the motion without prejudice, meaning that the defendant can still file a new motion to vacate the default judgment and set aside the default if it can provide new evidence or arguments.
