And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a Tentative Ruling in the case of Deijae Malik Johnson v. Burbank Holdings 2000 LLC, granting Burbank Holdings' demurrer to the fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action. The Court finds that Plaintiff has not pled sufficient facts to support his claims against Burbank Holdings for negligence, premises liability, and negligent hiring, retention, or supervision.

The Court notes that Plaintiff has not alleged a special relationship between himself and Burbank Holdings, nor has he alleged that Burbank Holdings employed Christian Doe, the club promoter who allegedly assaulted Plaintiff. The Court also finds that Plaintiff's allegations of duty and breach are insufficient to state a cause of action.

The Court grants Burbank Holdings' demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend. If Plaintiff wishes to amend his complaint, he must do so within the allotted time period.
