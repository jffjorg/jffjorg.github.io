ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Before the Court is a
motion brought by Rozanna Avetyan (Plaintiff) compelling Arpine Melikyan’s (Defendant) response to Form and
Special Interrogatories. Plaintiff initially filed this motion with a motion to
compel responses to Requests for Production of Documents and a motion to deem
Request for Admissions Matters Admitted. These other motions were advanced then
vacated at a February 29, 2024 Status Conference, but the motion to compel
interrogatory responses remains. Defendant has rendered no opposition to this
motion. 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
If a party served with interrogatories fails to timely respond,
then the propounding party may move for an order compelling response and for a
monetary sanction.  (C.C.P. § 2030.290(b).)  The statute contains no
time limit for a motion to compel when no responses are served.  The
moving party need only show that a set of interrogatories was properly served
on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired and that no
response of any kind has been served.  (See Leach v. Superior Court
(1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
Generally, the Court may impose
a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct. (C.C.P.
§ 2023.030(a).) 
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
On October 6, 2023, Plaintiff propounded her
Form and Special Interrogatories via e-mail upon Defendant’s counsel. (Campain
Decl. ¶ 2.) Defendant did not respond by the November 7, 2023 deadline.
(Campain Decl. ¶ 3.)  Plaintiff’s
counsel attempted to meet and confer with Defendant’s counsel regarding the
responses, indicating they would bring this motion if no response was had
before January 31, 2024. (Campain Decl. ¶ 4.) Defendant’s counsel did not
respond to this meet and confer email. (Campain Decl. ¶ 5.) 
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s unopposed
motion to compel initial responses to her Special and Form Interrogatories is
GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions 
 
Any monetary sanctions granted are within the
discretionary power of the Court as per C.C.P. § 2030.290. As per C.C.P. §
2023.010(d), failure to respond constitutes a misuse of the discovery process.
Further, it is customary to grant sanctions where a party has filed a motion to
compel, and the other party fails to file an opposition. (C.R.C., Rule
3.1348(a).)  
 
Here, Plaintiff has prepared and filed a motion
to compel while Defendant has rendered no opposition. The Court awards
sanctions against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel jointly and severally, in
the amount of $1,160. This amount reflects two hours of attorney work at a rate
of $550 per hour and the $60.00 filing fee. (Campain Decl. ¶ 6.)
