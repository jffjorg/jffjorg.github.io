of intent to appear is required.  Unless the Court directs argument in the
Tentative Ruling, no argument will be permitted unless a “party notifies all
other parties and the court by 4:00 p.m. on the court day before the hearing of
the party’s intention to appear and argue.  The tentative ruling will
become the ruling of the court if no notice of intent to appear is received.”

DISCUSSION:

 
Simon
Moshe (Plaintiff) brings this action against CP
Custom Woodworks, Inc. (Defendant). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant breached
an oral agreement between the two concerning a joint business venture. 
 
On
February 9, 2024, Defendant filed their Demurrer and Motion to Strike to
Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint (FAC). On March 15, 2024, Plaintiff
attempted to file his Second Amended Complaint (SAC). Plaintiff’s filing was
rejected as he did not seek leave of the Court to amend his pleading. (See C.C.P.
§ 472(a).) 
 
On March
22, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition which informs that the parties reached
a joint stipulation regarding amendment. Plaintiff attaches his SAC and the joint
stipulation signed by counsel for both parties. (See Oppo. Exh. A.) Plaintiff
also attaches a proposed order approving the joint stipulation and instating
the SAC as the operative complaint. 
 
Given the
foregoing, Defendants Demurrer and Motion to Strike are MOOT and will be taken
off the Court’s calendar. The Court will review and sign the proposed order
approving the joint stipulation.
