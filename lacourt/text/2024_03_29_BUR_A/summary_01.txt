And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a motion by the plaintiffs, Erma L. Miller, TR, and L.B. Stites, to relieve them from the court's July 7, 2023 order. The court granted State Farm General Insurance Company's six discovery motions, including an order compelling the production of documents and imposing monetary sanctions against the plaintiffs.

The judge finds that the plaintiffs failed to respond to discovery requests, despite several extensions, and that their failure was not the result of excusable neglect. The judge denies the motion as to the plaintiffs Miller and TR.

However, the judge grants the motion in part as to the plaintiff Stites, finding that his failure to respond to discovery requests was due to his hospitalization. The judge allows Stites to withdraw his admissions and relieve him from his waiver of objections, but sanctions remain.

The judge also notes that the relief granted to Stites does not negate the mandatory nature of sanctions for failure to timely respond to requests for admission (RFA) imposed by California Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280(c).
