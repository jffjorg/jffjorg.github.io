Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's unopposed motion to compel discovery responses from the defendant. The defendant failed to respond to the plaintiff's Form and Special Interrogatories, which were propounded on October 6, 2023. Despite attempts to meet and confer, the defendant's counsel did not respond to the plaintiff's counsel's email. As a result, the judge awards sanctions against the defendant and the defendant's counsel jointly and severally in the amount of $1,160. The defendant must produce responses to the interrogatories within 30 days, and payment of the sanctions must be made within 30 days.
