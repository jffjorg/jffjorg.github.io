Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Defendant Stephanie Wu's motion to vacate default judgment and set aside default. The judge finds that Defendant did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit and that the substituted service of summons was defective. The judge also grants Defendant's motion to quash service of summons.

The judge's ruling is based on the following factors:

* Defendant's declaration stating that she did not receive notice of the lawsuit
* The process server's affidavit, which creates a rebuttable presumption that service was valid, but which is rebutted by Defendant's evidence
* The lack of documentation showing that Defendant was aware of the lawsuit or had actual notice
* The fact that Defendant's insurance information was exchanged with Plaintiff at the time of the accident, but this does not necessarily mean that Defendant was aware of the lawsuit

The judge's ruling is also based on the policy of liberally granting relief to parties who have not received actual notice of a lawsuit, and of favoring hearings on the merits whenever possible. The judge has scheduled an order to show cause regarding proof of service and a case management conference for August 1, 2024.
