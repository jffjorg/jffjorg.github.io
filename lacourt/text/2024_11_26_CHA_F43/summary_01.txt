And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting Bank of America's motion to deem its requests for admission admitted and awarding sanctions. The motion was filed on September 30, 2024, after Bank of America served requests for admission on Gurmit Singh on June 19, 2024, and Singh failed to serve responses. The Court found that Singh's failure to respond waived any objections, including those based on privilege or work product protection, and that the requests are relevant to the case. As a result, the Court deems the requests for admission admitted and awards sanctions. The motion is granted, and Bank of America is ordered to give notice.
