And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Katherine Keller v. Robert H. Bisno, et al. The Plaintiff has requested sanctions against the Defendants in the amount of $13,620.00 for opposing an anti-SLAPP motion. The Court has denied the request without prejudice, allowing the Plaintiff to bring the request as a separate motion. The Court requires a noticed motion for sanctions to allow the parties to properly brief the sanctions request. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff's sanctions request is based on both procedural grounds and the contention that the anti-SLAPP motion was meritless, and that it may be best resolved after a decision on the merits of the anti-SLAPP motion.
