Plaintiff Diana Lopez moves for an order approving the
settlement in this PAGA case.
 
The Court tentatively GRANTS the motion, but requests
argument from Plaintiff on the appropriateness of the 33% attorney fee of $346,500.00,
which is higher than the lodestar of $148,360.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff was employed by Defendant White Memorial Medical
Center (“Defendant”) beginning in 2018. 
 
The main claims in this case are that non-exempt employees
were not paid for ‘waiting time’ while going through Covid-19 clearance prior
to starting their shifts and that case managers were not given meal and rest breaks.
 
Plaintiff filed this action on May 24, 2021, seeking civil
penalties against Defendant under the PAGA. In particular, the Complaint
alleges (a) failure to pay for non-exempt employees time spent on Covid-19
screening; (b) failure to provide meal breaks; (c) failure to provide rest
breaks; (d) failure to promptly pay wages upon termination; (e) failure to
provide accurate wage statements; and (f) failure to pay overtime wages. 
 
On January 31, 2023, the parties engaged in mediation, but
were unable to reach a settlement.
 
On May 5, 2023, Defendant filed a motion for summary
judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on July 6, 2023.
 
The parties subsequently reached a settlement agreement. The
class of Aggrieved Employees covered by the settlement includes all nonexempt
employees, who were classified as hourly, employed by Defendant from March 16,
2020 March 20, 2020, through October 17, 2022.
 
On November 29, 2023, Plaintiff moved for approval of the
settlement. On December 19, 2023, the Court found that the formula for
calculating aggrieved employees’ shares of the funds.
 
On April 30, the parties executed a revised settlement
agreement which modified the formulas to calculate employee’s shares.
 
On May 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a supplemental brief in
support of the motion for approval.
 
Legal Standard
 
Settlement
 
The PAGA is “a procedural
statute allowing an aggrieved employee to recover civil penalties—for Labor
Code violations—that otherwise would be sought by state labor law enforcement
agencies.” (Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1756, AFL-CIO v. Superior Court
(2009) 46 Cal.4th 993, 1003.)  The statute provides a mechanism for
private enforcement of Labor Code violations for the public benefit. (See Arias
v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 969, 986; Ochoa-Hernandez v. Cjaders Foods, Inc. (N.D.Cal. 2010) 2010 WL 1340777, at
p. *4.)   
 
To incentivize employees to
bring PAGA actions, the statute provides aggrieved employees 25 percent of the
recovered civil penalties. (Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (i).) The remaining 75 percent
is distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (“LWDA”) “for
enforcement of labor laws and education of employers and employees about their
rights and responsibilities under [the Labor Code].” (Id.) 
 
In reviewing the terms of a
settlement agreement, courts determine whether the settlement is fair,
reasonable, and adequate to all concerned, and not the product of fraud,
collusion, or overreaching. (Reed v. United Teachers Los Angeles (2012)
208 Cal.App.4th 322, 337; Nordstrom Commission Cases (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 576, 581.) Although a PAGA plaintiff need not satisfy class action
requirements (see Arias v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 969, 975),
general principles applicable to class action settlements apply equally in this
context. In the context of a class action settlement, courts consider various
factors including whether (1) the settlement is the result of arm’s length
bargaining, (2) investigation and discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and
the court to act intelligently, (3) counsel is experienced in similar
litigation, and (4) the percentage of objectors is small. (Nordstrom, supra,
186 Cal.App.4th at 581; Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224,
245.) The final factor is not
applicable to PAGA. (See Arias, supra 46 Cal.4th at p. 984
[rejecting the argument that representative actions under PAGA violate the due
process rights of “nonparty aggrieved employees who are not given notice of,
and an opportunity to be heard”].)
 
In considering the amount of
settlement, courts must be mindful that compromise is inherent and necessary in
the settlement process. (Wershba, supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at 250.) 
 
A proposed PAGA settlement must be submitted to LWDA
at the same time that it is submitted to the court for review and
approval.  (Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)
 
Attorney’s Fees Under Settlement
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.769(b) requires that
“[a]ny agreement… with respect to the payment of attorney fees or the
submission of an application for the approval of attorney fees must be set
forth in full in any application for approval of the dismissal or settlement of
an action that has been certified as a class action.” Despite any agreement by
the parties to the contrary, “the court ha[s] an independent right and
responsibility to review the attorney fee provision of the settlement agreement
and award only so much as it determined reasonable.” (Garabedian v. Los
Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 123, 128.)
 
Discussion
 
Notice to LWDA
 
Plaintiff has filed (albeit late) a notice that the proposed
settlement was submitted to LWDA. 
 
Fairness of Settlement
 
The gross settlement amount is $1,050,000.00. 
 
Under the settlement, several quantities will be deducted
from the gross amount:
 
(1) Up to $15,950.00
in administration costs to ILYM Group Inc. to administer the settlement;
(2) Up to $12,000.00 in litigation costs to Sottile Baltaxe,
Plaintiff’s counsel;
(3) Up to $346,500.00 in attorney’s fees to Sottile Baltaxe;
and
(4) Up to $2,500.00 as a service award to Plaintiff.
 
Following these deductions, the remaining settlement amount
would be roughly $673,050.00.
 
Of the remaining amount, referred to as the “PAGA Penalties
Fund”, 75% will be paid to the LWDA and 25% will be paid to all Aggrieved
Employees.
 
The formula by which the 25% of the fund will be distributed
to individual Aggrieved Employees is as follows:
 
(b) ADJUSTED
PAY PERIODS: means the actual total of PAGA pay periods worked by
Non-Exempt Employees Other Than Care or Case Managers Plus 1.1 x actual total
of PAGA pay periods worked by Care or Case Managers
 
(c)  Non-Exempt Employees Other Than Care or
Case Managers: Individual Aggrieved Employee Settlement Payment = (25% of
the PAGA Penalties divided by the ADJUSTED PAY PERIODS worked by all aggrieved
employees) x (each aggrieved employee's PAGA pay periods worked x 1.0)
 
(d) Non-Exempt
Care or Case Managers: Individual Aggrieved Employee
Settlement
Payment= (25% of the PAGA Penalties / ADJUSTED PAY PERIODS worked by all
aggrieved employees) x (each aggrieved employee's PAGA pay periods worked x
1.1)
 
(Supplemental Brief at p. 3:7-21; Romero Decl. Ex. 1 at p. 3.)
 
The revised settlement formula makes sense and indicates
that aggrieved employees are to be allocated portions of the settlement in
proportion to their pay periods worked as a fraction of all of the pay periods
worked by aggrieved employees.
 
The other factors supporting a presumption of fairness are
present. The settlement agreement contains an acknowledgment that the
settlement was reached at arm’s length with a summary judgment motion pending.
(Baltaxe Decl. ¶¶ 62-63, Exh. 1 at p. 8.) Substantial discovery was conducted;
Plaintiff served Employment Form interrogatories, two sets of Special
Interrogatories, and two sets of Requests for Production of Documents on
Defendant, which Defendant responded to. (Baltaxe Decl. ¶¶ 34-35.) Following
the mediation, where Defendant asserted unexpected facts regarding changes to
the Covid-19 screening program, Plaintiff took the deposition of Arlene Lara,
the person who was in charge of the screening program. (Baltaxe Decl. ¶¶
38-50.) Finally, counsel for Plaintiff has practiced for 36 years and has
extensive experience in employment litigation. (Baltaxe Decl. ¶¶ 6-20.) 
 
The attorney’s fees in the settlement, $346,500.00, is 33%
of the total recovery. It is higher than the lodestar of $148,360. The Court
requests argument on the appropriateness of this fee under the facts of the
case.
