TENTATIVE
RULING
 



KATHERINE KELLER, 
 
                                  Plaintiff,
  
         v.
 
 
ROBERT H. BISNO, et al.,
 
                                  Defendants.
 


 Case No: 
  24STCV04204
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  May 28, 2024
 Calendar Number:  6



 
 
 
Plaintiff requests sanctions against Defendants Robert H.
Bisno; Jeanette Ann Bisno; Bisno Management Company, LLC; Bisno Development
Enterprise, LLC; and Bisno Real Estate Group, LLC (“Defendants”) in the amount
of $13,620.00.
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request without prejudice to
Plaintiff’s ability to bring the request as a separate motion. 
 
Background
 
Plaintiff filed this action on February 20, 2024, raising
claims for (1) malicious prosecution, and (2) violation of the Bane Act.
 
On May 6, 2024, Defendants filed an anti-SLAPP motion,
noticing the hearing for May 28, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on May 9,
2024 arguing, inter alia, that the motion did not provide an adequate notice
period.
 
On May 20, 2024, Defendants withdrew the motion, stating
that they would re-file it with an adequate notice period.
 
On May 21, 2024, Plaintiff requested sanctions in the amount
of $13,620.00 in attorney’s fees for opposing the motion.
 
Discussion
 
If Plaintiff wishes to proceed with a sanctions request, the
Court requires a noticed motion that will allow the parties to properly brief
the sanctions request.
 
Moreover, Plaintiff’s motion is based on both procedural
grounds and on a contention that the anti-SLAPP motion was meritless. Thus it
appears that Plaintiff’s sanctions request would be best resolved after a
decision on the merits of the anti-SLAPP motion, if that timing is possible. 
 
For these reasons, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request
without prejudice to filing it as a separate motion.
