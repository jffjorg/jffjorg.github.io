 Case No: 
  22STCV36148
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  May 28, 2024
 Calendar Number:  2



 
 
 
Plaintiff John Doe A.P. (“Plaintiff”) moves for an order
compelling the California Commission on Teacher Credentialling (the
“Commission”), a non-party, to release unredacted records subpoenaed by
Plaintiff related to investigation of alleged misconduct and violations of now-dismissed
Defendant Eduardo Xavier Yanez.
 
The Commission shall disclose unredacted versions of the
documents with Bates Nos. CTC0019, CTC0024, CTC0030, CTC0035, CTC0043, CTC0051,
CTC0058, CTC0063 and CTC0086, except that it will redact Yanez’s social
security number, date of birth, and other identifying personal information that
does not pertain to his character and fitness. 
 
Moreover, the documents shall be kept confidential by
Plaintiff and used solely for purposes of this litigation.  The Court notes that Plaintiff has expressed
a willingness to stipulate to a protective order; the Court would enter a
stipulated protective order if one is presented.  
 
Background
 
This is a childhood sexual assault case. Plaintiff alleges
that Defendant Yanez, during his employment as a teacher at Defendant Los
Angeles Unified School District (“LAUSD”), committed acts of sexual abuse
against Plaintiff during the 1981 school year, when Plaintiff was a minor
student at LAUSD.
 
Around 1997, Yanez was convicted of sexual abuse of another
minor.
 
In around 1997 or 1998, the Commission suspended and
subsequently revoked Yanez’s teaching credentials.
 
Plaintiff filed this action against Doe 1 and Doe 2 on
November 15, 2022, raising claims for (1) childhood sexual abuse; (2)
intentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”); (3) negligent hiring,
supervision, and retention of unfit employee under Government Code, sections
815.2 and 820; (4) failure to report suspected child abuse under Government
Code, sections 815.2 and 820; (5) negligent supervision of a minor; and (6)
negligence.
 
LAUSD was named as a defendant by Doe amendment on April 21,
2023. Yanez was named as a defendant by Doe amendment on April 27, 2023.
 
On July 14, 2023, Yanez was dismissed from this action per
Plaintiff’s request.
 
On January 4, 2024, Plaintiff served a subpoena on the
Commission, seeking documents relating to investigations on Yanez.
 
On February 5, 2024, the Commission responded, objecting to
the subpoena but providing responsive documents. Portions of the documents were
redacted, portions of Yanez’s application to the Commission concerning Yanez’s
attestations related to his personal and professional fitness. The Commission
explained that its policy is not to produce any of the redacted information
absent a court order.
 
 
 
Legal Standard
 
Any party may obtain
discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject
matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion
made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.) Discovery may relate to the claim or defense of the
party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action. (Ibid.) Courts
have given the words “subject matter” a broad definition that is not limited to
only admissible evidence. (Jessen v. Hartford Casualty Ins. Co. (2003)
111 Cal.App.4th 698, 711.) Accordingly, information is relevant for discovery
purposes if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case,
preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement. (Id. at pgs. 711–712.) Admissibility
is not the test and information, unless privileged, is discoverable if it might
reasonably lead to admissible evidence. (Gonzalez v. Super. Ct. (1995)
33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.) These rules are applied liberally in favor of
discovery and “fishing expeditions” are permissible in some cases. (Ibid.) 
 
“Any party may obtain discovery…by taking in California the
oral deposition of any person, including any party to the action. The person
deposed may be a natural person, an organization such as a public or private
corporation, a partnership, an association, or a governmental agency.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) "Except as provided in subdivision (a) of Section
2025.280 the process by which a nonparty is required to provide discovery is a
deposition subpoena." (Code Civ. Proc., §2020.010, subd. (b). 
 
“A deposition subpoena may command any of the following: 
 
(a) Only the
attendance and the testimony of the deponent, under Article 3 (commencing with
Section 2020.310).
 
(b) Only the
production of business records for copying, under Article 4 (commencing with
Section 2020.410).
 
(c) The attendance
and the testimony of the deponent, as well as the production of business
records, other documents, electronically stored information, and tangible
things, under Article 5 (commencing with Section 2020.510).”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.020.)
 
Discussion
 
            Absent
a court order, the Commission “may disclose, only the following information
relating to the credentials, certificates, permits, or other documents that it
issues: the document number, title, term of validity, subjects, authorizations,
effective dates, renewal requirements, and restrictions. The commission may
also disclose the last known business address of any applicant or credential
holder.” (Ed. Code, § 44230, subd. (a).)
 
Plaintiff’s motion seeks the complete unredacted version of
certain documents described as Bates Nos. CTC0019, CTC0024, CTC0030, CTC0035,
CTC0043, CTC0051, CTC0058, CTC0063 and CTC0086.
 
A teacher’s disciplinary records are generally discoverable
in child sex abuse cases. (Marken v. Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School
District (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1250, 1259.) Such facts are relevant to the
plaintiff’s claims, and the public’s interest in misconduct by teachers
outweighs the potential harm to the teacher’s privacy interests. (Ibid.)
Although the ultimate issue in this case is LAUSD’s awareness, or lack thereof,
of Yanez’s unfitness, the Commission’s records may lead to discoverable information
to that effect. The disciplinary records in question are therefore prima facie
discoverable.
 
The Commission argues that the records may not be admissible
because they are not all business records. Material need not be admissible to
be discoverable.
 
LAUSD and the Commission argue that the records are
protected by the deliberative process privilege.
 
“Under the deliberative process privilege, senior officials
of all three branches of government enjoy a qualified, limited privilege not to
disclose or to be examined concerning not only the mental processes by which a
given decision was reached, but the substance of conversations, discussions,
debates, deliberations and like materials reflecting advice, opinions, and
recommendations by which government policy is processed and formulated.” (San
Joaquin County Local Agency Formation Commission v. Superior Court (2008)
162 Cal.App.4th 159, 170.) “The key question in every case is whether the
disclosure of materials would expose an agency's decisionmaking process in such
a way as to discourage candid discussion within the agency and thereby
undermine the agency's ability to perform its functions.” (Times Mirror Co.
v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325, 1342 [citation and quotation marks
omitted].)
 
As discussed above, the public has an interest in the
fitness of public-school teachers that permits the discovery of disciplinary
records in child sex abuse cases. (Marken v. Santa Monica-Malibu Unified
School District, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th at p. 1259.) This holding
carries an implicit determination that a limited exposure of the agency’s
internal processes is justified for the purposes of such a case.  There has been no showing that such a limited
exposure would discourage candid discussions within the agency.  
 
While it appears that the unredacted versions of CTC0019,
CTC0024, CTC0030, CTC0035, CTC0043, CTC0051, CTC0058, CTC0063 and CTC0086 are
discoverable, the Court does believe that there are limited privacy concerns.
The Court orders that the Commission disclose unredacted versions of the
documents, except that it will redact Yanez’s social security number, date of
birth, and other identifying personal information that does not pertain to his
character and fitness. Plaintiff shall keep these documents confidential and
shall not use them for any other purpose except for this lawsuit.
