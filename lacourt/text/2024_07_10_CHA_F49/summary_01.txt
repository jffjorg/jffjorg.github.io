And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories filed by the defendants. The motion was filed on May 10, 2024, and is based on the defendants' contention that the plaintiff's responses to their special interrogatories were evasive and incomplete. The judge finds that the motion was filed timely and that the defendants made a good faith attempt to resolve the issues through informal means. However, the judge also finds that the defendants failed to demonstrate effective service of the moving papers on the plaintiff, as the plaintiff had filed a substitution of attorney on the same day as the motion, and the defendants did not submit any evidence of service on the self-representing plaintiff. Therefore, the motion is denied, and the request for monetary sanctions is also denied.
