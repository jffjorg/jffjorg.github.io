MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER
RESPONSES TO FIRST SET OF SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES; REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS

Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 22CHCV00784

 
Motion
filed: 5/10/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendants Macaria Beltran, an
individual, and Macaria Beltran, Trustee of The MCB Trust (collectively,
“Defendants”)
RESPONDING PARTY: None.
NOTICE: NOT OK (see analysis below).
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order compelling Plaintiff to produce supplemental responses to Defendants’
first set of Special Interrogatories and imposing monetary sanctions against Plaintiff
and his attorney of record for $1,635.00
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is DENIED. The request for monetary sanctions is DENIED.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff initiated this action on September 26, 2022.
Subsequently, on December 12, 2022, Plaintiff filed his operative First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants and Does 1 to 10, alleging the following
causes of action: (1) Fraud; (2) Negligent Misrepresentation; and (3) Specific
Performance. Following this, Defendants filed their Answer to the FAC on
January 11, 2023. 
 
On May 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Substitution of Attorney
with the Court, substituting himself for his former counsel.
 
Subsequently, on the same day, May 10, 2024, Defendants
filed the instant Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories
(“SROG”), Set One (the “Motion”).
 
No Opposition or Reply papers have been received by the
Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following
apply: (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.
(2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. (3)
An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Procedural
Requirements 
 
1.     
Timeliness
 
Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (c), notice of this
motion must be given within 45 days following the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or by a later date agreed-upon
in writing, failing which the propounding party waives any right to compel a
further response to the interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(c); but see Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 134-136 [suggesting that the 45-day deadline does
not apply to (i.e., it does not begin to run with service of) objections-only
responses; it only applies to responses that are required to be verified].)
 
The 45-day deadline “is ‘jurisdictional’
in the sense that it renders the court without authority to rule on motions to
compel other than to deny them.” (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
“Any period of notice, or any right or duty to
do any act or make any response within any period or on a date certain after
the service of the document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute
or rule of court, shall be extended after service by electronic means by two
court days[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).)
            
Here, Plaintiff served written
responses by email to Defendants’ first set of SROG on February 14, 2024, (Block
Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. “B.”) The service of written responses establishes the deadline
for Defendants to file a motion to compel further as April 4, 2024, calculated
based on a 45-day period with an extension of two court days per Code of Civil
Procedure section 1010.6, subdivision (a)(3)(B), accounting for the method of
electronic service.
 
Therefore, the Court finds the Motion is filed timely as it
was filed prior to the established deadline.
 
2.      Meet
and Confer 
 
“A motion
under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(1).) “A meet and confer declaration in
support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)
 
Here, the Court finds Defendants’ meet and confer efforts to
be sufficient. (Block Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. “C” and “D.”) 
 
3.      Separate
Statement
 
The California Rules of Court rule
3.1345 (a)(2) explicitly states that “Any motion involving the content of a
discovery request or the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a
separate statement. The motions that require a separate statement include a
motion: ... (2) To compel further responses to interrogatories.” “A separate statement is a separate document filed and
served with the discovery motion that provides all the information necessary to
understand each discovery request and all the responses to it that are at
issue.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c).)
 
Here, Defendants have fulfilled the
requirement by concurrently filing a separate statement with the Motion.
 
4.      Proof
of Service
 
For noticed motions, “[u]nless
otherwise ordered or specifically provided by law, all moving and supporting
papers must be served and filed in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure
section 1005 and, when applicable, the statutes and rules providing for
electronic filing and service.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300(a).)
 
“Unless
otherwise ordered or specifically provided by law, all moving and supporting
papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)
 
Furthermore,
“[i]f a document may be served by mail, express mail, overnight delivery, or
facsimile transmission, electronic service of that document is deemed complete
at the time of the electronic transmission of the document or at the time that
the electronic notification of service of the document is sent.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(A).)
 
Here, Defendants submit Proof of
Service, indicating that on May 10, 2024, papers associated with the Motion
were served upon Plaintiff’s former counsels, Adam Grant and David Almaraz, by
emailing the documents to the former counsels’ email addresses.
 
However, the Proof of Service was filed
with the Court at 4:25 p.m. concurrently with the Motion, subsequent to
Plaintiff’s filing of Substitution of Attorney at 3:36 p.m. on the same day.
 
According to Code of Civil Procedure
section 284, which provides that “[t]he attorney in an action or special proceeding may be
changed at any time before or after judgment or final determination ... [u]pon
the consent of both client and attorney, filed with the clerk, or entered upon
the minutes,” Plaintiff’s former counsels ceased to represent Plaintiff upon
the filing of the Substitution of Attorney, i.e., at 3:36 p.m. on May 10, 2024,
and are no longer authorized to accept service on Plaintiff’s behalf. Moreover,
Defendants have not submitted any evidence of service upon the
self-representing Plaintiff. 
 
Therefore, Defendants have failed to
demonstrate effective service of the moving papers either on Plaintiff’s former
counsels or on Plaintiff, in pro per, pursuant to applicable Code of Civil
Procedure sections.
 
Based on the above records, the Court
determines that Defendants’ Motion does not comply with Code of Civil Procedure
section 1005 and California Rules of Court rule 3.1300(a). 
 
Therefore, the Court DENIES the Motion. 
 
B.    
Monetary
Sanctions
 
As the Court has denied the Motion, the request for
monetary sanctions, reserved for a prevailing party under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (d), is also DENIED. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendants’
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, is DENIED.
 
Defendants’
Request for Monetary Sanctions is DENIED.
 
Moving
party to give notice.
