Ford’s Motion to Compel Plaintiffs Garen Aklyan and Yelena Malkhasyan’s further
responses to (1) Form Interrogatories, Set One, (2) Special Interrogatories,

I. BACKGROUND
 
On August 11, 2023, Plaintiffs Garen Aklyan,
individually and as successor-in-interest to Arthur Aklyan, deceased; and
Yelena Malkhasyan (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed this action. On January 24,
2024, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint against Defendants Galpin
Jaguar Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. d/b/a Galpin Premier Collection; Ford Motor
Company (“Ford”); the State of California; and California Department of
Transportation.
 
The FAC alleges the following. On August 28, 2022, Arthur Aklyan was involved in a fatal collision
while driving northbound on the I-5 highway, south of Sheldon Street, Sun
Valley, California 91352, in a 2018 Lincoln MKZ, California License Plate No.
8EQC405, Vehicle Identification No. 3LN6L5E90JR615845 (the “SUBJECT MKZ”). The
Subject MKZ contained inherent defects in design and manufacturing. Arthur
Aklyan faced an emergency braking situation, which resulted in a collision,
while using the Subject MKZ and each of its component parts as intended or in a
reasonably foreseeable manner. However, had the Subject MKZ’s ruptured and/or
structurally weak front brake jounce hoses and loose steering wheel retaining
bolt been repaired, the collision would have been prevented or its severity
lessened. Plaintiffs assert the following causes of action:
1.     
Strict Liability/Product Defect
2.     
Negligence/Product Defect
3.     
Dangerous Condition of Public Property
 
On May 1, 2024, Defendant Ford filed the Motion to Compel Plaintiffs’ Further Responses to Ford’s First Set of
Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories and Requests for Production, and
request for sanctions. No opposition was filed. 
 
II.
ANALYSIS
 
A.      Meet and
Confer Requirement 
 
A motion to compel further discovery responses
must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration stating “facts showing a
reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(2);
2016.040.)¿ 
 
Here, Defendant Ford’s counsel declares that she met and
conferred telephonically and via correspondence with Plaintiffs’ counsel
regarding the allegedly deficient responses. (Nakamoto Decl., ¶ 5-24.) The Court finds that counsel has satisfied the meet and
confer requirements under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision
(b)(2). 
 
B.      Legal
Standard
 
“Unless
otherwise limited by order of the court in accordance with this title, any
party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is
relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action or to the
determination of any motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself
admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.) 
 
A motion to
compel further responses to interrogatories may be brought based on: (1)
incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or incomplete
claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(c).) 
 
It is not
necessary for the motion to show that the material sought will be admissible in
evidence. “Good cause” may be found to justify discovery where specific facts
show that the discovery is necessary for effective trial preparation or to
prevent surprise at trial. (See Associated Brewers Dist. Co. v. Superior Court
(1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 586-588; see also Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2017.010,
2019.030(a)(1) (Information is discoverable if it is itself admissible in
evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence and it is not unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is
obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or
less expensive.); Lipton v. Superior Court (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1599,
1611-1612 (noting a party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence).) 
 
Furthermore,
to the extent there is any doubt in whether these records should be discoverable,
California’s liberal approach to discovery provides that doubt should be
resolved in favor of permitting discovery. (Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v.
Superior Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d 161, 173.) 
 
C.     
Discussion 
 
Defendant Ford moves to compel Plaintiffs’ further responses to
Ford’s first set of discovery: (1) requests for production; (2) special
interrogatories; and (3) form interrogatories, general.
 
On September 18, 2023, Defendant Ford propounded its first set of
discovery upon Plaintiffs. (Alamdari Decl., ¶ 3, Exhs. 2-7.) On October 5,
2023, Ford granted Plaintiffs a 60-day extension of time to respond to its
first sets of written discovery, making Plaintiffs’ responses due on December
19, 2023. (Nakamoto Decl., ¶ 4.) On or about December 21, 2023, Ford sent
Plaintiffs a letter stating that it had not received Plaintiffs’ responses,
that Plaintiffs waived its objections, and that Plaintiff was to provide
verified responses, without objections, on or before January 5, 2024. (Alamdari
Decl., ¶ 4.) The parties met and conferred, and Defendant Ford provided an
extension until January 26, 2024 for Plaintiffs to provide responses. (Alamdari
Decl., ¶ 5.) On January 26, 2024, Plaintiffs served objection-only responses to
all Defendants to preserve its objections. Plaintiffs provided notice that it
would work to provide substantive responses by February 12, 2024. (Alamdari
Decl., ¶ 6.) On February 23, 2024, Plaintiffs served further responses to
Ford’s written discovery, with objections. (Alamdari Decl., ¶ 6.) On April 22,
2024, Plaintiffs served their document production to Ford’s first sets of
requests for production. On May 1, 2024, Ford filed its instant motion to
compel Plaintiffs to provide further responses to its first sets of form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production, without
objections, and associated requests for sanctions. 
 
Ford asserts that further responses are required as Plaintiffs
waived all objections to Ford’s first sets of written discovery by failing to
serve timely responses. Thus, per Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2030.290(a) and 2031.300(a), Plaintiffs waived all
objections to first sets of written discovery, including those based on
privilege and work product. On July 11,
2024, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ Motion for Relief
from Effect of Late Served Response.
 
The Court notes that Plaintiffs have failed to oppose the motion. If a timely motion to compel has been filed, the burden is
on the responding party to justify any objection or failure fully to answer. (Coy
v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220–221 [addressing a motion to
compel further responses to interrogatories]; see also Fairmont Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.) Therefore,
Plaintiffs have not met their burden of justifying any of their objections. 
 
Further, “a party who
has not timely filed written opposition to a motion…may not be afforded an
opportunity to offer oral argument at the hearing.” (Sexton v. Superior
Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) “The failure to file opposition
creates an inference that the motion…is meritorious.”¿ (Id.)¿ “In such
cases, the court may hear argument limited to a request for a continuance of
the hearing in order to afford an opportunity for written opposition.” (Id.)
“[T]he rule is patently intended to prevent the introduction of legal theories
without prior notice to opposing counsel and the court.” (Id.)
 
Based
on the foregoing, Defendant Ford’s Motion to Compel Plaintiffs Garen Aklyan and
Yelena Malkhasyan’s further responses to (1) Form Interrogatories, Set One, (2)
Special Interrogatories, Set One, and (3) Requests for Production, Set One, is
GRANTED. Plaintiffs Garen Aklyan and Yelena Malkhasyan shall provide verified
responses, without
objections, within 30 days. 
 
D.    
Sanctions
 
“A request for a sanction shall, in the notice of
motion, identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is
sought, and specify the type of sanction sought. The notice of motion shall be
supported by a memorandum of points and authorities, and accompanied by a
declaration setting forth facts supporting the amount of any monetary sanction
sought.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.040.) 
 
Sanctions
may be imposed for misuse of discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., section 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery
constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., section
2023.010, subd. (d).) Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348 provides that a court
may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a
motion to compel discovery even if no opposition was filed.  
 
Here, the
Court finds that Plaintiffs engaged in the misuse of the discovery process by
failing to provide code compliant responses to Defendant Ford’s discovery
requests. Ford requests $5,565 in sanctions for counsel’s work on this motion,
including 14.5 hours spent on the instant motion, and an anticipated 6.5
additional hours to review the opposition, prepare a reply and appear at the
hearing, at the rate of $265 an hour.
The Court finds sanctions are warranted. However, since no opposition was filed, the Court awards sanctions in
the reduced total amount of $3,842.50 (14.5 hours of attorney time at the rate
of $265 an hour).
 
III. DISPOSITION
 

Defendant
Ford’s Motion to Compel Plaintiffs Garen Aklyan and Yelena Malkhasyan’s further
responses to (1) Form Interrogatories, Set One, (2) Special Interrogatories,
Set One, and (3) Requests for Production, Set One, is GRANTED. Plaintiffs Garen
Aklyan and Yelena Malkhasyan shall provide verified responses, without
objections, within 30 days. 
 
The
Court further GRANTS Defendant Ford’s request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiffs
in the reduced amount of $3,842.50.
Said monetary sanctions are to be paid to counsel for Defendant Ford within 30
days of the date of this order.
