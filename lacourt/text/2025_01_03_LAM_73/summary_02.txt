And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant FCI Lender Services, Inc.'s motion to compel compliance with Rule 2.257 of the California Rules of Court. The plaintiff, Daniel A. Bond, failed to comply with the rule by not signing a printed form of the Complaint and First Amended Complaint, and also failed to use an electronic signature that meets the requirements of the rule. The plaintiff's attorney inserted the plaintiff's signature into the documents, but this does not comply with the rule. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the rule is a material defect and that the complaint and first amended complaint should be stricken.
