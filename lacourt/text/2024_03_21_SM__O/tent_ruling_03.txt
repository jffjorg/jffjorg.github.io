 Case Number:  23SMCV02449    Hearing Date:   March 21, 2024    Dept:  O   Case  Name:  Alaoui v. Vaynerman, et al.    Case No.:   23SMCV02449   Complaint Filed:   6-1-23      Hearing Date:   3-21-24    Discovery C/O:   N/A     Calendar No.:   7   Discovery Motion C/O:   N/A     POS:   OK    Trial Date:   None    SUBJECT:                 SPECIAL MOTION TO STRIKE UNDER  CCP § 425.16 (ANTI-SLAPP) MOVING  PARTY:   Defendants Deborah S. Tropp,  Tracy L. Breuer, McNeil, Tropp and Braun LLP RESP.  PARTY:         Plaintiff Aziz Alaoui    TENTATIVE  RULING             Defendants  Deborah S. Tropp, Tracy L. Breuer and McNeil, Tropp and Braun LLPs’ Special  Motion To Strike Under CCP § 425.16 (Anti-SLAPP) as to all causes of action in Plaintiff  Aziz Alaoui’s FAC is GRANTED.  Defendants  meet their burden to establish Plaintiff’s claims arise from protected  activity. Plaintiff does not meet his burden to show a probability of  prevailing on his claims. The Court orders all one through eight causes of  action in the Plaintiff’s FAC stricken as to Defendants Deborah S. Tropp, Tracy  L. Breuer and McNeil, Tropp and Braun LLP.  Defendants are entitled to reasonable attorney  fees and costs as the prevailing party on this motion pursuant to CCP ¶  425.16(c)(1) to be awarded under an appropriate separate motion.     Anti-SLAPP       First Step – Defendants Burden of Establishing Claims Arise From Protected       Activity.     In the first step of the anti-SLAPP  analysis, “courts are to consider the elements of the challenged claim and what  actions by the defendant supply those elements and consequently form the basis  for liability.  The defendant’s burden is to identify what acts each challenged  claim rests on and to show how those acts are protected under a statutorily  defined category of protected activity.”  (Bonni, supra, 11  Cal.5th at p. 1009.)   “First, the moving defendant must  show that the challenged claim or claims arise from the defendant's  constitutionally protected free speech or petition rights. (Ojjeh v. Brown  (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 1027, 1035.) A defendant has the “burden of identifying  all allegations of protected activity” on the 1st prong of  SLAPP.”  (Bel Air Internet, LLC v. Morales (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th  924, 936-937.)  Defendant only meets this burden by demonstrating that the  act underlying the plaintiff’s cause of action “fits one of the categories  spelled out in section 425.16, subdivision (e).”  (Sprengel v. Zbylut  (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 140, 150.)               Defendants  Deborah S. Tropp, Tracy L. Breuer, and McNeil, Tropp and Braun LLP  (collectively the “MTB Defendants”) move to strike Plaintiff Aziz Alaoui’s (“Alaoui”)  First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) pursuant to CCP § 425.16 (Anti-SLAPP) arguing  that Alaoui’s claims arise from statements or writings made in connection with the  underlying litigation at issue in the matter. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd.,  (e)(2) [“act in furtherance of a person's right of petition or free speech  under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public  issue includes: . . . any written or oral statement or writing made in  connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,  executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law.].)                 The  MTB Defendants show the lawsuit  arises  from a prior personal injury action, entitled Aziz Alaoui v Yevgisiy  Vaynerman, filed by Alaoui on March 27, 2018, Case No. BC699545, the  “Underlying Litigation”.) which was dismissed on 3-6-20, and Alaoui’s Motion to  Set Aside Dismissal was denied due to multiple factual inaccuracies. (Johnson  Decl., ¶¶ 4–13, 18; Notice of Lodgment, Ex. A, C, I, O.) The MTB Defendants  represented Yevgisiy Vaynerman in the Underlying Litigation. (Johnson Decl., ¶  5.) The MTB Defendants state Alaoui signed a statutory offer to compromise on  11-17-21, Alaoui filed a motion to enforce a settlement agreement and enter  judgment which was denied by the Court on 12-21-21, followed by Alaoui’s eventual  filing of the complaint in this matter on 9-13-23. (Johnson Decl., ¶¶ 14–21,  Notice of Lodgment, Ex. M, O, P, Q.) The MTB Defendants argue every fact  alleged in the FAC were statements or writings made in further of the  litigation in the Underlying Litgation. (Motion, p. 11.)             The  Court finds that the MTB Defendants have shown that the facts that form the basis  of each of Alaoui’s FAC arise out of protected speech in furtherance of the  litigation in the Underlying Litigation under CCP § 425.16(e)(2).           II.           Anti-SLAPP  Second Step – Alaoui fails to meet his burden Plaintiff’s Burden of  Demonstrating a Probability of Prevailing on their Claims.   Once  defendant demonstrates that a cause of action arises from protected conduct,  the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient  and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a  favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is  credited.  (Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82,  88–89.)  “The second prong of the statute deals with whether the plaintiff  has “demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.  Under section  425.16, subdivision (b)(2), the superior court, in making these determinations,  considers ‘the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the  facts upon which the liability or defense is based.’ For purposes of an  anti-SLAPP motion, the court considers the pleadings and evidence submitted by  both sides, but does not weigh credibility or compare the weight of the  evidence. Rather, the court's responsibility is to accept as true the evidence  favorable to the plaintiff.  A plaintiff need only establish that his or  her claim has minimal merit to avoid being stricken as a SLAPP.  With  these descriptions in mind, we will not strike a cause of action under the  anti-SLAPP statute unless it lacks even minimal merit.”  (Ralphs  Grocery Co. v. Victory Consultants, Inc. (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 245, 261.)   “In order  to establish a probability of prevailing on a cause of action in the context of  an anti-SLAPP motion, a plaintiff must state and substantiate  a legally sufficient claim.”  La Jolla  Group II v. Bruce (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 461, 470.  The “probability of prevailing” is tested by  the same standard governing a motion for summary judgment, nonsuit, or directed  verdict.  Thus, in opposing a SLAPP motion, it is plaintiff's burden to  make a prima facie showing of facts that would support a judgment in  plaintiff's favor.  (Crossroads Investors, L.P. v. Federal National  Mortgage Assn. (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 757, 785; Taus v. Loftus  (2007) 40 Cal.4th 683, 714 [a “summary-judgment-like procedure”].)                 Alaoui  electronically filed the anti-SLAPP motion opposition at 4:58 PM on March 19,  2024, less than two days before the hearing.   Alaoui did not seek leave from the Court to file a late opposition.  More important, Alaoui did not submit any  declaration or other evidence to support his opposition to the anti-SLAPP  motion.  Given Alaoui's complete failure to  submit any evidence to support the factual allegations of his FAC or the  facts recited in his opposition, Alaoui has failed to meet his burden to show  even a minimal probability of prevailing on the claims.     In addition, the MTB Defendants show  the litigation privilege is a complete bar to all of Alaoui’s causes of action.   (Motion, pp. 12–13.) “[T]he [litigation] privilege applies to any communication  (1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other  participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation;  and (4) that have some connection or logical relation to the action.” (Silberg  v. Anderson (1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 212, as modified (Mar. 12, 1990);  see Kashian v. Harriman (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 892, 913 [“Any doubt about  whether the privilege applies is resolved in favor of applying it.”].)    “Civil  Code section 47, subdivision (b)(2), promotes the effectiveness of judicial  proceedings by encouraging attorneys to zealously protect their clients'  interests. [I]t is desirable to create an absolute privilege ... not because we  desire to protect the shady practitioner, but because we do not want the honest  one to have to be concerned with [subsequent derivative] actions....  [Citation.]” (Knoell v. Petrovich (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 164, 171,  citations omitted; see Cal. Civ. Code § 47(b)(4) [protecting any “publication  or broadcast” made in in the course of a “judicial proceeding”].)                The  Court finds that all the elements of the litigation privilege are met: (1) the  allegations against the MTB Defendants relate to statements or writing made in  the Underlying Action (See FAC, ¶¶ 1–15, 17, 23); (2) the MTB Defendants were the  opposing counsel in the underlying litigation (Johnson Decl., ¶ 5); (3) the  statements and writings identified by Alaoui were made to  achieve the objects of the Underlying Action (Johnson Decl., ¶¶ 4–13; Notice of  Lodgment, Ex. A–I); (4) the statements and writings identified by Alaoui have a  connection and logical relation to the Underlying Action. (See FAC, ¶¶ 1–15, 17, 23; see also Johnson Decl., ¶¶  4–13; Notice of Lodgment, Ex. A–I).                 Therefore,  because the litigation privilege is a complete defense to Alaoui’s claims, and  Alaoui has not presented evidence to support those claims, the Court finds that  Alaoui has not met his burden to show a probability of prevailing on the claims  against the MTB Defendants.
