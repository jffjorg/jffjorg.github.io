TENTATIVE
RULING
Plaintiff William S. Brunsten,
P.C.’s Application for Writ of Attachment as to Defendant Carmi Flavor and
Fragrance Company, Inc. is GRANTED. Plaintiff seeks a writ as to the Defendant
in the amount of $455.077.69.  Plaintiff is
ordered to post an undertaking in the amount of $10,000.  
 
1.  The Claim:
The money claim must be for a “fixed or readily ascertainable amount” of not
less than $500 (excluding costs, interest, and attorney fees).  CCP § 483.010(a).  “If the action is against a defendant who is
a natural person, an attachment may be issued only on a claim which arises out
of the conduct by the defendant of a trade, business, or profession.”  CCP §483.010(c).  CCP §483.010(c)).  “A purpose of the attachment statutes is to
confine attachments to commercial situations and to prohibit them in consumer
transactions.”  (Kadison, Pfaelzer,
Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson (1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)
 
The damages need not be liquidated. But they must be
measurable by reference to the contract itself and the basis for computing
damages must be reasonable and certain.  (CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc. (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 541 [master lease and corresponding lease schedules provided clear formula
for computation of damages: monthly rent multiplied by unexpired term].)  
 
Plaintiff William S. Brunsten (“Brunsten”) claims
Defendant Carmi Flavor and Fragrance Co., Inc. (“Carmi”) owes Brunsten
$455,077.69 in legal fees, including $248,212.80 in unpaid invoices, $98,753.82
in late fees, $98,783.82 in prejudgment interest, $5,498.80 in litigation
expenses, and $3.798.45 in legal fees and costs charged to Plaintiff by Parker
Shaffie LLP in this case paid by Brunsten. (Brunsten Decl., ¶¶ 8–11, Ex. 3, 4.)
Brunsten establishes Carmi’s unpaid invoices from 11-1-19 to 12-3-20 totaling $248,212.80.
(Brunsten Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. 4.) Brunsten establishes claimed late fees and claimed
prejudgment interest at 10% annum applied to each of the invoices not paid by
Carmi when due, totaling $197,507.64. (Brunsten Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. 3.) Brunsten
establishes litigation expenses in this case at $5,498.80 based on the Case
Summary from First Legal. (Brunsten Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. 4.) Brunsten establishes
Parker Shaffie LLP attorney’s fees and costs of $3,798.45 paid by Brunsten.
(Brunsten Decl., ¶ 11.) 
 
 
2.  Probable
Validity of the Claim: Is the claim supported and/or does the defendant
have a viable argument in opposition to the claim?  If the application is unopposed, that appears
to be a basis for finding that plaintiff has met his/her burden.  "A claim has 'probable validity' where
it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against
the defendant on that claim."  (CCP
§481.190.).  
 
The court has the power to determine disputed facts on the
basis of a preponderance of the evidence as disclosed in the affidavits and
declarations (unlike summary judgment motions, for example, in which the court
has no power to weigh the evidence).  See
Hobbs v. Weiss (1999) 73 Cal. App.4th 76, 80 (court must “consider the
relative merits of the positions of the respective parties and make a
determination of the probable outcome of the litigation”).  The trial court is not required to accept as
true the sworn testimony of any witness or undisputed affidavit testimony. It
may make contrary findings based on inferences drawn from other evidence.  See Bank of America v. Salinas Nissan
(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 273.
 
            The
Court finds that Plaintiff has proved the probable validity of its claim for
unpaid attorney’s fees and late fees in the principal amount of  $373,784.31. 
In accordance with the unanimous consent of the directors of Carmi, and under
the terms of the engagement agreement between the SLC and Brunsten and the “stipulation”
with Carmi, the payment of those fees due was authorized and approved by Jason
Carmi.  (Dec. of Jason Carmi (signed 3-10-2022),
¶¶8-10. 12-13, ex E thereto.   The Court
rejects Carmi’s arguments that Brunston must now prove his fees were reasonable,
or that the engagement with Carmi is void. 
            The
Court is not persuaded that the amounts sought for prejudgment interest or
other litigation expenses should be included in the amount the Court finds is appropriate
for prejudgment attachment. 
 
3.  Undertaking:  An undertaking is required pursuant to CCP
§489.210 which provides that, "Before issuance of a writ of attachment . .
., the plaintiff shall file an undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the
defendant may recover for any wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the
action."  A flat amount of
undertaking is provided for by statute: $10,000 (CCP §489.220(a)).  The Court may set a higher amount pursuant to
CCP §489.220(b) if there is an objection to the undertaking.
 
No undertaking provided. 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide a $10,000 undertaking.
