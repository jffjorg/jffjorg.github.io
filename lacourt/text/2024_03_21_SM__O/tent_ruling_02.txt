SUBJECT:                 MTS DEFENDANT JAY LEVINE’S SPECIAL
MOTION TO STRIKE PURSUAN TO CCP § 425.16
MOVING
PARTY:   Plaintiff Adam J. Tenser 
RESP.
PARTY:         Defendant Jay Levine
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
            Plaintiff
Adam J. Tenser’s Motion to Strike Defendant Jay Levine’s anti-SLAPP Motion is
DENIED. 
            Tenser
argues that Levine’s SLAPP motion was brought more than 60 days after Levine
was served with the Complaint on 8-10-23, and thus subject to a motion to
strike as untimely. (Motion, p. 8.) Levine shows the alleged 8-10-23 service
was ineffective, as admitted by Tenser in an email exchange with Counsel Sager
(Sager Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. 10) The evidence shows Levine was not served until personal
service was effected on 1-22-24 (Sager Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. 11.)  Levine shows his 2-21-24 SLAPP motion is
timely as it was filed within 60 days from the 1-22-24 service date of the
complaint. (Sager Decl., ¶¶ 14, 15, 16.)
