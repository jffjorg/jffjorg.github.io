Summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' special motion to strike under CCP ยง 425.16 (Anti-SLAPP) as to all causes of action in the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The defendants have shown that the plaintiff's claims arise from statements or writings made in connection with the prior personal injury action, which was dismissed. The plaintiff has failed to meet his burden to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the claims. The litigation privilege is also a complete bar to all of the plaintiff's causes of action. The Court has ordered all causes of action in the plaintiff's first amended complaint to be stricken as to the defendants, and has awarded the defendants reasonable attorney fees and costs as the prevailing party on this motion.
