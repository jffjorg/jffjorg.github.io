And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Adam J. Tenser's motion to strike Defendant Jay Levine's anti-SLAPP motion. Tenser argued that Levine's anti-SLAPP motion was brought more than 60 days after he was served with the complaint, and thus is subject to a motion to strike as untimely. However, the judge found that Levine was not served with the complaint until January 22, 2024, and his anti-SLAPP motion was filed on February 21, 2024, within the 60-day time period from the date of service. Therefore, the judge determined that Levine's anti-SLAPP motion was timely and denied Tenser's motion to strike.
