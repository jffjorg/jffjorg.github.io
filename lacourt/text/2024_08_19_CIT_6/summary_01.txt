And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of CG Integrity Investments, Inc.'s motion to set aside the default and reinstate its answer to the First Amended Complaint. The default was entered against CG Integrity Investments, Inc. due to its suspended status with the California Secretary of State, but the company has since revived its corporate standing and moved to set aside the default. The Judge found that CG Integrity Investments, Inc. presented sufficient evidence to justify setting aside the default and that granting relief from default is in line with the policy of favoring trials on the merits. The Judge also rejected the Plaintiff's argument that CG Integrity Investments, Inc. needed to show a meritorious defense, citing outdated authority and noting that the moving party no longer needs to present a meritorious defense to set aside a default under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473.
