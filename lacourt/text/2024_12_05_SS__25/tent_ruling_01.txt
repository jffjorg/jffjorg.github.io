ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On March 10, 2022, Plaintiff Nicholas
Howell (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendants Eduardo Cabral
and Manuel Cabral (“Defendants”) and Does 1 through 100. (Compl., p. 1.)
On October 20, 2022, Defendants filed
an Answer.
 
On July 28, 2023, the Court granted
the parties’ stipulation to continue trial and all trial-related dates from
September 7, 2023 to March 8, 2024.  (7/28/23
Order.)
 
On December 28, 2023, the Court
granted the parties’ stipulation to continue trial and all trial-related dates
from March 8, 2024 to May 31, 2024. (12/28/23 Order.)
 
On March 15, 2024, the Court granted
the parties’ stipulation to continue trial and all trial-related dates from May
31, 2024 to December 10, 2024. (3/15/24 Order.)
 
On September 19, 2024, the Court
granted Defendants’ unopposed Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Deposition and ordered
Plaintiff and/or Plaintiff’s counsel to meet and confer with Defendants’
counsel within five days from the service of the Court’s order to set a
mutually agreed upon date for Plaintiff’s deposition for which Plaintiff is
ordered to appear. (9/19/24 Order.) 
 
On September 20, 2024, the Notice of
Ruling regarding Defendants’ Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Deposition was served
by mail and electronic service on Plaintiff’s counsel. (Motion, 9/20/24 Proof
of Service.) 
 
On September 30, 2024, Defendants
filed the instant Motion for Terminating Sanctions against Plaintiff (the
“Motion”). 
 
No Opposition has been filed.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion
 
Defendants
move for terminating sanctions on the grounds “Plaintiff has repeatedly
demonstrated disregard for the discovery process, their obligations under the
Code of Civil Procedure, and this Court’s Order. (Motion, p. 5.) 
 
Most
recently, Defendants contend Plaintiff have avoided Defendants’ request to “set
Plaintiff’s deposition and meet and confer with the Defendant regarding
scheduling the deposition,” as was ordered by this Court on September 19, 2024.
(Motion, p. 5; 9/19/24 Order.) Defendants’ counsel served the Notice of Ruling
on Plaintiff on September 20, 2024 and followed up via email on September 25,
2024 to no avail. (Motion, p. 4; Goodwin Decl.) As of September 30, 2024, Defendants
have not received a response. (Motion, p. 4; Goodwin Decl.)
 
On motion, if a party “fails to obey
an order compelling attendance, testimony, and production, the court may make
those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction” as provided in Section 2030.010,
et seq. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (h).)  The “court, after
notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after an opportunity for
hearing, may impose” monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions
“against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery
process[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.030; 2023.030, subds. (a)-(d).) Failing
to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery and disobeying a
court order to provide discovery are misuses of the discovery process.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.010, subds. (d) and (g).)

 
The court should look to the totality of
the circumstances in determining whether terminating sanctions are appropriate.
(Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) Ultimate discovery
sanctions are justified where there is a “willful” discovery order violation
“preceded by a history of abuse,” and evidence showing that “less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules.” (Van Sickle v.
Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A] penalty as severe as
dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with discovery is
caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad faith.” (Brown
v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) 
 
“The court may impose a terminating
sanction by one of the following orders:  
 
(1)   An order striking out the pleadings or
parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. 
(2)   An order staying further proceedings by
that party until an order for discovery is obeyed. 
(3)   An order dismissing the action, or any
part of the action, of that party. 
(4)   An order rendering a judgment by default
against that party.” 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (d).) 
 
As an
initial matter, the Court finds this Motion to be untimely. “Except as
otherwise provided in this chapter, any party shall be entitled as a matter of
right to complete discovery on or before the 30th day, and to have motions
concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the date initially
set for the trial of the action.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).) 
 
The Court
finds Defendants are not entitled to an order granting terminating sanctions
against Plaintiff. Defendants have not submitted evidence suggesting Plaintiff
and/or Plaintiff’s counsel failed to obey the Court’s order compelling
continued meet and confer discussions and Plaintiff’s attendance at a
deposition in a manner that warrants terminating sanctions. While Defendants allege
that Plaintiff’s counsel has not complied with the Court’s order and was unresponsive
from September 20, 2024, when Plaintiff was served with the Notice of Ruling,
to September 30, 2024, when the instant Motion was filed and served, the
imposition of terminating sanctions is unwarranted and/or premature. (See Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 793-794 [“The sanction of dismissal or the rendition of a
default judgment against the disobedient party is ordinarily a drastic measure
which should be employed with caution. [Citation.] However, there is no
question that a court is empowered to apply the ultimate sanction against a
litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with his discovery
obligations. [Citation.] The refusal to reveal material evidence is deemed
to be an admission that the claim or defense is without merit. [Citations.]”].)
Defendants submit no evidence of their meet and confer attempts or of another deposition
following the Court’s Order where Plaintiff failed to appear. Thus, the Court
finds there is insufficient evidence that Plaintiff’s and/or Plaintiff’s
counsel failure to comply with the Court order was willful or in bad faith. 
 
Plaintiff and/or Plaintiff’s counsel are ordered
to meet and confer with Defendants’ counsel to set a mutually agreed upon date for Plaintiff’s
deposition for which Plaintiff is ordered to appear per prev. Plaintiff is
ordered to appear for deposition before trial on December 10, 2024. 
 
III.             
Conclusion
& Order
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’
Motion for Terminating Sanctions is DENIED. 
 
Plaintiff is ordered to appear for the
continued deposition prior to trial on December 10, 2024. 
 
Moving party is ordered to
give notice.
