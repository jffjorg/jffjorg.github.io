ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On April 3, 2023,
Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of
the Automobile Club (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendant Angel
Mendoza (“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 alleging a single cause of action for
Subrogation. (Compl., pp. 1, 3.) 
 
On June 12, 2023,
Defendant filed a one-page document entitled “Response Plead Deny of Claims
from Plaintiff.”
 
On August 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Compel Answers to Form Interrogatories (“ROGs Motion”) and
Motion to Deem Request for Admissions Admitted (“RFAs Motion”) (the “Motions”).

 
On September 12, 2024, the Motions
were called for hearing and only Plaintiff’s counsel appeared. The Court and
Plaintiff’s counsel conferred. Subsequently, the Court continued the hearing on
the Motions to allow Defendant to file a proper answer/responsive pleading. As
the Court noted, the one-page document filed by Defendant on June 12, 2023 was
“an improper response to Plaintiff’s Complaint as it is not answer nor a
demurrer.” (9/12/24 Order.)
 
On October 15, 2024, the Motions were
again called for hearing. Defendant had not yet appeared. The Court stated it
was “advised that attorney M. Reza Lajevardi was previously present via
LACourtConnect and represented he was appearing on behalf of the Defendant.
However, Mr. Lajevardi was advised by this Judicial Assistant that the
Defendant was still self-represented as the Court does not have any record that
a proper Substitution of Attorney has yet been filed. Counsel was invited to
remain on the line to hear the outcome of this hearing, and to address the
Court if he so desired. (Note: By the time the Court called this matter for
hearing, Mr. Lajevardi was no longer present and had disconnected from
LACourtConnect.)” (10/15/24 Order.)
 
The Court and Plaintiff’s counsel
conferred, and Plaintiff’s counsel represented that he had not received any responses
to the discovery from Defendant. The Court then found that “Defendant has
failed to appear this date, and that no response to the Court's Order to Show
Cause Re: Why Defendant's Improper Response Filed on 06/12/2023 Should Not Be
Stricken has been received.” Accordingly, the Court struck the one-page
“Response Plead Deny of Claims from Plaintiff” and ordered the hearing on the
Motions continued. The Court also set an Order to Show Cause Re: Plaintiff’s
Request for Entry of Default / Default Judgment for the same day as the Motions
hearing.
 
            As of
the date of the instant hearing, Defendant has filed neither an Opposition to
the Motions or a responsive pleading in the matter. 
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
A party must respond to
interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260,
subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide
timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling responses
to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The party also
waives the right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or
work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
 
A party must respond to requests for
admissions within 30 days after service of such requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.250, subd. (a).) “If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
fails to serve a timely response…(a) [that party] waives any objection to the
requests, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The requesting party may
move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  
 
III.             
Discussion
 
Interrogatories and Request for
Admissions
 
Plaintiff contends that Defendant
failed to timely respond to Form Interrogatories and Request for Admissions by
the statutory deadline. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subd. (a), 2033.250,
subd. (a).) 
As an initial matter, the Court notes
Plaintiff has submitted evidence of 31 discovery requests made upon Defendant –
19 Form Interrogatories and 12 Requests for Admissions. Thus, the Court finds
Plaintiff in compliance with Code of Civil procedure section 94 and addresses
the merits of the Motions.
 
Here, Plaintiff’s counsel’s office
served Defendant with the interrogatories and request for admissions by mail on
or about June 26, 2024. (ROGs Tapper Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. A, Proof of Service; RFAs
Tapper Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. A, Proof of Service.) 
 
As of August 15, 2024, Plaintiff had
not received any responses. (ROGs Tapper Decl., p. 2; RFAs Tapper Decl., p. 2.)

 
Thus, Plaintiff’s Motions are GRANTED.
 
Sanctions
 
Sanctions are
mandatory against the party, the attorney, or both whose failure to serve a
timely response to the request necessitated the motion to deem request for
admissions as admitted. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2033.250(a), 2033.280(c); see
also Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a) [the court can award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party seeking to compel discovery even though
no opposition was filed, the opposition was withdrawn, or the requested
discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed].)
 
            Here,
Defendant failed to serve a timely response to Plaintiff’s Interrogatories and
Request for Admissions by the statutory deadline. Thus, sanctions are mandatory
against Defendant, “whose failure to serve a timely response to the
request necessitated the motion to deem request for admissions as admitted.
(See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2033.250(a), 2033.280(c); see also Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions
of $2,330.00, based on $1,165.00 for each motion, reflecting 2 hours incurred
on bringing each Motion at an hourly rate of $225.00 per hour, plus three hours
of travel and attendance per Motion at $225.00 per hour, plus $80.00 in filing
fees. (ROGs Tapper Decl., ¶ 6; RFAs Tapper Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
Given the similarity of the Motions,
the shared hearing date, and the straightforward nature of the Motions,
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions against Defendant is GRANTED in the reduced
amount of $980.00, reflecting 4 hours incurred at $225.00 an hour, plus $80.00
in filing fees.
