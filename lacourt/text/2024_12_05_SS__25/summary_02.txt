And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Nationwide Insurance Company of America, is seeking to enforce a settlement agreement with the defendant, Andrea Nicole Johnson, and to enter judgment against her. The settlement agreement was entered into on January 27, 2023, and provides that the defendant would pay the plaintiff a total sum of $5,248.46 at a rate of $90.98 per month, beginning February 1, 2023.

The plaintiff filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement on July 31, 2024, and an amended motion on October 14, 2024. The defendant did not file an opposition to the motion.

The court finds that the settlement agreement is valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. However, the court notes that the plaintiff's amended motion contains several errors, including incorrect calculations of the judgment amount and inconsistent statements about the payments received from the defendant.

The court orders the plaintiff to correct its amended motion and supporting evidence before a judgment can be rendered. The court also notes that the plaintiff gave the defendant improper notice of the hearing and orders the plaintiff to correct the notice.

The motion is continued to January 29, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 at the Spring Street Courthouse. The plaintiff is ordered to electronically file a second amended motion to enforce the settlement agreement and supplemental papers correcting the errors noted herein.
