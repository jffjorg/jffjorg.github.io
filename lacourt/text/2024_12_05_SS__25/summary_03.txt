And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motion to compel the defendant's responses to form interrogatories and motion to deem requests for admissions admitted. The defendant is ordered to provide verified responses to the form interrogatories within 30 days of the order. Additionally, the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions is granted in the reduced amount of $980.00, payable within 30 days of the order. The defendant's failure to timely respond to the discovery requests necessitated the motion to deem requests for admissions admitted, and the court finds that the defendant is responsible for the monetary sanctions.
