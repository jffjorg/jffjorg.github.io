ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On October 28, 2022, Plaintiff Nationwide Insurance
Company of America (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendant Andrea
Nicole Johnson (“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 alleging a common counts cause of
action. 
 
On January 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Stipulation,
Settlement Agreement, and Release (the “Settlement Agreement”). 
 
On February 3, 2023, the Honorable Mark E. Windham signed
an order dismissing the action but retaining jurisdiction under Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6. (2/3/23 Order.)
 
On July 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed the Motion to Enforce
Settlement Agreement (the “Motion”). No Opposition was filed.   
 
On October 9, 2024, the Court held a hearing on the
Motion and found the Settlement to be valid and enforceable under Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6. However, the Court noted various issues with the
numerical amounts and calculations used by Plaintiff as well as Plaintiff’s
requested judgment sum. As a result, the Court continued the hearing on the
Motion to allow Plaintiff to file an Amended Motion to Enforce Settlement
Agreement with supplemental papers correcting the errors noted therein.
(10/9/24 Order.)
 
On October 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed the Amended Notice
of Motion and Motion to Enforce Settlement (the “Amended Motion”). On November
7, 2024, Plaintiff filed Notice of Hearing on the Amended Motion. 
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure, section 664.6: 
 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the
parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for
settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties,
the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement
until performance in full of the terms of the settlement. 
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed by
a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
 
(1) The party. 
(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
(3) If an insurer is defending and indemnifying a party
to the action, an agent who is authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on
the party’s behalf. This paragraph does not apply if the party whom the insurer
is defending would be liable under the terms of the settlement for any amount
above the policy limits.” 
 
The Settlement Agreement filed by
Plaintiff was signed by Plaintiff’s authorized representative Lisa Berry and by
Plaintiff’s counsel on January 20, 2023, and by Defendant on January 27, 2023.
(1/27/23 Settlement, pp. 5-6.) 
 
The Settlement provides the matter
would be settled for a total sum of $5,248.46 to be paid by Defendant at a rate
of $90.98 per month, beginning February 1, 2023 and continuing on the first day
of each month thereafter until paid in full. (1/27/23 Settlement, ¶ 3.) 
 
The Settlement further states that
failure to make a timely payment constitutes a default and, in the event of
default, there is no grace period or notice of default to be given to
Defendant. (1/27/23 Settlement, ¶ 6.) When default occurs, the Settlement
states “Judgment may be entered against Defendant without notice in the sum of
$4,902.58, plus first appearance fees in the sum of $225.00 less payments
received.”  (1/27/23
Settlement, ¶ 6.)
 
The Court finds the Settlement to be
valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. Plaintiff
provides evidence that Defendant made partial payment. (Smith Decl., ¶¶ 6-8.)
As of the date this Motion was filed, however, Plaintiff had received neither
further payments from Defendant nor any emails stating she will pay any amount.
(Smith Decl., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff also presents evidence that, although the
Settlement states the parties agreed to no grace period, Plaintiff’s counsel
attempted to reach out to Defendant regarding the overdue payment to no avail.
(Smith Decl., ¶ 6.) 
 
Plaintiff requests that a judgment of $3,719.84, based on
the principal amount of $4,902.58 less payment received in the amount of $1,182.74,
be entered against Defendant. (Amended Motion, pp. 2, 7; Smith Decl., p. 8.) To
describe the payment amount received from Defendant, Plaintiff states Defendant
made thirteen payments totaling $1,182.74. (Motion, p. 2.)
 
While portions of the Amended Motion and accompanying
declaration remedy the calculation and total judgment issues discussed at the
previous hearing, the Court finds various issues still remain. First, the Court
notes Plaintiff’s above calculation for the Judgment differs from the
calculation listed in the definite terms of the Default section of the
Settlement, as it omits “first appearance fees in the sum of $225.00.”  (1/27/23 Settlement, ¶ 6.) 
 
Next, the Court finds the Amended Motion and accompanying
declaration are inconsistent as to several sums. For Defendant’s partial
payment, the Amended Motion and accompanying declaration provide three
different partial payment totals – the Amended Motion states Defendant made
partial payment totaling $1,182.74 (Amended Motion, pp. 6, 7, 8) but then also states
Defendant made partial payment of $98 plus $1,699.44, which totals $1,790.42. (Amended
Motion, p. 7.) Then, Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration states Defendant made
partial payment totaling $1,699.44 (Smith Decl., ¶¶ 6, 7) while later stating
Defendant made partial payment totaling $1,182.74. (Smith Decl., ¶ 8.) As to
the requested judgment sum, the Amended Motion and accompanying declaration
state the total judgment amount is $3,719.84 (Amended Motion, pp. 7, 8; Smith
Decl., ¶ 8); however, the accompanying declaration also states the total
judgment amount is $3,203.14. (Smith Decl., ¶ 7.) As to the judgment
calculation, the Amended Motion and accompanying declaration state the judgment
total is calculated by “the principal amount of $4,902.58, less payment
received in the amount of $1,182.74, for a total judgment amount of $3,719.84.”
(Amended Motion, pp. 2, 3, 7; Smith Decl., ¶ 8.) However, the Amended Motion
then also states the judgment total is calculated by “the principal amount of
$1,175.00 plus pre-judgment costs in the amount of $4,902.58, less payment
received in the amount of $1,182.74, for a total judgment amount of $3,719.84.”
(Amended Motion, p. 8.)
 
Finally, for the second time, the Court notes that
Plaintiff made multiple mistakes when describing payments received from
Defendant – namely, Plaintiff’s counsel again declares Defendant made “thirteen
payments of $35.88 for a total amount of $1,699.44” (Smith Decl., ¶ 6); however, $90.98
was the agreed-upon monthly payment in the Settlement. (1/27/23 Settlement, ¶ 3.) Further, thirteen
installments of $34.88 totals $466.44, not $1,699.44 as mentioned throughout
the Amended Motion and accompanying declaration, and thirteen installments of $90.98
totals $1,182.74, which is also not the $1,699.44 mentioned throughout the Amended
Motion and accompanying declaration. (Amended Motion, pp. 3, 7, 8; Smith Decl., ¶¶ 6-7.) 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff must correct
its Amended Motion and supporting evidence before a judgment can be rendered.
 
Additionally, the Court notes
Plaintiff gave Defendant improper notice of this hearing. Specifically, the
Motion incorrectly states that the Motion would be heard at “111 North Hill
Street, Los Angeles, California 90012.” (Motion, p. 1.) This is the address for
the Stanley Mosk Courthouse, not the Spring Street Courthouse in which this
Department is located. Should Defendant wish to attend the hearing and present
oral argument, Defendant will be unable to do so. While the Notice of Motion
filed on November 7, 2024 is timely and code-compliant, it does not remedy the
error in the Amended Motion itself.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to correct the Amended
Motion and file new proof of service as well as file a Second Amended Motion
correcting the errors noted herein.
