And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the issue of attorney fees in an unlawful detainer case. The defendant, Debra McGee, seeks attorney fees of $45,840, while the lease between the parties has an attorney fee cap of $500. The judge finds that the lease is still in effect, despite the defendant's argument that it was forfeited. Since the lease is still in effect, the judge concludes that the defendant is entitled to fees as limited in the lease to $500.00. The judge's ruling is based on the jury's verdict in favor of the defendant and the terms of the lease.
