And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by defendant Alen Gevorgyan to grant him leave to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff, Christino Erasto Lara. The motion was filed late, five court days before the hearing date, and was served on the plaintiff's counsel, but not on their email address of record. The judge notes that Gevorgyan had intended to file the cross-complaint with his answer, but did not due to medical issues. The judge also notes that efforts to obtain a stipulation from the plaintiff to allow Gevorgyan to file the cross-complaint went unanswered. If the plaintiff's counsel appears at the hearing and has no objection, the motion will be granted. If not, the motion will be placed off calendar due to the defects in notice. The judge also warns counsel for the parties that failure to comply with the rule requiring electronic bookmarking of exhibits may result in sanctions.
