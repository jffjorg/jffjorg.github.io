And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Requests for Admissions, Set 1, along with original verifications. The judge found that the Plaintiff failed to provide clear notice of the relief requested and improperly combined various motions. The judge also noted that the Plaintiff should have moved to have the matters in the unverified substantive responses deemed admitted under California Code of Civil Procedure 2033.280, rather than seeking to compel further responses. Finally, the judge denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions against Defendants and/or their attorney of record in the amount of $1,935.
