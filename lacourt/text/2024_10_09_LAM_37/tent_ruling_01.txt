Background
 
On October 9, 2024, Silvia Garcia, Jose
Jesus Licea and Miguel Esparza (“Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against Lehmans
Hardware, Inc. (“Defendant”) for violating the California Invasion of Privacy
Act (“CIPA”). 
 
Defendant now demurs to the Complaint.
Plaintiffs oppose the demurrer. The matter is now before the court. 
 
request
for JUDICIAL notice
 
The Court may
take judicial notice of records of any court of record of the United States.
(Evid. Code, § 452(d)(2).) However, the court may only judicially notice the
existence of the record, not that its contents are the truth. (Sosinsky v.
Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.) 
Plaintiffs ask
the court to take judicial notice of the following:

Plaintiffs
seek judicial notice of trial court rulings in other cases which are
unpublished rulings with no precedential value in this court and the opinions
are submitted not as evidence but are being cited as precedent. Such citation
is beyond the scope of judicial notice and is legally improper. (Budrow v.
Dave & Buster’s of California, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 875,
884-885.) “A written trial court ruling in another case has no precedential
value in this court [citation], which is also the rule in federal courts.” (Id.,
at pp. 884-885.) 
 
For this
reason, the court declines to take judicial notice of the trial court decisions
in Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice. 
 
Demurrer[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP, § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Discussion
 
The
Complaint alleges that Defendant violated the CIPA by paying “a third party
that has no corporate affiliation with Defendant to eavesdrop on all such
conversation” that took place on the chat feature of Defendant’s website,
www.lehmans.com. (Compl., ¶¶ 1, 9.) “[W]henever a consumer chats via
Defendant’s Website, the chat is routed through The Third Party’s servers so
they may simultaneously collect a transcript of that chat, along with other
user data, in real time and save it for later access.” (Id., ¶ 10.) 
 
“Defendant,
The Third Party, and Meta – profit from secretly exploiting the chat data
through targeted social media advertising[.]” (Compl., ¶ 17.) “The Third Party
does more than merely provide a storage function for Website users’ chat
communications with Defendant. It is more than the proverbial “tape-recorder”
in the hand of Defendant. Instead, The Third Party uses its record of Website
users’ interaction with Defendant’s chat feature for data analytics and
marketing/advertising to consumers[.]” (Id., ¶ 18.) “The Third Party’s
exploitation, monetization, use of, and interaction with the data it gathers
through the chat feature on Defendant’s Website in real time makes it a
third-party interceptor and eavesdropper known to and enabled by Defendant
under CIPA, rather than a mere extension or tool of Defendant and/or party to
the communication with Website visitors.” (Id., ¶ 19.)  
 
 
The
Complaint alleges that Defendant violated “the third prong” of Penal Code
section 631(a) by “aiding, abetting, and conspiring” to allow a third party to
intercept, eavesdrop upon, learn, share, and monetize the contents of
Defendant’s chat conversations.” (Compl., ¶ 28.) “Defendant also aided and
abetted a third party to eavesdrop upon such conversations during transmission
and in real time. “ (Id., ¶ 31.) Plaintiffs did not know or consent to
such conduct. (Id., ¶¶ 25, 26, 31.) 
 
Defendant
now demurs to the Complaint. 
 
A.        Plaintiffs Fail to Allege that the Third
Party Violated the CIPA and that Defendant is subject to Derivative Liability
for the Third Party’s Violations
 
Penal
Code section 631(a) is part of the California Invasion of Privacy Act (“CIPA”).
“CIPA prohibits any person from using electronic means to ‘learn the contents
or meaning’ of any ‘communication’ ‘without consent’ or in an ‘unauthorized
manner.’” (In re Facebook, Inc. Internet Tracking Litigation (9th Cir.
2020) 956 F.3d 589, 607 citing Pen. Code, § 631(a).) Liability only applies to
third parties, not parties to the communication. (Ibid; see Warden v.
Kahn (1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 805 [“[S]ection 631 ... has been held to apply
only to eavesdropping by a third party and not to recording by a participant to
a conversation.”]) 
 
Penal
Code § 631(a), states in the relevant part:  
Any person [1] who,
by means of any machine, instrument, or contrivance, or in any other manner,
intentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized connection, whether physically,
electrically, acoustically, inductively, or otherwise, with any telegraph or telephone
wire, line, cable, or instrument, including the wire, line, cable, or
instrument of any internal telephonic communication system, or [2] who
willfully and without the consent of all parties to the communication, or in
any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to read, or to learn the contents
or meaning of any message, report, or communication while the same is in
transit or passing over any wire, line, or cable, or is being sent from, or
received at any place within this state; or [3] who uses, or attempts to use,
in any manner, or for any purpose, or to communicate in any way, any
information so obtained, or [4] who aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires
with any person or persons to unlawfully do, or permit, or cause to be done any
of the acts or things mentioned above in this section...[is liable]. 
 
“The
California Supreme Court has interpreted § 631(a) to contain three operative
clauses, which cover three distinct and mutually independent patterns of
conduct: (1) ‘intentional wiretapping,’ (2) ‘willfully attempting to learn the
contents or meaning of a communication in transit over a wire,’ and (3)
‘attempting to use or communicate information obtained as a result of engaging
in either of the two previous activities.’ (Martin v. Sephora USA, Inc.
(E.D. Cal., Mar. 30, 2023, No. 1:22-CV-01355-JLT-SAB) 2023 WL 2717636, at p. *6
(Martin) citing Tavernetti v. Superior Court (1978) 22 Cal.3d
187, 192.) “Section 631(a) also provides for liability for third party
violations of the statute by containing an aiding and abetting provision, which
imposes liability on a defendant who ‘aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires
with any person or persons to unlawfully do, or permit, or cause to be done any
of the acts or things mentioned [in Section 631(a)].’ [Citation.]” (Heiting
v. Taro Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (C.D. Cal., Apr. 2, 2024, No.
2:23-CV-08002-SPG-E) 2024 WL 1626114, at p. *4.) 

The Complaint alleges that Defendant violated the third clause or prong of
Section 631 (Compl., ¶ 28) but because Defendant is a party to the
communication it cannot held liable for violating the third prong, and can only
be held liable for aiding and abetting under the fourth prong. “It is never a
secret to one party to a conversation that the other party is listening to the
conversation; only a third party can listen secretly to a private
conversation.” (Rogers v. Ulrich (1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 894, 899.) Therefore,
Defendant as a party to the conversation cannot eavesdrop on its own
conversations and cannot be liable for violating the first three prongs of
Section 631. Consequently, Defendant’s liability can only arise under the
aiding and abetting provision for violations of the first, second, or third
prongs of Section 631 by a third party. 
 
While
the Complaint alleges that a third party was listening to Defendant’s
conversations, the Complaint is devoid of any allegations stating which prong
of Section 631 the third party violated. Statutory-based causes of action must
be pled with reasonable particularity. (See Soliz v. Williams (1999)
74 Cal.App.4th 577, 585.) Therefore, the Complaint must state what specific
prong of Section 631 the third party violated to support the allegation that
Defendant aided and abetted that third in its violation of Section 631. 
 
Defendant
further asserts that for the third party to be liable under the third prong of
Section 631, Plaintiffs must allege that the third party violated the first or
second prong of Section 631. “A finding of a violation under the third clause
of § 631(a) is contingent on a finding of a violation of the first or second
clause of § 631(a).” (Martin, supra, (E.D. Cal., Mar. 30, 2023,
No. 1:22-CV-01355-JLT-SAB) 2023 WL 2717636, at p. *11.) Yet, the Complaint is
devoid of any such allegations. 
 
Without
the third party being liable for Section 631 violations, the Defendant
cannot be subject to derivative liability. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained
with leave to amend.  
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s demurrer is sustained with
leave to amend. Plaintiff is granted 10 days leave to 
amend. The court sets a Non-Appearance OSC
RE: Filing of Amended Complaint for October 
31, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The Case
Management Conference on October 18, 2024, is advanced to 
today and continued to December 4, 2024,
