And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to reopen expert discovery filed by the plaintiff, Anabella Alexandra Pleitez Navas. The motion was filed on May 30, 2024, and the defendants, Richard Aronoff and Pamela Aronoff, opposed it. The plaintiff argues that the defendants failed to provide available deposition dates for their experts, and the plaintiff seeks to complete expert depositions before the trial date of August 1, 2024.

The judge finds that the plaintiff acted reasonably in seeking available dates before noticing unilaterally set depositions and that the need for the discovery appears high since neither party has conducted expert depositions. The judge also notes that the defendants failed to dispute that they failed to provide available deposition dates for their experts.

Based on these findings, the judge grants the motion to reopen expert discovery. The parties are ordered to meet and confer promptly to ensure that all expert discovery can be completed by the current trial date. The plaintiff is ordered to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
