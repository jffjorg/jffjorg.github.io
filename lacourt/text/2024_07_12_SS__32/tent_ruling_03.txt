[1] Although
FEC objects to the sur-reply, the sur-reply was filed because of FEC’s failure
to timely provide the proposed cross-complaint. Universal Protection argues the
Court should deny this motion based on the failure to abide by the Court’s
April 24, 2024 order. (Opp., 5.) However, in reply, FEC maintains this was an
inadvertent mistake. Accordingly, the Court considers both the untimely notice
of errata and the sur-reply.
