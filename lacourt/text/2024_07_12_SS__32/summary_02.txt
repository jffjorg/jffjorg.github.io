And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion filed by Federal Express Corporation (FEC) for leave to file a cross-complaint against Universal Protection Service, LP. The motion was filed in response to a previous court order that granted Universal Protection's motion to strike FEC's original cross-complaint. FEC argues that the "Guard Services Agreement" between FEC and Universal Protection required Universal Protection to obtain a release from any employee assigned to FEC, and that the agreement contained an express indemnity clause. The Court has denied the motion, citing deficiencies in the proposed pleading and failure to address prior deficiencies identified by the Court.
