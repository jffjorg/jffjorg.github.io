The Court has reviewed the petition
filed on June 17, 2024 by Petitioner Jennifer Gardner (Petitioner) on behalf of
Claimant Amani Bleu Taylor, age 6.
The Court denies the petition without prejudice for the following reasons: 
 
According to the Court’s docket, Petitioner has not been
appointed guardian ad litem for Claimant. The Court notes that the Application
filed April 19, 2024 was denied. 
Therefore, the Court will not grant a petition filed by Petitioner until
she is appointed guardian ad litem.[1]  
 
In the event Petitioner is appointed in the future, the
Court observes the following defects in the instant petition. 
 
Petitioner must complete item 10c or mark the agreement
in attachment 11(b)6 as attachment 10c. 
 
Item 11b must be marked. The values in 11b(5) must equal
the value in 11b(1). 
 
Petitioner must provide attachment 11b3 and 11b(6). 
 
Petitioner has put conflicting gross settlement amounts
in item 10a and 16a: these values should be equal. Petitioner can include an
attachment to explain the discrepancies. 
 
Items 12a(2) and 12a(5) must be completed. 
 
The response in 12b(5)(a)(i) conflicts with 12b(5)(b),
showing several medical liens. Petitioner should mark and complete
12b(5)(a)(ii) instead. 
 
Petitioner must make sure the medical liens add up to the
total amount sought to be reimbursed in medical expenses.
 
Petitioner requests $277,000.42 in attorney fees. It is
unclear what percentage of the gross settlement this represents since the gross
settlement amount is unclear. 
 
Petitioner must provide an attorney declaration in
attachment 13a. 
 
Petitioner selects 18a, however there is no evidence that
there is a guardian of the estate of the minor (which if different from a
guardian ad litem). If this is true, then Petitioner must make a selection in
item 18b. 
 
 
Accordingly, the Court denies the petition without
prejudice.
 
Petitioner shall give notice and file a
proof of service of such.
