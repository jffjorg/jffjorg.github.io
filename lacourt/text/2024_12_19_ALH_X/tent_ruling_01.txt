  Case Number:  21GDCV01154    Hearing Date:   December 19, 2024    Dept:  X Plaintiff’s Motion to Continue Trial is GRANTED.  The Court declines to stay the action.Plaintiff moves to continue trial for one year.  The trial is currently set for February 4,  2025.  Plaintiff seeks a one-year  continuance to February 2026, citing the need for additional discovery and the  pendency of Defendant’s appeal, which could significantly impact the scope of  the case. Defendant opposes the motion, arguing that Plaintiff’s suit is  frivolous, and that sufficient evidence exists for both parties to proceed to  trial as currently scheduled.  The Court  determines that the addition of class claims in February 2024 and the fact that  the parties are currently litigating an issue on appeal supports the requested  continuance.  Accordingly, the trial and Final Status Conference dates are advanced to  this date and continued as follows:Final Status Conference: Thursday, May 29, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. in  Dept.
