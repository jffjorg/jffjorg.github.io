And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial, which was scheduled for February 4, 2025. The plaintiff is seeking a one-year continuance to February 2026 due to the need for additional discovery and the pendency of the defendant's appeal, which could significantly impact the scope of the case. The defendant opposed the motion, arguing that the plaintiff's suit is frivolous and that sufficient evidence exists for both parties to proceed to trial as currently scheduled. The judge has determined that the addition of class claims in February 2024 and the fact that the parties are currently litigating an issue on appeal support the requested continuance. As a result, the trial and Final Status Conference dates have been advanced to May 29, 2025, and June 10, 2025, respectively. The parties are ordered to comply with the Court's Trial Preparation Order and to give notice of the new trial and Final Status Conference dates.
