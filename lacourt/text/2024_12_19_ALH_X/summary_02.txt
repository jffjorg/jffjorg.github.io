Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to tax Plaintiff's Memorandum of Costs. The motion was filed by Defendant Karim Hamza and his co-defendants Fakk LLC, Alexandre Caillat, Kian Farin, and Jamie Mitchell. The Court has ordered the hearing to be continued to February 26, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. in Department X of the Alhambra Courthouse.

The Court has directed Plaintiff to file a supplement, with receipts attached, identifying the costs claimed in items 5 and 14 of the Amended Memorandum of Costs within nine court days prior to the hearing. Any reply in support of the motion to tax is due within five court days prior to the continued hearing.

The Court has also ordered that the hearing will be continued to February 26, 2025, and that Plaintiff must attach receipts to its opposition, memorandum of costs, or amended memorandum of costs to support its claims for costs.

The Court has stated that the arbitrator's award resolved all cost issues and that Plaintiff has waived its right to seek costs for items that were not pursued in the arbitration. The Court has also cited several cases and statutes in support of its decision.
