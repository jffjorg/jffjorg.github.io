 Case Number:  22AHCV00270    Hearing Date:   December 19, 2024    Dept:  X DEFENDANTS’
MOTION TO TAX PLAINTIFF’S COST BILLDefendants
moves to tax or strike Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Costs in its entirety.The matter went to arbitration and the hearing was conducted
on March 11-15 and 18, 2024.  On June 13,
2024, the arbitrator issued a Final Award.  (6/25/24 Petition to Confirm Arbitration
Award, Attachment 8(c).)Tentative RulingThe hearing is
continued to February 26, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. in Department X.  Within nine days of the continued hearing, Plaintiff
is directed to file a supplement, with receipts attached, identifying the costs
claimed in items 5 and 14 of the Amended Memorandum of Costs.  Any reply in support of the motion is due
five court days prior to the February 25 hearing.Legal Authority and
AnalysisOn July 31, 2024,
the Court entered a judgment for Plaintiff against Defendant Karim Hamza in
amounts which totaled to $341,461.38.  (7/31/24
Judgment.)  To obtain this judgment,
the motion claims Plaintiff incurred hundreds of thousands of dollars in
attorneys’ fees, and at least $132,518.78 in costs.On August 9, 2024, Judgment Creditor (Plaintiff) filed a
Memorandum of Costs.  (8/9/24 Memorandum
of Costs.)  On August 23, 2024, Judgment
Debtor (Defendant Hamza) and his co-defendants Fakk LLC, Alexandre Caillat,
Kian Farin, and Jamie Mitchell moved to tax costs.California Rule of
Court, Rule 3.1700 requires that “Any notice of motion to strike or to tax
costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum.”  (Cal. Rules Court, rule, 3.1700(b)(1).)  The time for filing is extended for mail or
electronic service pursuant to either Code of Civil Procedure sections 1010.6,
subdivision (a)(4) or 1013.  The Court
observes Defendants’ motion was filed on 14 days after service of the
memorandum of costs.Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5 sets forth the costs recoverable by the prevailing
party.  To recover a cost, it must be
reasonably necessary to the litigation and reasonable in amount.  (Acosta v. SI Corporation (2005) 129
Cal.App.4th 1370, 1380; Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (1992)
4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.)Defendants’ motion includes the following language from the
final arbitration award issued on June 13, 2024, which is attached as Exhibit F
to the Motion to Vacate: 
“19.  The expenses of this arbitration are the AAA’s
administrative fees in the amount of $12,500.00 and the Arbitrator’s fees in
the amount of $110,840.00.  Having been
paid equally by Mr. Cameli and Respondents, these expenses shall be borne by
the Parties as incurred. 
20.  All other costs incurred by the Parties in
this arbitration proceeding are to be borne by the Parties as incurred except
to the extent of the attorney fee award next addressed. 
21. As to Mr. Cameli’s request for
an award of attorney fees, Mr. Cameli is awarded $40,000.00 in attorney fees
against Mr. Hamza.  No attorney fees are
awarded against FAKK, Mr. Farin. Ms. Mitchell or Mr. Caillat.” (8/27/24 Motion to Vacate, Exh. F, p. 50.)
(8/27/24 Motion to Vacate, Exh. F, p. 50.)The award specifies that the expenses of arbitration include
the AAA’s administrative fees of $12,500.00 and the Arbitrator’s fees of
$110,840.00, to be shared equally by Mr. Cameli and the Respondents.  Additionally, Mr. Cameli was awarded
$40,000.00 in attorney fees against Mr. Hamza, while no fees were awarded
against FAKK, Mr. Farin, Ms. Mitchell, or Mr. Caillat.  Despite these stipulations, Defendants argue Plaintiff
filed a Memorandum of Costs on August 9, 2024, totaling $132,518.78, in violation
of the arbitration award.  Thus,
Defendants argue that the motion should be granted, and the Plaintiff’s
Memorandum of Costs should be stricken from the record.It should be noted that Plaintiff dismisses his request for
costs claimed under item “16. Other” in his Memorandum of Costs.  (Opposition, p. 1.)  The Court notes item 16 has a total of
$61,679.00. (8/9/24 Memorandum of Costs.) The motion asserts these amounts
represent Plaintiff’s share of the Arbitrator’s fees, and Plaintiff hereby
dismisses this portion of his cost request.  Concurrently with the opposition, Plaintiff filed
an Amended Memorandum of Costs reflecting this dismissal.  (Sheik Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. B; see 11/7/24 Amended
Memorandum of Costs [no costs are claimed in item 16].)As to the remaining costs, Plaintiff argues they are
entirely proper and properly claimed.  Plaintiff argues that the costs claimed
in the Memorandum of Costs (e.g., deposition costs, service of process fees,
court reporter fees, and electronic filing fees) did not come before the
Arbitrator.  (Opp., pp. 3-4.)  Plaintiff argues the short passage from
the Arbitrator’s Final Award quoted by Defendants, without any further argument
or analysis, does not deprive Plaintiff of his statutory right to costs here.The reply argues the Arbitrator’s
Final Award explicitly resolved all cost issues, stating that “all other costs
incurred by the Parties in this arbitration proceeding are to be borne by the
Parties as incurred.”  Defendants
reiterate that the Arbitrator’s Final Award explicitly resolved all cost issues
and that Plaintiff’s attempt to recover additional costs contradicts the
binding terms of the Operating Agreement and the Award.The Amended
Memorandum of Costs seeks $71,004.78 in total costs.  (11/7/24 Amended Memorandum of Costs.)  The breakdown is $37,457.98 in deposition
costs, $2,381.47 in service of process, $30,738.89 in court reporter fees, and
$426.44 in fees for electronic filing or service. (Ibid.)Code of Civil
Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b) provides, “Except as otherwise
expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of
right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.”  There are, however, specific statutes
“otherwise expressly” governing costs arising from contractual arbitration.  Section 1284.2 provides, “Unless the
arbitration agreement otherwise provides or the parties to the arbitration
otherwise agree, each party to the arbitration shall pay his pro rata share of
the expenses and fees of the neutral arbitrator, together with other expenses
of the arbitration incurred or approved by the neutral arbitrator, not
including counsel fees or witness fees or other expenses incurred by a party
for his own benefit.”  This provision
“sets forth the legislative policy of this state that arbitration costs are to
be borne by the party incurring them, unless the arbitration agreement provides
otherwise.”  (Austin v. Allstate Ins.
Co. (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1812, 1815.) 
In contrast, section 1293.2 provides, “The court shall award costs upon
any judicial proceeding under” the title of the Code of Civil Procedure
governing arbitration.  (Emphasis added.)
 In other words, “[i]t is apparent that
the Legislature has distinguished between costs incurred in an arbitration
proceeding and costs incurred in superior court to enforce an arbitration
award, allowing costs to the prevailing party only in the latter.”  (Austin, at pp. 1815-1816; Dickinson
v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 952, 954.)  If the parties do not want to allow the
arbitrator to allocate the costs of arbitration, section 1284.2 allows the
parties to contract around its terms in their arbitration agreement.Plaintiff argues the
costs are entirely proper because they did
not come before the Arbitrator: “The entire oral and written record of
the arbitration proceedings is devoid of any mention of or reference to any of
these items of costs.”  (Opp., p. 3.)  That is, the deposition costs, service of
process fees, court reporter fees, and fees for electronic filing and service.  The Court disagrees. This does not mean the issue of costs during the arbitration
was taken from the arbitrator and preserved for the trial court; it instead
means Plaintiff waived the right to those costs.  “Allowing a party to request that the trial
court make an award that was within the scope of the arbitration but not
pursued in that forum is inconsistent with the policies underlying the
statutory private arbitration scheme.”  (Corona
v. Amherst Partners (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 701, 706; see also Heimlich
v. Shivji (2019) 7 Cal.5th 350, 358 [party was required to seek costs under
section 998 from the arbitrator in the first instance; failure to do so
precludes relief].)  As cautioned in the
Rutter Guide, “A party requesting costs and attorney fees incurred in the
arbitration must make the request to the arbitrator during the
arbitration proceeding.  A court lacks
power to correct the award to include arbitration costs that should have been
awarded.”  (Knight et al., Cal. Practice
Guide: Alternative Dispute Resolution (The Rutter Group 2008) ¶ 5:402 (rev.
2022).)The Court has
jurisdiction to award actual court costs (e.g., filing and motion fees,
although none are claimed in item 1), but not arbitration costs (here, the deposition
costs (item 4) and court reporter fees (item 11)).  Because Plaintiff has not attached receipts to
its opposition, memorandum of costs, or amended memorandum of costs, it is
unclear to the Court whether the service of process fees in item 5, and the
fees for electronic filing or service in item 14, are actual court costs versus
arbitration costs.Accordingly, the
hearing is continued to February 26, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. in Department X of the
Alhambra Courthouse.  Within nine court
days prior to this hearing, Plaintiff is directed to file a supplement, with
receipts attached, identifying the costs claimed in items 5 and 14 of the
Amended Memorandum of Costs.  Any reply
in support of the motion to tax is due per Code, within five court days prior
to the continued hearing. Moving Party is to
give notice.
