And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses several issues related to Caltrans's opposition to Megeen's motion for judgment. Caltrans failed to lodge a courtesy copy of its opposition, in violation of the Presiding Judge's First Amended General Order Re: Mandatory Electronic Filing. As a result, the court has exercised its discretion to read and consider only the first 10 pages of Megeen's reply brief, which exceeded the 10-page limit. Caltrans also requested judicial notice of certain facts, including the distance between two properties, but failed to provide evidence to support this request. The court denied judicial notice of these facts. Finally, the court noted that Megeen's reply brief referred to a deposition that was not relevant to the motion and has not been considered. The parties have not briefed the issue of the pertinent limitations period, which may be three years for a claim based on a liability created by statute.
