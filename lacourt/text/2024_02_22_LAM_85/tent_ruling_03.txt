 Case Number:  22STCV34062    Hearing Date:   February 22, 2024    Dept:  85 
Gang Ding v. Kin Hui
and William Chu, 22STCV34062
 
 
Tentative decision on motion
for reconsideration: reconsideration granted and denied on merits



 
            Defendant
Kin Hui (“Kin”) moves for reconsideration of the court’s order granting Plaintiff
Gang Ding (“Ding”)’s application for a right to attach order against Kin in the
amount of $1,088,592.18.  Alternatively,
Kin moves to vacate the order.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
First Amended Complaint
            Plaintiff
Ding filed the Complaint against Defendants Kin and William Chu (“Chu”) on October
24, 2022.  The operative pleading is the
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) filed on January 3, 2023, alleging seven counts
of breach of contract, one count of breach of the covenant of good faith and
fair dealing, and common count.  The FAC
alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            On
August 2, 2018, the parties entered into a Loan Agreement (“August
2018 Loan”) whereby Chu borrowed $60,000 at an annual interest rate of
6%.  Chu agreed to repay the loan in full
within three years, but that term could be extended.  The loan also listed Kin as guarantor.  On August 2, 2021, the parties mutually
agreed to extend the term to August 2, 2022.
            On
April
9, 2019, Ding and Kin entered into a Promissory Note (“April 2019 Note”) for
principal of $44,640 with the commercial loan interest rate of Shanghai
Commercial Bank, Los Angeles Branch.  Kin
agreed to repay the note in 12 months, and the note was not eligible for
renewal or extension.  
            On
May 9, 2019, Ding and Kin entered into a Promissory Note (“May 2019 Note”) for principal
of $43,630 with the commercial loan interest rate of Shanghai Commercial Bank,
Los Angeles Branch.  Kin agreed to repay
the note in 12 months, and the note was not eligible for renewal or
extension.  
            On
August
8, 2019, Ding and Kin entered into a Loan Agreement (“August
2019 Loan”) whereby Chu borrowed $100,000 at an annual interest rate of
6%.  The August 2019 Loan also listed Kin as
guarantor.  Chu agreed to repay
the loan in full within two years, but that term could be extended.  On August 8, 2021, the parties mutually
agreed to extend the term to August 8, 2022.
            On
October 9, 2019, Ding and Kin entered into a Promissory Note (“October 2019
Note”) for principal of $1,000,000 plus interest, to be repaid within three
years. 
            Of
the amounts owed, Chu and Kin have only repaid the $100,000 principal for the
August 2019 Loan without interest.  Ding
has sent written demands for all outstanding amounts to no avail.
            Ding
seeks compensatory damages of over $2,000,000 plus interest, attorney’s fees,
and costs.
 
            2.
Cross-Complaint
            Cross-Complainants
Kin, Singpoli Milpitas, LP (“Milpitas”), and Singpoli Capital Corporation
(“Capital”) filed a Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants Ding and American
BD Investment Group, LLC (“American”) and Nominal Cross-Defendant BDK Capital,
LLC (“BDKC”) on February 17, 2023, alleging (1) breach of contract, (2) breach
of fiduciary duty, (3) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,
(4) breach of contract, and (5) reformation of contract.  The Cross-Complaint alleges in pertinent part
as follows.
            In
November
2014, Milpitas and American entered into a joint venture to develop and manage
Landmark Tower at 600 Barber Lane, Milpitas, CA (“Landmark”).  Milpitas closed escrow and acquired Landmark
on November 20, 2014, subject to a $10,500,000 seller’s carry back loan (“Seller
Loan”) which was 50% of the purchase price.
            On
December 18, 2014, the parties entered into a written BDKC Operating Agreement.  Per this agreement, American would inject sufficient
capital to repay the Seller Loan in exchange for 50% of BDKC.  Milpitas and American would then
become BDKC’s managers.  
            Per
section 5.1 of the BDKC operating agreement, any important issue would require
the unanimous agreement or written consent of the BDKC members.  Section 5.3 extended this requirement to any
decision that would cause BDKC to incur a debt or obligation of $100,000 or
more.  However, only one member’s
signature would be required to enter contracts on BDKC’s behalf.  Section 5.5 imposed a fiduciary duty on every
member such that no member would partake in any activity that would harm BDKC.
            On
December 23, 2014, Milpitas transferred Landmark’s property to BDKC.  In February 2015, Ding borrowed money from
Bank of Shanghai to use for Landmark.  Kin
believed that these funds would be used only for Landmark and to infuse more
capital into BDKC.  Ding instead used the
Bank of Shanghai loan to purchase personal residences for himself and family.
            On
March 27, 2015, Milpitas and American executed the first amendment
to BDKC’s    Operating Agreement which
reflected new ownership interests and defined a Majority-In-Interest as any
member or group of members who in the aggregate had more than a 50% interest in
BDKC.  A majority interest owner could
not take any action adverse to the benefit of other BDKC members without
consent of all members.
            On
March 15, 2017, Milpitas and American executed the second amendment
to the BDKC Operating Agreement which reduced the amount a BDKC member could
pay to a third party without the other members’ consent.
            On
December 17, 2018, Ding proposed to Kin a plan to reduce costs for Landmark.  The proposal would require a reduced scope and
new entitlements.  In September 2020, Kin
first learned that Ding unilaterally submitted and obtained approvals for new
entitlements that reduced Landmark’s expected value by over 50%.  Kin would never have agreed to this.
            New
complications required BDKC members to provide more equity for Landmark.  Ding’s associate Frank Lin (“Lin”) offered to
Kin and Milpitas that Ding would take full responsibility over all
financing matters and ensure that Landmark remained profitable after the change
in plans.  In return, Kin, on Milpitas’s
behalf, would abdicate control as a BDKC manager and leave Ding as sole
manager.  On September 30, 2020, Kin executed
a third amendment to the BDKC Operating Agreement to that effect.  This gave Ding sole authority to act on BDKC’s
behalf except as limited by the BDKC Operating Agreement.  Ding has not made any reasonable progress on
Landmark in the two and a half years since this amendment.
            Milpitas
seeks compensatory damages from Ding and American with pre-judgment interest,
constructive trust over the personal properties Ding purchased with BDKC funds,
and punitive damages.  Kin and Capital
both seek from American compensatory damages and pre-judgment interest.  Kin also seeks reformation of the April 9,
2019 Note and the May 9, 2019 Note to reflect that he borrowed that money on Singboli
BD Media’s behalf.
            
            3.
Course of Proceedings
            On January 3, 2023, Ding
served Kin with the FAC.
            On January 10, 2023, Chu
signed a Notice of Acknowledgement of Receipt of the FAC and First Amended
Summons.
            On February 17, 2023, Cross-Complainants
Kin, Milpitas, and Capital served Ding with the Cross-Complaint and Kin’s
Answer to the FAC.
            On February 21, 2023,
Chu filed and served his Answer to the FAC.
            On March 10, 2023, Kin served
American and BDKC with the Cross-Complaint.
            On March 31, 2023, Ding
filed and served an Answer to the Cross-Complaint.
            On April 24, 2023, American
and BDKC filed an Answer to the Cross-Complaint.
            On December 14, 2023,
this court granted Ding’s application for a right to attach order against Kin
in the amount of $1,088,592.18.
            On
December 22, 2023, Department 86 (Hon. Mitchell Beckloff) denied Kin’s ex parte application to
stay enforcement of the order granting a right to attach order against him.  On January 4, 2024, this court denied a
second ex parte application for such a stay.
            On
January 17, 2024, this court granted Kin’s
ex parte application to hear an objection to the undertaking’s amount
for the right to attach order against him for $1,088,592.18.  On January 22, the court granted the motion in
part by raising the undertaking to $50,000.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 1008(a) (“section 1008(a)”) provides for
reconsideration of court orders.  Section
1008(a)’s motion to reconsider is broad in scope and allows any party affected
by the order to seek reconsideration and modification, amendment or vacation of
prior orders.  Relief under section
1008(a) is strictly limited; motions to reconsider must be brought within 10
days of service of written notice of the original order.  
            A
motion for reconsideration constitutes the exclusive means for a party seeking
modification, amendment or revocation of an order.  Morite of Calif. v. Superior Court,
(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 485, 490.  To be
entitled to reconsideration, a party must show (1) new or different facts,
circumstances, or law and (2) a satisfactory explanation for failing to produce
such evidence earlier.  Kalivas v.
Barry Controls Corp., (“Kalivas”) (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1152,
1160-61.  The requirement of satisfactory
explanation for failing to provide the evidence earlier can only be
described as a strict requirement of diligence. 
Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690.  A motion for reconsideration cannot be
granted on the ground that the court misapplied the law in its initial
ruling.  Gilberd v. AC Transit
(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.  A
mistake based on ignorance of law is not a proper basis for
reconsideration.  Pazderka v.
Caballeros Dimas Alang, Inc. (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 658, 670.  
            Relief
under CCP section 1008(a) is strictly limited. 
A motion to reconsider must be brought within ten days of service of
written notice of the original order.  Kalivas,
supra, 49 Cal.App.4th at 1160.  
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            1.
Original Evidence
            Relevant
evidence from the original hearing is as follows.
            On
June 30, 2017, BDKA pledged a $1,000,000 time certificate as collateral for a
loan EverTrust Bank made to Kin.  Ding App.
Supp. Decl.,[1] ¶4.  
            On
October 9, 2019, Ding and Kin signed the October 2019 Note pursuant to which
Kin borrowed $1,000,000.  Ding App. Decl.,
¶19, Ex. 8.  The recitals explained that
Kin had borrowed $1 million from EverTrust Bank on March 28, 2017, secured by a
$1,000,000 certificate of deposit (“CD”) pledged by BDK Arcadia (“BDKA”).  Ex. 8. 
BDKA had borrowed $2,500,000 from BDKC on March 28, 2017.  Ex. 8. 
As of October 9, 2019, Ding had repaid $1,300,000 of BDKA’s $2,500,000
loan and $1.2 million in loan principal remained outstanding.  Ding App. Decl., ¶20, Ex. 8; Ding App. Supp.
Decl. ¶6.  
            Kin
promised to repay $1,000,000 of the $1.3 million outstanding loan from BDKC to BDKA,
plus any accrued interest, within three years of the October 2019 Note’s
effective date.  Ding App. Decl., ¶21,
Ex. 8.  The parties agreed to mutually
agree to an extension after the expiration of this three-year period.  Ding App. Decl., ¶21, Ex. 8.  Kin’s BDKC membership interest would serve as
collateral, and this note would take priority over all other agreements for
which Kin had offered his BDKC membership interest as collateral.  Ding App. Decl., ¶20, Ex. 8.  In exchange, Ding, as the lender, agreed to
repay Kin’s loan to EverTrust Bank from the proceeds of liquidating the $1
million CD for Kin’s loan by October 8, 2020. 
Ding App. Decl., ¶20, Ex. 8.  The
October 2019 Note provided that it could only be amended with Ding’s written
consent.  Ding App. Decl., ¶20, Ex.
8.  
            Beginning
October 11, 2019 thereafter, Ding paid BDKC the amounts Kin owed under the loan
from BDKC.  Ding App. Supp. Decl. ¶7, Ex.
A.  These payments total $1,138,300,
albeit commingled in checks to BDKC for unrelated expenses.  Ding App. Supp. Decl. ¶7, Ex. A.  As of the application for a right to attach
order, Kin had not repaid the $1,000,000 owed to Ding under the October 2019
Note.  Ding App. Supp. Decl. ¶8.  
            On
May 28, 2022, Ding’s manager Lin sent an email to Chu and Kin’s wife Ivy
(“Ivy”) to confirm a list of 16 loans, including the Loans and Notes at issue
in the right to attach order.  Lin App. Decl.,
¶2, Ex. 9.  On June 29, 2022, Ivy asserted
that only two loans, including the October 2019 Note, were past due.   Lin App. Decl., ¶10, Ex. 9.  
            On
December 30, 2022, EverTrust Bank sent Ding a “Notice of Liquidation of BDK
Capital LLC Certificate of Deposit Account” (“Liquidation Notice”).  Hallock App. Supp. Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.  The Liquidation Notice informed Ding that Evertrust
Bank had liquidated the $1,000,000 collateral time certificate from “BDK
Investment LLC” the day before.  Hallock App.
Supp. Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.  The proceeds
exceeded the outstanding balance on the loan EverTrust Bank made to Kin.  Hallock App. Supp. Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.  
            On
July 20, 2023, Plaintiffs deposed Kin in this case.  Hallock App. Decl., ¶12, Ex. 14 (“Kin
Depo.”).  Kin admitted that he borrowed
$1,000,000 as reflected in the October 2019 Note to pay debts owed through
different restaurants.  Kin Depo., p.
111.  Kin has not repaid it because he
and Ding have a dispute as to whether the amount owed exceeds any offset.  Kin Depo., pp. 111-12.
 
            2.
Kin’s Evidence
            a.
Transaction History
            On
February 5, 2020, Kin borrowed $2,000,000 from East West Bank (“EWB
Loan”).  Kin Decl., ¶2, Ex. A.  An event of default under the EWB Loan
included any material adverse change in Kin’s financial condition.  Kin Decl., ¶2, Ex. A.  
            On
January 16, 2020, BDKA and BDKC agreed to change title of CD Account #28877108
from BDKA to BDKC.  Kin Decl., ¶5, Ex.
D.  Accordingly, EverTrust Bank was directed
to close this CD and transfer its $1,019,770.05 balance to Checking Account No.
2516912.  Kin Decl., ¶5, Ex. D.  Evertrust Bank then was to withdraw
$1,000,000 from that account and open a new six-month CD Account #2883692 under
BDKC’s name.  Kin Decl., ¶5, Ex. D.  BDKC would then pledge this CD to Kin’s “CD
loan #3217012016.”  Kin Decl., ¶5, Ex. D.  BDKC’s 2020 ledger confirms that it received
a $1,000,000 deposit from BDKA’s account. 
Gamarnik Decl., ¶2, Ex. A.
            EverTrust
Bank’s counsel Roger Yuen, Esq. (“Yuen”) made a typographical error in the
Liquidation Notice.  Yuen Decl., ¶3, Ex.
A.  The reference to “BDK Investment LLC”
should have been to BDKC.  Yuen Decl.,
¶4, Ex. A.  Yuen wrote this letter in
response to a letter from Ding’s counsel Karen Hallock, Esq. (“Hallock”) seeking
termination of the CD and return of the funds to BDKC.  Yuen Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  Evertrust Bank subsequently liquidated the
BDKC CD on or about December 30, 2022, and applied the proceeds to pay off the
Kin loan.  Yuen Decl., ¶4.
 
            b.
Course of Proceedings
            Kin’s
counsel Kevin Gamarnik, Esq. (“Gamarnik”) reviewed Ding’s declaration in
support of the application for a right to attach order.  Gamarnik Decl., ¶7.  He knew there was a “glaring hole” as to
whose collateral was liquidated, but he did not think the court would interpret
this to mean it was BDKA’s collateral. 
Gamarnik Decl., ¶7.  Ding never
affirmatively said so, and Gamarnik did not recognize that someone unfamiliar
with the facts would not consider this “slight nuance” obvious.  Gamarnik Decl., ¶7.  Kin therefore did not submit any evidence
showing the liquidated CD belonged to BDKC. 
Gamarnik Decl., ¶7.  
            Gamarnik
also did not anticipate that this court would think EverTrust Bank’s December
30, 2022 Liquidation Notice erred in saying the liquidated collateral belonged
to BDKC.  Gamarnik Decl., ¶8.  He was shocked when Hallock did not clarify this
mistake during the hearing, even after he invited her to do so.  Gamarnik Decl., ¶¶ 4, 8.  He therefore did not provide a declaration
from Yuen, the letter’s author, before the hearing.  Gamarnik Decl., ¶8.
 
          On December 18, 2023, Gamarnik
sent a letter to Hallock Gamarnik Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.  He asserted that this court’s decision to
grant the right to attach order as to the October 2019 Note presumed the CD
thereunder belonged to BDKA.  Gamarnik
Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.  Gamarnik alleged Hallock
knew that the liquidated collateral in fact belonged to CDKC.  Gamarnik Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.  Despite this, she refused to clarify the
matter when invited to do so at the hearing. 
Gamarnik Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.  She had
therefore violated California Rules of Professional Conduct (“CRPC”), Rule
3.3(a)(1)(3), which prohibits an attorney from knowingly failing to correct a
false statement of material fact. 
Gamarnik Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.  Gamarnik
asked Hallock whether Ding would agree to stay entry of the attachment order
while the court decides how to respond to “this new understanding” of relevant
facts.  Gamarnik Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.  Hallock never responded.  Gamarnik Decl., ¶6
 
            3.
Ding’s Evidence
            On
December 18, 2014, Milpitas and American entered into the BDKC Operating
Agreement.  Ding Decl., ¶3, Ex. 1.  Per this agreement, Milpitas and American
became BDKC’s managers.  Ding Decl., ¶3,
Ex. 1.  Under section 5.1, any important
issue requires the unanimous agreement or written consent of the BDKC
members.  Ding Decl., ¶3, Ex. 1.  Section 5.5 imposes a fiduciary duty on every
member, such that no member was to partake in any activity that would harm
BDKC.  Ding Decl., ¶3, Ex. 1.  
            On
March 27, 2015 Milpitas and American executed the first amendment to the BDKC
Operating Agreement.  Ding Decl., ¶4, Ex.
2.  Section 5.7 was modified to define a
member holding a majority-in-interest as any member or group of members who in
the aggregate had more than a 50% interest in BDKC.  Ding Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  Such member(s) could not add capital, incur
debt, or take any action adverse to the benefits of other BDKC members without
consent of all members.  Ding Decl., ¶4,
Ex. 2.  
            In
October 2019, Kin asked Lin if he could borrow $1,000,000 from Ding to secure
another loan from EverTrust Bank to pay back debts for his restaurant business.  Lin Jan. 2024 Decl., ¶7.  Soon after, Kin sent Lin the October 2019
Note, drafted by one of Kin’s representatives,  for Ding’s signature.  Lin Jan. 2024 Decl., ¶8.  Ding used his entity, BDKA, to loan the money
to Kin for the October 2019 Noe.  Lin
Jan. 2024 Decl., ¶9.  However, Ding
remade the lender and holder of the October 2019 Note.  Lin Jan. 2025 Decl., ¶9.
            On
September 30, 2020, Milpitas and American executed the third amendment to the BDKC
Operating Agreement.  Ding Decl., ¶6, Ex.
4.  It identified Ding as the manager and
gave the manager the authority to act on BDKC’s behalf.  Ding Decl., ¶6, Ex. 4.  This would include the right to assign BDKC’s
claim under the October 2019 note to Ding so that he can collect the amounts
past due by Kin to BDKC.  Ding Decl., ¶10.
            On
July 12, 2023, Kin produced both the October 2019 Note and the transfer of the CD
in response to Ding’s Request for Production of Documents.  Hallock Decl., ¶4, Ex. 1.
 
            4.
Reply Evidence
            On
December 22, 2023, during a hearing on an ex parte application to stay
enforcement of this right to attach order, Department 86 asked why the transfer
of the CD in the October 2019 Note would be material.  Gamarnik Supp. Decl., Ex. A.  Kin responded that the October 2019 Note required
BDKA, which Ding wholly owns, to post collateral.  Gamarnik Supp. Decl., Ex. A.  BDKA instead used that CD to repay Ding’s
debt to BDKC, a third of which Kin owns. 
Gamarnik Supp. Decl., Ex. A.  BDKC
then posted a different CD with a different CD number, but the ownership of
this collateral was different from the original CD.  Gamarnik Supp. Decl., Ex. A.  
 
            D. Analysis
            Thes court granted an application
for a right to attach order against Kin totaling $1,088,592.18.  Kin moves for reconsideration of, or
alternatively to vacate, the court’s decision for the $1,000,000 portion of
this order that concerns the October 2019 Note. 
 
            1. Timeliness
            A motion to reconsider must be filed
within ten days of service of written notice of the original order.  Kalivas, supra, 49 Cal.App.4th
at 1160.  The court granted the right to
attach order on December 14, 2023.  Kin filed
the motion to reconsider on December 21, 2023, and the motion is timely.
 
            2. Request to
Reconsider
            To be entitled to reconsideration, a party
must show (1) new or different facts, circumstances, or law and (2) a
satisfactory explanation for failing to produce such evidence earlier.  Kalivas,
supra, 49 Cal.App.4th at 1160-61. The requirement of satisfactory
explanation for failing to provide the evidence earlier can only be
described as a strict requirement of diligence.  Garcia, supra,
58 Cal.App.4th at 690. 
            On October 9, 2019, Ding and Kin
signed the October 2019 Note, pursuant to which Kin borrowed $1,000,000.  Ding App. Decl., ¶19, Ex. 8.  The recitals explained that Kin had borrowed
$1 million from EverTrust Bank on March 28, 2017, secured by a $1 million CD pledged
by BDKA.  Ex. 8.  BDKA borrowed $2,500,000 from BDKC on March
28, 2017.  Ex. 8.  As of October 9, 2019, Ding had repaid
$1,300,000 of BDKA’s $2,500,000 loan and $1.2 million in loan principal remained
outstanding.  Ding App. Decl., ¶20, Ex. 8;
Ding App. Supp. Decl. ¶6.  Kin promised
to repay $1 million of the $1.3 million outstanding loan from BDKC to BDKA,
plus any accrued interest, within three years of the October 2019 Note’s
effective date.  Ding App. Decl., ¶21,
Ex. 8.  The parties agreed to mutually
agree to an extension after the expiration of this three-year period.  Ding App. Decl., ¶21, Ex. 8.  Kin’s BDKC membership interest would serve as
collateral, and this note would take priority over all other agreements for
which Kin had offered his BDKC membership interest as collateral.  Ding App. Decl., ¶20, Ex. 8.  In exchange, Ding, as the lender, agreed to
repay Kin’s loan to EverTrust Bank from the proceeds of liquidating the $1
million CD pledged by BDKA by October 8, 2020. 
Ding App. Decl., ¶20, Ex. 8.  The
October 2019 Note could only be amended with Ding’s written consent.  Ding App. Decl., ¶20, Ex. 8.  
             On December 30,
2022, EverTrust Bank sent Ding a Liquidation Notice.  Hallock App. Supp. Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.  It informed Ding that it had liquidated the $1,000,000
CD from “BDK Investment LLC” the day before. 
Hallock App. Supp. Decl., ¶5, Ex. B. 
The proceeds exceeded the outstanding balance on Kin’s loan from EverTrust
Bank.  Hallock App. Supp. Decl., ¶5, Ex.
B.
            In opposition to Ding’s application for a right to attach
order, Kin argued that Ding had not liquidated BDKA’s CD
collateral to repay Kin’s loan as required. 
Ding App. Decl., ¶20, Ex. 8.  The new facts relied
on by Kin for this motion concern whether the CD liquidated as reflected in the
Liquidation Notice belonged to BDKA or BDKC.  Kin now presents evidence of a January 2020 CD
transfer in which EverTrust Bank closed BDKA’s CD, transferred its
$1,019,770.05 balance to BDKC’s checking account, and used $1,000,000 of that money
to open a new CD that BDKC pledged to Kin’s loan.  Kin Decl., ¶5, Ex. D.  He also presents statements from the author
of the Liquidation Notice that its reference to “BDK Investment LLC” was to
BDKC, not BDKA.  Yuen Decl., ¶4, Ex.
A.  
            Kin asserts that the facts are new
insofar as he had no reason to believe the court would think the Liquidation
Notice referred to BDKA instead of BDKC. 
Gamarnik Decl., ¶8.  He was
shocked when Hallock did not clarify otherwise during the hearing, even after
he invited her to do so.  Gamarnik Decl.,
¶¶ 4, 8.  He therefore did not provide a
declaration from Yuen, the letter’s author, before the hearing.  Gamarnik Decl., ¶8.
Ding asserts that
none of these qualify as new facts before Kin knew about them years before the
hearing.  Opp. at 8.  Kin shared the CD transfer with Ding during
discovery along with the October 2019 Note. 
Hallock Decl., ¶4, Ex. 1.  
             Kin is correct that the court issued the right
to attach with respect to the October 2019 Note based on its belief that the
Liquidation Notice’s reference to BDK Investment LLC was to BDKA, not
BDKC.  Kin shows that this belief was
mistaken.  Kin has presented new facts
that justify reconsideration and the motion to reconsider is granted.
 
            2. Merits
Upon
reconsideration, the motion is denied on its merits.[2]  Kin’s argument is that he will prevail at
trial because he and Ding agreed to swap debt in the October 2019 Note and Ding
did not perform his obligation.  
Through their
respective entities, Ding solely owns BDKA but Ding and Kin jointly own BDKC. 
Ding controls both BDKA and BDKC.  On
Oct. 8, 2019, Kin signed the October 2019 Note which was a debt swap.  The
2019 Note recited that Kin had borrowed $1 million from EverTrust Bank secured
by a $1 million CD pledged by BDKA.  Ding
agreed to cause EverTrust Bank to liquidate the $1 million CD to pay off Kin’s
loan.  In exchange, Kin agreed to pay $1
million of a $1.2 million loan that BDKA had obtained from BDKC.  Kin
argues that Ding never caused EverTrust Bank to liquidate BDKA's CD. 
Instead, Ding caused a letter to be sent by BDKA and BDKC to EverTrust Bank redesignating
the pledged CD from BDKA to BDKC.  Subsequently, BDKC pledged the CD for
collateral for Kin's loan and that CD was liquidated.  Kin contends that none of BDKA’s funds were
liquidated; it was BDKC’s CD that was liquidated.  Mot. at 1-2.
As stated by the
court at the bond hearing, Kin’s theory essentially is that Ding performed his
obligations under the October 2019 Note by using BDKC’s funds, not BDKA’s
funds.  If true, this theory would be
viable because BDKC is partly owned by Kin. 
Essentially, Ding would be using money partly owned by Kin to perform
his personal obligation.
The theory is not
supported by the evidence, however, because Kin fails to show that there was
any consideration for the transfer of the pledged CD from BDKA to BDKC.   Rather, it appears to be only a paper
transfer between entities controlled by Ding. 
There is no evidence that BDKA owed BDKC the money embodied by the
transferred CD.  While the October 2019
Note states that BDKA borrowed $2.5 million from BDKC in 2017, it also states
that Ding, on behalf of BDKA, had repaid $1.3 million of the loan, leaving $1.2
million in unpaid principal.  Hallock
Decl., Ex. 1.  The October 2019 Note
provides that Kin would pay $1 million of the BDKC loan plus unpaid interest
and Ding would pay the rest.  Beginning October 11, 2019, Ding did
pay BDKC the amounts Kin owed under the loan from BDKC.  Ding App. Supp. Decl. ¶7, Ex. A.  As a result, the
only debt owed to BDKC by BDKA at the time of the January 16, 2020 transfer of
the $1 million CD from BDKA to BDKC was the $1 million plus interest that Kin
was required to pay.  The CD transfer did
not occur to pay a debt and it still belonged to Ding (through BDKA).  As a result, Kin had no interest in the CD’s funds,
which could be used for Ding’s performance of the 2019 Note.
Ding correctly points out that BDKA, BDKC, and Kin
(through Milpitas) all agreed to the CD transfer from BDKA and BDKC.  Opp. at 9. 
Additionally, Kin has not repaid the $1,000,000 owed to Ding
under the October 2019 Note.  Ding App. Supp.
Decl. ¶8.  Kin has admitted that he borrowed
$1,000,000 as reflected in the October 2019 Note to pay debts owed through
different restaurants.  Hallock App. Decl.,
¶12, Ex. 14 (“Kin Depo.”), p. 111.  Kin contends
that he has not repaid it because he and Ding have a dispute as to whether the
amount owed exceeds any offset.  Kin
Depo., pp. 111-12.[3]
            Because Kin has not shown that he
has any beneficial interest in the CD transferred from BDKA to BDKC, he cannot
dispute that Ding performed his obligations in the 2019 Note by causing the CD
to be liquidated and used to pay Kin’s debt to EverTrust Bank.  Ding is entitled to Kin’s performance, and
therefore attachment of $1 million for Kin’s failure to perform.  The motion to reconsider is denied on its
merits.[4]
