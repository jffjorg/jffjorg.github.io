 Case Number:  23STCV29943    Hearing Date:   February 22, 2024    Dept:  85 
NFS Leasing, Inc. v. Zeeba
Company, Inc. et al, 23STCV29943
 
Tentative decision on applications
for right to attach orders: denied




 
            
Plaintiff NFS Leasing, Inc.  (“NFS”) applies for right to attach orders against
Defendants Zeeba Automotive Group, Inc., Zeeba Company, Inc. (collectively “Borrowers”),
Sonny Investments LLC (“Sonny”), Kayvon Marashi (“Kayvon”), and Saied Mohammed
Marashi (“Saied”) in the amount of $2,968,390.42.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, oppositions, and consolidated reply[1]
and renders the following tentative decision.
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            NFS
filed its Complaint on December 7, 2023, alleging (1) breach of the equipment
financing and security agreement, (2) claim and delivery, (3) breach of
personal guarantees, and (4) breach of corporate guaranty.  The Complaint alleges in pertinent part as
follows. 
 
            a.
Loans and Guaranties
            On
November 29, 2022, Borrowers entered Master Equipment Finance Agreement Number
2022-0311 with a Multiple Borrower Addendum (collectively “MFA”).  Under the MFA, NFS financed Borrowers’
acquisition and refinancing of various pieces of Equipment.  The Equipment and other collateral secured
all financing thereunder, pursuant to separate schedules under the MFA.  The MFA combines with the schedules to
constitute an Equipment Finance Agreement (“EFA”).
            Under
the EFA, Borrowers agreed to periodically pay principal, financing fees, and
interest as outlined in each schedule without invoices or other written
demand.  Failure to make a payment within
five days of the due date would also incur a late charge plus interest at a
Late Payment Rate.  The Borrowers also
agreed to be jointly and severally liable to NFS for the full performance of
all obligations thereunder.
            The
loan amount was $1,059,324.08 under Schedule 1 and $1,891,149.27 under Schedule
2.  Borrowers were to repay both in 48
monthly installments.
            An
event of default includes failure to make any payment when due, or any default
under any agreement or guaranty for a total amount of $50,000.  Under the EFA, upon default, NFS could declare
all obligations under the EFA immediately due and payable.  Any event of default by one borrower would
also allow NFS to exercise rights and remedies against all borrowers.
            Also
on November 29, 2022, Kayvon and Saied (collectively “Marashis”) signed
separate Personal Guaranty and Security Agreements (“Personal Guaranties”) for
all amounts owed under the EFAs after five days’ notice of payment due.  The Marashis agreed to waive any right to
require NFS to proceed against Borrowers before proceeding against them.  Sonny also signed a Corporate Guaranty
Agreement (“Corporate Guaranty”) with identical relevant terms.
 
            b.
Default
            In
September 2023, Borrowers were in default under the EFA.  In association with amendments to the EFA
Schedules, they entered a Voluntary Surrender (“VS”) whereby they agreed to
surrender all Equipment to NFS and waive all rights and interests therein.  Of the 53 pieces of Equipment, one was
totaled and NFS has begun repossession efforts as to the remaining 52.
            On
November 10, 2023, NFS sent Defendants a Notice of Default under the EFA for
failure to make payments due thereunder.  Borrowers failed to repay the amounts due or
return the Equipment.  This default
entitles NFS to accelerate and declare immediately due and payable all sums owed.  As of December 6, 2023, Borrowers and
Guarantors owe $2,968,390.42 plus accruing interest and attorneys’ fees and
costs.
 
            c.
Damages
            Based
on the applicable EFA or Guaranty for each Defendant, NFS seeks $2,968,390.42
in damages plus continuing interest, fees, costs and expenses under the
EFA.  NFS also seeks possession of all
Equipment and other collateral under the EFA, as well as attorney’s fees and
costs.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
December 11, 2023, NFS personally served Borrowers with the Complaint and
Summons.
            On
December 29, 2023, NFS personally served Borrowers with the moving papers.
            On
January 10, 2024, NFS served Sonny with the Complaint, Summons, and moving
papers by substitute service effective January 20, 2024.
            On
January 25, 2024, Borrowers filed separate Answers.
            On
January 26, 2024, NFS filed undated proofs of service on the Marashis with the
Complaint and Summons by e-mail pursuant to a written agreement with Kayvon’s
attorney per CCP section 417.10(d).  Also
on January 26, NFS served both Marashis with the moving papers by e-mail.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            Attachment
is a prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the
defendant’s assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the
outcome of the trial of the action.  See
Whitehouse v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et
seq.) that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v.
Appellate Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536. 
See Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176
Cal.App.3d 1108, 1115.  As the attachment
statutes are purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly
construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner,
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 879, 882.




            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is
“readily ascertainable” where the amount due may be clearly ascertained from
the contract and calculated by evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 540-41 (attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for
lease of commercial equipment).
            All
property within California of a corporation, association, or partnership is
subject to attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson,
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            The
plaintiff may apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the
order and serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the
application, and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
            The
notice of the application and the application may be made on Judicial Council
forms (Optional Forms AT-105, 115).  The
application must be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the
facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.  CCP §484.030.  
            Where
the defendant is a corporation, a general reference to “all corporate property
which is subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil
Procedure Section 487.010” is sufficient. 
CCP §484.020(e).  Where the
defendant is a partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to
“all property of the partnership or other unincorporated association which is
subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure
Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP
§484.020(e).  A specific description of
property is not required for corporations and partnerships as they generally
have no exempt property.  Bank of
America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207
Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            A
defendant who opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of
opposition and supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not
later than five court days prior to the date set for hearing.  CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of opposition may be made on a
Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155). 

            The
plaintiff may file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for
the hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
            At
the hearing, the court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right
to attach order and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is
exempt from attachment.  The defendant
may appear the hearing.  CCP
§484.050(h).  The court generally will
evaluate the attachment application based solely on the pleadings and
supporting affidavits without taking additional evidence.  Bank of America, supra, 207
Cal.App.3d at 273. A verified complaint may be used in lieu of or in addition
to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts. 
CCP §482.040.  The plaintiff has the
burden of proof, and the court is not required to accept as true any affidavit
even if it is undisputed.  See Bank
of America, supra, at 271, 273.



            The
court may issue a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff
shows all of the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is
one on which an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is sought for no purpose other than the
recovery on the subject claim (CCP §484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be
secured by the attachment is greater than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            Except
in unlawful detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the
sum of (1) the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff,
and (2) any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and
any allowable attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110.  CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak
Construction, (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must be reduced by the sum of (1)
the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has in a money judgment against plaintiff,
(2) the amount claimed in a cross-complaint or affirmative defense and shown
would be subject to attachment against the plaintiff, and (3) the value of any
security interest held by the plaintiff in the defendant’s property, together
with the amount by which the acts of the plaintiff (or a prior holder of the
security interest) have decreased that security interest’s value.  CCP §483.015(b).  A defendant claiming that the amount to be
secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative defense must
make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an attachment
against the plaintiff.
            Before
the issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an
undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any
wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the action.  CCP §489.210. 
The undertaking ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If the defendant objects, the court may
increase the amount of undertaking to the amount determined as the probable
recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP
§489.220.  The court also has inherent
authority to increase the amount of the undertaking sua sponte.  North Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior
Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            1.
NFS’ Evidence
            a.
Loans and Guaranties
            On
November 29, 2022, Borrowers and NFS entered the MFA, under which NFS financed Borrowers’
acquisition and refinancing of various pieces of Equipment.  Calumby Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  Two schedules described the Equipment and
other collateral securing the financing. 
EFA.  Calumby Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  The MFA combines with the schedules to
constitute the EFA.  Calumby Decl., ¶5.  The EFA is governed by the law of
Massachusetts.  Calumby Decl., ¶5, Ex. A,
¶17.  
            Under
the EFA, Borrowers agreed to periodically pay principal, financing fees, and
interest as outlined in each schedule without invoices or other written
demand.  Calumby Decl., ¶6, Ex. A ¶2.  Failure to make a payment within five days of
the due date would incur a $250 late charge plus interest at a Late Payment
Rate of 1.5% per month.  Calumby Decl.,
¶6, Ex. A, ¶¶ 2, 14.
            Under
Paragraph 1 of the Multiple Borrower Addendum, the Borrowers also agreed to be
jointly and severally liable to NFS for the full performance of all obligations
thereunder.  Calumby Decl., ¶7, Ex. A.  
            Schedule
1 was for a loan principal of $1,059,324.08 and Schedule 2 was for a loan
principal of $1,891,149.27.  Calumby
Decl., ¶¶ 8-9, Ex. A.  Borrowers were required
to repay both Schedules in 48 monthly installments, albeit with two of those
installments as $0 under each schedule. 
Calumby Decl., ¶¶ 8-9, Ex. A.  Each
Schedule also required advance payment of the last three monthly installments
totaling $90,419.58 under Schedule 1 and $161,420.79 under Schedule 2.  Calumby Decl., ¶¶ 8-9, Ex. A.  
            The
Schedules identified the price of each piece of Equipment thereunder.  Calumby Decl., ¶¶ 8-9, Ex. A.  For example, Schedule 1 lists the original price
of the Ford 2022 TRANSIT T 350 CARGO Transit, VIN 1FTBW9CK1NKA75374 (“75374
Vehicle”) as $49,465.37.  Calumby Decl.,
¶¶ 8-9, Ex. A.  Borrowers granted NFS a
security interest in the Equipment as well as Borrowers' inventory,
accessories, parts, attachments, improvements, accessions, replacements,
substitutions, additions and proceeds therefrom or thereto.  Calumby Decl., ¶10, Ex. A ¶1.  NFS perfected this security interest when it
filed UCC-1 financing statements and amendments with the Office of the
Secretary of State of Delaware.  Calumby
Decl., ¶11, Ex. B.
            An
Event of Default under the EFA included (a) failure to make any payment with
respect to any agreement or obligation when due; (b) any event or condition
which after notice, lapse of time, or both would constitute an event of default
or permit acceleration of any obligation; and (k) the default of any Borrower
or Guarantor in an amount totaling $50,000. 
Calumby Decl., ¶12, Ex. A ¶7. 
Upon an Event of Default, NFS could repossess the collateral and declare
all outstanding balances immediately due and payable.  Calumby Decl., ¶13, Ex. A ¶8.  This includes the “Present Value” of all
future payments, defined as the payment amount discounted at a 5% annual
rate.   Calumby Decl., ¶13, Ex. A ¶¶ 6, 8.  Borrowers would also be responsible for any
costs and expenses incurred to repossess, store, repair, sell, or lease the
Equipment.  Calumby Decl., ¶13, Ex. A
¶8.  
            Under
Paragraph 3 of the Multiple Borrower Addendum, any event of default by one
Borrower would entitle NFS to exercise its rights and remedies against all Borrowers.  Calumby Decl., ¶14, Ex. A.
            Also
on November 29, 2022, the Marashi Defendants signed separate Personal
Guaranties holding them jointly and severally liable for all amounts owed under
the EFAs after five days’ notice of payment due.  Calumby Decl., ¶¶ 15, 17, Exs. C-D.  Paragraph 1 of the Personal Guaranties stated
that the Marashi Defendants have a substantial financial interest in the
Borrowers.  Calumby Decl., ¶16, Exs. C-D.  The Marashi Defendants waived any right to
require NFS to proceed against Borrowers before proceeding against them.  Calumby Decl., ¶18, Exs. C-D.  Sonny also signed a Corporate Guaranty with
identical terms.  Calumby Decl., ¶¶
19-21, Ex. E.  
 
            b.
Default
            In
September 2023, Borrowers were in default under the EFA.  Calumby Decl., ¶22.  They requested that NFS amend the remaining
obligations due under the EFA.  Calumby
Decl., ¶22.  In connection with these
amendments, Borrowers signed the VS, which NFS agreed to hold in escrow until
and unless subsequent default occurred.  Calumby
Decl., ¶22, Ex. F.
            Under
the VS, Borrowers agreed to surrender all Equipment to NFS, waive all rights
and interests therein, and consent to immediate repossession and liquidation
thereof.  Calumby Decl., ¶23, Ex. F.  A schedule to the VS identified 53 Vehicles
that are part of the Equipment.  Calumby
Decl., ¶24, Ex. F.  One vehicle has been
totaled, and repossession of the other 52 is underway.  Calumby Decl., ¶24, Ex. F.  
            On
November 10, 2023, NFS sent Defendants a Notice of Default under the EFA.  Calumby Decl., ¶25, Ex. G.  The notice asserted that Borrowers failed to
pay $104,187.35 that had become past due under the Schedules as of November 1,
2023.  Calumby Decl., ¶25, Ex. G.  Borrowers had five days to pay $105,156.19,
which reflected fees added to the $104,187.35 owed, plus $52.09 for each day
subsequent to the Notice of Default.  Calumby
Decl., ¶25, Ex. G.  
            To
date, Borrowers have failed to repay the amount owed under the EFA or to return
the Equipment.  Calumby Decl., ¶26.  NFS exercises its right to declare all
outstanding amounts owed immediately due and payable.   Calumby Decl., ¶27. 
            NFS
has subtracted the present value discount of accelerated payments, advance
payments made, and loss insurance proceeds received from all amounts past due
and remaining under the EFA.  Calumby Decl.,
¶28.  The total owed before collection
costs in this action and accruing interest is $2,968,390.42.  Calumby Decl., ¶28.  Under the Guaranties, the Guarantors are jointly
and severally responsible for this amount. 
Calumby Decl., ¶¶ 29-32.  
 
            2.
Defendants’ Evidence[2]
            Defendants
have calculated what they assert is the total balance under the EFA as follows.  They first itemized all 53 pieces of
Equipment listed in the VS.  Kayvon Decl.,
¶3, Ex. A.  They then identified the
original purchase price paid and the original loan amount from NFS for each vehicle.  Kayvon Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  For example, the 75374 Vehicle’s original
purchase price was $48,597.62, and its original loan amount was
$43,217.11.  Kayvon Decl., ¶3, Ex.
A.  The aggregate original purchase price
of all Equipment was $2,855,758.99, and the aggregate original loan amount was
$2,525,990.59.  Kayvon Decl., ¶3, Ex.
A.  
            Borrowers’
“FP&A” person has calculated loan payoff amounts for each vehicle, which
may include $10,000 per vehicle in early pay-off fees.  Kayvon Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.   The total payoff amount is
$1,964,759.68.  Kayvon Decl., ¶4, Ex.
A.   
            Defendants
collected the Manheim Market Reports (“MMR”) for each vehicle based on the
make, model, year, and mileage as of February 14, 2024.  Kayvon Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.   MMR is an industry standard for determining
wholesale pricing, and Defendants believe that NFS uses it also.  Kayvon Decl., ¶5.  Defendants used the wholesale adjusted MMR as
the projected selling price.  Kayvon
Decl., ¶5, Exs. A-B.
            The
total projected selling price of all Equipment is $2,146,300.  Kayvon Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.
This includes a projected selling
price of $29,700 for the 75374 Vehicle.  Kayvon
Decl., ¶5, Exs. A-B.  Other noteworthy
vehicles include four 2023 Ford E-Transit cargo vans, with projected selling
prices of $34,300 for VIN 1FTBW9CK9PKA26538 (“538 Van”), $34,400 for VIN 1FTBW9CK1PKA26579
(“579 Van”), $34,200 for VIN 1FTBW9CK0PKA26735 (“735 Van”), and $34,400 for VIN
IFTBW9CK1PKA27389 (“389 Van”).  Kayvon
Decl., ¶5, Exs. A-B.  The combined projected
selling price of these four Vans is $34,300 + $34,400 + $34,200 + $34,400 =
$137,300.
            The
projected selling price of nine 2023 Ford Transit T350 passenger wagons includes
$54,600 for 1FBAX2X87PKA16349 (“349 Wagon”), $52,400 for VIN 1FBAX9C86PKA16597
(“597 Wagon”), $52,100 for VIN 1FBAX2X80PKA15897 (“897 Wagon”), $53,300 for VIN
1FBAX9C81PKA15695 (“695 Wagon”), $47,300 for VIN 1FBAX2X81PKA15892 (“892
Wagon”), $29,800 for VIN 1FTBW9CK9NKA74991 (“991 Wagon”), $29,700 for VIN 1FTBW9CK1NKA75374
(“374 Wagon”), $52,100 for VIN 1FBAX9C85PKA15540 (“540 Wagon”), and $51,500 for
VIN 1FBAX2X82PKA16775 (“775 Wagon”).  Kayvon
Decl., ¶5, Exs. A-B.  The combined
projected selling price of these nine Wagons is $54,600 + $52,400 + $52,100 + $53,300
+ $47,300 + $29,800 + $29,700 + $52,100 + $51,500 = $422,800.
            Subtracting
the payoff amount from the projected selling price yields NFS’ equity in each vehicle.   Kayvon
Decl., ¶6, Ex. A.  The aggregate equity is
$2,146,300 - $1,964,759.68 = $181,540.32. 
Kayvon Decl., ¶¶ 6-7, Ex. A.  The
value of the collateral exceeds the amount owed.  Kayvon Decl., ¶7.
            Of
the 53 pieces of Equipment, two are in Borrowers’ possession, the status of
three is unknown, and NFS already has possession of the rest.  Kayvon Decl., ¶8, Ex. A.  NFS recently called about two pieces of
Equipment, one of which it had already repossessed, and one Borrowers have
since located.  Kayvon Decl., ¶8.  Defendants will continue to cooperate with
NFS.  Kayvon Decl., ¶8.  
 
            3.
Reply Evidence
            a.
Background
            On
June 7, 2010, NFS obtained its California finance lender’s license.  Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶18, Ex. 4.  It has since maintained this license, and the
license remains active.  Calumby Supp.
Decl., ¶18, Ex. 4.  
            On
January 1, 2022 and January 1, 2023, pursuant to Massachusetts General Law
chapter 271 section 49, NFS sent the Massachusetts Office of Attorney General
notice that it intended to engage in commercial lease and financing
transactions.  Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶16,
Ex. 3.  It warned that the finance
charges and expenses upon amounts financed could exceed 20% annually.  Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶16, Ex. 3.  NFS has since calculated the EFA’s effective
interest rate as 17% per year.  Calumby
Supp. Decl., ¶17.
 
            b.
Damages
            NFS’s
ledger shows that November 2023 was the last month for which Defendants paid
amounts due.  Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶13,
Ex. 2.  Between the outstanding balance
in November 2023 and the amount due every month from December 2023 to February
2024, the amount past due is $134,557.83 for Schedule 1 and $240,218.17 for
Schedule 2, or $374,776 total.  Calumby
Supp. Decl., ¶13(a), Ex. 2.  
            Interest
on the amounts past due at 1.5% per month totals $3,574.27 under Schedule 1 and
$6,380.94 under Schedule 2, for a total of $9,955.21.  Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶13(b), Ex. 2.
            The
EFA lists late charges of $250 per late payment.  Calumby
Supp. Decl., ¶13(c), Ex. 2.  As payment
under each Schedule per month is separate, late fees total $1,000 per Schedule
for the four months, or $2,000.  Calumby
Supp. Decl., ¶13(c), Ex. 2.  
            The
remaining future payments total $1,052,752.02 under Schedule 1 and $1,987,030.39
under Schedule 2, or $3,039,782.41 total. 
Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶13(d), Ex. 2. 
Discounting these at a 5% annual rate (Calumby Decl., ¶13, Ex. A ¶¶ 6,
8) decreases the present value by $136,177.46. 
Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶13(e), Ex. 2. 

            Each
Schedule (Calumby Decl., Ex. A) also required advance payment of $90,419.58
under Schedule 1 and $161,420.79 under Schedule 2.  Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶13(f), Ex. 2.  NFS credited this $251,840.37 against the amounts
owed.  Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶13(f), Ex. 2.  
            NFS
has received $52,500 in insurance proceeds from the loss of one of the 53
pieces of Equipment.  Calumby Supp.
Decl., ¶13(h), Ex. 2.  NFS has recovered
50 of the other 52 vehicles and incurred $30,250 in repossession fees to do so.  Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶9, Exs. 1-2.  
            NFS’s
damages total $374,776 + $9,955.21 + $2,000 + $3,039,782.41 - $136,177.46 - $251,840.37
- $52,500  = $2,985,995.79 before repossession
of the collateral and $2,985,995.79 + $30,250 = $3,016,245.79 before sale of
the 52 surviving pieces of Equipment.  Calumby
Supp. Decl., ¶12.
            NFS
sold 34 of the 50 recovered pieces of Equipment.  Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶7.  Its spreadsheets show that the total net sales
are $1,371,589.  Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶7,
Ex. 1.  This has reduced the amount owed
to $3,016,245.79 - $1,371,589 = $1,644,656.79. 
Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶12, Ex. 2.
            NFS
is waiting to receive an additional $140,910 in proceeds from sales of three of
the 34 pieces of Equipment sold thus far. 
Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶7, Ex. 1.  
            NFS
has recovered 13 vehicles not yet sold.  Calumby
Supp. Decl., ¶8, Ex. 1.  Based on their
current condition, NFS estimates that it can sell the 538 Van, 579 Van, 735
Van, and 389 Van for $35,898.44 each.  Calumby
Supp. Decl., ¶8, Ex. 1.  It can also sell
the 349 Wagon, 597 Wagon, 897 Wagon, 695 Wagon, 892 Wagon, 991 Wagon, 374
Wagon, 540 Wagon, and 775 Wagon for $51,253.17 each.  Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶8, Ex. 1.  The total revenue from future sales should be
($35,898.44 x 4) + ($51,253.17 x 9) = $143,593.76 + $461,278.53 = $604,872.29.  Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶8, Ex. 1.
            If
NFS receives the anticipated additional proceeds from Equipment sold and not
yet sold but in its possession, its damages would be reduced to $1,644,656.79 -
$140,910 - $604,872.29 = $898,874.50.  Calumby
Supp. Decl., ¶15, Ex. 2.
            The
two vehicles not yet recovered are both 2023 Ford Transit T350 passenger wagons.  Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶10, Ex. 1.  If NFS recovers them in the same condition as
the others, it estimates it can sell them for $51,253.17 each, or
$102,506.34.  Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶10,
Ex. 1.  
 
            D. Analysis
            NFS
applies for right to attach orders against Borrowers and
Guarantors in the amount of $2,968,390.42.
 
            1.
A Claim Based on a
Contract and on Which Attachment May Be Based
            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).
            NFS
claim against Borrowers for $2,968,390.42 is based on a breach of the EFA.  Calumby Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  The claim against Guarantors is based on the
Guaranties to the EFA.  Calumby Decl., Exs.
C-E.  NFS has contract claims on which to
base attachment.
 
            2. An Amount Due That is Fixed
and Readily Ascertainable 
            A
claim is “readily ascertainable” where the damages may be readily ascertained by
reference to the contract and the basis of the calculation appears to be
reasonable and definite.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537,
540-41.  The fact that the damages are
unliquidated is not determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a standard by
which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by which the
damages can be determined by proof.  Id.
(citations omitted).
            The
Schedules to the EFA outline the payment owed each month over the course of
four years.  Calumby Decl., ¶¶ 8-9, Ex.
A.  Any late payment under either
Schedule would accrue a $250 late charge plus interest at a Late Payment Rate
of 1.5% per month.  Calumby Decl., ¶6,
Ex. A, ¶¶ 2, 14.  
            Upon
an Event of Default, NFS could repossess the collateral and declare all
outstanding balances immediately due and payable.  Calumby Decl., ¶13, Ex. A ¶8.  This includes the “Present Value” of all
future payments, defined as the payment amount discounted at a 5% annual
rate.   Calumby Decl., ¶13, Ex. A ¶¶ 6,
8.  Borrowers would also be responsible
for any costs and expenses incurred to repossess, store, repair, sell, or lease
the Equipment.  Calumby Decl., ¶13, Ex. A
¶8.  Under Paragraph 3 of the Multiple
Borrower Addendum, any event of default by one Borrower would entitle NFS to
exercise rights and remedies against all borrowers.  Calumby Decl., ¶14, Ex. A.  
            Under
the Guaranties, Guarantors are jointly and severally liable for all amounts
owed under the EFAs after five days’ notice of payment due.  Calumby Decl., ¶¶ 15, 17, Exs. C-E.  Guarantors waived any right to require NFS to
proceed against Borrowers before proceeding against them.  Calumby Decl., ¶18, Exs. C-E.  
 
            a.
Damages Before Sale of Equipment
            The
November 10, 2023 Notice of Default asserted that Borrowers failed to pay
$104,187.35 that had become past due under the Schedules on November 1.  Calumby Decl., ¶25, Ex. G.  Borrowers had five days to pay $105,156.19,
which reflected fees added to the $104,187.35 owed, plus $52.09 for each day
subsequent to the Notice of Default.  Calumby
Decl., ¶25, Ex. G.  
            NFS
asserts that because Borrowers failed to repay the amount owed under the EFA,
it has exercised its right to declare all outstanding amounts owed immediately
due and payable.   Calumby Decl., ¶27.  NFS has subtracted the present value discount
of accelerated payments, advances paid on those amounts, and loss insurance
proceeds received from all amounts past due and remaining under the EFA.  Calumby Decl., ¶28.  The total owed before collection costs in
this action and accruing interest is $2,968,390.42.  Calumby Decl., ¶28.  Under the Guaranties, Guarantors are jointly
and severally responsible for this amount. 
Calumby Decl., ¶¶ 29-32.  
            Strict
compliance is required with statutory requirements for affidavits for
attachment.  Anaheim National Bank v.
Kraemer, (1932) 120 Cal.App. 63, 65. 
All documentary evidence, including contracts and canceled checks, must
be presented in admissible form, and admissibility as nonhearsay evidence or
exception to the hearsay rule, such as the business records exception.  Pos-A-Traction, Inc., v.
Kepplly-Springfield Tire Co., (C.D. Cal. 2000) 112 F.Supp.2d, 1178,
1182.  For business records, evidence
should be presented to establish that the record was made in the regular course
of business, at or near the time of the act or event, and the custodian of
records or other qualified witness must identify the record and its mode of
preparation, as well as the sources of information and method and time of
preparation.  Id.
            NFS’s
moving papers included no payment history showing that Borrowers failed to pay
amounts past due or owe the amount claimed. 
This is particularly important when, as here, the amount due each month
varied under the Schedules and NFS admits that Borrowers made some advance
payments.  Calumby Decl., ¶¶ 8-9, 28, Ex.
A.  Defendants argue in opposition that this
presentation is too conclusory to warrant a right to attach order.  Opp. at 3.
            The
calculations Defendants offer in opposition are even more speculative.  Kayvon Decl., Ex. A.  Defendants assert that their calculations began
with the original purchase price paid and the original loan amount from NFS for
each Vehicle.  Kayvon Decl., ¶3, Ex.
A.  However, neither matches the terms of
the EFA.  For example, Defendants assert the
75374 Vehicle’s original purchase price was $48,597.62, and its original loan
amount was $43,217.11.  Kayvon Decl., ¶3,
Ex. A.  Schedule 1 lists the original
price as $49,465.37, which does not match either amount.  Calumby Decl., ¶¶ 8-9, Ex. A.
            Defendants
then assert an “FP&A” person has calculated loan payoff amounts for each piece
of Equipment, totaling $1,964,759.68. 
Kayvon Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.   They
provide no explanation of how this person calculated the payoff amount, except
to say it may include $10,000 per vehicle in early pay-off fees.  Kayvon Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  Nothing explains how these payoff amounts are
ascertainable from the EFA.
            NFS
attempts to remedy its evidentiary defects in reply.  Its ledger shows the amounts Defendants have paid,
including a partial payment in November 2023 for each Schedule.  Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶13(a), Ex. 2.  The ledger calculates that Defendants owe
$374,776 in payments past due, $9,955.21 in interest for those payments, $2,000
in administrative late fees, and $3,039,782.41 in future payments less $136,177.46
based on a 5% annual discount rate. 
Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶¶ 13(a)-(e), Ex. 2.  
            NFS
also credits $251,840.37 in advance payments and $52,500 in insurance proceeds
from the loss of one of the 53 pieces of Equipment.  Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶¶ 13(f), (h), Ex.
2.  It 
also asserts $30,250 in repossession fees for 50 of the other 52.  Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶9, Ex. 2.  Damages total $374,776 + $9,955.21 + $2,000 +
$3,039,782.41 - $136,177.46 - $251,840.37 - $52,500 = $2,985,995.79 before
repossession of collateral and $2,985,995.79 + $30,250 = $3,016,245.79 before
sale of the 52 surviving pieces of equipment. 
Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶12.
            The
reply evidence is an improvement if not necessarily sufficiently detailed about
the calculations.  In any event, NFS
cannot use its reply brief to cure the failure in its moving papers to provide
sufficient payment history and accounting of the amount owed.  NFS failed to meet its burden of showing
readily ascertainable damages.  
            
            b.
Sale of the Vehicles
            The
amount to attach must be reduced by, inter alia, the value of any
security interest in the property of the defendant held by the plaintiff,
together with the amount by which the acts of the plaintiff (or a prior holder
of the security interest) have decreased that security interest’s value. CCP
§483.015(b)(4).
            The
EFA granted NFS a security interest in the Equipment as well as Borrowers’
inventory, accessories, parts, attachments, improvements, accessions,
replacements, substitutions, additions and proceeds therefrom or thereto.  Calumby Decl., ¶10, Ex. A ¶1.  NFS perfected this security interest when it
filed UCC-1 financing statements and amendments with the Office of the
Secretary of State of Delaware.  Calumby
Decl., ¶11, Ex. B.  NFS does not dispute
that the proceeds from the sale of this collateral should reduce the amount
Defendants owe.    
            NFS
admits it has repossessed 50 pieces (Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶9, Ex. 1) and
received an insurance payout from the destruction of one of the others.  It lists the actual sale price for 37 pieces
it has already sold.  Calumby Supp.
Decl., Ex. 1.  NFS asserts it has received
$1,371,589 from those sales thus far, will receive another $140,910 from three
of them, and estimates another $604,872.26 in sales of the 13 remaining vehicles
in its possession.  Calumby Supp. Decl.,
¶¶ 7-8, Ex. 1.  
            NFS
asks the court to reduce the ascertainable damages only by the $1,371,589 it
has already received, arguing that market conditions could change or the unsold
Equipment could be destroyed or stolen. 
Reply at 7.  A greater reduction
in damages could leave NFS under secured even after a right to attach order is
granted.  Id.
            NFS’
argument has merit only as to the two vehicles NFS has yet to repossess.  But otherwise, CCP section 483.015(b)(4) requires
that the amount to attach must be reduced by the value of any security interest
in the defendant’s property held by the plaintiff.  NFS has possession of 13 unsold vehicles, and
their value must be subtracted from the attachment amount.  NFS estimates a sale price of $35,898.44 each
of the four unsold Vans and $51,253.17 each for nine unsold Wagons, a  total of $604,872.29.  Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶8, Ex. 1.  
            Again,
this information was presented for the first time in reply, and NFS failed to
give Defendants an opportunity to disagree. 
It also would be better if NFS seeks attachment after actual sales of
the remaining vehicles rather than estimated sale prices.
 
            3. Probability of Success
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            On
November 29, 2022, Borrowers and NFS entered the MFA, under which NFS financed Borrowers’
acquisition and refinancing of various pieces of Equipment.  Calumby Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  Two Schedules outlined the payments due
across 48 months and described the Equipment and other collateral securing the
financing.  EFA.  Calumby Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.
              An Event of Default under the EFA includes
(a) failure to make any payment with respect to any agreement or obligation
when due; (b) any event or condition which after notice, lapse of time, or both
would constitute an event of default or permit acceleration of any obligation;
and (k) the default of any Borrower or Guarantor in an amount totaling $50,000
across all instances.  Calumby Decl., ¶12,
Ex. A ¶7.  Upon an Event of Default, NFS
could repossess the collateral and declare all outstanding balances immediately
due and payable.  Calumby Decl., ¶13, Ex.
A ¶8.  Under Paragraph 3 of the Multiple
Borrower Addendum, any event of default by one Borrower would entitle NFS to
exercise rights and remedies against all borrowers.  Calumby Decl., ¶14, Ex. A.
            On
the same day, Guarantors signed the Guaranties that they would be jointly and
severally liable for all amounts owed under the EFAs after five days’ notice of
payment due.  Calumby Decl., ¶¶ 15, 17,
Exs. C-E.  Guarantors waived any right to
require NFS to proceed against Borrowers before proceeding against them.  Calumby Decl., ¶18, Exs. C-E.
            On
November 10, 2023 NFS sent Defendants a Notice of Default for $104,187.35 past
due as of November 1, 2023.  Calumby Decl.,
¶25, Ex. G.  The notice gave them five
days to pay this amount, plus flat fees and $52.09 in additional fees for each
day subsequent to the Notice of Default. 
Calumby Decl., ¶25, Ex. G.  To
date, Borrowers have failed to repay the amount owed under the EFA or to return
the Equipment.  Calumby Decl., ¶26.  
 
            (1).
Unconscionability
            A
contract is unconscionable if one of the parties lacked a
meaningful choice in deciding whether to agree and the contract contains terms
that are unreasonably favorable to the other party.  OTO, LLC. v. Kho,
(2019) 8 Cal.5th 111, 125.  Under this standard, the unconscionability doctrine
has both a procedural and a substantive element.  The procedural element
addresses the circumstances of contract negotiation and formation, focusing on
oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power, while the substantive
element pertains to the fairness of an agreement’s actual terms, and to
assessments of whether they are overly harsh or one-sided.  Ibid. 
Procedural and substantive unconscionability are
evaluated on a sliding scale: the more substantively oppressive the contract
term, the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is
required to conclude that the term is unenforceable.  Conversely, the more
deceptive or coercive the bargaining tactics employed, the less substantive
unfairness is required.  Id. at 125-26.  The ultimate issue in
every case is whether the terms of the contract are sufficiently unfair, in
view of all relevant circumstances, that a court should withhold
enforcement.  Id. at 126. 
            Without
any analysis, Defendants note that their Answers have asserted parts of the
contract are unenforceable based on unconscionability.  Opp. at 3. 
They cite Civil Code section 1671(b), which prohibits contract
provisions that liquidate the damages of a breach when the provision was
unreasonable under the circumstances existing at the time the contract was
made.  Defendants also cite Honchariw
v. FJM Private Mortgage Fund, LLC (2022), 83 Cal. App. 5th 893, 902-903,
which held that a contract provision imposes a penalty and is therefore
unenforceable if it assesses amounts disproportionate to the anticipated
damages.  Opp. at 3.
            The
court need not discuss this issue in detail. 
If a defendant seeks to reduce damages based on an affirmative defense (CCP
§483.015(b)), he or she must make a prima facie showing of
a probability of success on that argument. 
Defendants’ failure to provide substantive legal analysis why any of the
EFA’s provisions for damages is a penalty or unconscionable waives the
argument.  See Reply at 3.
 
            (2).
Usury
            Under
the EFA, the failure to make a payment within five days of the due date would incur
interest at a Late Payment Rate of 1.5% per month, or 18% annually.  Calumby Decl., ¶6, Ex. A, ¶¶ 2, 14.  Defendants assert that this interest rate is
usurious.  Opp. at 3.
            The
EFA is governed by Massachusetts law. 
Calumby Decl., ¶5, Ex. A, ¶17.  Criminal
usury thereunder is defined as charging interest and expenses exceeding an
aggregate 20% annual rate on sums loaned. 
ALM GL ch. 271, §49(a).  This does
not apply if the person notifies the attorney general of his intent to engage
in a transaction or transactions which would otherwise be usurious.  ALM GL ch. 271, §49(d).  
            An
interest rate of 18% is not usurious under Massachusetts law.  Assuming arguendo that it is, NFS
presents evidence that it warned the Massachusetts Office of Attorney General that
finance charges and expenses upon amounts financed under the EFA could exceed
20% annually.  Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶16,
Ex. 3.  The EFA’s effective
interest rate of 17% per year is not usurious. 
See Calumby Supp. Decl., ¶17.
            NFS
has demonstrated a probability of success on the merits.
 
            4.
Attachment Based on Commercial Claim
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson, (“Kadison”)
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            These terms “trade,”
“business,” and “profession” encompass almost any activity engaged in for
profit with “frequency and continuity.”  Advance
Transformer Co. v. Superior Court, (1974) 44 Cal.App.3d 127, 139. 
The purpose of the attachment statutes is to confine attachment to
commercial situations and prohibit their use in consumer transactions.  Kadison, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d
at 4.
            The Personal
Guaranties of the Marashi Defendants affirm that they both have a personal ownership
interest in Borrowers.  Calumby Decl.,
¶16, Exs. C-D.  The claim against the Marashi Defendants is a commercial claim.
            
            5.
Description of Property to be Attached
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268. The requirement of
specificity avoids unnecessary hearings where an individual defendant is
willing to concede that the described property is subject to attachment.  Ibid. 
A general list of categories - e.g., “real property, personal
property, equipment, motor vehicles, chattel paper, negotiable and other
instruments, securities, deposit accounts, safe-deposit boxes, accounts
receivable, general intangibles, property subject to pending actions, final money
judgments, and personal property in decedents’ estates” – is sufficient.  Ibid. 
            NFS
seeks to attach the Marashi Defendants’ interest in real property except
leasehold estates with unexpired terms of less than one year; accounts
receivable, chattel paper, and general intangibles arising out of the conduct
of a business or  profession, except any
such individual claim with a principal balance of less than $150; equipment;
farm products; inventory; final money judgments arising out of conduct of a
business or profession; money on the premises of such a business or profession,
less the first $1,000 in aggregate; negotiable documents of title and other
instruments; securities; and minerals.  The
description of attachable property is adequate.
 
6. Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose 
            Attachment
must not be sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon
which attachment is based.  CCP §484.090(a)(3).  NFS seeks attachment for a proper purpose.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The
applications for right to attach orders are denied.  NFS may renew the application after selling
the remaining 13 vehicles by presenting detailed evidence of the payment
history and amounts owed.  If NFS does
renew, it must comply with the requirements of CCP section 1008(b), with the
exception of a showing why it could not have presented this information in the
exercise of due diligence.
