The court has ruled in favor of the defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint. The cross-complaint seeks indemnity, equitable indemnity, apportionment of fault, and declaratory relief against Albertson's, which is alleged to have had a duty to maintain the parking lot where the accident occurred. The court found that the proposed cross-complaint arises out of the same set of facts as the plaintiff's complaint and that the defendant acted promptly and diligently. The court granted the motion, allowing the defendant to file the proposed cross-complaint within 10 days of the hearing and to serve the cross-defendant promptly.
