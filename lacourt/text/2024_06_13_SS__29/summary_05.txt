This tentative ruling by the Judge addresses the petitions for approval of minor's compromise and person with disability's compromise. The Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call. The Court reviewed the petitions and proposed orders, identifying certain issues that needed to be addressed. Since the last hearing, the Petitioner has submitted new proposed orders that fully address the outstanding issues. The Court finds the settlements and requested fees and expenses fair and reasonable. The Court grants and approves the petitions for minor's compromise and person with disability's compromise. An OSC (Order to Show Cause) is set for a future date to allow the Petitioner to remedy certain deficiencies.
