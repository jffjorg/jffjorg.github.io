 Case Number:  22STCV35872    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the  alternative, Summary Adjudication filed by Defendant Pacific Steel Group TENTATIVE Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication of the
First Cause of Action (negligence) is denied.Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication of the
Second Cause of Action (premises liability) is granted.Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is
denied. BackgroundPlaintiff
Kenneth Willoughby (“Plaintiff”) alleges that he was injured in a workplace
accident on February 18, 2022, at a construction project at Belvedere Middle
School on Record Avenue in Los Angeles. Plaintiff
filed the Complaint in this action on November 14, 2022. In the Complaint,
Plaintiff asserts causes of action for negligence and premises liability
against Defendants Hensel Phelps Development, L.L.C.; PSG Construction, LLC;
and Does 1 through 50. Plaintiff states in the Complaint (among other things)
that that “while walking through an area open to all workers on the jobsite,”
he fell “at a place he was directed to walk by Defendants and suffered severe
personal injuries.” (Complaint, at p. 4.) Plaintiff was not employed by the
defendants in this action. (Ibid.)Subsequently:
(1) Plaintiff amended his complaint to name Pacific Steel Group (“PSG”) as Doe
1; (2) Plaintiff amended his complaint to name Hensel Phelps Construction Co. (“HP”)
as Doe 2; and (3) the Court, at Plaintiff’s request, dismissed without
prejudice all claims against the original named defendants, Hensel Phelps
Development, L.L.C. and PSG Construction, LLC.PSG
and HP filed Answers to the Complaint in February and March 2023.On January 25, 2024, PSG filed this motion for summary judgment or, in
the alternative, for summary adjudication. Plaintiff filed an opposition on May
29.  PSG filed a reply, along with
objections to some of Plaintiff’s evidence, on June 7.Legal Standard“The purpose
of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381-382.)As to each
cause of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary
judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by
presenting facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ...
cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the cause
of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has met
that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show that
a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action
or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)The party
opposing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply
“rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set
forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)Objections to EvidencePSG asserts a total of 15 objections: Objections
Nos. 1-7 to the declaration of Rodriguez Robinson and Objections Nos. 8-15 to
the declaration of Charles Craig.Evidence presented in support of, or
in opposition to, a motion for summary judgment must be admissible. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (d); Perry
v. Bakewell Hawthorne LLC
(2017) 2 Cal.5th 536, 541-43.) The court must “consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers,
except the evidence to which objections have been made and sustained.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)The Court SUSTAINS Objection No. 3 (lacks foundation, lacks
personal knowledge, hearsay).The Court also SUSTAINS Objection No. 4 in
part, as to the phrase “that caused the accident” (lacks foundation, lacks
personal knowledge, improper opinion testimony)The Court OVERRULES PSG’s other objections.DiscussionPlaintiff was injured while working on a
construction project at the Belvedere Middle School in Los Angeles.  (Defendant’s Statement of Undisputed Material
Facts [“DSUMF”], No. 1.)  HP was the
general contractor for the project. 
(DSUMF, Nos. 9-10; Plaintiff’s Statement of Additional Material Facts
[“PSAMF”], Nos. 1-2.)  The accident
occurred in the locker room area of Building C. 
(DSUMF, No. 8.)HP and PSG entered into a contract for PSG
to provide and place rebar on the project. 
(DSUMF, Nos. 7-8.)  HP also entered into a separate subcontract
with Maya Steel Fabrications, Inc. (“Maya”) to fabricate and install structural
steel for the project.  (DSUMF, No. 11;
PSAMF, No. 3.)  The contract between HP
and Maya required Maya to comply with all laws and regulations, including safety
laws and regulations and OSHA standards. 
(DSUMF, Nos. 12-17.)  At the time
of the accident, Plaintiff was working for Maya.  (DSUMF, Nos. 32-33.)PSG supplied and placed rebar in the
flooring in the locker room area of Building C before HP poured concrete.  (DSUMF, No. 19.)  PSG followed the design of the project and
installed the rebar to be configured so that it protruded approximately one
inch to three inches above the level of the flooring and then turned at a 90
degree angle so that it was parallel to the flooring, rather than perpendicular
to it.  (DSUMF, Nos. 21-22; Bell Decl.,
Exh. 2 (“Dirvin Depo.”), at 17:20-24, 28:11-29:11.)PSG also installed mesh to provide
additional support for the concrete when it was poured.  (PSAMF, No. 11; Dirvin Depo. at 30:2-15,
52:12-15.)  The plan called for the mesh
to be placed underneath the Z-bar, but the mesh was placed over the top of the
Z-bar.  (PSAMF, No. 15; Dirvin Depo. at
48:8-19.)  Although the mesh was supposed
to extend over the entire length of the pad, at some point it became dislodged
or “jumbled up.”  (Dirvin Depo., at
30:16-31:5.)  PSG completed its rebar work in the locker
room area of Building C on January 24, 2022. 
(Pennington Decl., ¶ 4.)  By mid
February, the rebar was installed and the concrete had been poured in the area,
and Maya began its work.  (DSUMF, Nos.
20, 24.)  No PSG employees were present
or working in the area on February 18, 2022, the date of the accident.  (Pennington Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.)The accident occurred when Plaintiff
tripped over rebar that was sticking out into the walk path.  (PSAMF, No. 18.)After the accident, HP “picked up loose
rebar that had been either damaged or displaced from the area.”  (Dirvin Depo. at 65:2-8; see also PSAMF, No.
12; Robinson Decl., ¶ 9.)There is a dispute in the evidence
regarding whether the exposed rebar installed by PSG was visible or
hidden.  PSG’s General Field
Superintendent, Clint Pennington, testified that as of the time that PSG
finished its work in the area (more than three weeks before the accident), the
exposed rebar was “not hidden in any way” and was “visible to anybody who
looked at the flooring.”  (Pennington
Decl., ¶ 8.)  Maya’s job steward,
Rodriguez Robinson, testified that the rebar had become “dislodged,” that the
“mesh and rebar” were “sticking up in an unusual way,” and that “it was hard to
see it when exiting and entering the building.” 
(Robinson Decl., ¶ 7.)  On these facts, Plaintiff asserts two causes
of action against PSG in the complaint: for negligence (the First Cause of
Action) and for premises liability (the Second Cause of Action). The basic
elements of a cause of action for negligence and for premises liability are the
same: (1) the existence of a legal duty; (2) breach of that duty; (3)
causation; and (4) resulting damages. (Brown v. USA Taekwondo
(2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213; Kesner v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th
1132, 1158; Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.) PSG argues that is entitled to summary
judgment, or in the alternative summary adjudication, on the following grounds:
(1) PSG did not own or control the premises at the time of Plaintiff’s
accident; (2) no act or omission of PSG caused or contributed to Plaintiff’s
injury; (3) there was no dangerous
condition; and (4) any dangerous condition was open and obvious.Control of PremisesPSG’s first argument is that it did not own,
possess, or control the site of Plaintiff’s accident.  (Mem. at pp. 14-16.)  Before addressing this argument, the Court
considers an antecedent issue: whether ownership, possession, or control
matters for, or is material to, Plaintiff’s causes of action.  The short answer is both yes and no.Plaintiff asserts two causes of action against PSG,
for premises liability and negligence. 
Although, as noted above, the elements of the two causes of action are
the same, that does not mean that they are identical or duplicate causes of
action.  In particular, although the
element of duty is part of each cause of action, the scope and nature of the
duty is not identical.In a negligence cause of action, the general
rule governing
duty is set forth in Civil Code section 1714: “Everyone is responsible, not
only for the result of his or her willful acts, but also for an injury
occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or skill in the
management of his or her property or person, except so far as the latter has,
willfully or by want of ordinary care, brought the injury upon himself or
herself.” (Civ. Code, § 1714, subd. (a).) This establishes what the California
Supreme Court has described as the “default rule” that every person has a legal
duty “to exercise, in his or her activities, reasonable care for the safety of
others.” (Brown, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 214.)  This general duty to exercise reasonable care
in one’s own activities applies universally, not just on the defendant’s property.
 For example, a person who drives
negligently is liable for injuries proximately caused by that negligent
driving, regardless of whether the negligent driving occurred on private land
owned by the driver or on a public road. 
Thus, in a general negligence cause of action, ownership or control of
the premises or other location at which the accident occurred is not material.But premises liability is
different.  Although “duty” is an
element of a premises liability cause of action just as it is for a negligence
cause of action, the nature and scope of the duty in a premises liability cause
of action is different.  Those who own,
possess, or control property generally have a duty to exercise ordinary care in
managing the property to avoid exposing others to an unreasonable risk of harm.
(Ortega
v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1200, 1205; Alcaraz v. Vece (1997) 14 Cal.4th
1149, 1159-1163, 1170-1171; Annocki¿v. Peterson Enterprises, LLC¿(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32, 37.) If a dangerous condition exists, the
property owner (or a non-owner who exercises possession of or control over the
property) is “under a duty to exercise ordinary care either to make the
condition reasonably safe … or to give a warning adequate to enable [others] to
avoid the harm.” (Bridgman v. Safeway Stores, Inc. (1960) 53 Cal.2d 443,
446; accord Alcaraz, supra, at pp. 1170-1171.)  The law is also
clear, however, that “[a] defendant cannot be held liable for the
defective or dangerous condition of property which it did not own, possess, or
control. (Isaacs v. Huntington Memorial Hospital (1985) 38 Cal.3d 112,
134; accord Gray v. America West
Airlines, Inc. (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 76,
81.)  Plaintiff cites no authority
(and the Court is aware of none) standing for the proposition that premises
liability can extend to a person or entity that does not own, does not possess,
or does not control the premises at the time of the accident.  In a premises liability cause of action (in
contrast to a negligence cause of action), ownership, possession, or control is
material to the issue of duty.Here, PSG has shown, with admissible evidence, that it had completed its
work at the site of the accident (in
the locker room area of Building C) by January 24, 2022, more than three weeks
before the accident.  (Pennington Decl.,
¶ 4.)  No PSG employees were present, were
working in, or were exercising control over the area on February 18, 2022, the
date of the accident.  (Id., ¶¶ 4-5.)  With this evidence, PSG has met its initial
burden on summary judgment or summary adjudication of showing that Plaintiff
cannot establish duty, one of the elements of his premises liability cause of
action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)This shifts
the burden to Plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists” as to the element of duty element.  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff has not done so.  Thus, the
undisputed evidence in the record shows that PSG did not own, possess, or
control the accident site at the time of the accident.  In the absence of such ownership, possession,
or control, PSG had as a matter of law no duty to maintain the accident site in
a reasonably safe condition or warn Plaintiff or others of any dangerous
condition at the site as of the time of the accident.  Accordingly, summary adjudication of the
premises liability cause of action (only) in favor of PSG is granted.  As noted
above, the absence of ownership, possession, or control is not material to the
negligence cause of action.  PSG had a
general duty to exercise reasonable care in its activities, regardless of
whether it retained control over the accident site.Dangerous Condition and Causation Next, PSG argues that there was no dangerous
condition present (Mem. at pp. 17-18) and that that no act or omission by PSG caused
or contributed to Plaintiff’s injuries (Mem. at pp. 16-17).  The existence of a dangerous condition and causation
are commonly questions of fact for the jury but, like any other question of
fact, they can become issues of law where the evidence is so one-sided that there
is only one determination that a jury could reasonably make.  (See Mitchell v. Gonzales (1991) 54
Cal.3d 1041, 1052.)Here, however, the evidence is in dispute.  Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence
to create a triable issue on whether PSG’s actions (or inactions) created a
dangerous condition at the site of the accident (a tripping hazard from exposed
or improperly secured rebar and mesh which became dislodged, and on which
Plaintiff actually tripped).  (DSUMF, Nos. 21-22; PSAMF, Nos. 11-12, 18; Dirvin
Depo., at 17:20-24, 28:11-29:11, 30:2-31:5, 48:8-19, 52:12-15, 65:2-8; Robinson
Decl., ¶ 9.)Open and ObviousFinally,
PSG argues that any dangerous condition was open and obvious.  (Mem. at pp. 18-19.)  In some cases, a dangerous condition may be so obvious that the
condition itself serves as a warning, and the landowner may have no further
duty to remedy or warn of the condition. (See Kinsman v. Unocal Corp. (2005) 37
Cal.4th 659, 672-73;
Montes v.
YMCA of Glendale
(2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 1134, 1142; Christoff v. Union Pacific Railroad Co. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 118,
126; Krongos v. Pacific Gas Electric Co. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 387, 393.)PSG does not, however, present any evidence
regarding the condition of the site on the day of the accident.  Rather, PSG’s evidence relates to the
condition of the site at the time PSG completed its work, several weeks before
the accident.  (Pennington Decl., ¶ 8.)  But part of Plaintiff’s argument is that PSG
did not adequately perform its work, causing the mesh to become dislodged in
the weeks between the completion of the PSG’s work and the accident.Moreover, and independently, Plaintiff has
presented sufficient evidence to create a triable issue on whether the allegedly
dangerous condition was open and visible and whether it was located in a place that
Plaintiff necessarily needed to encounter to enter and exit the work space.  (PSAMF,
No. 18; Robinson Decl., ¶ 7.)ConclusionThe Court GRANTS PSG’s motion for summary
adjudication of the Second Cause of Action (premises liability).The Court DENIES PSG’s motion for summary
adjudication of the First Cause of Action (negligence), for the reasons set
forth above.The Court DENIES PSG’s motion for summary
judgment.Moving
Party is to give notice.
