 Case Number:  22STCV33224    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  29 Petitions for
Approval of Minor’s Compromise for Amado Ruiz (Age 10), Annaleia Huertas (Age
4), and Annarae Huertas (Age 3)
 
Tentative:  
The Court excuses the personal
appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by
telephone or video conference call.  
The hearings on these petitions
are continued so that Petitioner may address the issues identified in this order.
Background
This case arises out of a tragic incident
in which a three-year old child, Avanna Huertas (“Avanna”), died of drowning in
a swimming pool on July 21, 2021, while under the care and custody of the
defendants.
On October 11, 2022, Plaintiffs
Brianna Torrez, Joseph Huertas, Amado Ruiz (a minor), Annaleia Huertas (a
minor), and Annarae Huertas (a minor) (“Plaintiffs”) filed this lawsuit.  The Plaintiffs are Avanna’s parents and siblings.  The Defendants identified in the complaint
are County of Los Angeles (“County”), McKinley Children’s Center, Maria Cabral,
Alfonso Cabral (collectively, “Defendants”), and Does 1 through 25.  Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)
against the same defendants on December 2, 2022.
On March 27 and April 3, 2023,
Defendants Maria Cabral, Alfonso Cabral, and McKinley Children’s Center, Inc.
(erroneously sued as McKinley Children’s Center) filed their answers to the
FAC.  County appeared and stipulated to a
continuance of the deadline to respond to the FAC and then to a stay.
On March 13, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed a Notice of Settlement of Entire Case.
On March 18, 2024, Petitioner
Brianna Torrez filed petitions for approval of minor’s compromises for each of
the three Plaintiffs who are children. 
On April 30, 2024, Petitioner filed the first supplement to the
petitions.  On June 5, 2024, Petitioner
filed second supplements to each of the petitions.  Petitioner has also submitted proposed
orders.
The hearing was initially set for
May 9, and was continued, on the Court’s own motion, to June 13, 2024.
Discussion
The proposed settlement involves a
total payment of $1.3 million by or on behalf of all Defendants.  (Petitions, Item 10.)  Plaintiffs’ counsel seeks payment of $432,900
in fees (33.3 percent of the gross settlement amount) and $3,447.15 in
costs.  (Petitions, Item 13.)  Plaintiff Brianna Torrez seeks to receive
$100,000 as her share of the settlement, and Plaintiff Joseph Huertas is waiving
any claim to any share of the settlement. 
(Petitions, Item 20; Attachment 13a(1), Beltran Decl. (“Beltran Decl.”),
¶¶ 23 & 24(a) & Exh. 1; Attachment 13a(2), Fink Decl. (“Fink Decl.”), ¶
18.)  
That leaves net settlement
proceeds of $763,652.85, which will be shared equally by the three minor
Plaintiffs.  (Beltran Decl., ¶ 23; Fink
Decl., at p. 6.)  Each minor plaintiff
will therefore receive net settlement proceeds of $254,550.95.  (Beltran Decl., ¶ 23; Fink Decl., at p. 6.)  
For Plaintiff Annaleia, there is a
Medi-Cal lien in the amount of $5,204.95 for services provided to
Annaleia.  (Ibid.; see also Annaleia
Petition, Item 12b(4)(c) and Attachment 12b(4)(c).)  Petitioner proposes that the balance of the
settlement proceeds, or $249,346.00, be used to purchase an annuity for
Annaleia.  (Petitions, Attachment 13a(1),
Beltran Decl., ¶ 24(b).)
For Amado and Annarae, a Medi-Cal
lien is expected but the amount is unknown. 
(Beltran Decl., ¶ 23; Fink Decl., at p. 6.)  Petitioner, apparently assuming that the
amount of the Medi-Cal liens will be $0, proposes that $254,550.95 be used to
purchase an annuity for Amado and that $254,550.95 be used to purchase an annuity
for Annarae. (Beltran Decl., ¶ 24 (c) & (e); Fink Decl., at p. 6.)  
For each of the three children, Petitioner
proposes that the distributions from each annuity be paid into a Special Needs
Trust established for each child.
The Court will address separately
(1) the petitions for approval of the terms of the compromises and (2) the
unique issues that arise in connection with the establishment of special needs
trusts.
Petitions for Approval of Minor’s
Compromises
The Court has reviewed each of the
Petitions and proposed orders.  Before
the Court can grant the petitions, the following issues must be addressed.
No. 1.  All three Petitions, Item 10.  In all three Petitions, this item is not
completed correctly.  Item 10 requires Petitioner
to identify the amount offered to settle the claim of the claimant.  The settlement amount listed, however, is the
total amount offered by all Defendants to settle the claims of the claimant, the
claimant’s two siblings, the claimant’s mother, and Plaintiff Joseph Huertas
(who, the Court understands, is the father of two of the three minor claimants).
No. 2.  All three Petitions, Item 11.  In all three Petitions, this item is not
completed correctly.  Item 11a is
checked, but the proposed settlement involves payments to persons other than
each claimant (the claimant’s two siblings plus the claimant’s mother).  Item 11b must be completed, along with all
appropriate subsections, and an Attachment 11b(6) is required.
No. 3.  Petitions for Amado and Annarae, Item 12b(4)
and 12b(5)(a)(i).  As noted above, the
attorney declarations indicate that a Medi-Cal lien is expected, but the amount
is unknown.  It is unclear to the Court
now it can approve the petitions, and order the distribution of net settlement
proceeds, when the lien amount (and therefore the amount of the net settlement
proceeds) is unknown.
No. 4.  All three Petitions, Items 13, 14, 15, and 16.  In all three Petitions, these items are not
completed correctly.  The items are completed
with regard to the aggregate settlement, not the settlement of the claimant’s
claim.
No. 5.  Petitions for Amado and Annarae, Items 18b(4)
and Item 19.  See Issue No. 3, above.
No. 6.  All three Petitions, revised Attachment
18b(3), submitted June 5, 2024.  The
attachment to each Petition contemplates a premium payment of $254,550.95 for each
annuity.  It is unclear whether that sum
will be available for an annuity on behalf of Amada and Arrarae after payment
of a Medi-Cal lien.  And that amount does
not appear to be available for an annuity on behalf of Annaleia.
No. 7.  All three proposed Orders (MC-351), Items 6,
8a (all subparts).  In all three proposed
Orders, these items are not completed correctly.  The orders are completed with regard to the
aggregate settlement, not the settlement of the claimant’s claim.
No. 8.  All three proposed Orders, revised Attachment
8b(2), submitted June 5, 2024.  The
attachment to each Order contemplates a premium payment of $254,550.95 for each
annuity.  It is unclear whether that sum
will be available for an annuity on behalf of Amada and Arrarae after payment
of a Medi-Cal lien.  And that amount does
not appear to be available for an annuity on behalf of Annaleia.
Request for Approval of Special
Needs Trust
When seeking approval of a special needs trust (SNT), notice of
the hearing and service of the petition must be made upon three state agencies
including the Dept. of Mental Health, Dept. of Developmental Services, and
Dept. of Health Care Services.  (Probate
Code sections 3602(f), 3611(c).). A proof of service indicates that service and
notice is complete.  
Petitioner proposes to create a SNT for each minor plaintiff but
use the entire net settlement proceeds for each to purchase an annuity that
would start paying into the SNT of each plaintiff at age 18.  There would be no funding of the SNTs until
annuity payments begin. 
The annuity for Annaleia would pay at:
·        
$30,000.00 payable annually, guaranteed for 4
year(s), starting on 8/13/2037, increasing by 3.00% compounded annually, with
the last guaranteed payment on 8/13/2040. 
·        
$40,000.00 is payable as a lump sum on
08/13/41. 
·        
$40,000.00 is payable as a lump sum on
08/13/2044. 
·        
$40,000.00 is payable as a lump sum on
08/13/2046. 
·        
$461,089.36 is payable as a lump sum on
08/13/2048.
The annuity for Annarae would pay at:
·        
$30,000.00 payable annually, guaranteed for 4
year(s), starting on 9/10/2038, increasing by 3.00% compounded annually, with
the last guaranteed payment on 9/10/2041. 
·        
$40,000.00 is payable as a lump sum on
09/10/2042. 
·        
$40,000.00 is payable as a lump sum on
09/10/2045. 
·        
$40,000.00 is payable as a lump sum on
09/10/2047. 
·        
$499,905.83 is payable as a lump sum on
09/10/2049.
The annuity for Amado would pay at:
·        
$30,000.00 payable annually, guaranteed for 4
year(s), starting 05/15/2031, increasing by 3.00% compounded annually, with the
last guaranteed payment on 05/15/2034. 
·        
$40,000.00 is payable as a lump sum on
05/15/2035. 
·        
$40,000.00 is payable as a lump sum on
05/15/2038. 
·        
$40,000.00 is payable as a lump sum on 05/15/2040.

·        
$246,706.22 is payable as a lump sum on
05/15/2042.
The three declarations filed on June 5, 2024 contain additional
details regarding the annuities and annuity companies.  
An SNT is used to receive the settlement funds in these situations
so that plaintiff does not lose benefits eligibility for Medi-Cal, SSI, and
other benefits.  Historically, a person
receiving Medi-Cal or SSI benefits could have only up to $2,000 in non-exempt
assets, and any additional non-exempt assets over $2,000 would cause the loss
of benefits eligibility under the relevant federal and state law.  Funds held in a valid SNT, however, are
exempt assets that do not count toward the $2,000 asset limit for purposes of
calculating benefits eligibility.  On
January 1, 2024, the Medi-Cal asset qualification limit was eliminated and
there is no longer a means test for Medi-Cal. 
The asset qualification for other benefits, like SSI, did not change and
therefore there might remain a reason for creation and funding of a SNT to
maintain other benefits.  
Trust Instruments
Petitioner provides the proposed trust instrument as part of the
proposed order attached to each petition at Exhibit 3.
The main requirements for court created or funded trusts are set
forth at California Rules of Court (CRC) rule 7.903(c) and LASC rule
4.116(b).  
The proposed trust instruments meet those requirements and are
ready for approval for creation and/or funding.
Findings
When approving the establishment or funding of a SNT from
settlement proceeds, the court must make certain findings pursuant to Probate
Code section 3604(b).  Based on the facts
presented in the Petitions and the attachments, the Court finds:

The SNT beneficiary has a
     disability which substantially impairs the individual’s ability to provide
     for her own care or custody and constitutes a substantial handicap;
The SNT beneficiary is likely to
     have special needs that will not be met without the trust; 
The money to be paid to the trust
     does not exceed the amount that appears reasonably necessary to meet the
     SNT beneficiary’s special needs.

Bond
The proposed initial trustee is Petitioner Brianna Torrez.  
Bond must be required of a
trustee unless the trustee is a corporate fiduciary.  (California Rules of Court, Rule 7.903(c)(5),
Probate Code section 2320.). The proposed trustee does not meet the definition
of a corporate fiduciary and bond normally would be required.  The wrinkle here is that there is no initial
funding of the SNT because all settlement funds would be used to purchase an
annuity for each plaintiff that would not start paying into the SNT under years
later.  Petitioner therefore requests
that the requirements for bond and accountings do not start until the fund
accumulates $20,000 assets.  
Having considered all of the
facts in the record, the Court grants Petitioner’s request and requires that a
bond and accountings will be due from trustee for each trust once it reaches $20,000
in assets.  Trustee is ordered to report
this event to the trust supervision court and post a bond at that time.  The trustee and trusts will be subject to
ongoing review hearings.  
Proposed Orders
The Court has reviewed the three proposed orders with a received
stamp date of 3/20/24. 
The Orders provide that accountings and bond for each trust until
it reaches assets of $20,000 (p. 2, para. 6). 
Therefore, there is no need to state the usual 14 month due date for the
first accounting.  
The Orders require filing of a Notice of Commencement of
Proceedings for a Court Supervised Trust on LASC Form PRO 044 within 60 days.  Upon approval, the Court will add the
calendar date for this requirement. 
The Orders do not set an OSC in this civil department in
approximately 60 days to ensure funding of settlement and filing of LASC Form
PRO 044 to open trust supervision action in probate division.  Upon approval, the Court will add the date and
time for this OSC in this department. 
Conclusion
The Court CONTINUES the hearings
on these petitions.
Moving party to give notice.
