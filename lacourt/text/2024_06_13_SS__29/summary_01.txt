And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial into two parts (liability and damages) without prejudice. The defendants, Cutco Stores, Inc. and Vector Marketing Corporation, had requested to bifurcate the trial, but the judge has decided that it is more appropriate for the trial judge to make this decision. The judge has instead ordered that the defendants may submit their motion for bifurcation at the same time as their motions in limine, and any opposition to the motion can be filed at the same time as the opposition to the motions in limine. The judge has also directed that the briefing on bifurcation be included in the trial binders in Tab B along with any motions in limine filed in the case.
