Summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer and a motion to strike filed by defendants Borba Investment Realty, Inc. and Charles B. Roselli against plaintiff Brian Jones. The demurrer challenges the legal sufficiency of the complaint, while the motion to strike seeks to eliminate certain claims. The judge finds that the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, meaning that the complaint must be dismissed. However, the judge grants leave to amend for some claims, requiring the plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 20 days. The judge also orders Roselli to file a responsive pleading within the statutory time thereafter. The case is scheduled for a hearing on February 15, 2024, and the parties are reminded to participate in a Case Management Conference concurrently.
