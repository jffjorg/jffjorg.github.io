Motion to Set Aside
     Notice of Settlement and Enter Judgment Pursuant to Stipulation

a.    
Request for Relief
On 8/10/23, Plaintiff filed this
motion to set aside notice of settlement and enter judgment pursuant to terms
of stipulation.  Plaintiff provides
evidence that Defendant made payments per the parties’ stipulation in the total
amount of $8505, but ceased making payments on 5/10/23 and has made no payments
since that date.  Plaintiff provides evidence
that $17,318.25 remains due and owing pursuant to the parties’ settlement
agreement.  
 
b.     Law
Governing Enforcement of Settlement per CCP §664.6 After Dismissal
Usually, the court loses subject
matter jurisdiction when an action is voluntarily dismissed (with or without
prejudice). Thereafter, it has no power to enforce a settlement agreement.  Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles
(2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913, 917-918.  Where
a settlement agreement provides the court may retain jurisdiction to enforce
the settlement, but the dismissal fails to provide for retained jurisdiction, the
plaintiff's remedy is to move to vacate or modify the dismissal under CCP § 473(b)
for “mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect.”  Basinger v. Rogers & Wells (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d
16, 21.  
 
c.     Analysis
In this case, the dismissal
explicitly provides that the Court retains jurisdiction to enforce the
settlement per CCP §664.6.  Therefore, no
order setting aside the dismissal is necessary. 

 
The motion to vacate the notice of
settlement and enter judgment pursuant to stipulation is therefore granted.  The Court will sign the proposed judgment,
submitted with the moving papers on 8/10/23, upon entry of this order.  
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.
