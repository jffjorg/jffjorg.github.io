And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint filed by the defendants, Motion Fitness Group, LLC and Alexandria Nguyen. The defendants seek to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff, Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (CAB) and American Textile Management Company dba Republic Master Chefs (ATMC) for fraud and related claims. The judge rules that the motion is mandatory because the proposed cross-complaint is pled against CAB, and since there is no opposition to the motion, no showing of bad faith is required. As for the permissive cross-complaint against ATMC, the judge grants the motion in the interest of justice, as the case has no trial date scheduled and it would be more efficient to have all issues between the parties decided in the same action. The judge also schedules a Case Management Conference to be held concurrently with the hearing on the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint, and asks the parties to make arrangements to appear remotely.
