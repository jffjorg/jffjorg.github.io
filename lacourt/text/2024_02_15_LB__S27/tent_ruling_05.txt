 Case Number:  23LBCV00650    Hearing Date:   February 15, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiffs, Steven and Rebecca
Johnston seek an order consolidating 23LBCV00650 with 23LBCV00876.  Plaintiffs provide evidence that the two
actions arise out of the same automobile accident.  The two cases have previously been deemed
related, such that they are ripe for consolidation.  Plaintiffs have properly served all parties
in all actions.  Any opposition to the
motion was due on or before 2/02/24.  The
Court has not received opposition to the motion.    
 
The unopposed motion to consolidate is granted.  CCP §1048. 

 
23LBCV00650 is the lead case.  All future papers must be filed in 23LBCV00650.  All future hearing dates must be reserved in 23LBCV00650.  All future hearing dates currently pending in
23LBCV00876 are advanced to today’s date and vacated.  The Court notes that there is currently a
motion to compel arbitration scheduled in 23LBCV00876 for 4/18/24.  The hearing will be scheduled in 23LBCV00650
for the same date.  No new moving papers
need to be filed, but any opposition and/or reply must be filed in 23LBCV00650.
