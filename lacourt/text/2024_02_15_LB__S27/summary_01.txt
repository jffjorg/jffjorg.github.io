And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to set aside the notice of settlement and enter judgment is granted. The case was originally filed by Discover Bank against Seng Men for failure to pay a credit card bill. A notice of settlement was filed on August 27, 2019, and a stipulation for entry of judgment and retention of jurisdiction was filed on October 2, 2019. The court signed a judgment of dismissal on October 3, 2019. However, on August 10, 2023, Discover Bank filed a motion to set aside the notice of settlement and enter judgment, stating that Seng Men made payments per the parties' stipulation but ceased making payments on May 10, 2023, and still owes $17,318.25. The Judge found that the dismissal explicitly provides for retained jurisdiction, so no order setting aside the dismissal is necessary. The motion to vacate the notice of settlement and enter judgment is granted, and the court will sign the proposed judgment submitted with the moving papers.
