Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by Super Center Concepts, Inc. (Defendant). The motion is denied because Defendant failed to meet its moving burden to show that it did not cause or contribute to Plaintiff Martin Delgado's injuries sustained in a fall at Super Center's store. Specifically, Defendant failed to provide affirmative evidence that the mobility scooter used by Plaintiff was not defective, and also failed to shift the burden by showing that Plaintiff lacked evidence concerning how the scooter broke. The Court notes that there are triable issues of material fact concerning what caused the incident, including whether Defendant's employees opened the scooter's seat to access the batteries, controller, or charger prior to the incident. The motion is therefore denied, and a hearing will be held on February 15, 2024, to consider the parties' submissions on the tentative.
