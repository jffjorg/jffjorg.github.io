And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and order to show cause why a preliminary injunction shall not issue. The application was filed by Zoë Muntaner, who is seeking to disqualify candidates who violate the California Election Code and challenging the appointment of a board member to a vacancy on the Santa Monica College Board of Trustees. The judge has previously granted Muntaner's ex parte application to set the case on an expedited schedule and scheduled the hearing on the petition for January 9, 2024, which is the day before the investiture ceremony. The judge does not find that there is an exigency that requires the issuance of an injunction at this time. Additionally, Muntaner has not demonstrated a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits at this preliminary stage. Therefore, the judge is denying the ex parte application and ordering that the court's clerk provide notice.
