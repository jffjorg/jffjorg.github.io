Case No.
24STCP03660
Order Denying Ex
Parte Application for Temporary Restraining Order
            
            Petitioner
Zoë Muntaner
(“Petitioner”), a self-represented party, filed this petition for writ of
mandate against the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk (the “County
RR/CC”) and the City of Santa Monica (collectively, “Respondents”).  Petitioner sought to run for a position on
the Santa Monica College Board of Trustees (the “Board”) and was required to
submit a nominating petition with 100 valid signatures.  The City forwarded Petitioner’s nomination
petition to the RR/CC for verification of signatures.  However, Petitioner was disqualified because
one of her signature pages—containing 68 signatures—omitted the dates of
circulation on the “declaration of circulator” section.  Therefore, the County RR/CC did not count
those signatures, leaving Petitioner with less than the required 100 signatures.  Petitioner filed a prior petition (which was Case
Number 24STCP02741) and did not dispute these facts.  At the hearing on the prior petition for writ
of mandate, Petitioner confirmed that the dates of circulation were missing
from the petition.    
 
            Petitioner
has filed a new petition, again challenging her disqualification, as well as
other issues.  Petitioner seeks to “[d]isqualify
candidates whose declaration of circulator point 3 violates the California Election
Code, under Elections Code § 18202.” 
(Petition for Writ of Mandamus (“Pet.”) p. 6 at ¶ 4.)  Petitioner also challenges the appointment of
one board member to a vacancy, pursuant to Education Code section 5328.  Now, Petitioner seeks an injunction to stop the
investiture ceremony, which is scheduled for January 10, 2025.  The court construes this ex parte application
as an ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and order to show
cause why a preliminary injunction shall not issue.
 
            The purpose of a temporary restraining order and preliminary
injunction is to preserve the status quo pending a decision on the
merits.  (Major v. Miraverde Homeowners Ass’n. (1992) 7 Cal. App. 4th 618,
623.)  This is a drastic remedy.  “To issue an injunction is the exercise of a
delicate power, requiring great caution and sound discretion, and rarely, if
ever, should be exercised in a doubtful case.” 
(Willis v. Lauridson (1911) 161 Cal. 106, 117.)  This is especially true here, because
Petitioner is asking this court to stop the transition of  the Board. 

 
Where, as here, the defendants are public agencies and the
plaintiff seeks to restrain them in the performance of their duties, public
policy considerations also come into play. 
There is a general rule against enjoining public officers or agencies
from performing their duties.  This rule
would not preclude a court from enjoining unconstitutional or void acts, but to
support a request for such relief the plaintiff must make a significant showing
of irreparable harm.
 
(Tahoe
Keys Property Owners’ Assn. v. State Water Resources Control Bd. (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1471.)  
 
In deciding whether to grant injunctive relief before trial,
the court looks to two factors, including “(1) the likelihood that the
plaintiff will prevail on the merits, and (2) the relative balance of harms
that is likely to result from the granting or denial of interim injunctive
relief.”  (White v. Davis (2003) 30 Cal.4th 528, 553-54.)  The factors are interrelated, with a greater
showing on one permitting a lesser showing on the other.  (Dodge,
Warren & Peters Ins. Services, Inc. v. Riley (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th
1414, 1420.)  However, the party seeking
an injunction must demonstrate at least a reasonable probability of success on
the merits.  (IT Corp. v. County of Imperial (1983) 35 Cal.3d 63, 73-74.)  The party seeking the injunction bears the
burden of demonstrating both a likelihood of success on the merits and the
occurrence of irreparable harm.  (Savage v. Trammell Crow Co. (1990) 223
Cal.App.3d 1562, 1571.) 
 
            The court
denies this ex parte application.  As an
initial matter, there is no exigency.  The
court previously granted Petitioner’s ex parte application to set this case on
an expedited schedule and scheduled the hearing on the petition for January 9,
2024, which is the day before the investiture. 
The court will decide the writ on that date, so there is no need to
issue an injunction at this point.  Putting
that aside, Petitioner does not demonstrate a sufficient likelihood of success
on the merits at this preliminary stage. 
Therefore, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         Petitioner’s ex parte application for a
temporary restraining order and order to show cause why an injunction shall not
issue is denied.
 
            2.         The court’s clerk shall provide notice.
