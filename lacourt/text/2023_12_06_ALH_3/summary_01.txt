And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Helix Media LLC's motion to enter an amended order awarding attorney's fees against Defendants Natalie Clark, Freya Holdings LLC, and Robert J. Winkler. The Court previously awarded fees against these defendants, but the fees were later vacated against Gabriel Vadasz, who was not involved in the anti-SLAPP motion and did not have notice of the fee motion. Plaintiff seeks an amended order to clarify the amount of the fee award and the parties against whom the award is entered, as their attempts to enforce the judgment have been unsuccessful. The Court finds that the request is reasonable and grants the motion, signing the proposed order submitted by Plaintiff. The Court also disregards the portion of the opposition briefs that requests the Court consider the possibility of reversal before issuing the amended order.
