And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion to be relieved as counsel of record for plaintiff Shirley Elena Samayoa. Peter M. Williamson, counsel for Samayoa, seeks to withdraw due to irreconcilable differences with his client. The court notes that the trial is set for December 9, 2024, and that no prejudice will result from granting the motion. However, the proposed order fails to include a status conference re: mediation and discovery scheduled for March 20, 2024. The hearing on this motion is continued to December 20, 2023, to allow counsel to submit a revised proposed order. The revised order must be submitted at least 5 days before the hearing date.
