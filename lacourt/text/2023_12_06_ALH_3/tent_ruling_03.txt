I.           
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff BE 830 Lake, LLC
(“Plaintiff”) moves for an order awarding attorney fees as the prevailing party
in this unlawful detainer action. This action arises from the failure to pay
rent by defendant East Coast Foods, Inc. dba Roscoe’s House of Chicken &
Waffles (“Defendant”). Plaintiff argues it is entitled to a fee award in the
sum of $195,266, which includes the fees incurred in making this motion. 
 
 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
A prevailing party is entitled to
recover costs, which can include attorney’s fees, as a matter of right. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 1032, subd. (a)(4); 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) This right may arise
out of contract, statute or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).)
Additionally, a party prevailing on an action on a contract is entitled to
attorney fees if the contract contains an attorney’s fees provision. (Civ.
Code, § 1717, subd. (a).) 
The most common method for calculating
reasonable attorneys’ fees begins with the “lodestar” approach which is
calculated as¿“the
number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Margolin
v. Regional Planning Com. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004-1005.)
“California courts have consistently held that a computation of time spent on a
case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of
an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Id.) The reasonable hourly rate
is that prevailing in the community for similar work. (Id. at 1004.)¿ The lodestar figure may then be
adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to
fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided. (Serrano
v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49; PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.App 4th 1084, 1095.)
III.       
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff is entitled to the award of
attorney fees as the prevailing party pursuant to a contractual agreement.
Section 31 of the Lease underlying this action provides that the prevailing
party in an action or proceeding involving the Premises shall be entitled to
reasonable attorney fees. (Lombardi Decl., Ex. 1.) In addition, Plaintiff, as
the lessor, “shall be entitled to attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses incurred
in the preparation and service of notices of Default and consultations in
connection therewith, whether or not a legal action is subsequently commenced
in connection with such Default or resulting breach.” (Ibid.) 
As a threshold matter, the Court addresses
Defendant’s time-wasting argument that the judgment entered on June 30, 2023,
bars Plaintiff from seeking attorneys’ fees. (Opp., p. 5.) The Court’s signed judgment
removed placeholders for the award of fees, because at that time no motion for
attorneys’ fees or costs had been filed (as clearly contemplated by the deleted
placeholders), and the Court did not bar Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’
fees. The Court thus proceeds to analyze the merits of Defendant’s opposition. 
Defendant argues that the fees sought
by Plaintiff were not “reasonably incurred” by Plaintiff because the bills were
addressed to non-party Black Equities LLC. However, as explained in Plaintiff’s
reply brief, Black Equities is the “sole manager” and an owner of Plaintiff. (Reply,
p. 2.) In this capacity, Black Equities was invoiced for, and paid, Plaintiff’s
attorneys’ fees. (Ibid.) Plaintiff is not precluded from recovering attorneys’
fees even if it did not have a personal obligation to pay for legal services;
the ultimate payor of the fees is immaterial. (See Sonoma Land Trust v.
Thompson (2021) 63 al.App.5th 978, 984; Nemecek & Cole v. Horn (2012)
208 Cal.App.4th 641, 653.)  
Next, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
counsel did not establish that their billing rates correspond to the prevailing
rates in southern California for attorneys with similar experience engaged in
unlawful detainer work. Defendant’s demand for additional evidence is meritless.
(Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 156
(awarding attorneys’ fees based solely on “unrebutted declarations”); Davis
v. City of San Diego (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 893, 903 (rejecting argument
the court should have “required [the party seeking attorneys’ fees] to present
evidence beyond its counsel’s declaration sufficient to show its ‘requested
rates’ were ‘in line with those prevailing in the community for similar service
by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience and reputation”).) Here,
attorney Thomas Lombardi declares that he billed at an hourly rate of $620 in
2022 and $675 in 2023, which was discounted from his usual hourly rate of $870
in 2022 and $925 in 2023. Lombardi’s practice focuses on real estate litigation
and he has experience litigating novel issues concerning the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on commercial lease obligations. He provides a summary of
tasks performed each month from June 2022 to August 2023 by each of his staff
to show that the total billed to Plaintiff is $195,266. Attorney Matthew
Anderson had an effective billing rate of $675 per hour, which is discounted
from his normal hourly rate of $825. Anderson is a commercial litigation
associate who, like Lombardi, has experience litigating issues concerning the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial lease obligations. Anderson has
been practicing for 9 years and spent 105 hours on work almost exclusively
dedicated to Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment and the instant motion.
Another litigation associate, Jesse Hogin, billed 13 hours to his matter on
legal research and discovery drafting, at an hourly rate of $550 in 2022 and
$620 in 2023. Hogin has been a litigator for two years and has clerked for 3
years for different federal judges. Staci Steadman, a research services
manager, dedicated approximately 4 hours to this matter and had an hourly
billing rate of $360 in 2022 and $370 in 2023. Steadman has 25 years of
experience working as a research librarian at law firms. Based on these
descriptions, the Court finds no objection with the hourly rates claimed by
Plaintiff’s counsel. 
In addition, Defendant argues that
Plaintiff’s counsel’s billed amount should be reduced by $91,161 because time
entries were purportedly duplicative and fees incurred during he “grace period”
for rent payment under Pasadena Ordinance 7392 should not be allowed. The Court
partially agrees with Defendant’s assessment that some of the work was
duplicative or excessive. Specifically, with respect to pre-litigation tasks,
Plaintiff’s counsel spent 13 hours amounting to a total of $14,913.50 to
investigate and analyze the claims, draft correspondence and facilitate
settlement discussions, and prepare the pleadings and notice to pay or quit.
(Motion, p. 3.) This work amounts to about $1,147.19 per hour, which is
unreasonably high in light of the previously-listed hourly rates. Accordingly,
the Court reduces the fees recoverable for this preparatory work to an hourly
rate of $620, for a total $8,060. The Court rejects Defendant’s argument that
the case was “straightforward.” Defendant raised multiple arguments regarding
the impact of COVID-19 moratoriums that were novel and required extensive
accounting to rebut. Even the summary judgment motion required supplemental
briefing and two hearings. 
Last, Defendant asks the Court to
consider the fact that it is subject to a bankruptcy reorganization plan. However,
the authorities cited are factually inapposite as they concern different
statutory causes of action and individual (not corporate) plaintiffs. 
IV.        
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff’s motion for fees is GRANTED
subject to a $8,060 reduction for a total fee award of $187,206.
