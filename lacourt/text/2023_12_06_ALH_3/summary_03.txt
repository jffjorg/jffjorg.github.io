And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees, subject to a reduction of $8,060. The plaintiff, BE 830 Lake, LLC, is entitled to an award of attorney fees as the prevailing party in this unlawful detainer action. The fees incurred by the plaintiff's counsel, totaling $195,266, are reasonable and reflect the prevailing rates in southern California for attorneys with similar experience engaged in unlawful detainer work. The court has reduced the fees recoverable for preparatory work to an hourly rate of $620. The court has also granted the plaintiff's motion for fees subject to a total fee award of $187,206. The defendant, East Coast Foods, Inc., had argued that the fees were not reasonably incurred and that the billing rates claimed by the plaintiff's counsel were excessive, but the court has rejected these arguments.
