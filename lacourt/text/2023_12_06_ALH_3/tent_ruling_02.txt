      CASE NO.: 22AHCV01335
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED 
 
Dept.
  3
8:30
  a.m.
December
   6, 2023




 


 


 



 
Peter M.
 Williamson seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for plaintiff
 Shirley Elena Samayoa on grounds that irreconcilable
 differences have arisen between counsel and client.  Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an
attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268
Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  
The Court notes that trial in this
matter is set for December 9, 2024 and no prejudice will result from granting
this motion. However, the proposed order fails to include the status conference
re: mediation and discovery scheduled for March 20, 2024 in Item 8. 
Accordingly, the hearing on this motion
is continued to December 20, 2023 so that counsel may submit a revised proposed
order. The revised proposed order should be submitted no later than 5 days
before the hearing date. 
Moving party to give notice.
Dated
this 6th
day of December 2023
