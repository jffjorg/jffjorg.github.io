And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants' motion to dismiss the lawsuit based on forum non conveniens. The defendants argued that the case should be heard in Virginia, where the plaintiff is a resident and all the relevant documents and witnesses are located. The judge agreed, finding that Virginia is a more suitable forum for the action than California, where the lawsuit was originally filed. The judge noted that all the parties, documents, and evidence are located outside of California, and the witnesses are geographically closer to Virginia than California. The judge also found that the conduct alleged in the lawsuit does not relate to or affect any property located in California or products manufactured there, and that Virginia has a greater interest in resolving the plaintiff's claims, implementing its laws, and regulating its business practices that directly affect Virginia.
