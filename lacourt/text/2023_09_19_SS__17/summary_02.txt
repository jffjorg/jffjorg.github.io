## English Text Summary

The judge has tentatively ruled to dismiss the case brought by Navid Keshavarz-Nia against Raytheon (CA) Technologies Corporation and Raytheon Technologies, Inc. This decision is based on the legal doctrine of "forum non conveniens," which allows a court to decline jurisdiction if a more suitable forum exists.

The judge found that Virginia is a more appropriate forum for this case because:

* All parties, documents, and most witnesses are located in Virginia.
* The alleged conduct and its impact primarily occurred in Virginia.
* Virginia has a stronger interest in resolving this case involving its residents and businesses.



The Plaintiff had temporarily relocated to California, but the judge determined that California has a weak connection to the case. The opposing party, Raytheon, successfully argued that Virginia is a more suitable location for the lawsuit.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to dismiss the case due to forum non conveniens. The defendant argues that the case should be tried in Virginia, where all parties, documents, and evidence are located, and where witnesses involved in the alleged conduct are also located. The judge agrees that Virginia is a more suitable forum for the action and that the balance of private and public interest factors weighs against retaining the case in California. The plaintiff, an indispensable witness, is a resident of Virginia, and nearly all witnesses are located outside of California. The judge finds that the conduct alleged does not relate to or affect any property located in California or products manufactured there, and that Virginia has a greater interest in resolving its residents' claims. Therefore, the defendant's motion to dismiss is granted.
