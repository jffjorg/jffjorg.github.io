And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's motion to bifurcate is denied without prejudice. The court finds it appropriate for the trial judge to determine whether bifurcation is warranted, given that the case will be tried by a different judicial officer than the one ruling on the motion. The court orders that the bifurcation briefing be included in the trial binders, along with any motions in limine filed in the case. The court also recognizes that CRC Rule 3.57(c) prohibits using a motion in limine to seek an order to try an issue before the trial of another issue or issues. The moving party is ordered to give notice, and parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court. If the court does not receive emails from the parties and there are no appearances at the hearing, the court may adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
