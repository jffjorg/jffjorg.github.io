Roles:

  - Plaintiff: MARIA ELENA ESPINOZA
  - Defendant: LUIS CORNEJO, et al

Significant Statements:
  - The Court does not find persuasive Plaintiff's argument that her failure to appear at this IME is justified by Defendants' cancellation or rescheduling of the four previously set IMEs.
  - The prior cancellations are, in any event, not relevant to the instant motion.
  - Plaintiff's counsel failed to notify Defendants' counsel of Plaintiff's unavailability due to jury duty in a timely manner.
  - Plaintiff surely had more than two days' advance notice of jury duty and could have relayed unavailability earlier to avoid expert and translator cancellation fees, but failed to do so.
