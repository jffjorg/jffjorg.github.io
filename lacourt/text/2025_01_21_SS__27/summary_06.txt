And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the defendant's motion to continue the trial for 120 days. The defendant alleged that the plaintiff failed to comply with discovery orders and that additional time is needed to analyze discovery responses. However, the Court has already rejected a similar stipulation filed by the parties, finding that the reasons provided did not constitute good cause. The defendant has not demonstrated any significant new developments or unforeseen circumstances that would warrant reconsideration. The motion is denied, and the trial remains set for February 7, 2025.
