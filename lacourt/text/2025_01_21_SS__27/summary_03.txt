The court has reviewed the present motion requesting to continue the trial to May 27, 2025. However, the court previously granted the defendant's ex parte request to continue the trial to the same date, making the present motion moot and taking it off calendar. The parties must submit on the tentative ruling by email to the court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org. If the court does not receive submissions from all parties and there are no appearances at the hearing, the court may adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
