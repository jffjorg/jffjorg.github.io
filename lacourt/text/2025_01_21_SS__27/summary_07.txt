And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition to approve a minor's compromise. The compromise is for a gross settlement of $40,000, which will be distributed as follows: $8,416.06 for medical expenses, $13,332.00 for attorneys' fees, and $1,532.40 for costs. The net balance of $16,719.94 will be awarded to Claimant Deacon Handfield. The court has reviewed the petition and finds the settlement fair and reasonable. The court also finds the attorney's fees fair and reasonable.

The court grants the petition for Claimant Deacon Handfield, but conditionally grants the petition for Claimant Robinson Handfield due to deficiencies in the numbers listed in the petition and attachment. The court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Compliance of Payment and a Non-Appearance Case Review to address these deficiencies.

The moving party is ordered to give notice.
