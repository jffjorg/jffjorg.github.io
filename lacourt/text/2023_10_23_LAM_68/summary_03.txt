Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel arbitration brought by International Line Builders Inc. (Plaintiff) against Skanska USA Building Inc. and other defendants. The Plaintiff alleges breach of contract against the defendants and seeks to compel arbitration under the arbitration clause in the Prime Contract between Skanska and CHA. The arbitration clause provides for arbitration of disputes arising out of or related to the contract.

The judge finds that an arbitration agreement exists between the parties, and that the Plaintiff's claims against the Sureties are also subject to arbitration because the payment bond with the Sureties attaches to the Prime Contract with the arbitration clause. The judge notes that none of the Sureties objected to the Plaintiff's motion to compel arbitration, and that most of them filed a notice of non-opposition to the motion.

The judge grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel arbitration and stays the action pending arbitration.
