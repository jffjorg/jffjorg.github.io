Procedural Background
On
September 8, 2022, Plaintiffs Tawanda Honors, et al.[1]
(collectively “Honors Plaintiffs”) filed a breach of habitability action (“Honors
Action”) against Defendants 5505 Ackerfield Apts LLC (“Ackerfield”), AJJ2020
LLC (“AJJ2020”), Masuda Investments LLC (“Madusa”), and Weststar Property
Management, Inc. (“Weststar”).  On December
22, 2023, Honors Plaintiffs filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“Honors
SAC”) against Defendants Ackerfield, AJJ2020, Masuda, and Weststar.  The FAC asserts six causes of action for (1)
Breach of Contract, (2) Breach of the Implied Warranty of Habitability, (3)
Nuisance, (4) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, (5) Negligence, and
(6) Violation of Civil Code § 1942.4.
On July
27, 2023, Plaintiffs Edana Jones, Tykisha Bain, and Raydell Latrent Patterson
(collectively “Jones Plaintiffs”) filed a breach of habitability action (“Jones
Action”) against Defendants Ackerfield, AJJ2020, and Masuda.  The Jones Action complaint asserts four
causes of action for (1) Failure to Provide Habitable Dwelling, (2) Breach of
the Covenant and Right to Quiet Enjoyment and Possession of the Property, (3)
Nuisance, and (4) Negligence.
On
October 30, 2023, the Court deemed the Honors Action and Jones Action related
and transferred the Jones Action to the instant department.  (Minute Order 10/30/23.)  
On November
29, 2023, Defendant Ackerfield filed the instant motion to consolidate the
Honors Action and Jones Action.  On March
4, 2024, the Jones Plaintiffs filed an opposition.  On March 7, 2024, Ackerfield filed a reply.
On
March 13, 2024, the Court continued the instant motion to March 19, 2024.
 
Allegations
of the Operative Complaints
            The Honors SAC alleges that:
            Masuda was the owner of the property
at 5505 Ackerfield Ave. Long Beach, CA 90805 (“Subject Property”)from
2012-2020.  (Honors SAC ¶ 35.)  AJJ2020 was the Owner of the Subject Property
from 2020-2021.  (Honors SAC ¶ 36.)  Ackerfield is the current owner of the
Subject Property.  (Honors SAC ¶
37.)  Weststar is the current property
manager of the Subject Property.  (Honors
SAC ¶ 38.)  The Honors Plaintiffs each
entered into a written lease agreement for the lease of their respective units
at the Subject Property.  (Honors SAC ¶¶
1-24, 34.)
            “[Honors Plaintiffs] have been
living at the property going back to as early as 2016 and the failure to remedy
and fix these uninhabitable conditions date back that far.”  (Honors SAC ¶ 39.)  “Pursuant to terms of the LEASE AGREEMENT, [Honors
Plaintiffs] agreed to pay monthly rents in exchange for habitable, safe and
clean-living quarters.”  (Honors SAC ¶ 40.)  However, “[Masuda, AJJ2020, Ackerfield, and
Weststar] have not maintained the SUBJECT PROPERTY therein causing and allowing
slum and substandard living conditions. During plaintiffs' tenancy, the
following conditions have existed at the SUBJECT PROPERTY, and have been
allowed to exist by defendants, and each of them (collectively, the ‘CONDITIONS’):
a. Insect infestation; b. Visible mold and mildew; c. Leaking roof; d. Lack of
hot water; e. Defective plumbing; f. Broken kitchen sink; 9. Broken stairs; h.
Excessive garbage or debris; i. No heat; j. Defective ventilation; k. Broken
shower/bathtub; I. Holes in wall[.]”  (Honors
SAC ¶ 41.)
            “[Honors] Plaintiffs suffered with
lack of sleep, stress and anxiety because of the CONDITIONS at the SUBJECT
PROPERTY. Plaintiffs continued to notify [Masuda, AJJ2020, Ackerfield, and
Weststar] of their suffering, but defendants did nothing to help
plaintiffs.”  (Honors SAC ¶ 42.)  
            “Fed up with the CONDITIONs at the
SUBJECT PROPERTY, [Honors Plaintiffs] made a formal complaint to The City of
Long Beach Department of Health.”  (Honors
SAC ¶ 43.)  “The City of Long Beach
Department of Health did an inspection of the SUBJECT PROPERTY on or about
October 28, 2022. The SUBJECT PROPERTY was cited for violations. After 35 days
of being notified of the violations, defendants did not fix or abate the
SUBJECT PROPERTY.”  (Honors SAC ¶ 44.)
            “The [Honors Plaintiffs] in this
action repeatedly notified the [Masuda, AJJ2020, Ackerfield, and Weststar] of
the defective and dangerous conditions in their apartments and the defendants
have simply ignored their pleas or tried to avoid fixing them properly.”  (Honors SAC ¶ 45.)  “In addition, during their tenancy at the
SUBJECT PROPERTY, [Honors Plaintiffs] repeatedly notified [Masuda, AJJ2020,
Ackerfield, and Weststar] of the health issues they were experiencing as a
result of the CONDITIONS, including, but not limited to respiratory
issues.”  (Honors SAC ¶ 46.)  “Moreover, [Honors Plaintiffs] repeatedly
informed [Masuda, AJJ2020, Ackerfield, and Weststar] that the CONDITIONs at the
SUBJECT PROPERTY were causing them extreme anxiety and discomfort.”  (Honors SAC ¶ 47.)  
            “Despite their knowledge of the
CONDITIONs and [Honors Plaintiffs] health issues, the [Masuda, AJJ2020,
Ackerfield, and Weststar] failed to properly remedy the CONDITIONS, placing the
health and safety of plaintiffs at risk.” 
(Honors SAC ¶ 48.)
 
            The Jones Action Complaint (“Jones
Complaint”) alleges that:
            5505 Ackerfield Avenue, Long Beach,
CA 90805 (“Subject Property”) “is a multiple family dwelling, which is occupied
by tenants and their families, including low-income tenants, minorities and
families with children.” (Jones Complaint ¶ 14.) 
            Ackerfield is the current owner of
the Subject Property since 2021 and were Jones Plaintiffs’ landlord.  (Id. ¶¶ 5-6.)  AJJ2020 owned the Subject Property from
October 2020 to October 2021 and were landlords of the Subject Property.  (Id. ¶¶ 7-8.)  Masuda owned the Subject Property from
December 2012 to October 2020 and were landlords of the Subject Property.  (Id. ¶¶ 9-10.)  
Jones Plaintiffs are current and former
tenants of Subject Property.  (Id.
¶ 1.)  Plaintiff Edana Jones resided in
unit 103 from October 2021 to February 2023. 
(Id. ¶ 2, Exh. A.)  Plaintiffs
Tykisha Bain and Raydell Latrent Patterson have lived in unit 104 from July
2019 to present.  (Id. ¶ 3, Exh.
A.)  Jones Plaintiffs made complaints

(Jones
Complaint ¶ 17, Exh. B.)  
            Jones Plaintiffs made numerous
complaints about these substandard conditions at the Subject Property, which
Defendants Ackerfield, AJJ2020, and Masuda refused to repair.  (Id. ¶ 18.)  Rather, Defendants Ackerfield, AJJ2020, and
Masuda threatened, harassed, and intimidated the Jones Plaintiffs when they
continued to complain about the Subject Property’s condition.  (Id. ¶ 18.)  
 
Legal Standard
California Rules of
Court Rule 3.350(a) states in relevant part:
(1) A notice of motion to consolidate must:
(A) List all named
parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of
their respective attorneys of record;
(B) Contain the
captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest numbered
case shown first; and
(C) Be filed in each case sought to be consolidated.
 
(2) The motion to consolidate:
(A) Is deemed a
single motion for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but
memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in
the lowest numbered case;
(B) Must be served
on all attorneys of record and all non-represented parties in all of the cases
sought to be consolidated; and
(C) Must have a proof of service filed as part of the motion.
(Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.350(a).) Also, the consolidation statute, Code of Civil Procedure
§ 1048, provides in relevant part:
 
(a) When actions
involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may
order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the
actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders
concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
(b) The court, in
furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will
be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any cause
of action, including a cause of action asserted in a cross-complaint, or of any
separate issue or of any number of causes of action or issues, preserving the
right of trial by jury required by the Constitution or a statute of this state
or of the United States.
(CCP § 1048(a).) The
granting or denial of the motion to consolidate rests in the sound discretion
of the trial court, and will not be reversed except upon a clear showing of
abuse of discretion. (See Fellner v. Steinbaum (1955) 132 Cal.App.2d
509, 511.)
 
Discussion
            Defendant
Ackerfield seeks to consolidate the Honors Action with the Jones Action for all
purposes.
            “Code of Civil Procedure section 1048, subdivision (a), authorizes the
trial court, when appropriate, to ‘order a joint hearing or trial’ or to ‘order
all the actions consolidated.’ Under the statute and the case law, there are
thus two types of consolidation: a consolidation for purposes of trial only,
where the two actions remain otherwise separate; and a complete consolidation
or consolidation for all purposes, where the two actions are merged into a
single proceeding under one case number and result in only one verdict or set
of findings and one judgment.”  (Hamilton
v. Asbestos Corp., Ltd. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147.)  “Consolidation under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1048 is permissive, and it is for the trial court to determine whether
the consolidation is for all purposes or for trial only.”  (Id. at p.1149.)  Moreover, there is no requirement that the
parties be identical for a complete consolidation. (See e.g., Jefferson
Street Ventures, LLC v. City of Indio (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1175,
1206 [noting in action involving multiple but not completely overlapping parties
that “consolidation appears particularly appropriate in this case—the cases are
in the same court, involve the same property, and many (if not all) of
the same damages.”] [italics added].)
            Here,
numerous factors support a complete consolidation.  First, the claims at issue in both the Honors
Action and Jones Action involve the same property – i.e., the Subject
Property.  Further, the claims asserted
in the Honors Action and Jones Action cover the same timeframe.  The Honors Action covers claims from 2016-2023,
and the Jones Action covers claims from 2021-2023.  (Honors SAC ¶ 39; Jones Complaint ¶¶ 16-17.)  There is also substantial overlap of the
alleged damages claimed in both the Honors Action and Jones Action; the
respective plaintiffs in each of the two actions allege that they suffered economic
damage, emotional injury, physical injury, and injury to personal
property.  (Honors SAC ¶¶ 46-47, 53, 72, 74;
Jones Complaint ¶¶ 31-33, 53, 62-63, 74,82, 84.)  
Moreover, the
factual basis for the Plaintiffs’ respective claims in the Honors Action and
Jones Action are nearly identical, namely, that all of the Plaintiffs’
respective units in the Subject Property are unhabitable due to lack of
maintenance by all Defendants, and Defendants failed to repair the
property.  (Honors SAC ¶¶ 41-45; Jones
Complaint ¶¶ 15-22.)  In fact, many of
the claimed unhabitable conditions suffered in the Honors Action and Jones
Action are identical, such as insect infestations, lack of hot water, mold and
mildew, holes in the wall, roof leaks, plumbing defects, and lack of heating.  (Honors SAC ¶¶ 41; Jones Complaint ¶ 16.)  Finally, there is a near complete overlap in
defendants as the Honors Action and Jones Action include the owners and former
owners of the Subject Property -- Defendants Ackerfield, AJJ2020, and Masuda.  The only difference in defendants is that the
Honors Action also includes the current property manager Weststar.  
In sum, “consolidation
appears particularly appropriate in this case—the cases are in the same court,
involve the same property, and many (if not all) of the same damages.” (Jefferson
Street Ventures, LLC, supra, 236 Cal.App.4th at p.1206.)
In
opposition, the Jones Plaintiffs contend that the Court should deny consolidation
because (1) the cases do not share common issues of law or fact, (2) the
plaintiffs are represented by different firms, (3) consolidation would be
prejudicial to Jones Plaintiffs, and (4) consolidation would increase trial
complexity and confuse the jury.  Each of
these contentions is without merit.
As
explained above, the Jones Action and Honors Action share many common issues of
law and fact as they involve the same defendants, the same property, the same
harm, the same damages, and cover the same timeframe.  The fact that the actions do not share four
causes of action is immaterial as the underlying factual basis for the claims
in the Jones Action and Honors Action are the same.  The fact that the plaintiffs are represented
by different firms is also immaterial; litigation can often involve numerous
firms representing numerous parties without issue.  In fact, in the instant actions there are
separate attorneys representing the defendants. 
Further, the Jones Plaintiffs’ claim of jury confusion is
unfounded.  Both the Jones Action and the
Honors Action involve multiple plaintiffs that were tenants in different units
and who would have suffered different damages. 
Thus, any complexity in having multiple plaintiffs as tenants in
different units is inherent in both the Jones Action and Honors Action even without
consolidation.
Finally,
Jones Plaintiffs’ claim of prejudice is unfounded.  There is no indication that a consolidated
trial would be significantly longer.  The
Jones Plaintiffs, Honors Plaintiffs, and Defendant Ackerfield have all indicated
that the trial would be 7-10 days in the respective actions.  Moreover, many witnesses would likely be the
same.  
The Jones
Plaintiffs also claim prejudice because Plaintiffs would have to share protected
and privileged work product.  (Elder
Decl. ¶ 7.)  However, a consolidation –
even for all purposes – does not eliminate or change standard work product
rights and privileges.  Thus, the claims
of prejudice are unfounded.
Accordingly,
the Court finds that consolidation for all purposes is warranted under the lead
action Case No. 22STCV40554.  
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant 5505 Ackerfield Apts LLC and Westar Property Management,
Inc.’s motion for complete consolidation of Case Nos. 22STCV40554 and 23LBCV01405
is GRANTED.  Consolidation is ordered for
all purposes under Case No. 22STCV40554. 
All future pleadings are to be filed in the Lead Action only under Case
No. 22STCV40554.
Moving Party is ordered to give notice to
all parties in Case Nos. 22STCV40554 and 23LBCV01405 and file proof of service
of such within five days.
