The consolidation is warranted due to the common issues of law and fact between the two actions, which involve the same property, same defendants, same harm, same damages, and same timeframe. The judge finds that consolidation will avoid unnecessary costs and delay, and that the objections raised by the Jones Plaintiffs are unfounded.
