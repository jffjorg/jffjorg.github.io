And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied Amur Equipment Finance, Inc.'s application for default judgment against Little Fat Trucking (LFT) and Xing Wang (Wang) without prejudice. The court notes two defects in the application: (1) the guaranty only references Contract No. 1045134, which is the contract number for Agreement #2, and (2) the proposed judgment does not specify the collateral in an attachment to Paragraph 7. The court requests that Amur Equipment Finance, Inc. provide the specific language in the guaranty that supports its claim that Wang guarantied all of LFT's obligations under Agreements #1, #2, and #3, as well as explain why the guaranty appears to reference Contract No. 1045134 only. The court has scheduled a Case Management Conference and an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to File Proof of Service for January 10, 2024.
