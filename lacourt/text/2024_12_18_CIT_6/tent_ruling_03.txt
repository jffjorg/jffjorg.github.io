 Case Number:  24PSCV02825    Hearing Date:   December 18, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Jeffrey  Ito v. International Neural Network Society  Defendant  International Neural Network Society’s Anti-SLAPP Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s  Complaint  TENTATIVE  RULING  The First Amended Complaint is hereby stricken as improperly filed  while the anti-SLAPP motion is pending.  The Court GRANTS Defendant International Neural Network Society’s  anti-SLAPP motion to strike Plaintiff’s complaint. The Court hereby STRIKES  Plaintiff’s entire complaint and directs Defendant to submit a proposed  judgment of dismissal with prejudice within five calendar days of this order.  The Court also GRANTS Defendant International Neural Network  Society’s request for attorney’s fees and costs in the reduced amount of  $13,560.00.  The Court DENIES Defendant International Neural Network Society’s  demurrer and motion to strike as moot.              Defendant International Neural  Network Society is ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five  calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is a professional liability case. On August 28, 2024, plaintiff  Jeffrey Ito (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant International  Neural Network Society (Defendant), alleging causes of action for professional  liability, unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy, misrepresentation and fraud,  deceptive trade practices, and invasion of privacy.  On November 4, 2024, Defendant filed an anti-SLAPP motion to  strike Plaintiff’s complaint. The motion is unopposed.  LEGAL  STANDARD  Code  of Civil Procedure section 425.16 permits the court to strike causes of action  arising from an act in furtherance of the defendant's right of free speech or  petition, unless the plaintiff establishes that there is a probability that the  plaintiff will prevail on the claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16.)  “The  anti-SLAPP procedures are designed to shield a defendant’s constitutionally  protected conduct from the undue burden of frivolous litigation.” (Baral v.  Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 393 (Baral), italics in original.)  “The anti-SLAPP statute does not insulate defendants from any liability  for claims arising from the protected rights of petition or speech. It only  provides a procedure for weeding out, at an early stage, meritless  claims arising from protected activity.” (Id., at p. 384, italics in  original.)  “Resolution  of an anti-SLAPP motion involves two steps. First, the defendant must establish  that the challenged claim arises from activity protected by section 425.16. If  the defendant makes the required showing, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to  demonstrate the merit of the claim by establishing a probability of success.” (Baral,  supra, 1 Cal.5th at p. 384, citation omitted.) The California Supreme Court  has “described this second step as a ‘summary-judgment-like procedure.’ The  court does not weigh evidence or resolve conflicting factual claims. Its  inquiry is limited to whether the plaintiff has stated a legally sufficient  claim and made a prima facie factual showing sufficient to sustain a favorable  judgment. It accepts the plaintiff’s evidence as true, and evaluates the  defendant’s showing only to determine if it defeats the plaintiff’s claim as a  matter of law. ‘[C]laims with the requisite minimal merit may proceed.’” (Id.,  at pp. 384-385, internal citations omitted.)  Where a cause of action is predicated on both  protected and unprotected activity, the court may strike those parts predicated  on protected activity, even if the moving party sought to strike the entire  cause of action. (Bonni v. St. Joseph Health System (2021) 11 Cal.5th 995, 1011 (Bonni).)  Allegations that are merely incidental and provide context without a right to  recovery are not subject to the anti-SLAPP statute. (Id., at p. 1012.)  REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE              The Court GRANTS  Defendant’s requests for judicial notice. (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).) However, the Court takes judicial notice of the  foregoing documents only as to “the existence, content and authenticity of  public records and other specified documents”; it does not take judicial notice  of the truth of the factual matters asserted in those documents. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)  PRELIMINARY  ISSUE              Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on December 6,  2024, which did not add any new parties. (First Amended Complaint (12/6/24).) However,  Plaintiff may not amend the complaint before the hearing on the anti-SLAPP  motion. (Salma v. Capon (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1275, 1280.) Thus,  the First Amended Complaint has no bearing on the Court’s ruling and is hereby  stricken.  DISCUSSION  Timeliness  Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (f), requires  that a special motion to strike be filed within 60 days of service of the  complaint, or later with court permission. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd.  (f).) Here, Defendant filed and served the motion on November 4, 2024, which is  less than 60 days from the time Plaintiff served the complaint on Defendant on  September 17, 2024. (Proof of Service (9/30/24).) Accordingly, the motion is  timely.  First Prong – Protected Activity  Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision  (e), defines protected activity as, “(1) any written or oral statement or  writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any  other official proceeding authorized by law, (2) any written or oral statement  or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a  legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding  authorized by law, (3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place  open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public  interest, or (4) any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the  constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in  connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.” (Code Civ.  Proc., § 425.16, subd. (e).)              Summary of Arguments – Protected  Activity  Defendant contends it satisfies the first prong of the anti-SLAPP  analysis because Defendant engaged in protected activity, and the causes of  action in the complaint arise from Defendant’s protected activity. Defendant  contends its activities are constitutionally protected because the activities  allegedly at issue are the publication and dissemination of scientific and  educational materials, which is an act in furtherance of Defendant’s right to  free speech. Defendant then contends Plaintiff’s claims arise out of  Defendant’s protected activities because they are based on the omission of  warnings from Defendant’s publications.  Plaintiff did not oppose the motion.              Analysis –  Protected Activity  The Court finds Defendant has satisfied the first  prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis. Publication and dissemination of scientific  and educational materials is clearly protected activity. “[S]peech  interpreting, evaluating and discussing the content and weight of the  scientific literature… represents the kind of rigorous debate on issues of  public concern that the First Amendment was designed to promote and protect.” (Bernardo v. Planned Parenthood Fed'n of Am. (2004) 115  Cal.App.4th 322, 359-360.)  Moreover,  Plaintiff’s complaint is directed at Defendant allegedly publishing and  disseminating scientific and educational materials, and alleges that Plaintiff  suffered harm because of those activities. (Colyear v. Rolling Hills  Community Association of Rancho Palos Verdes (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 119, 130  [defendant must demonstrate its acts constitute protected activity and that the  plaintiff’s claim arose from that protected activity].) For example:  ·          “INNS engages in the publication of academic journals, the  organization of conferences, and the dissemination of educational materials  related to neural networks and their applications. The organization has played  a pivotal role in shaping the development of neural network theory and its  practical applications....” (Complaint, 2:25-3:3.) ·          “Plaintiff believes that the information contained in these  publications contributed to his mental distress, as the materials may have been  misapplied or misunderstood by third parties, leading to the alleged experiment  performed on Plaintiff's brain.” (Compl., 5:16-19.) ·          “The Defendants, through INNS, have published and distributed a  vast array of educational materials related to neural networks. These materials  have been widely disseminated through academic journals, conferences, and  online platforms.” (Compl., 5:23-6:2.) ·          “Defendants failed to provide adequate warnings or safeguards regarding  the potential misuse of these materials…. The Defendants' [sic] negligence  in this regard has resulted in significant harm to the Plaintiff….” (Compl.,  6:6-10.) ·          “Defendants are responsible for the dissemination of harmful information  and for contributing to a broader conspiracy that has led to the misdiagnosis  and mistreatment of individuals like himself.” (Compl., 8:25-28.) ·          “The harm caused by the Defendants' actions has had a profound  impact on Plaintiff's mental health, emotional well-being, and financial  stability.” (Compl., 9:13-15.)  The gravamen of Plaintiff’s claims are Defendant’s  alleged publication and dissemination of scientific and educational materials, the  failure to properly warn in connection therewith, and third parties’  misapplication or misunderstanding of those materials to Plaintiff. (Compl.,  pp. 2-10, e.g. p. 11:5-7, 19-22, p. 12:13-16, 122:27-13:3, p. 14:10-14, p. 15:8-12,  p. 16:20-22, p. 18:3-6; Ramona Unified Sch. Dist. v. Tsiknas  (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 510, 519 [court looks to gravamen or principal thrust of  a plaintiff’s claim to determine whether anti-SLAPP applies].) Plaintiff’s  claims are clearly predicated on Defendant’s protected activity. Accordingly, Defendant  has met its initial burden. The burden now shifts to Plaintiff to establish a  probability of success on the merits.  Second Prong – Probability of Success on the Merits  (b)(1) A cause of action against a person arising  from any act of that person in furtherance of the person's right of petition or  free speech under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution  in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to  strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that  there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.  (2) In making its determination, the court shall  consider the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the  facts upon which the liability or defense is based.  (3) If the court determines that the plaintiff has  established a probability that the plaintiff  will prevail on the claim, neither that determination nor the fact of that  determination shall be admissible in evidence at any later stage of the case,  or in any subsequent action, and no burden of proof or degree of proof  otherwise applicable shall be affected by that determination in any later stage  of the case or in any subsequent proceeding.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16,  subd. (b).)  The complaint alleges causes of action for professional liability,  unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy, misrepresentation and fraud, deceptive  trade practices, and invasion of privacy.  For Plaintiff to defeat this anti-SLAPP  motion, Plaintiff must demonstrate a probability of success on the merits for  each cause of action alleged in the cross-complaint.  Defendant  makes various arguments as to why Plaintiff’s claims are barred, which the  Court finds meritorious. However, it is unnecessary to address the merits of  those arguments since Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. Plaintiff therefore  has failed to establish a probability of success on the merits. (See Code Civ.  Proc., § 425.16, subd. (b).) Further, the Court construes Plaintiff's lack of opposition as a  concession on the merits. (D.I. Chadbourne, Inc. v. Superior Court  (1964) 60 Cal.2d 723, 728, fn. 4 [where nonmoving party fails to oppose a  ground for a motion "it is assumed that [nonmoving party] concedes"  that ground].)  Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s anti-SLAPP  motion as to the entire complaint.  Attorney’s Fees and Costs  “[A] prevailing defendant on a special motion to  strike shall be entitled to recover that  defendant's attorney's fees and costs.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16,  subd. (c).) “[A]ny SLAPP defendant who brings a successful motion to strike is  entitled to mandatory attorney fees.” (Ketchum v. Moses  (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131.)  Since the Court granted the motion, Defendant is entitled to  recover attorney fees and costs. However, the Court finds the amount requested  somewhat excessive, as Plaintiff did not oppose the motion, which negated any review  of an opposition and preparing a reply, which were included in Defendant’s  calculation. (Carlsen Decl., ¶ 6.) While the Court understands anti-SLAPP  motions require a lot of work, the Court finds this motion was relatively  straightforward and should not have required 38.5 hours of preparation.  (Carlsen Decl., ¶ 6.) The Court also finds Defendant’s counsel’s hourly rate  slightly excessive for the applicable legal community of eastern Los Angeles  County. (Carlsen Decl., ¶ 6; 569 E. Cnty. Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry  Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 436-437 [“The courts  repeatedly have stated that the trial court is in the best position to value  the services rendered by the attorneys in his or her courtroom [citation], and  this includes the determination of the hourly rate that will be used in the  lodestar calculus.[Citation.]”) Therefore, the Court will award Defendant  attorney’s fees and costs in the reduced amount of $13,560.00, comprised of 30.0  hours preparing the motion and attending the hearing on the motion, multiplied  by the reduced hourly rate of $450.00, plus the $60.00 filing fee.  DEMURRER-MOTION  TO STRIKE              In light of the  Court granting Defendant’s anti-SLAPP motion to the entire complaint, the Court  DENIES Defendant’s demurrer and motion to strike as moot.  CONCLUSION  The First Amended Complaint is hereby stricken as improperly filed  while the anti-SLAPP motion is pending.  The Court GRANTS Defendant International Neural Network Society’s  anti-SLAPP motion to strike Plaintiff’s complaint. The Court hereby STRIKES  Plaintiff’s entire complaint and directs Defendant to submit a proposed  judgment of dismissal with prejudice within five calendar days of this order.  The Court also GRANTS Defendant International Neural Network  Society’s request for attorney’s fees and costs in the reduced amount of  $13,560.00.  The Court DENIES Defendant International Neural Network Society’s  demurrer and motion to strike as moot.              Defendant International Neural  Network Society is ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five  calendar days of this order.
