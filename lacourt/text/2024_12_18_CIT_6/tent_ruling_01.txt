(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320,

DISCUSSION 
Meet and Confer 
The Court finds EPI’s efforts to meet and confer before bringing
this motion satisfactory. (Daley Decl., ¶¶ 5-6; Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.310,
subd. (b).) 
Analysis 
EPI seeks an order requiring Plaintiff to submit to an independent
mental examination at the office of Manuel Saint Martin, M.D., J.D., 8616 La
Tijera Blvd., Suite 400, Los Angeles, CA 90045, (310) 641-7311. EPI states that
it served a demand for mental examination on Plaintiff on October 18, 2024. (Daley
Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.) EPI further states that Plaintiff failed to object to the
demand and to appear for his examination on November 8, 2024. (Daley Decl., ¶
6.) 
EPI contends good cause exists to take a mental examination of
Plaintiff based upon Plaintiff’s claim for extraordinary damages related to
anxiety and depression suffered as a result of the underlying accident. (See Daley
Decl., Ex D.) EPI states that the proposed mental examination will be conducted
by Dr. Manuel Saint Martin under standard office conditions, and will consist
of taking the history, present status, examination, and review of medical
records, and that no other person may attend on behalf of any defendant. (Daley
Decl., Ex. A.) EPI indicates that the scope of the examination will consist of
a psychiatric interview in which Dr. Saint Martin will collect information
about Plaintiff’s complete medical history, which is important because systemic
conditions can affect psychological functioning separate from a traumatic injury.
(Daley Decl., Ex. C.) EPI indicates that psychological testing is also
warranted, and that Dr. Saint Martin will utilize some or all of the following
psychological tests, namely the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
Third Edition Spanish Version, Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory Fourth
Edition Spanish Version, Personality Assessment Inventory Spanish Version,
Structured Interview of Malingered Symptoms Spanish Version, and the Patient
Pain Profile Spanish Version. (Daley Decl., Ex. C.) EPI states that the entire
examination should last approximately four to six hours, that breaks for
personal comfort or necessity may be taken as needed, and that the interview
will be audio-recorded and available to all parties. (Daley Decl., Ex. C.) 
The Court finds EPI’s motion well taken and that good cause exists
to permit a mental examination of Plaintiff. EPI presented evidence indicating
that Plaintiff seeks emotional distress damages over and above those typically
associated with his injuries, which the Court finds meets the minimum evidence
necessary to show good cause. (See Daley Decl., Ex. D; see also Compl., ¶¶ 20, 33-34,
46-47 [Plaintiff alleging permanent and serious emotional injuries requiring
psychologists and therapists for treatment].) EPI’s motion specifies the time,
place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, as well as the
identity and specialty of the person conducting the examination. (Daley Decl.,
Exs. A-C.) Notice of the motion was given to Plaintiff and all parties.
(Motion, pp. 44-45 of pdf; Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.310, subd. (c).) The Court
further construes Plaintiff’s lack of opposition as a tacit admission that
EPI’s arguments are meritorious. (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410; C. Opposing the Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition,
Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶ 9:105.10; see also Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003) 111
Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215 [“Contentions are waived when a party fails to support
them with reasoned argument and citations to authority. [Citation]”].) 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS EPI’s motion. Plaintiff
must appear for a mental examination by Manuel Saint Martin, M.D., J.D., at
8616 La Tijera Blvd., Suite 400, Los Angeles, CA 90045, (310) 641-7311, within
30 days of the Court’s ruling. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS EPI Construction, Inc.’s motion to compel mental
examination of Plaintiff Alonso Rivera. Plaintiff must appear for a mental examination
as described herein and in the moving papers by Manuel Saint Martin, M.D.,
J.D., at 8616 La Tijera Blvd., Suite 400, Los Angeles, CA 90045, (310)
641-7311, within 30 days of the Court’s order.

Civil Procedure section 20232.320, subd. (d), within five calendar days of this
