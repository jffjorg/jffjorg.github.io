 Case Number:  24PSCV02441    Hearing Date:   December 18, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  SCE Federal Credit Union’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment  Defendant: Karina Acorda  TENTATIVE RULING            Plaintiff’s request for entry of  default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $82,785.95. Plaintiff can  submit a new proposed Judgment prior to the hearing or the Court will modify  and sign the proposed judgment.            BACKGROUND                        This  is a collection case. On July 30, 2024, plaintiff SCE Federal Credit Union  (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Karina Acorda (Defendant) and  Does 1 through 10, alleging causes of action for breach of promissory note and  money lent.               On November 19, 2024, Plaintiff entered  default against Defendant.               On  December 5, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a default judgment package.            LEGAL  STANDARD  Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration  of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all  parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate  judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of  grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for  attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)  ANALYSIS  Plaintiff  seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $85,164.89,  including $74,447.07 in damages, $7,765.02 in interest, $2,378.94 in attorney  fees, and $573.86 in costs. The Court finds Plaintiff has submitted sufficient  evidence to support the amount requested, except for attorney fees. Attorney  fees are only recoverable under contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., §  1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) Local Rule 3.214 predicates recovery of attorney fees  in default judgments on a promissory note, contract, or statute providing for  their recovery. (Local Rule 3.214 [“When a promissory note, contract,  or statute provides for the recovery of reasonable attorneys' fees…”].) The Court was unable to find any provision in  the loan agreement that entitles Plaintiff to recover attorney fees. (Velazco  Decl., Ex. 1.) The most it could find was language stating that Plaintiff could  recover attorney fees in connection with selling a vehicle. (Velazco Decl., Ex.  1, p. 8 of pdf, ¶ 9.) Plaintiff has not presented any evidence indicating that a  vehicle was sold. Plaintiff has not presented any other evidence indicating  that Plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees under statute or law. Accordingly,  the Court will deduct the attorney fees request from the total judgment. The  Court otherwise finds everything else in order. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS  Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment in the reduced amount of $82,785.95.  CONCLUSION                        Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request  for entry of default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $82,785.95. Plaintiff  can submit a new proposed Judgment prior to the hearing or the Court will modify  and sign the proposed judgment.
