And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the application for a writ of possession by Ally Bank against Evaristo Cuellar Hernandez for a 2017 Honda Pilot. The Bank seeks to recover the Vehicle, which is collateral for a loan, and alleges that Hernandez breached the contract by failing to make payments since September 28, 2022. The Bank's application is denied due to insufficient notice, and the Bank fails to provide documentary evidence of the amount owed.
