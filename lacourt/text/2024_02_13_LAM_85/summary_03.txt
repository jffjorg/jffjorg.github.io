And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge grants the County's request for judicial notice of the provisions of Titles 16 and 20 of the LACC amended by Ordinance 2023-001, as well as relevant provisions of the County's General Plan 2035. The Judge also grants Petitioners' request for judicial notice of the same provisions, as well as LACC Chapter 22.184.

The Judge overrules Petitioners' objection to paragraphs 5-21 of the Declaration of Patricia Ursea, finding that the declaration is relevant to the County's meet-and-confer obligation.

The Judge notes that the merits of the Bail Reform Act in Salerno are irrelevant to the general principles for facial challenges. The Judge also finds that the creation of design checklists is a legislative, not adjudicative act, and that the challenge must be under the arbitrary and capricious standard of CCP section 1085, not due process.

The Judge concludes that the facial challenge to the design checklists is unripe, as no permit has been issued which can be challenged.
