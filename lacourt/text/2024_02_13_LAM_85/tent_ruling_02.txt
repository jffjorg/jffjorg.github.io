et al. v. County of Los Angeles et al, 23STCP00750

 
Tentative decision on motion
for judgment on the pleadings: granted in part



 
            Respondents
County of Los Angeles (“County”), County Board of Supervisors (“Board”), County
Regional Planning Commission (“Planning Commission”), County Department of
Regional Planning (“Planning Department”), and County Department of Public
Works (“DPW”) (collectively, “County”) move for judgment on the pleadings for
five causes of action in the First Amended Petition (“FAP”) filed by Petitioners
Fiber First Los Angeles, Mothers of East LA, Union Binacional De Organizaciones
De Trabajadores Mexicanos Exbraceros 1942-1964, Boyle Heights Community
Partners, United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma, California
Fires & Firefighters, Malibu for Safe Tech, EMF Safety Network,
Californians for Safe Technology, 5G Free California, and Children’s Health
Defense.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and renders
the following tentative decisions. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
            1.
First Amended Petition
            On
March 7, 2023, Petitioners filed the Petition. 
The operative pleading is the FAP, which alleges (1) project
ineligibility for exemptions under the California Environmental Quality Act
(“CEQA”), (2) failure to substantially support findings, (3) unlawful colocation,
(4) general plan inconsistency, (5) violation of County legislative land use
and zoning process, (6) improper blanket designation of permit approval process
as ministerial and unlawful precommitment to future approvals under CEQA, (7) violation
of due process, and (8) unlawful delegation of legislative authority to an
administrative agency.  The FAP alleges
in pertinent part as follows.
 
            a.
Introduction
            The
project at issue is an ordinance (“Ordinance”) establishing regulations for the
review and permitting of wireless telecommunication facilities.  FAP, ¶1. 
It eliminates discretionary conditional use permitting (“CUP”) for most
wireless telecommunication facilities and institutes ministerial review.  FAP, ¶2. 
As a result, it strips away site-specific environmental inquiries required
by CEQA.  FAP, ¶2.
            The
Ordinance illegally delegates the Board’s legislative authority to the Planning
Department’s Director (“Director”) and the Highway Commissioner (“Commissioner”)
insofar as both can create new substantive obligations.  FAP, ¶4. 
The Planning Department and DPW would have unfettered authority to cut
the public out of the wireless facility permitting process.  FAP, ¶5. 
They can exercise discretion with no constraint, even as the process is
supposed to be ministerial.  FAP,
¶4.  While the Board asserts this will
close a digital divide for the less fortunate, it actually will worsen the
divide because such persons will have no voice. 
FAP, ¶5.
            Ample
scientific evidence shows that wireless projects can so sicken residents that
it constructively evicts families who cannot tolerate continuous exposure to
the radiation emitted from towers.  FAP, ¶8.  Poor and minority families holding on to
affordable housing lack any financial means of escape.  FAP, ¶8. 
Basic justice demands that these families have adequate prior notice and
a fair hearing before their voice is silenced. 
FAP, ¶8.  The wireless facilities
will endanger the air, water, flora, fauna, and objects of historic or aesthetic
significance.  FAP, ¶9.  They also are not designed to withstand
earthquakes or floods, and they will create new risks of fire. FAP, ¶9.
            Petitioners
seek relief vacating the Ordinance’s approval and declaring that its adoption
did not comply with CEQA, the Government Code, the Los Angeles County Code
(“LACC”), and the California and U.S. Constitutions.  FAP, ¶10.
            
            b.
Ordinance Passage
            Before
the Ordinance’s adoption, Planning Department policy required a CUP for a
wireless facility.  FAP, ¶119.  The Planning Department would then process
the CUP similar to CUPs for radio and television towers.  FAP, ¶119. 
The process was discretionary and required consideration of proper
integration with the surrounding community, public notification of the
application by publication, mail, and a sign posted on the property, and a
public hearing.  FAP, ¶119.  To be complete, an application needed to
conform with the requirements in LACC sections 22.222.060 et seq.  FAP, ¶119. 

            On
March 5, 2019, the Board instructed the Director to prepare an ordinance
establishing standards for the location, height, and design of wireless
communication facilities.  FAP, ¶120.  The Planning Department was required to conduct
outreach to residents and interested parties, prepare an appropriate
environmental document to comply with CEQA and the County’s environmental review procedures,
and present the ordinance and environmental document to the Planning Commission
and Board for consideration at respective hearings.  FAP, ¶120. 

            On March
23, 2022, the Planning Department presented to the Planning Commission amendments
to Title 22 of the LACC (“Title 22 Amendments”).  FAP, ¶121. 
The proposal did not include amendments to LACC Title 16.  FAP, ¶121. 
Over vigorous public opposition, the Planning Commission recommended Board
approval of the Title 22 Amendments.  FAP,
¶121.  
            In a Proposed
Environmental Determination also dated March 23, 2022, the Planning Department asserted
that the Title 22 Amendments qualified for Class 1 and Class 3 Exemptions to
CEQA because the Project authorized modifications to existing facilities and
minor alterations to land with the construction or conversion of small
structures and neither action would have a significant environmental effect.  FAP, ¶122. 

            At a public
hearing on November 15, 2022, the Board discussed the Title 22 Amendments with
County staff, accepted public comment, passed a motion indicating its intent to
approve the Project, and made a finding that the Project is exempt from CEQA.  FAP, ¶124. 
The Board continued to discuss the Project with County staff and accept
public comment through January 10, 2023. 
FAP, ¶¶ 125-26.  
            
            c.
The Ordinance Provisions 
            The
Ordinance allows the construction of new support structures to serve small cell
facilities, also known as small wireless facilities (“SCFs”) and macro
facilities.  FAP, ¶¶ 132-33.  Eligible facilities requests (“EFRs”) to
modify existing facilities also would include co-located wireless facilities.  FAP, ¶134. 
A wire facility can be up to 75 feet tall in industrial, rural,
agricultural, open space, resort-recreation, and watershed zones.  FAP, ¶135. 
If a wireless facility is used to provide temporary service, it can be
up to 200 feet tall for up to six months. 
FAP, ¶136.  
            The
Ordinance does not estimate how many wireless facility structures can be built.  FAP, ¶137. 
It does not limit the amount of new SCFs and macro facilities, including
those on a Scenic Highway or in a Significant Ecological Area, Significant
Ridgeline, or Coastal Zone.  FAP, ¶¶ 138-139.
 The Ordinance permits installation of
new towers and support structures on properties listed or eligible for listing
on the National, California, or County historic registers.  FAP, ¶140.
            If a
facility is on a site with an eligible resource, the Ordinance allows but does
not require the Director to order a historic resource assessment to identify
impacts to historic resources and mitigation to minimize such impacts.  FAP, ¶141. 
The Ordinance does not include any mitigation measures, limit the number
of facilities in any one location, or address the cumulative impacts of such
facilities.  FAP, ¶¶ 142-44.
            The
Commissioner has the authority to (1) adopt and amend a design standards checklist
and permit conditions for SCFs and EFRs (FAP, ¶145), (2) approve or disapprove
an applicant’s engineered plans for SCFs to mount on new or replacement County
infrastructure (FAP, ¶146), and (3) grant a permit when satisfied the
application meets all applicable requirements (FAP, ¶147).  The Commissioner’s action on an application is
the County’s final action.  FAP, ¶148.
SCFs must comply with a design standards checklist adopted
by the Commissioner. FAP, ¶149.  The
Commissioner may approve the structural analysis of the effect of placement of SCFs
on County infrastructure.  FAP, ¶150.
            The Director
may periodically amend the Application Checklist and the Zoning Permit
Instructions and Checklist.  FAP, ¶151.  If a zone or land use category within a
Specific Plan is silent about wireless facilities, the Director may accept an
application for a wireless facility if he or she determines that such
facilities are similar to another permitted use in that zone or category.  FAP, ¶153.
            The
Ordinance outlines the process and eligibility for a Ministerial Plan Review of
existing macro facilities, EFRs, and SCFs on private property.  FAP, ¶¶ 155-158.
 
d. The Checklists
On January 3, 2023, County staff proposed amendments to the Ordinance.  FAP, ¶126. 
The agenda for the Board’s January 10, 2023 hearing made these changes
public.  FAP, ¶126.  The amendments added changes to LACC Titles
16 and 22.  FAP, ¶126.  A change to LACC section 16.25.030.B.2
authorized the Commissioner to amend a design standards checklist and permit
conditions for SCFs and EFRs.  FAP, ¶126(a).  The Board approved the Ordinance at its
January 10, 2023 hearing.  FAP, ¶128.
            On January
25, 2023, the Planning Department released a “Small Cell Wireless
Communications Facilities Design Standards Self-Assessment Checklist”
(“Self-Assessment Checklist”) without circulation for public comment.  FAP, ¶129. 
The Self-Assessment Checklist addressed wireless facilities now subject
to LACC Title 16 and facilities not on County infrastructure or on County
highways.  FAP, ¶129.  The Commissioner made several subjective and/or
policy decisions in the Self-Assessment Checklist.  FAP, ¶129. 
It is unclear why the Planning Department handled a matter that should
have been assigned to DPW.  FAP,
¶129.  
            On the same
day, the Planning Department released a “Land Use Application Checklist - Small
Cell Facilities, Colocations and Eligible Facilities Requests” (“Application
Checklist”) without previous circulation for public comment.  FAP, ¶130. 
The Commissioner made several subjective and/or policy decisions in this
document, including insurance coverage requirements and the notice radius.  FAP, ¶130. 

            On February
7, 2023, DPW published a “Small Cell Facility in Public Right of Way Design
Standards Checklist” (“Standards Checklist”) without circulation for
public comment.  FAP, ¶131.  The Commissioner made several subjective and/or
policy decisions in this document.  FAP,
¶131.  These included insurance coverage
requirements, the minimum distance a facility must be from residential windows,
size limitations, applicable safety standards, and certain aesthetics
requirements.  FAP, ¶131.  These specifics are not contained in the Ordinance.  FAP, ¶131. 

 
            e.
The General Plan
            Guiding
Principle 1 of the County General Plan is to protect and conserve the County’s natural
and cultural resources, including the character of rural communities.  FAP, ¶159. 
This promotes land use development in rural areas that is compatible
with the natural environment and landscape. 
FAP, ¶159.
            The
General Plan also seeks to: (1) discourage development in riparian habitats and
woodlands to support preservation in their natural state; (2) protect scenic
resources through land use regulations that mitigate development impacts; (3)
protect ridgelines from incompatible development that diminishes their scenic
value; (4) mitigate all impacts from new development on or adjacent to historic,
cultural, and paleontological resources; (5) support an inter-jurisdictional
collaborative system that protects and enhances such resources; and (6) ensure
proper notification and recovery processes for development on or near such
resources.  FAP, ¶¶ 160-65.
 
            f.
Relevant Causes of Action
            (1).
Unlawful Colocation
            Government
Code section 65850.6 (“section 65850.6”) only allows the colocation of a
wireless facility as a permitted use not subject to discretionary permitting if
it meets the conditions of sections 65850.6(a)(1)-(2) and 65850.6(b).  FAP, ¶184. 
This includes a certified environmental impact report (“EIR”), negative
declaration, or mitigated negative declaration, or mitigation measures that
conform to the same, pursuant to CEQA. 
FAP, ¶184.
            SCFs
and EFRs can involve such colocation facilities.  FAP, ¶185. 
The Ordinance authorizes the Commissioner to deem an application
complete and grant a permit for a co-located wireless facility when it
determines the application meets the Ordinance’s requirements.  FAP, ¶185. 
The Ordinance violates section 65850.6 because it bypasses the determination
whether an EIR, negative declaration, or mitigated negative declaration was
established on the original co-located facility.  FAP, ¶185. 

            Section
65850.6(c) also requires notice and at least one public hearing on the
discretionary permit for wireless telecommunications colocation facilities.  FAP, ¶186. 
Ordinance section 22.140.760.D.1.a instead allows approval of SCFs
through a plan review which is ministerial. 
FAP, ¶186.
            The
County prejudicially abused its discretion by requiring the Commissioner to
deem an application for a colocated wireless facility complete, and grant a
permit, without complying with section 65850.6. 
FAP, ¶187.
 
            (2).
General Plan Inconsistency
            The
Ordinance is inconsistent with and frustrates General Plan 2035 and its
underlying principles.  FAP, ¶189.  This includes Guiding Principle 1, to protect
and conserve natural and cultural resources like rural communities by approving
land uses and development compatible with the natural environment and landscape.  FAP, ¶190.  Policy C/NR 3.11 discourages development in
riparian habitats and native woodlands to preserve them in a natural
state.  FAP, ¶191.  Policy C/NR 13.1 is to protect scenic
resources through land use regulations that mitigate development impacts.  FAP, ¶192. 
Policy C/NR 13.2 is to protect ridgelines from incompatible development
that diminishes their scenic value.  FAP,
¶193.  Policy C/NR 14.1 is to mitigate
impact from new development on or adjacent to historic, cultural, and
paleontological resources.  FAP,
¶194.  Policy C/NR 14.2 is to support an inter-jurisdictional
collaborative system that protects and enhances historic, cultural, and
paleontological resources.  FAP, ¶195.
            Wireless
facilities can be built up to 75 feet in height in industrial, rural,
agricultural, open space, resort-recreation, and watershed zones.  FAP, ¶¶ 190-95.  Temporary facilities may extend up to 200
feet in height for up to six months. 
FAP, ¶¶ 190-95.  The Ordinance
does not limit how many facilities can be built within the same location.  FAP, ¶¶ 190-95.  Such facilities will pose a fire hazard and
impact the character of rural communities, the natural state of riparian
resources, the scenic value of ridgelines, and the protection of historic,
cultural, and paleontological resources. 
FAP, ¶¶ 190-95.
 
            (3).
Unlawful Precommitment to Future Approvals
            The
Ordinance’s assertion that certain actions are ministerial is incorrect and
violates CEQA Guidelines sections 15369 and 15002(i)(l).  FAP, ¶208. 
Those decisions involve subjective judgment from the Commissioner or
Director.  FAP, ¶208.
            For
example, section 16.25.030.B.2 states the Commission may adopt and amend a
design standards checklist and permit conditions for SCFs and EFRs.  FAP, ¶209. 
This requires the Commissioner to exercise judgment to amend the list at
its discretion.  FAP, ¶209.  Similarly, section 16.25.030.B.3 requires the
Commissioner’s approval of engineered plans for SCFs, but it does not define
how or when the Commissioner should approve such plans.  FAP, ¶210.
            Section
22.140.760.G.3 states that an EFR request may be processed with a Ministerial
Site Plan Review application if minor modifications will bring the facility in
conformance with all standards of the Ordinance.  FAP, ¶216. 
If so, the application does not require a waiver.  FAP, ¶216. 
However, section 22.140.760.E states that an historic resource
assessment “may” be required for a facility to be located on a site containing
an eligible resource.  FAP, ¶216.  This gives the Director two levels of discretion:
whether the EFR request needs an historic resource assessment and whether that assessment
is satisfactory.  FAP, ¶216.
            It
is reasonably foreseeable that individual permits and projects approved under
the Ordinance may have significant individual and cumulative environmental
impacts.  FAP, ¶221.
            
            (4).
Constitutional Due Process 
            A
person may not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of
law.  FAP, ¶228.  Due process principles require reasonable
notice and opportunity to be heard before governmental deprivation of a
significant property interest.  FAP,
¶228.  Land use decisions which
substantially affect the property rights of owners of adjacent parcels may
constitute deprivation of property.  FAP,
¶228.  
            The
Ordinance is unconstitutional due to its vagueness, overbreadth, and failure to
ensure procedural due process, including the failure to provide property owners
with notice and fair hearing when the County processes permit applications and
related approvals.  FAP, ¶229.  The placement of telecommunication devices
near individual properties may or will affect and interfere with individual
property rights, including the right to unimpeded use of property.  FAP, ¶232. 
Despite this substantial loss of property rights, the Ordinance does not
provide any notice or opportunity for a hearing.  FAP, ¶230. 

            The
Ordinance also allows the Commissioner or Director to develop
permit-application design checklists without due process for the public to
review and help shape these checklists. 
FAP, ¶231.
            The
Ordinance is overbroad in that it allows most permit applications to be treated
as ministerial yet provides decisionmakers with considerable discretion.  FAP, ¶233. 
It fails to provide guarantees and safeguards to guard against arbitrary
County action in the design of checklists or the adjudication of individual
applications.  FAP, ¶234.
            
            (5).
Unlawful Delegation of Legislative Authority
            Legislative
bodies have limited authority to delegate their legislative powers to
administrative bodies.  FAP, ¶240.  When they do, they must have ascertainable
standards and safeguards.  FAP, ¶240. 
            The
Ordinance fails to establish this mechanism when the Board delegates its
authority to the Commissioner.  FAP,
¶241.  It does not include a standard to
guide the Commissioner in developing or amending the design standards checklist
for SCFs or EFRs, approving an applicant’s engineered plans for SCF’s to mount
on new or County infrastructure, granting permits based on a conclusion that an
SCF or EFR application meets applicable requirements, developing criteria for
deciding to deny an application or order changes thereto, and approving the applicant’s
structural analysis of the effect of the SCF’s placement.  FAP, ¶241.
            The
Ordinance also fails to establish such a mechanism when it delegates its
authority to the Director.  FAP,
¶242.  It does not include a standard to
guide the Director in how to modify a design standard checklist or decide when
a historic resource assessment is required. 
FAP, ¶242.
            The
delegation of the power to develop or modify the design checklist, or the power
to adjudicate permit or modification applications, violates non-delegation law and
due process safeguards under CEQA and other land use laws.  FAP, ¶245. 
For example, CEQA allows delegation of the power to find a project
CEQA-exempt but not the power to approve an EIR or mitigated negative
declaration.   FAP, ¶245.  The staff’s finding of a CEQA exemption must
also be appealable to elected decisionmakers. 
FAP, ¶246.
 
            f.
Relief
            Petitioners
seek a writ of mandate compelling the County to vacate Project approvals, perform
an adequate CEQA review, and ensure public notice, review, comment, and
participation as required by law.  FAP
Prayer for Relief, ¶A.  Petitioners seek
injunctive relief enjoining the County from taking any action to implement the
Project until it complies comply with CEQA. 
FAP Prayer for Relief, ¶B.  Petitioners
also seek a declaration of the rights and duties of parties to this FAP,
including declaratory relief that the County violated its CEQA duties.  FAP Prayer for Relief, ¶C.  Aside from specific relief, Petitioners
request such relief as this court deems appropriate and just.  FAP Prayer for Relief, ¶F.
 
            2. Course
of Proceedings
            On March 13,
2023, Petitioners served the County with the Petition and Summons.
            On September
9, 2023, the County filed an Answer to the Petition.
            On October
25, 2023, the parties stipulated that Petitioners could file an FAP and the
court would take the County’s motion for judgment on the pleadings off the calendar.
            On November
2, 2023, Petitioners filed and served the FAP.
            On December
5, 2023, the County filed an Answer to the FAP.
            Also on
December 5, 2023, the court granted Petitioners’ motion to augment the record
in part.  It augmented the record with
all requested exhibits but redacted portions of the first 11 based on
attorney-client privilege.
            On January
25, 2024, the court denied Petitioners’ ex parte application to prohibit
the County’s motion for judgment on the pleadings as a common law motion.
 
            B. Applicable Law
            1.
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
            A
motion for judgment on the pleadings serves the same function as a general
demurrer, but it is made after the time for demurrer has expired.  Weil & Brown, Civil Proceedings Before
Trial, (1998) §7:275.  
            The
rules governing demurrers apply to statutory motions for judgment on the
pleadings except as provided by Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section
438.  Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp.,
(“Cloud”) (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999; Lance Camper Mfg. Corp. v.
Republic Indemnity Co. of America, (“Lance”) (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th
194, 198.  A motion by defendant can be
made on the ground that (1) the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject of one
or more of the causes of action alleged or (2) the complaint (or any cause of
action) does not state facts sufficient to state a cause of action.  CCP §438(c). 
Except with leave of court, a motion for judgment on the pleadings
cannot be made after entry of a pretrial conference order or 30 days before the
initial trial date, whichever is later. 
CCP §438(e).
            A
motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general
demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings
or by matters that can be judicially noticed. 
See, e.g., Weil & Brown, Civil
Procedure Before Trial, (1998) §§ 7:275, 7:322; Lance, supra, 44 Cal.App.4th at 198.  Presentation of extrinsic evidence is
therefore not proper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.  Cloud, supra, 67 Cal.App.4th at 999. 
Both a demurrer and a motion for judgment on the pleadings accept as
true all material factual allegations of the challenged pleading, unless
contrary to law or to facts of which a court may take judicial notice.  The sole issue is whether the complaint, as
it stands, states a cause of action as a matter of law.  Mechanical Contractors Assn. v. Greater
Bay Area Assn., (“Contractors”) (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 672, 677; Edwards
v. Centex Real Estate Corp., (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 15, 27.  On a motion for judgment on the pleadings a
court may take judicial notice of something that cannot reasonably be
controverted, even if it negates an express allegation of the pleading.  See
Columbia Casualty Co. v. Northwestern Nat. Ins. Co., (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 457; Evans v. California Trailer Court, Inc., (1994) 28
Cal.App.4th 540, 549.
            In
addition to statutory grounds, a motion for judgment on the pleadings may be
made under the common law at any time either prior to or at the trial
itself.  See Stoops v. Abbassi, (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650; Weil
& Brown, Civil Proceedings Before Trial, (2015) §7:277.  
            
            2.
Telecommunications Act of 1996
            Except
as specified in title 47 of the United States Code (“U.S.C.”) section 332(c)(7)(B),
the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (“TCA”) generally does not limit or
affect the authority of a State or local government or instrumentality thereof
over decisions regarding the placement, construction, and modification of
personal wireless service facilities.  47
U.S.C. §332(c)(7)(A).
            Any
such regulation shall neither (I) unreasonably discriminate among providers of
functionally equivalent services, nor (II) prohibit or have the effect of
prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services.  47 U.S.C. §332(c)(7)(B)(i).  
            A
local government shall act on any request for authorization to place,
construct, or modify personal wireless service facilities within a reasonable
period after the request is duly filed with such government or instrumentality,
taking into account the nature and scope of such request.  47 U.S.C. §332(c)(7)(B)(ii).
            Any
decision by a local government to deny a request to place, construct, or modify
personal wireless service facilities shall be in writing and supported by
substantial evidence contained in a written record.  47 U.S.C. §332(c)(7)(B)(iii).
            No
State or local government or instrumentality thereof may regulate the
placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service
facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency
emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the Federal
Communication Commission’s (“FCC”) regulations concerning such emissions.  47 U.S.C. §332(c)(7)(B)(iv).
 
            3.
Federal Regulations
            Title
47 of the Code of Federal Regulations (“47 CFR”) defines “colocation” to
include (1) mounting or installing an antenna facility on a pre-existing
structure, or (2) modifying a structure to mount or install an antenna facility
thereon.  47 CFR §1.6002(g).  A “structure” is any building used or to be
used to provide personal wireless services, whether or not it has an existing
antenna facility.  47 CFR §1.6002(m).
            A
“small wireless facility” is a personal wireless services facility that (1) is
mounted on a structure up to 50 feet in height, (2) has no antennae with a
volume of over three cubic feet, (3) has no more than 28 cubic feet of other
wireless equipment associated with the structure, (4) does not require antenna
structure registration, (5) is not on tribal lands, and (6) does not result in
human exposure to radiofrequency radiation in excess of the applicable safety
standards in 47 CFR section 1.1307(b).  47
CFR §1.6002(l).
            A
siting authority that does not act on a siting application on or before the
date for the application is presumed to not have acted within a reasonable
time.  47 CFR §1.6003(a).  A presumptively reasonable period is (i) 60
days for review of a “Small Wireless Facility” application, (ii) 90 days for
review of an application to collocate a facility other than a Small Wireless
Facility with an existing structure, and (iii) 90 days for review of an
application to deploy a Small Wireless Facility using a new structure.  47 CFR §1.6003(c)(1).
            “Collocation”
is defined as the mounting or installation of transmission equipment on an
eligible support structure for the purpose of transmitting and/or receiving
radio frequency signals for communications purposes.  47 CFR §1.6100(b)(2).  An “EFR” is defined as any request for
modification of an existing tower or base station that does not substantially
change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station.  47 CFR §1.6100(b)(3).  This can include colocation of new
transmission equipment as well as removal and replacement of equipment.  Id.
            An
“eligible support structure” is a tower or base station as defined in 47 CFR
section 1.6100, provided that it exists at the time the relevant application is
filed with the state or local government. 
47 CFR §1.6100(b)(4).  It is
“existing” if it has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or
siting process, or under another state or local regulatory review process.  47 CFR §1.6100(b)(5).  A tower that has not been reviewed and
approved because it was not in a zoned area when it was built, but was lawfully
constructed, is also existing for purposes of this definition.  Id.
            A
modification substantially changes the physical dimensions of an eligible
support structure if it, inter alia, does not comply with conditions
associated with the siting approval of the construction or modification of the
eligible support structure or base station equipment.  47 CFR §1.6100(b)(7)(vi).  
            A
“tower” is any structure built for the sole or primary purpose of supporting
any Commission-licensed or authorized antennas and their associated facilities.  CFR §1.6100(b)(9).
            Notwithstanding
the TCA or any other provision of law, a state or local government may not deny
and shall approve any EFR for modification of an eligible support structure,
existing wireless tower, or base station that does not substantially change the
physical dimensions of such structure.  47
U.S.C. §1455(a)(1); 47 CFR §1.6100(c).  When
an applicant asserts in writing that an EFR is covered by 47 CFR section 1.6100,
the state or local government can only ask for sufficient information to confirm
this is true.  47 CFR §1.6100(c)(1).  It may not require an applicant to submit any
other documentation.  Id.

Section 65850.6
            Section
65850.6(a) exempts a colocation facility from a city or county discretionary
permit if (1) the colocation facility is consistent with requirements for the
wireless telecommunications colocation facility for which the colocation is
proposed, and (2) that facility was subject to a discretionary permit and
either an EIR was certified or a negative or mitigated negative declaration was
adopted.  The city or county must have
held at least one public hearing on the discretionary permit and given notice
under Govt. Code section 65091. 
§65850.6(c).
For purposes of that statute, a “colocation facility” refers
to the placement or installation of wireless facilities, including antennas,
and related equipment, on, or immediately adjacent to, a wireless
telecommunications colocation facility. §65850.6(d)(1).  A “wireless telecommunications facility”
refers to equipment and network components such as towers, utility poles,
transmitters, base stations, and emergency power systems that are integral to
providing wireless telecommunications services. §65850.6(d)(2). A “wireless telecommunications
colocation facility” means a wireless telecommunications facility that includes
colocation facilities.  §65850.6(d)(3).
 
            C.
Statement of Facts[1]
            1.
The Ordinance
            The
Ordinance applies to all highways and private property in the unincorporated
areas of the County.  AR 16.
            The
Ordinance defines a “SCF” to match the definition of a “small wireless
facility” in 47 CFR section 1.6002(l). 
LACC §16.25.020(I); AR 20, 33.
The Ordinance defines an “EFR” as a request for modification of an
existing tower or base station pertaining to SCF, provided it does not
substantially change the physical dimensions of that tower or base station, and
involves colocation, removal, or replacement of transmission equipment under
the definition of 47 CFR section 1.6100(b)(3). 
LACC §16.25.020(E)); AR 19-20, 32. 
For purposes of this definition, “colocation” is as defined as in 47 CFR
section 1.6100(b)(2).  LACC §16.25.020(E);
AR 20.
            A
permit under the Ordinance is required for the installation, replacement,
maintenance, modification, or removal of any SCF, Temporary SCF, or EFR
pertaining to an SCF on a highway.  LACC §16.25.030(A);
AR 21.  
            The
Commissioner may adopt and amend a design standards checklist and permit
conditions for SCFs and EFRs implementing Chapter 16.25 of the LACC.  LACC §16.25.030(B)(2); AR 22.  The applicant must comply with the public
notification requirements set forth in the checklist.  LACC §16.25.030(B)(2); AR 22.  
            The
Commissioner shall grant a permit when satisfied that the SCF or EFR meets all
applicable requirements.  LACC §16.25.030(B)(7);
AR 23.  Aside from the Commissioner’s
design standards checklist, such requirements include support structure
concealment, a location that does not interfere with use of the highway or flow
of traffic, structural integrity, height, placement of pole-mounted SCF
antennas and associated equipment, a power supply that does not comingle or
share circuits with County power services, above-ground generators, no
artificial lighting beyond the support structure itself, and meeting minimum
safety standards.  LACC §16.25.050; AR
26-28.
            Once
granted, the permit is subject to all applicable provisions of “Title 16 –
Highways – Division 1” of the LACC.  LACC
§16.25.030(B)(7); AR 23.  SCF owners and
permittees also agreed to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local
laws, regulations, and other rules, permits, and conditions.  LACC §16.25.040(E); AR 25.
            The
Commissioner’s final decision on any application is the final action of the
County.  LACC §16.25.030(B)(8); AR 23.
 
            b.
Zoning Code
            The
purposes of the Ordinance’s amendments to the Zoning Code include to (1) provide
equitable, high-quality wireless communications service infrastructure to serve
the County’s current and future needs; (2) establish streamlined permitting
procedures for the installation, operation, and modification of wireless
facilities, while protecting the public health, safety, and welfare of the
County residents; (3) establish standards to regulate the placement, design,
and aesthetics of wireless facilities to minimize visual and physical impacts
to surrounding properties; and (4) comply with all applicable federal and State
laws and regulations regarding wireless facilities.  LACC §22.140.760(A); AR 44.  
            This
portion of the Ordinance applies to all wireless facilities located on private
and public property except for SCFs located in public rights-of-way.  LACC §22.140.760(B); AR 45.  Where another regulation in the Zoning Code
applies to a wireless facility, it takes precedence over the Ordinance.  LACC §22.140.760(B); AR 45.  
            As
in 47 CFR section 1.6002(g)(1)-(2), “colocation” is defined as (1) mounting or
installing an antenna facility on a pre-existing structure, and/or (2)
modifying a pre-existing structure for the purpose of mounting or installing an
antenna facility on that structure.  LACC
§22.14.230; AR 32.
            An
“EFR” is defined as a request for modification of an existing tower or base
station pertaining to SCF, provided it does not substantially change the
physical dimensions of that tower or base station, and involves colocation,
removal, or replacement of transmission equipment under the definition of 47
CFR section 1.6100(b)(3).   LACC §22.14.230;
AR 32.  For purposes of this definition, “colocation”
is defined as it is in 47 CFR section 1.6100(b)(2).  LACC §22.14.230; AR 32.
            Like
a “small wireless facility” under 47 CFR section 1.6002(l), an “SCF” is defined
as a personal wireless services facility that (1) is mounted on a structure up
to 50 feet in height, (2) has no antennae with a volume of over three cubic
feet, (3) has no more than 28 cubic feet of other wireless equipment associated
with the structure, (4) does not require antenna structure registration, (5) is
not on tribal lands, and (6) does not result in human exposure to
radiofrequency radiation in excess of the applicable safety standards in 47 CFR
section 1.1307(b).  LACC §22.14.230; AR
33-34.  
            The
Ordinance outlines the permits that are subject to a ministerial process (LACC §22.140.760(D)(1))
(AR 47) and those that are subject to the CUP process under LACC 22.158.  LACC §22.140.760(D)(2); AR 48.  Any SCF on private or public property other
than a public right-of-way is subject to Ministerial Site Plan Review.  LACC §22.140.760(D)(1)(a); AR 48.  A CUP is required to authorize installation
and operation of any wireless facility of any type that requires a waiver from
one or more of the design standards under LACC section 22.140.760(E).  LACC §22.140.760(D)(2)(b); AR 48.  
            Revised
Exhibit “A” provides a process to authorize limited modification to the plans
of an approved discretionary permit or review that remain in substantial
conformance with the conditions of approval. 
LACC §22.184.010 (RJN Ex. B). 
This type of application is required to colocate a macro facility on an
existing base station or tower with an approved and unexpired discretionary
permit that currently hosts another macro facility, or to make modifications to
an existing macro facility with an approved and unexpired discretionary permit,
including an EFR for the macro facility. 
LACC §22.140.760(D)(3); AR 48. 
Such an application shall be filed and processed in compliance with LACC
Chapter 22.226, which is a chapter on ministerial review.  LACC §22.184.020(B) (RJN Ex. B).
            Any
new application must include all the required materials listed on either the
Land Use Application Checklist – SCF, Colocation, and EFR, or the Zoning Permit
Instructions and Checklist, whichever is applicable -- and which may be
periodically modified by the Director. 
LACC §22.140.760(D)(4); AR 48.
            EFRs
and modifications to existing macro facilities may be eligible for Ministerial
Site Plan Review or a Revised Exhibit A application under certain
conditions.  LACC §22.140.760(G)(1); AR
54-55.
            All
facilities subject to the CUP process must comply with a set of standards.  LACC §22.140.760(H); AR 55.  A Commission or hearing officer may impose
conditions to ensure the approval will be in accordance with the findings
required by the application.  LACC §22.140.760(J);
AR 57.  
            All
wiring facilities permits must comply with state and federal requirements,
standards, and law.  LACC §22.140.760(E)(1)(a);
AR 49.  In Residential Zones, including
public right-of- way, wireless facilities shall be placed no further than five
feet from any common property line shared with adjoining lots.  LACC §22.140.760(E)(1)(b)(ii); AR 49-50.  
            New
wireless facilities shall not be installed on buildings or structures listed or
eligible for listing on the National, California, or County historic registers.  LACC §22.140.760(E)(1)(b)(iv); AR 50.  New towers and support structures installed
on the grounds of properties listed or eligible for listing on the National,
California, or County historic registers shall be located and designed to
eliminate impacts to the historic resource. 
LACC §22.140.760(E)(1)(b)(iv); AR 50. 
An historic resource assessment, prepared to the satisfaction of the
Director by a qualified architectural historian, may be required for a facility
to be located on a site containing an eligible resource to identify impacts to
historic resources and identify mitigation to minimize impacts.  LACC §22.140.760(E)(1)(b)(iv); AR 50.
In Industrial, Rural, Agricultural, Open Space, Resort-Recreation,
and Watershed Zones, the maximum height of a non-building-mounted wireless
facility shall be 75 feet.  LACC §22.140.760(E)(1)(c)(i);
AR 50.  In Zones R-1, R-2, and R-3, the
maximum height of a wireless facility shall be 35 feet.  LACC §22.140.760(E)(1)(c)(ii); AR 51.  In all other zones, the maximum height of a
non-building-mounted wireless facility shall be 65 feet. LACC §22.140.760(E)(1)(c)(iii);
AR 51.  
 
            2.
General Plan
            Policy
goals of the General Plan include the improvement of existing wired and
wireless telecommunications infrastructure (Policy PS/F 6.2) and the expansion
of access to wireless technology networks, while minimizing visual impacts
through colocation and design (Policy PS/F 6.3).  RJN Ex. 2.
 
            D.
Analysis
The County moves for judgment on the pleadings on the FAP’s
causes of action for (1) unlawful colocation; (2) General Plan inconsistency; (3)
improper blanket designation of the permit approval process as ministerial and
unlawful precommitment to future approvals under CEQA; (4) violation of
constitutional due process; and (5) unlawful delegation of legislative
authority to an administrative agency.
 
            1.
Meet and Confer[2]
            On
October 12, 2023, the County sent Petitioners detailed meet-and-confer letters
reflecting its arguments for judgment on the pleadings of the relevant causes
of action in the Petition.  Ursea Decl.,
¶6.  On October 20, 2023, Petitioners
stated that they would not dismiss the disputed causes of action but asked to
stipulate to allow filing of an FAP. 
Ursea Decl., ¶9.  The parties
entered into such a stipulation on October 23, 2023.  Ursea Decl., ¶10.
            Between
Petitioners’ November 2, 2023 filing of the FAP and the County’s December 5,
2023 Answer, County reserved a hearing date for a motion for judgment on the
pleadings.  Ursea Decl., ¶14.  On December 5, 2023, the day the County filed
its Answer, Petitioners asked the County about its intent to file this motion
and its effect on the trial date.  Ursea
Decl., ¶15.  On January 9, 2024, the
parties met and conferred by video for a second time concerning the anticipated
motion and were unable to resolve the issues. 
Ursea Decl., ¶¶ 19-20.
            The
County fulfilled its statutory meet and confer requirement.
 
            2.
Due Process
            The
seventh cause of action alleges that the Ordinance is unconstitutional due to
its vagueness, overbreadth, and failure to ensure procedural due process.  FAP, ¶229. 
This includes its failure to provide property owners with notice and
fair hearing when the County processes permit applications and related
approvals.  FAP, ¶229.  The placement of telecommunication devices
near individual properties may or will affect and interfere with individual
property rights, including the right to unimpeded use of property.  FAP, ¶232.
A challenge of a statute, ordinance, or regulation is facial
if it considers only the text of the measure itself, while an as-applied
challenge concerns application of the measure to the particular circumstances
of an individual.  Tobe v. City of
Santa Ana, (“Tobe”) (1995) 9 Cal.4th 1069, 1084.  A constitutional challenge to statute is
“as-applied” when it turns on specific factual scenario pled, including the
agency’s application of the statute to the petitioner.  Monsanto
Co. v. Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, (2018) 22
Cal.App.5th 534, 550.  
A facial attack on the overall constitutionality of a
statute or ordinance “considers only the text of the measure itself, not its
application to the particular circumstances of an individual.”  Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th at 1084
(citation omitted).  The petitioner
cannot prevail by suggesting that problems may arise in some future
hypothetical situation in application of the statute.  Ibid. 
Rather, he or she must demonstrate that the law’s provisions inevitably
pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional
provisions.   Ibid.  (citation omitted).  Under a facial challenge, the fact that the
statute or ordinance “might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable
set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid....”  Sanchez v. City of Modesto, (2006) 145
Cal.App.4th 660, 679.  If a statute is
constitutional in its general and ordinary application, it is not facially
unconstitutional merely because there might be some applications where it would
impinge upon constitutional rights.  City
of San Diego v. Boggess, (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1504 (citation
omitted).  See also Sturgeon v.
Bratton, (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1407, 1418.
Although the strictest standard
of facial unconstitutionality requires total and fatal conflict in every
circumstance, the courts have sometimes imposed a more lenient
standard.  Our Supreme Court has
acknowledged that it has “sometimes applied [the] more lenient standard, asking
whether the statute is unconstitutional ‘in the generality or great
majority of cases.’”  Gerawan
Farming, Inc. v. Agricultural Labor Relations Board, (2017) 3 Cal.5th
1118, 1138 (emphasis in original).  In Alliance
for Responsible Planning v. Taylor, (“Alliance for Responsible
Planning”) (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 1072, 1084, the court explained: “For a
facial challenge to succeed, the plaintiff must demonstrate the challenged
portion will result in legally impermissible outcomes in the generality or
great majority of cases, the minimum showing we have required for a facial
challenge to the constitutionality of a statute….[W]e may not uphold the law
simply because in some hypothetical situation it might lead to a permissible
result.” (emphasis added).  
The party challenging the constitutionality of a statute
carries a “heavy burden.”  City of
Los Angeles v. Superior Court, (2002) 29 Cal.4th 1, 10.  “A statute is presumed to be constitutional
and must be upheld unless its unconstitutionality clearly, positively and
unmistakably appears.”  Boyer
v. County of Ventura, (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 49, 53 (internal
quotations and citations omitted).  A
court considering a facial challenge to a procedural scheme must determine
whether the procedures “provide sufficient protection against erroneous and
unnecessary deprivations of liberty” and property.  Schall v. Martin, (1984) 467 U.S. 253,
274.
The FAP alleges that the wireless facilities will endanger
the air, water, flora, fauna, and objects of historic or aesthetic significance,
are not designed to withstand earthquakes or floods, and will create new risks
of fire.  FAP, ¶9.  Because there is no limitation on the number
of facilities that can be built, the operation of multiple facilities in a
single location may cause adverse environmental impacts to aesthetics and
safety by increasing the risk of fire hazard and exposing sensitive species to RF/EMF
radiation.  FAP, ¶175.  The Ordinance’s proposed ministerial
processing also raises issues of environmental justice without recourse.  FAP, ¶7. 
The FAP alleges that the Ordinance is facially
unconstitutional because: (1) the placement of telecommunications devices near
[private] individual properties may or will affect and interfere with
individual property rights and the Ordinance “does not provide any notice of or
any opportunity for a hearing.”  FAP,
¶¶230, 232; (2) the Ordinance is overbroad because it allows most, if not all,
permit applications to be treated as ministerial but fails to provide
safeguards against arbitrary actions (FAP, ¶¶ 233-34); and (3) the Ordinance
allows the Commissioner and Director to develop or modify checklists without
due process for the public to review and shape the checklist (FAP, ¶231).  
The County notes that a facial challenge to a statute is the most difficult
challenge to mount successfully because the plaintiff must establish that “no
set of circumstances exists” in which the law could be validly applied.  United
States v. Salerno, (“Salerno”) (1987) 481 U.S. 739,
745.  The law requires the pleading to
allege facts that meet this burden.  See
Cooper v. Equity General Insurance, (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1252,
1263-64.   The County
asserts that the allegations in the FAP do not meet this burden.  At best, they allege that some hypothetical
circumstances may arise that would affect individual property rights.  Mot. at 9.
The County is correct. 
For a facial challenge, Petitioners must allege facts showing that the
Ordinance is unconstitutional in all or the great majority of
applications.  Alliance for
Responsible Planning, supra, 63 Cal.App.5th at 1084.  Petitioners acknowledge that the Ordinance
requires discretionary review, including notice and an opportunity to be heard,
for certain wireless permit applications (FAP ¶2), but fail to recognize that this
admission is fatal to the facial invalidity claim.  Unless all or the great majority of SCFs and
EFRs will be placed near private properties that will affect or interfere with
their property rights the facial challenge fails.  Even then, not every wireless facility
permitted next to an individual residents’ property will have an adverse impact
on the property or its inhabitants.  See
Robinson v. City & County of San Francisco, (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th
995, 963 (affixing small equipment boxes to existing utility pole in an urban
area did not result in significant deprivation of property).     
Petitioners try to distinguish Salerno on the basis that it did not involve a motion for judgment
on the pleadings and held that the challenger must “establish” that no set of
circumstances exists under which the law at issue is valid.  481 U.S. at 745.  Petitioners argue that it may establish
facial invalidity of the Ordinance at trial and is not required to do so on a motion
for judgment on the pleadings.  Id.  Opp. at 12.
            Petitioners
are incorrect.  A motion for judgment on
the pleadings seeks to determine whether the complaint, as it
stands, states a cause of action as a matter of law.  Contractors, supra, 66
Cal.App.4th at 677.  Facial
challenges are routinely disposed of at the pleading stage.  See, e.g., Browne v. County of
Tehama, (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 704, 711. 
As the County notes, courts have held that this means a
petitioner or plaintiff needs to plead sufficient facts to sustain the facial constitutional
challenge.  Rubin v. Padilla
(2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1155; Browne v. Cnty. of Tehama (2013) 213
Cal.App.4th 704, 711.  Reply at 3.[3]
            Petitioners
argue that the County’s argument that wireless facilities may not always be
placed next to houses ignores the liberal construction mandated for the
Ordinance and the fact that the FAP alleged proximity to houses merely as an
example and not as the only instance in which due process is triggered.   Petitioners
should not have to wait until a wireless facility is placed next to a private
property to challenge the Ordinance.  Robinson
also is distinguishable as it involved a specific permit application for
the installation of 40 small structures on existing utility poles in an urban
environment.  208 Cal.App.4th at
953-54.  Opp. at 14-15.  
            This
argument ignores the test for facial invalidity.  The Ordinance cannot be facially invalid
unless all, or a great majority, of wireless facilities installed will create
the safety, environmental, and health hazards alleged.  Whether or not pled as examples, the Petition
admits that discretionary permits will be issued which provide the procedural
due process safeguards Petitioners want. 
This fact is fatal to the facial invalidity clam.[4] 
The Petition also fails to allege facts supporting a
conclusion that the Ordinance is void for vagueness or overbreadth.  See FAP, ¶¶ 229-37.  Petitioners argue that the Ordinance is both
vague and overbroad under United States v. Inzunza, (9th Cir. 2011) 638
F.3d 1006, 1017, 1019, because it allows, under all conceivable circumstances,
hazardous wireless facilities to be ministerially placed at or near private
properties or public places within five feet of private property and empowers
non-elected officials  to make or amend
design standards for permits without safeguards to curb abuses or contest
agency actions.  Opp. at 14.
This argument has little to do with vagueness or
overbreadth. Petitioners allege no facts showing that the Ordinance is vague
such that it cannot be understood by a reasonable reader.  The Ordinance is not vague.  As for overbreadth, the Ordinance provides
for both ministerial and discretionary permits but that fact does not make it
overbroad; the County intended the Ordinance to cover both circumstances.  The placement of wireless facilities near
private property and creation of design standards are not overbreadth issues.[5]
The motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted for the
seventh cause of action.  
 
            3.
Ministerial Designation
            The
sixth cause of action alleges that the Ordinance calls for discretionary review
of permit applications yet designates the permits as ministerial.  Those decisions involve subjective judgment
from the Commissioner or Director.  FAP,
¶208.  For example, the Commissioner may
adopt and amend a design standards checklist and permit conditions for SCFs and
EFRs.  FAP, ¶209.  In doing so, the Commissioner necessarily must
exercise judgment and discretion.  FAP,
¶209.  Similarly, the Commissioner may
approve engineered plans for SCFs, but there is no standard for how and when
the Commissioner should approve such plans. 
FAP, ¶210.  The designation of such
acts as ministerial is inconsistent with CEQA Guidelines sections 15369 (defining
ministerial acts) and 15002(i)(l) (where law requires governmental agency to
act without discretion, it is ministerial) as well as CEQA’s prohibition
against pre-commitment to a project.  FAP,
¶¶ 208, 219.  Opp. at 16.
            The
County disputes whether the Ordinance’s amendments to the Highway and Zoning
Code are ministerial, noting that the amendments do not use the word
“ministerial”.  Mot. at 11.  Petitioners correctly respond that the
Ordinance outlines the permits that are subject to a ministerial review process
and those to which a discretionary CUP process applies.  LACC 22.140.760(D)(1)-(2); AR 47-48.  Opp. at 16.
            The
County then argues that this does not give rise to a cause of action because CEQA
Guidelines sections 15369 and 15002(i)(l) only define
terms and do not impose a duty.  The
cases relied on by Petitioners involve governmental action constituting
pre-commitment for specific projects, not the labels in an ordinance.  See Sava Tara v. City of West
Hollywood, (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116 (city took definite course of action to
approve project before complying with CEQA). 
Mot. at 11.  
Petitioners cite Protecting Our Water & Environmental
Resources v. County of Stanislaus, (“POW”) (2020) 10 Cal. 5th 479,
497, which was a declaratory relief action in which the court held that an
ordinance that categorically classified a subset of well construction permits
as ministerial violated CEQA because at least some permits may involve
discretionary judgment.  The court explained
that the distinction is important because ministerial projects require no environmental
review and mislabeling decisions as ministerial allows an agency to shield them
from CEQA review.  Id. at 487, 499.  The CEQA Guidelines allow an agency to
categorically classify approvals as ministerial only when its conferred
authority is solely ministerial.  Id.
at 498.  The plaintiffs were therefore
entitled to a declaration that the blanket ministerial categorization of such
decisions was unlawful.  Id. at
501.
            The
County replies that, if Petitioners are contending that the Ordinance improperly
exempts EFRs and a macro facility permit as inconsistent with CEQA, the argument
is duplicative of the FAP’s two CEQA causes of action.  To the extent that Petitioners argue that the
entire Ordinance should be deemed invalid because there are some instances
where it violates CEQA, that is not a proper facial attack, particularly since
federal law requires the County to process EFRs ministerially.  Whether the proper interpretation of the
Ordinance is to provide for ministerial or discretionary acts is an issue of
law properly addressed in this motion.  Reply
at 4.  
The County’s arguments are not dispositive.  Even if the sixth cause of action is
duplicative, that is not a basis for judgment on the pleadings.  Nor is total invalidation of the Ordinance
necessary should Petitioners prevail on this claim.  Rather, as in POW, Petitioners would
be entitled to a decision that the blanket ministerial categorizations in the
Ordinance are unlawful.  The
FAP seeks a
declaration of the rights and duties of parties to this FAP, along with any such
relief as this court deems appropriate.  FAP
Prayer for Relief, ¶¶ C, F.  
            The
motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied for the sixth cause of action.
 
            4.
General Plan Inconsistency
            The
fourth cause of action asserts that the Ordinance frustrates General Plan 2035
and its underlying principles.  FAP,
¶189.  Guiding Principle 1 seeks to
protect and conserve natural and cultural resources like rural communities by
approving land uses and development compatible with the natural environment and
landscape.  FAP, ¶190.  Specific General Plan policies seek to discourage
development in riparian habitats and native woodlands as to preserve them in a
natural state.  FAP, ¶191.  Other specific policies seek to protect scenic
resources, ridgelines, and historic, cultural, and paleontological resources.  FAP, ¶¶ 192-95.
            The
County argues that the FAP ignores the fact that the General Plan policies also
specifically address wireless facilities, including the objective to
“improve[d] existing wired and wireless telecommunications infrastructure” and
“expand[] access to wireless technology networks, while minimizing visual
impacts through co-location and design.” 
RJN Ex. 2.  The Ordinance clearly
furthers these specific policies.  A
local ordinance is inconsistent with a general plan only if it conflicts with a
“fundamental, mandatory, and clear” general plan policy.  Endangered Habitats League, Inc. v. County
of Orange, (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 777, 782. 
The FAP acknowledges that the Ordinance makes a general plan consistency
finding (FAP, ¶196) and this determination carries a strong presumption of
regularity.  Petitioners cannot carry
their burden, particularly in light of the fact that the TCA proscribes local
governments from adopting wireless facility siting regulations that have the
effect of prohibiting personal wireless services.  Mot. at 11-12.
Petitioners respond that Govt. Code section 65860(a)(2) requires
consistency with all objectives, policies, general land uses, and programs
specified in the general plan, not a single policy.  A project’s inconsistency with even one basic
and clear general plan policy may scuttle a project.  Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural etc.
County v. Board of Supervisors (“Families”) (1998), 62 Cal. App. 4th
1332, 1341.  Additionally, Govt. Code
section 65300.5 requires internal consistency between various policies of a
general plan, which cannot be achieved if the Ordinance is consistent with only
one policy. The County’s argument about the TCA’s preemption fails because the
County retains zoning authority under 47 U.S.C. section 332(c)(7)(A) and the
County wrongly assumes that the General Plan policies relied on in the FAP
would prevent the provision of wireless services.  Opp. at 17.
            The
County replies that Petitioners do not raise a factual dispute and only argue
that the County is trying to evade Govt. Code section 65860.  Yet, Petitioners do not allege a direct
conflict with any fundamental, mandatory and clear General Plan policy.  General provisions about open space and
natural and cultural resources do not impose obligations incompatible with the
Ordinance.  Although Petitioners contend
that the Ordinance is incompatible with these policies because it permits
wireless facilities to have certain heights, does not limit their number, and
can create a fire hazard, the FAP does not show an inconsistency with these
policies.  For example, Petitioners fail
to explain why a 75-foot wireless facility in an industrial zone is
incompatible with policies concerning riparian rights or protection of natural
and cultural resources.  Reply at 5.
The land use policy at issue in Families, supra, 62
Cal. App. 4th at 1342, was fundamental, mandatory, and clear.  The court also held that a local
determination finding a policy consistent with the general plan carries a
strong presumption of regularity.  Id.
at 1338.  A general plan inconsistency
would exist only if a reasonable person could not agree based on the evidence
that was before the governing body.  Id.  Reply at 5, n. 4.  While the County retains authority to make
zoning regulations under federal law, its authority is limited.  See T-Mobile, LLC v. City of
Roswell, (2015) 574 U.S. 293, 300.  Thus,
if the County enacted an ordinance that limited the number of wireless
facilities, imposed height restrictions different from federal law, or denied
siting applications based on fire hazard or local resident health, it would be
preempted.  Reply at 6.
            Although
the County contends that Petitioners fail to raise an issue of fact, this cause
of action cannot be addressed without the development of facts.  Whether the facilities pose a risk to
the surrounding environment is a factual allegation that Petitioners may
demonstrate at trial.  FAP, ¶175.  The inconsistency between two General Plan
policies and whether they can be harmonized also requires specific facts.  Petitioners are not required to allege
specific examples of inconsistency between General Plan policies because that
is a matter of proof at trial.  
            As
for preemption by the TCA, 47 U.S.C. section 332(c)(7)(A) generally respects
the authority of local governments and instrumentalities thereof as to the
placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service
facilities.  However, a locality may not regulate
the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service
facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency
emissions, to the extent that such facilities comply with the Commission’s
regulations concerning such emissions. 
47 U.S.C. §332(c)(7)(B)(iv).  It also
may not prohibit or take action that has the effect of prohibiting the
provision of personal wireless services. 
47 U.S.C. §332(c)(7)(B)(i).  The
TCA clearly limits the County’s authority on the placement of wireless
facilities, but the County has not shown that these limitations bar Petitioners’
claim of General Plan inconsistency.  
The motion for judgment on the pleadings of the fourth cause
of action is denied.
 
            5.
Unlawful Delegation of Legislative Authority
The eighth cause of action asserts that the Project unlawfully
delegated legislative authority to the Commissioner and Director without
ascertainable standards and safeguards. 
FAP, ¶¶ 240-242.  The Ordinance
unlawfully delegates legislative authority to the Commissioner to adopt a
design standards checklist for SCFs and ERFs, approve an applicant’s engineered
plans for SCF’s to mount on new or existing County infrastructure, grant
permits based on a conclusion that the SCF or EFR application meets applicable
requirements, develop criteria for deciding to deny an application or order
changes thereto, and approve the applicant’s structural analysis of the effect
of the SCF’s placement.  FAP, ¶241.  The Ordinance unlawfully delegates to the
Director to modify a design standard checklist and to determine whether a
historic resource assessment is required. 
FAP, ¶242.
Discretionary legislative powers
may not be delegated to a non-elected body in a way that abdicates those
powers.  Kugler v. Yocum, (“Kugler”) (1968) 69 Cal.2d
371, 376.  The
purpose of this doctrine is to “assure that ‘truly fundamental issues [will] be
resolved by the Legislature’ and that a ‘grant of authority [is] accompanied by
safeguards adequate to prevent its abuse.”  Id.  The
legislature may not delegate the power to make the law, including the
discretion to determine what the law will be.  Carmel Valley Fire
Protection District v. State of California, (2001) 25 Cal.4th 287, 299. 
Generally, “powers conferred upon public agencies and officers which
involve the exercise of judgment or discretion are in the nature of public
trusts and cannot be surrendered or delegated to subordinates in the absence of
statutory authorization.”  Southern
California Edison Co. v. Public Utilities Com., (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th
172, 195.  
A legislature may delegate the
power to prescribe rules and regulations to promote the purpose of the
legislation or carry the legislation into effect.  Kugler, supra,
69 Cal.2d at 376.  The legislature also can delegate if the
administrative officer is governed by a sufficient standard.  Id. at 375-376.  It further may
delegate the power to “determine some fact or state of things upon which the
law makes or intends to make its own action depend.”  Id. at 376.
Finally, public agencies
may delegate the performance of ministerial tasks while retaining for
themselves general policymaking power to determine the terms and
conditions.  Ibid.  Moreover, an agency’s subsequent approval or
ratification of an act delegated to a subordinate validates the act, which
becomes the act of the agency itself.  Ibid.  The word "ministerial" describes
a governmental decision involving little or no personal judgment by the public
official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the project.  14 CCR §15369. 
The public official merely applies the law to the facts as presented but
uses no special discretion or judgment in reaching a decision.  Id.  A
ministerial decision involves only the use of fixed standards or objective
measurements, and the public official cannot use personal, subjective judgment in
deciding whether or how the project should be carried out.  Id. 

A delegation is unlawful if it (1) leaves the resolution of fundamental
policy issues to others or (2) fails to provide adequate direction for the
implementation of that policy.  Carson Mobilehome Park Owners’ Assn. v.
City of Carson, (1983) 35 Cal.3d 184, 190. 
The petitioner must show a total abdication of legislative power through
a failure to render basic policy decisions or assure that they are
implemented.  Kugler, supra,
69 Cal.2d at 376.
The County argues that the
Ordinance, at both LACC Titles 16 and 22, contains legislative direction and
defines relevant safety standards sufficient to enable the Commissioner and
Director to act constitutionally.   LACC
§§ 16.25.030(A)(2), 16.020.050.  As a
result, the Ordinance on its face shows no total abdication of legislative
power.  Mot. at 12-13.
Petitioners respond that this cause of action concerns
contested factual allegations which may not be decided on a motion for judgment
on the pleadings.  Whether the delegation
of design standards is a fundamental policy and whether there has been a total
abdication of authority are issues of fact. 
Petitioners distinguish Kugler, 69 Cal.2d at 375, and Carson
Mobilehome, supra, 35 Cal.3d at 188, as cases not decided at the
pleading stage.  The courts in both cases
also held that there was no unlawful delegation because there were sufficient
standards for the official to use.  Kugler,
supra, 69 Cal.2d at 380-83 (ordinance fixing Los Angeles rates as the
minimum for Alhambra firemen’s salaries was not unlawful delegation because
market forces would set those wages at realistic level); Carson Mobilehome,
supra, 35 Cal.3d at 188 (no unlawful delegation where city set maximum
rent for mobilehomes and delegated the issue of rent increase to rent review
board using 12 non-exhaustive list of factors). 
Opp. at 17-18.
Here, the Ordinance enables ministerial permitting of
unlimited wireless facilities and empowers non-elected officials to make design
standards and adjudicate permits. 
Whether the Ordinance contains all required development standards and
whether they are sufficient are questions of fact.  In fact, the Ordinance leaves out a critical
detail of the distance of wireless facilities from public or private
places.  Petitioners distinguish Sacramentans
for Fair Planning v. City of Sacramento, (“Sacramentans”) (2019) 37
Cal.App.5th 698, 716-717, cited by the County, as a case involving approval of
a single project based on a general plan policy for approval of a project
providing significant public benefits that also was appealable to the city
council.  Opp. at 17.
The County replies that whether there is a total abdication
of legislative power is a question of law that can be decided at the pleading
stage.  See Sims v. Kernan,
(2918) 30 Cal.App.5th 105, 115 (upholding trial court ruling sustaining
demurrer to improper delegation claim).  A
legislative body may delegate some quasi-legislative or rule-making authority and
the standards for administrative application of a statute may be implied and need
not be express.  Id. at 110-111.  To hold otherwise would be to require the
delegation to define the “metes and bounds” of the agency’s authority, which is
unnecessary.  Sacramentans, supra,
7 Cal.App.5th at 717.  The Ordinance
contains pages of detailed design and development standards and specific
permitting procedures and is not a total abdication of authority even if “some
critical details have been left out” as Petitioners contend.  Reply at 6. 

            The
County has not adequately presented the non-delegation issue.  The pertinent question is whether the
Ordinance leaves the resolution of fundamental policy
issues to the Director and Commissioner or fails to provide adequate direction to
them for the implementation of that policy. 
Context is important and the court does not know whether issues such as
placement of wireless facilities near private homes or public spaces are
fundamental policy matters and whether the “pages of detailed design and
development standards” are sufficient direction to avoid a total abdication of
authority.  It may be that this issue is
a matter of law, but even matters of law must be adequately presented.             
The motion for judgment on the eighth cause of action is
denied.
 
            6.
Unlawful Colocation
            The
third cause of action alleges that the Ordinance authorizes the Commissioner to
deem an application complete and grant a permit for a colocated wireless
facility when it determines the application meets the Ordinance’s requirements.  FAP, ¶185.  The Ordinance requires ministerial issuance of
these permits in violation of section 65850.6’s requirement of a discretionary
review, a CEQA determination, and a public hearing for a specially defined type
of “wireless telecommunications colocation facility” because SCFs and EFRs can
involve the colocation facilities described in section 65850.6.  FAP, ¶185. 

            Section
65850.6(a) exempts a colocation facility from a city or county discretionary
permit if (1) the colocation facility is consistent with requirements for the wireless
telecommunications colocation facility for which the colocation is proposed,
and (2) that facility was subject to a discretionary permit and either an EIR
was certified or a negative or mitigated negative declaration was adopted.  The city or county must have held at least
one public hearing on the discretionary permit and given notice under Govt.
Code section 65091.  §65850.6(c).
            For
purposes of section 65840.6, a “colocation facility” refers to the placement or
installation of wireless facilities, including antennas, and related equipment,
on, or immediately adjacent to, a wireless telecommunications colocation
facility.  §65850.6(d)(1).  A “wireless telecommunications facility”
refers to equipment and network components such as towers, utility poles,
transmitters, base stations, and emergency power systems that are integral to
providing wireless telecommunications services. §65850.6(d)(2). A “wireless
telecommunications colocation facility” means a wireless telecommunications
facility that includes a colocation facility. 
§65850.6(d)(3).
            The
Highway Code adopted the federal definition of “colocation” in 47 CFR section
1.6100(b)(2).  AR 20 (LACC §16.25.020(E)).  “Colocation” refers to the mounting or
installation of transmission equipment on an eligible support structure for the
purpose of transmitting and/or receiving radio frequency signals for
communications purposes.  47 CFR
§1.6100(b)(2).
            The
Zoning Code adopted the federal definition of “colocation” in 47 CFR section
1.6002(g)(1)-(2), which includes (1) mounting or installing an antenna facility
on a pre-existing structure, and/or (2) modifying a pre-existing structure for
the purpose of mounting or installing an antenna facility on that structure.  LACC §22.14.230; AR 32.
            The
County asserts that the third cause of action wrongly assumes that the term “colocation”
in the Ordinance refers to the “colocation facility” or “wireless
telecommunications colocation facility” used in section 65850.6.  Mot. at 13-14.  Section 65850.6 applies to an application for
a wireless telecommunications facility that is designed to anticipate that more
wireless equipment will be added on or immediately adjacent to the approved
facility and is approved pursuant to a specific procedure. This facility is
called a “wireless telecommunications colocation facility.”  Mot. at 13. 

            The
County acknowledges that it is possible for a SCF or EFR to qualify as a
“colocation facility” under section 65850.6(d)(1).  However, the County is duty bound to follow
federal law in the TCA, not section 65850.6, and approve EFRs that meet those
requirements.  47 U.S.C. §1455(a)(1); 47
C.F.R. §1.6100(c).  Even if an EFR involves
an eligible support structure that was approved initially as a wireless
telecommunications colocation facility under section 65850.6(d)(3), the County
must consider it under EFR rules permitted by the TCA.  47 C.F.R §1.6100(b)(7)(vi).  Opp. at 14.
            As
for SCFs, a SCF colocation under federal law cannot be a colocation facility
under section 65850.6.  An application
for a SCF might be collocated on an existing structure or it might be deployed
on a new structure.  A “colocation” under
federal law applies to SCFs placed on existing structures which have no
wireless facility whereas a “colocation facility” under section 65850.6 only
applies to wireless facilities placed on existing structures with a wireless
facility.  A SCF on a new structure need
not be a “wireless telecommunications relocation facility” under section
65850.6; it can simply be a “wireless telecommunications facility” under that
statute.  Opp. at 14-15.
            The
County concludes that Petitioners cannot show that the Ordinance commits a prejudicial
abuse of discretion in requiring the Commissioner to deem an application
complete and grant a permit for a collocated wireless facility without
complying with section 65850.6.  The
County need not adopt processes for EFRs and SCFs with section 65850.6’s requirements
because that statute applies to a different type of facility and application
process.  At best, Petitioners show that
some applications processed under the Ordinance can involve colocation
facilities defined in section 65850.6(d)(1). 
Additionally, this claim is not ripe because Petitioners allege nothing
more than a hypothetical state of facts. 
See California Water Telephone Co. v. County of Los Angeles,
(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 16, 22-23.  Mot. at
13, 15.
            Petitioners
assert that the County raises only semantic differences; the result of
colocation under both federal and state law is that a new facility is placed on
an existing facility.  Opp. at 20.  
The County replies that Petitioners’ argument ignores the
scope of each “colocation” definition.  The
general federal definition is broadest and includes placement of any wireless
facility on any pre-existing structure. 
47 C.F.R. §2.60002(g)(1-2), 1.6002(k), 1.6003(c)(1)(i).  The federal definition for EFRs is narrower and
involves placement only on an existing tower or base station.  47 C.F.R. §1.6100(b)(3), (7).  Section 65850.6 is narrowest, defining
placement on a structure intended for “wireless telecommunications colocation
facility” as a structure intended for future colocation facilities.  Reply at 7. 

The court agrees that the definitions are different, but
that conclusion is not dispositive of the claim.  Petitioners are correct that section 65850.6
would apply to an SCF that is a colocation facility for a wireless
telecommunications colocation facility. 
Opp. at 21.
However, the County is correct (Reply at 809) that
Petitioners want the court to rewrite section 65850.6, which only mandates
ministerial review for a colocation facility if it is consistent with the
requirements of a wireless telecommunications colocation facility that was
subject to discretionary review and CEQA procedures and a public hearing.  Section 65850.6 does not perform the converse
by prohibiting ministerial review of every type of colocation except for a
wireless telecommunications colocation facility.  By subjecting a broader set of applications
to ministerial review than required by section 65850.6, the Ordinance does not
violate the statute.  Petitioners have
not shown that section 65850.6 has any bearing on a local ordinance requiring
ministerial permits for colocation wireless facilities.
Petitioners argue that the County admits that some EFR and
SCF applications may qualify as “colocation facilities” under section 65850.6(d)(1),
this is a partial challenge to the cause of action, which is improper.   If any part is properly pleaded, the
demurrer will be overruled.  See Fire
Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court, (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.  Opp. at 20. 

            Petitioners
are incorrect.  The County concedes that
some SCFs and ERFs may meet the definition of “colocation facilities” in
section 65850.6(d)(1), but that fact does not undermine its argument that section
65850.6 does not govern them.  Section
65850.6 only governs a ministerial permit requirement for colocation facilities
placed on wireless telecommunications colocation facilities.  While it is conceivable that some SCFs and
ERFs will meet this limited scope, section 65859.6 does not proscribe the Ordinance’s
ministerial review of a broader range of wireless facilities.  This is not a partial challenge to the cause
of action.  See Reply at 9.
            Petitioners
then argue that 47 U.S.C. section 1455(a)(1) -- which requires local government
approval of EFRs that do not substantially change the physical dimensions of a
tower or base station -- does not preempt the Ordinance -- which does not require
approval or denial of EFRs.  The
Ordinance merely discusses the requirements for an EFR application the County
can approve or deny the application.  It
therefore never triggers the duty under 47 U.S.C. section 1455(a)(1) not to deny
the application.  Section 65850.6 also
sets conditions for an EFR which involve CEQA compliance.  The County can implement section 65850.6 for
EFRs without running afoul of federal law. 
Opp. at 20.
            The
County rebuts this point by noting that federal law requires approval of an EFR
if the federal criteria set forth in 47 C.F.R. section 1.6100 are met,
“notwithstanding…any other provision of law…” 
47 U.S.C. §1455(a)(1).  The County
may also require the applicant to provide documentation [] only to the extent
reasonably related to determining whether the request meets [the EFR criteria]
… and may not require an applicant to submit any other documentation.”   47 C.F.R. §1.600(c)(1).  This clear preemption prevents the County
from imposing for any EFR the CEQA compliance and public hearing criteria
imposed in section 65850.6(a) and (b).  Reply
at 9-10.  
            Finally,
Petitioners argue that federal preemption is an affirmative defense for which
there is a factual dispute.  Opp. at
21.  Petitioners provide no facts that
are disputed, but the preemption issue pertains only to ERFs anyway.  If made solely on this ground, the motion
would have been denied for this cause because the Ordinance’s treatment of SCFs
is not preempted.  See Fire
Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at 452.  But the motion does not concern solely ERFs;
section 65850.6 does not bar ministerial treatment of colocations on any type
of structure.
            The
motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted for the third cause of action.
 
            7.
Declaratory Relief
            Where
a trial court has concluded the plaintiff did not state sufficient facts to
support a statutory claim and therefore sustained a demurrer as to that claim,
a demurrer is also properly sustained as to a claim for declaratory relief
which is “wholly derivative” of the statutory claim.  Ball v. FleetBoston Financial Corp.
(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 794, 800
            The
last three causes of action (FAP, ¶¶ 205-250) seek declaratory relief as an
alternative to mandamus.  The County
argues that they are duplicative.  Mot.
at 15.  
Petitioners concede that these claims are proper because declaratory
relief is cumulative and does not restrict any other remedy.  Case law bars joining declaratory relief with
administrative mandamus (City of Pasadena v. Cohen, (2014) 228
Cal.App.4th 1461, 1467), but the Ordinance is not an administrative approval of
a specific project and rather is a legislative act.  Where a court believes that more effective
relief can be granted through another procedure, it may deny declaratory
relief.  Guilbert v. Regents of
University of California, (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 233, 245.  This discretionary issue should not be decided
on demurrer.  Opp. at 22.  
            The
motion for judgment on the pleadings for declaratory relief is granted with
respect to the third and seventh causes of action. 
 
            E.
Conclusion
            The
motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted for the third and seventh
causes of action, including declaratory relief under those claims.
