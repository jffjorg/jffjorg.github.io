 Case Number:  23STCV21382    Hearing Date:   February 13, 2024    Dept:  85 
H&H
Retail Owner, LLC v. CWHH Inc. et al, 23STCV21382
Tentative decision on application
for right to attach order: granted




 
 
            
            Plaintiff
H&H Retail Owner, LLC (“H&H” or “Landlord”) applies for a right to attach
order against CWHH Inc., doing business as Cabo Wabo Cantina (“CWHH” or
“Tenant”) for $1,092,707.56.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers (no opposition was filed) and
renders the following tentative decision. 
            
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
First Amended Complaint
            Plaintiff Landlord filed a Complaint for unlawful detainer on September
5, 2023.  The operative pleading is the
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), filed on October 16, 2023, against Defendants
CWHH, Catchris LLC, Catchris, Inc, Cristcat Hollwood, Inc., the Cristcat Group,
Inc., CW on the Blvd, Inc., doing business as Cabo Wabo Cantina (“CW”), Robert
Azinian (“Robert”), Christina Azinian (“Christina”); Catyana Azinian (“Catyana”);
and Karine Azinian (“Karine”).  The FAC
alleges a breach of lease, a breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting the
breach of fiduciary duty, approval and receipt of illegal distributions,
fraudulent transfers in violation of Civil Code sections 3439.04 and 3439.05,
money had and received, constructive trust, and unjust enrichment.  The FAC alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            Tenant is Catchris LLC’s successor-in-interest.  The other Defendants are Tenant’s alter egos.
 
            a. Lease History
            On November 1, 2017, Landlord and Catchris
LLC entered into an Amended and Restated Lease (“Lease”) for Space No. C4-416
at 6801 Hollywood Blvd., Suite 411, Los Angeles, CA 90028 (“Premises”).  
            In March 2020, Landlord and Tenant
entered into a Lease Amendment No. 1 (“First Amendment”).  
            On June 18, 2021, Landlord and
Tenant entered into a COVID-19 Rent Relief Amendment (“Second Amendment”)
extending the Lease for two years to October 31, 2024.  The Second Amendment also abated the rent
owed from April through June 2020 (“Abated Charges”).
 
            b. Lease Terms
            Section 4.2 of the Lease requires
Tenant to pay the Minimum Annual Rent (“MAR”) in monthly installments.  Section 1(a) of the First Amendment changes the
MAR to $300,000, or $25,000 per month.
            The Second Amendment waived the requirement
to pay the MAR between July 1, 2020 and the earlier of June 30, 2021 and when
Tenant’s monthly Gross Sales equaled or exceeded $175,000.  Until then, Tenant was instead to pay a
Percentage Rent equal to 10% of the monthly Gross Sales for the preceding month,
up to $20,000.  The Second Amendment also
raised the monthly MAR payment to $26,250 from November 2021 to October 2022, $27,562.50
from November 2022 to October 2023, and $28,940.63 from November 2023 to
October 2024.
            The Lease required Tenant to pay “Additional
Rent,” which referred to all sums of money required to be paid or reimbursed by
Tenant to Landlord under the Lease.
            Section 12.1 of the Lease required
the Tenant to repair, maintain in good and tenantable condition, and replace,
as necessary, the Premises and every part thereof at its own cost and
expense.  This included any piping
exclusively serving the Premises even if not located therein.  Under section 12.3, if Tenant did not fulfill
this duty, Landlord had the right to enter the Premises and make such repairs on
behalf of and for the account of Tenant. 

            Section 16.1 defines the failure to
pay any MAR or Additional Rent as an event of default.  Section 16.2 requires Landlord to provide
three days’ written notice and demand to cure such default to Tenant.  If Tenant then fails to do so, Landlord could
terminate the Lease, repossess the Premises, and pursue any other rights or
remedies under state law.
            Article 24 of the Lease allows the
prevailing party in any action based on a breach of the Lease to recover
attorney’s fees and costs from the non-prevailing party.  This includes any costs of collecting unpaid
rent from the Tenant.
 
            c. Breach and Damages
            On July 31, 2023, Landlord sent
Tenant a Demand for Payment of Rent (“July 31 Rent Demand”) for all amounts due
and owed through July 2023 and prospectively through August 2023.  Landlord gave Tenant until August 7, 2023 to
pay all amounts owed.  Failure to do so
would allow Landlord to initiate an action for breach of the Lease, apply for a
writ of attachment, and pursue other remedies. 
Tenant failed to pay any of the amounts owed.
            Also on July 31, 2023, Landlord sent
a second Demand for Payment of Rent asking Tenant to remove and replace an old
cast iron pipe and fittings below the Premises within 5 days.  Landlord included a $186,750 estimate from Curtis
Plumbing for such replacement.  Tenant
was welcome to arrange for the repairs with either Curtis Plumbing or another company,
but failure to do so would lead Landlord to contract with Curtis Plumbing and
bill Tenant.  Tenant failed to make
arrangements for the repairs.
            On September 5, 2023, Landlord filed
this unlawful detainer action. Tenant has now surrendered possession of the
Premises to Landlord.
            As of the FAC, Tenant owes $750,963.07
in accrued rent, not including allowable interest, late fees, and $518,509.26
in discounted future rent through the end of the Lease’s term.
            Tenant has also transferred assets
and other revenue generating concepts and trade secrets to the other
Defendants.
 
            d. Prayer for Relief
            Landlord seeks, inter alia, $750,963.07
in damages, plus future damages of $518,509.26, consequential damages, legal
interest, and attorney’s fees and costs. 
Landlord also seeks reversal of the Tenant’s improper distribution to
the other Defendants to the extent necessary to satisfy Landlord’s claim
against Tenant.
            
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On September 7, 2023,
Landlord filed notice of an unlawful detainer action against Tenant for the
Premises.
            On September 7, 2023,
Landlord served Tenant with the Complaint and Summons by substitute
service, effective September 17, 2023. 
On September 8, Landlord served “All Unknown Occupants in Possession” of
the Premises with the Complaint and Summons by substitute service, effective
September 18, 2023.
            On
September 29, 2023, this court denied Landlord’s ex parte application
for a temporary restraining order and order to show cause re: preliminary
injunction enjoining Tenant from damaging the Premises or removing any
improvements thereto from it.
            On
October 16, 2023, Landlord served CWHH with the FAC and filed it on October 26,
2023.
            On
November 17, 2023, Defendants CWHH, Cristcat Hollwood, Inc., CW, Robert,
Christina, Catyana, and Karine filed a joint Answer to the FAC.  
            
            B.
Applicable Law
            Attachment
is a prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the
defendant’s assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the
outcome of the trial of the action.  See
Whitehouse v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et
seq.) that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v.
Appellate Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536. 
See Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176
Cal.App.3d 1108, 1115.  As the attachment
statutes are purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly
construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner,
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 879, 882.




            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is
“readily ascertainable” where the amount due may be clearly ascertained from
the contract and calculated by evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (“CIT”) (2004)
115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41 (attachment appropriate for claim based on rent
calculation for lease of commercial equipment).
            All
property within California of a corporation, association, or partnership is
subject to attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
            The
plaintiff may apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the
order and serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the
application, and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
            The
notice of the application and the application may be made on Judicial Council
forms (Optional Forms AT-105, 115).  The
application must be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the
facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.  CCP §484.030.  
             Where the defendant is a corporation, a
general reference to “all corporate property which is subject to attachment
pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010” is
sufficient.  CCP §484.020(e).  Where the defendant is a partnership or other
unincorporated association, a reference to “all property of the partnership or
other unincorporated association which is subject to attachment pursuant to
subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP §484.020(e).  A specific description of property is not
required for corporations and partnerships as they generally have no exempt
property.  Bank of America v. Salinas
Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            A
defendant who opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of
opposition and supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not
later than five court days prior to the date set for hearing.  CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of opposition may be made on a
Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155). 

            The
plaintiff may file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for
the hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
            At
the hearing, the court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right
to attach order and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is
exempt from attachment.  The defendant
may appear the hearing.  CCP
§484.050(h).  The court generally will
evaluate the attachment application based solely on the pleadings and
supporting affidavits without taking additional evidence.  Bank of America, supra, 207
Cal.App.3d at 273. A verified complaint may be used in lieu of or in addition
to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts. 
CCP §482.040.  The plaintiff has
the burden of proof, and the court is not required to accept as true any
affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See
Bank of America, supra, at 271, 273.



            The
court may issue a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff
shows all of the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is
one on which an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is sought for no purpose other than the
recovery on the subject claim (CCP §484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be
secured by the attachment is greater than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (“Kemp”) (2007) 146
Cal.App.4th 1474, 1484.  The court does
not determine whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be
made at trial and is not affected by the decision on the application for the
order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            Except
in unlawful detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the
sum of (1) the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff,
and (2) any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and
any allowable attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110.  CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak
Construction, (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must be reduced by the sum of (1)
the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has in a money judgment against
plaintiff, (2) the amount claimed in a cross-complaint or affirmative defense
and shown would be subject to attachment against the plaintiff, and (3) the
value of any security interest held by the plaintiff in the defendant’s
property, together with the amount by which the acts of the plaintiff (or a
prior holder of the security interest) have decreased that security interest’s
value.  CCP §483.015(b); see also
CCP §483.010(b) (“an attachment may not be issued on a claim which is secured
by any interest in real property arising from agreement, statute, or other rule
of law…However, an attachment may be issued where the claim was originally so
secured but, without any act of the plaintiff or the person to whom the
security was given, the security has become valueless or has decreased in value
to less than the amount then owing on the claim).  A defendant claiming that the amount to be
secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative defense must
make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an attachment
against the plaintiff.
            Before
the issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an
undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any
wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the action.  CCP §489.210. 
The undertaking ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If the defendant objects, the court may
increase the amount of undertaking to the amount determined as the probable
recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP
§489.220.  The court also has inherent
authority to increase the amount of the undertaking sua sponte.  North Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior
Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
            
            C. Statement of Facts
            1. Lease and Amendments
            On November 1, 2017, Landlord and
Catchris LLC entered into the Lease for the Premises.  Gomez Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  Catchris LLC agreed to pay an MAR of
$360,000, divided into $30,000 installments due on the first of each
month.  Gomez Decl., ¶3, Ex. A, §4.2.  It would also pay Additional Rent, defined as
all sums of money required to be paid to Landlord beyond the MAR.  Gomez Decl., ¶12, Ex. A.[1]
            Catchris LLC agreed to repair,
maintain in good and tenantable condition, and replace, as necessary, the
Premises and every part thereof at its own cost and expense.  Gomez Decl., ¶3, Ex. A, §12.1.  This included any piping exclusively serving
the Premises even if not located therein. 
Gomez Decl., ¶14, Ex. A, §12.1.  If
the tenant did not fulfill this duty, Landlord had the right to enter the
Premises and make such repairs on the tenant’s behalf and account.  Gomez Decl., ¶14, Ex. A, §12.3.  
            An event of default included failure
to pay any of the MAR or Additional Rent, as well as failure to fully and
promptly perform any covenant or condition of the Lease.  Gomez Decl., ¶3, Ex. A, §§ 16.1(a), (c).  To enforce its rights following a tenant’s
default for failure to pay amounts owed, Landlord needed to give written notice
of the nature of the default and demand cure of such within three days.  Gomez Decl., ¶3, Ex. A, §16.2(a).  The period to cure a default based on section
16(c) must be reasonable and not exceed 30 days.  Gomez Decl., ¶3, Ex. A, §16.2(c).
            If the tenant failed to cure the
default, Landlord could terminate the Lease, repossess the Premises, and
continue to recover rent as it became due notwithstanding the
repossession.  Gomez Decl., ¶3, Ex. A, §§
16.3(a)-(c).  Landlord’s damages include
(a) all unpaid rent at the time of termination; (b) the amount of unpaid rent
that would have accrued at the time of an award to that effect, less any loss
the tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; (c) the worth, at the
time of award, of unpaid rent that will accrue from the time of award to the
end of the Lease, less any loss the tenant proves could have been reasonably
avoided; and (d) any other amount necessary compensate Landlord for, inter
alia, retaking the Premises and maintaining them after default, including
attorney’s fees and costs. Gomez Decl., ¶20, Ex. A, §§ 16.4(a)-(d).  For purposes of subsection 16.4(c), “worth”
is the amount of unpaid rent discounted at a rate equal to 1% more than the current
discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (“FRB”).  Gomez Decl., ¶20, Ex. A, §16.4.
            In March 2020, Landlord and Tenant[2]
entered into the First Amendment to the Lease. 
Gomez Decl., ¶4, Ex. B.  Tenant
agreed to pay Landlord a Settlement Amount of $175,000 for all Rent owed
through March 1, 2020.  Gomez Decl., ¶5,
Ex. B.  The First Amendment also changed
the MAR to $300,000, or $25,000 per month. 
Gomez Decl., ¶9, Ex. B, §1(a).  
            On June 18, 2021, Landlord and
Tenant entered into the Second Amendment to the Lease extending it to October
31, 2024.  Gomez Decl., ¶6, Ex. C, §5.  The Second Amendment also waived the
requirement to pay the MAR between July 1, 2020 and the earlier of June 30,
2021 and when Tenant’s monthly Gross Sales equaled or exceeded $175,000.  Gomez Decl., ¶11, Ex. C, §7.  During this time, Tenant was instead required
to pay a Percentage Rent equal to 10% of the monthly gross sales for the
preceding month, up to $20,000.  Gomez Decl.,
¶11, Ex. C, §7.2.  This provision
remained in effect until June 1, 2021.  Gomez
Decl., ¶6, Ex. C. 
            The Second Amendment also increased
the monthly MAR by 5% every year starting November 1, 2021.  Gomez Decl., ¶10, Ex. C, §6.5.  This increased the monthly payment to $26,250
from November 2021 to October 2022, $27,562.50 from November 2022 to October
2023, and $28,940.63 from November 2023 to October 2024.  Gomez Decl., ¶10.
            Section 3.1 of the Second Amendment
waived Tenant’s duty to pay MAR, Additional Rent, or Percentage Rent from April
to June 2020.  Gomez Decl., ¶17, Ex.
C.  Waiver of these Abated Charges was
conditioned on Tenant’s full, faithful and punctual performance of its
obligations under the Lease and the Second Amendment.  Gomez Decl., ¶18, Ex. C, §3.2.  If Tenant defaulted and failed to cure such
default, its right to the Abated Charges would cease and damages would include
Landlord’s recovery of any Abated Charges. 
Gomez Decl., ¶18, Ex. C, §3.2.  
 
            2. Notices of Default
            On February 24, 2023, Landlord
issued a Demand for Payment of Rent (“February Rent Demand”).  Gomez Decl., ¶25, Ex. E.  It alleged that since April 2020, Tenant had
failed to pay $62,250 in Percentage Rent, $850,250 in MAR, and $4,178.46 in
utilities.  Gomez Decl., ¶25, Ex. E.  After various credits, the outstanding
balance was $550,323.47.  Gomez Decl.,
¶25, Ex. E.  Tenant had three days to pay
this amount before Landlord pursued all available remedies.  Gomez Decl., ¶25, Ex. E.  
            On July 10, 2023, Landlord sent Tenant Notice of Intent regarding
mandatory repairs under sections 12.1 and 12.3 of the Lease.  Gomez Decl., ¶26, Ex. F.  Tenant had prior notice on April 13 and June
27, 2023, but had failed to complete the repairs described therein.  Gomez Decl., ¶26, Ex. F.  Landlord attached a $17,750 estimate for the
repair cost and asserted it would exercise its right to repair the damage and
bill Tenant for it.  Gomez Decl., ¶26,
Ex. F.  Landlord never heard a response
from Tenant and never received reimbursement for the repair costs.  Gomez Decl., ¶26.  
            The July 31 Rent Demand asserted an
outstanding balance of $626,763.25.  Gomez
Decl., ¶27, Ex. G.  This included $75,000
in Abated Charges, which the Second Amendment only had waived for as long as Tenant
was not in default.  Gomez Decl., ¶27,
Ex. G.  The balance would increase to
$701,763.25 if Tenant failed to pay the MAR installment for August 2023.  Gomez Decl., ¶27, Ex. G.  If Tenant did not repay the balance by August
7, Landlord would pursue all available remedies.  Gomez Decl., ¶27, Ex. G.  
            On August 29, 2023, Landlord issued
a final Maintenance and Repair Letter (“Repair Final Notice”) with pictures of damages
that stemmed from plumbing leaks.  Gomez
Decl., ¶28, Ex. H.  Tenant had prior
notice on June 1 and July 19, 2022, but failed to complete the necessary
repairs.  Gomez Decl., ¶28, Ex. H.  Landlord included a $22,283.26 repair cost
estimate and asserted it would exercise its right to repair the damage and bill
Tenant for it.  Gomez Decl., ¶28, Ex. H.  Landlord never heard a response from Tenant
and never received reimbursement for the repair costs.  Gomez Decl., ¶28.  
            On September 5, 2023, Landlord filed
the unlawful detainer action against Tenant. 
Gomez Decl., ¶31.  On October 4,
2023, Tenant surrendered the Premises to Landlord.  Gomez Decl., ¶31.  
            On October 26, 2023, Landlord sent
Tenant another Rent Demand (“October Rent Demand”) for $750,963.07, including
Abated Charges.  Gomez Decl., ¶29, Ex. I.  If Tenant did not repay the balance by
October 29, 2023, Landlord would pursue all available remedies.  Gomez Decl., ¶29, Ex. I.
            Tenant failed to timely pay the
outstanding balance after any Rent Demand or repair notice.  Gomez Decl., ¶30.
 
            3. Damages
            Rent accrued includes Percentage
Rent of $92,145.24, MAR of $861,512.48 from July 2021 to February 2024, reclaimed
Abated Charges of $75,000, and $2,350 + $2,350 + $17,750 + $525 + $18,569.38 = $41,544.38
in Additional Rent via plumbing and pipe repairs.  Gomez Decl., ¶37.  Of the $1,070,202.10 in Rent accrued, Tenant
has paid $203,476.55.  Gomez Decl., ¶37.  The outstanding balance totals $1,070,202.10
- $203,476.55 = $866,725.55.  Gomez
Decl., ¶¶ 32, 37.  
            Landlord has calculated the current
value of future MAR through the end of the Lease in October 2024 as
$225,982.01.  Gomez Decl., ¶¶ 21, 32, 37,
Ex. D.  Landlord’s calculations assert
this is based on an FRB discount rate of 5.5%. 
Gomez Decl., Ex. D.  Tenant
therefore owes $866,725.55 + $225,982.01 = $1,092,707.56.  Gomez Decl., ¶¶ 32, 37.
            Counsel for Landlord estimates
Landlord will incur $33,550.50 in allowable attorney’s fees and $1,000 in
allowable costs.  Aguirre Decl., ¶6.
 
            E. Analysis
            Plaintiff
Landlord applies for a right to attach order against Defendant Tenant for $866,725.55,
or alternatively $1,092,707.50.  Landlord
asserts that it seeks attachment of this amount plus attorney’s fees and
costs.  Mem. at 16.  However, its application states the $1,092,707.50
sought includes $1,000 in costs and $33,550.50 in attorney’s fees.  App. at 2. 
H&H must be limited to the amount sought in its application.
 
            1.
A Claim Based on a Contract and on Which Attachment May Be Based 
            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  
            Landlord’s
claim is for breach of the Lease and Amendments thereto, for damages totaling
$1,092,707.56 plus attorney’s fees and costs. 
Gomez Decl., Exs. A-C.  Attachment
may be based on this claim. 
             
            2.
An Amount Due That is Fixed and Readily Ascertainable  
            A
claim is “readily ascertainable” where the damages may be readily ascertained
by reference to the contract and the basis of the calculation appears to be
reasonable and definite.  CIT, supra, 115 Cal.App.4th at
540-41.  The fact that the damages are unliquidated is not
determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a standard
by which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by which the
damages can be determined by proof.  Id. (citations omitted). 
 
            a.
Accrued Damages
            Under
the Lease, Catchris LLC agreed to pay an MAR of $360,000, divided into $30,000
installments due on the first of each month. 
Gomez Decl., ¶3, Ex. A, §4.2.  From
July 2020 to June 2021, the Second Amendment substituted a Percentage Rent
equal to 10% of the monthly gross sales for the MAR.  Gomez Decl., ¶¶ 6, 11, Ex. C, §7.2.  It then increased the monthly MAR by 5% every
year starting November 1, 2021.  Gomez
Decl., ¶10, Ex. C, §6.5.  The Second
Amendment increased the monthly payment to $26,250 from November 2021 to
October 2022, $27,562.50 from November 2022 to October 2023, and $28,940.63
from November 2023 to October 2024. 
Gomez Decl., ¶10.
            The
Second Amendment waived the requirement to pay any rent from April to June
2020.  Gomez Decl., ¶17, Ex. C.  Waiver of these Abated Charges was
conditioned on Tenant’s full, faithful and punctual performance of its
obligations under the Lease and the Second Amendment.  Gomez Decl., ¶18, Ex. C, §3.2.  If Tenant defaulted and failed to cure such
default, its right to the Abated Charges would cease, and damages would include
Landlord’s recovery of any Abated Charges. 
Gomez Decl., ¶18, Ex. C, §3.2.  
            The
Lease also defined Additional Rent as all sums of money required to be paid to
Landlord beyond the MAR.  Gomez Decl.,
¶12, Ex. A.  This included costs to repair,
maintain in good and tenantable condition, and replace, as necessary, the
Premises and every part thereof at its own cost and expense.  Gomez Decl., ¶3, Ex. A, §12.1.  This included any piping exclusively serving
the Premises even if not located therein. 
Gomez Decl., ¶14, Ex. A, §12.1. 
If the tenant did not fulfill this duty, Landlord had the right to enter
the Premises and make such repairs on the tenant’s behalf and account.  Gomez Decl., ¶14, Ex. A, §12.3.  
            Landlord
asserts Tenant owes $866,725.55 in rent and damages accrued to date.  Gomez Decl., ¶¶ 32, 37.  To calculate this amount, Landlord applied Tenant’s
payments of $203,476.55 to Percentage Rent of $92,145.24, MAR of $861,512.48
from July 2021 to February 2024, reclaimed Abated Charges of $75,000, and Additional
Rent of $41,544.38 via plumbing repairs. 
Gomez Decl., ¶37.  
            Landlord
does not provide a payment history or other documentary evidence of the amounts
Tenant owes.  At most, Landlord presents
Rent Demands listing the amounts owed at the time by category.  Gomez Decl., Exs. E, G, I.  As Tenant has not opposed, any evidentiary
defect in this presentation is waived.
 
            b.
Future MAR
            Upon
Tenant’s default, even if the Landlord repossesses the Premises, it may recover
the current worth of rent that would accrue through the end of the Lease.  Gomez Decl., ¶3, Ex. A, §§ 16.3(a)-(c),
16.4(c).  For such purposes, “worth” is
the amount of unpaid rent less interest at a rate equal to 1% more than the FRB’s
current discount rate.  Gomez Decl., ¶20,
Ex. A, §16.4.  The Second Amendment extended
the Lease to October 2024.  Gomez Decl.,
¶6, Ex. C, §5.
            Landlord
has calculated the current value of future MAR through the end of the Lease as
$225,982.01.  Gomez Decl., ¶¶ 21, 32, 37,
Ex. D.  This is based on an FRB discount
rate of 5.5%.  Gomez Decl., Ex. D.  Landlord does not present evidence that this
is the current rate.  This defect also is
waived.
 
            c.
Attorney’s Fees and Costs
            Recoverable
damages also include any costs of repossessing the Premises and maintaining
them after default, including attorney’s fees and costs.  Gomez Decl., ¶20, Ex. A, §16.4(d).  Counsel estimates fees of $33,550.50 and
costs of $1,000.  Aguirre Decl., ¶6.
 
            d.
Conclusion 
            Ascertainable
damages total $866,725.55 + $225,982.01 + $33,550.50 + $1,000 = $1,127,258.06.  Because Landlord’s application only seeks
attachment of $1,092,707.56, the excess damages are disallowed.
 
            3.
Probability of Success 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim.  CCP §481.190.  In determining
this issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp, supra, 146 Cal.App.4th at
1484.  The court does not determine whether the claim is actually valid;
that determination will be made at trial and is not affected by the decision on
the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b). 
            On
November 1, 2017, Landlord and Catchris LLC entered into a Lease for the
Premises.  Gomez Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  Landlord has demonstrated Tenant is Catchris
LLC’s successor-in-interest; it signed Amendments to the Lease.  Gomez Decl., Exs. B-C.
            An
event of default under the Lease includes failure to pay any of the MAR or
Additional Rent, as well as failure to fully and promptly perform any covenant
or condition of the Lease.  Gomez Decl.,
¶3, Ex. A, §§ 16.1(a), (c).  One such
condition was that Tenant repair, maintain in good and tenantable condition,
and replace, as necessary, the Premises and every part thereof at its own cost
and expense.  Gomez Decl., ¶3, Ex. A,
§12.1.  This included any piping
exclusively serving the Premises even if not located therein.  Gomez Decl., ¶14, Ex. A, §12.1.  
            Before
Landlord could enforce its rights under an event of default, it needed to give
written notice of the nature of the default and demand cure of such
default.  Gomez Decl., ¶3, Ex. A, §16.2.  Landlord must provide a cure period of three
days for a default based on failure to pay rent, and a reasonable period of
less than 30 days for default based on a breach of a covenant or
condition.  Gomez Decl., ¶3, Ex. A, §§ 16.2(a),
(c).
            Landlord
sent several Rent Demands for amounts owed, each of which demanded payment by a
deadline set at least three days after the Rent Demand.  Gomez Decl., Exs. E, G, I.  Tenant failed to timely pay the outstanding
balance after any Rent Demand.  Gomez
Decl., ¶30.  Landlord has demonstrated a probability
of success on the merits.
 
            4.
Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose¿ 
            Attachment
must not be sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon
which attachment is based.¿ CCP §484.090(a)(3). 
Landlord seeks attachment for a proper purpose.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The
application for a right to attach orders against Tenant is granted in the
amount of $1,092,707.56.  No writ shall issue until Landlord files a $10,000 undertaking.
