            [1] The County
requests judicial notice of (1) the provisions of Titles 16 and 20 of the LACC
that were amended by Ordinance 2023-001 (RJN Ex. 1); and (2) relevant
provisions of the County’s General Plan 2035 (“General Plan”) (RJN Ex. 2).  Both requests are granted.  Evid. Code §452(b).
            Petitioners request judicial notice of (1) the provisions
of LACC Titles 16 and 20 amended by the Ordinance as they appear in the Administrative
Record (RJN Ex. A); and (2) LACC Chapter 22.184 as referenced in the amended
LACC Title 16 (AR 48, 55) (RJN Ex. B). 
The requests are granted.  Evid.
Code §452(b).

Petitioners’ objection to footnote 1 in the County’s moving papers is not an
evidentiary objection and need not be ruled upon.  Petitioners’ objection to paragraphs 5-21 of
the Declaration of Patricia Ursea on the ground that the moving papers do not
cite these paragraphs is overruled; the declaration is relevant to the County’s
meet-and-confer obligation and need not be discussed in the motion itself.


            [3]
Petitioners also address the merits of the Bail Reform Act at issue in Salerno, noting that the high court upheld it
because it contained various adjudicative safeguards for a federal criminal
defendant’s bail.  481 U.S. at 750.  As the County replies, the merits of Salerno
are irrelevant to the general principles for facial challenges.  Reply at 3.

The County also correctly notes (Mot. at 10) that the creation of design
checklists is a legislative, not adjudicative act, to which due process does
not apply.  See Pacific Legal
Foundation v. California Coastal Commission, (1982) 33 Cal.3d 158,
168-69.  Petitioners argue that this
argument is inconsistent with Horn v. County of Ventura, (1979) 24
Cal.3d 605, 614-15, which rejected a legislative defense in a zoning case where
resolution of issues involved the exercise of judgment and careful balancing of
conflicting interests, which is the hallmark of the adjudicative process.  Opp. at 15.
There is no doubt that the creation of checklists is a
legislative act.  Horn decided
that the zoning resolution in question was adjudicative in nature, but the FAP
alleges no facts which could support the design checklist as adjudicative.  Indeed, the checklists have the hallmark of a
legislative act because it is intended for general use, not a specific
determination.  This does not mean that
the checklists cannot be challenged, but the challenge must be under the
arbitrary and capricious standard of CCP section 1085, not due process.

The County argues that the due process claim is unripe based on the fact that,
since a facial challenge fails, Petitioners can only make as-applied claims and
no permit has been issued which can be challenged.  Mot. at 10. 
The County is correct.  No
as-applied challenge is ripe.
