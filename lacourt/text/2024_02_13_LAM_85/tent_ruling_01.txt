  Case Number:  22STCV31684    Hearing Date:   February 13, 2024    Dept:  85 
Atlas VI JCP Carson,
LLC v. Subway Real Estate, LLC and Behzad Salehi, 22STCV31684
 
Tentative decision on applications
for right to attach orders against (1) Subway Real Estate, LLC: granted in part;
(2) Behzad Salehi: granted




 
            Plaintiff
Atlas VI JCP Carson, LLC (“Atlas” or “Landlord”) applies for right to attach
orders against Defendants Subway Real Estate, LLC (“Tenant”) and Behzad Salehi
(“Sublessee”) in the amount of $168,882.42, including $5,000 in costs and
$50,000 in attorney’s fees. 
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers and Sublessee’s opposition (no
opposition from Tenant is on file) and renders the following tentative
decision.
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Landlord
filed its Complaint on September 27, 2022. 
The operative pleading is the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) filed on February
23, 2023, alleging breach of lease and breach of sublease in pertinent part as
follows. 
 
            a. Contract History
            On
June 25, 2012, Landlord’s predecessor-in-interest VCG-Southbay Pavilion, LLC
(“VCG”) and Tenant entered a 120-month lease (“Lease”) for 20700 Avalon
Boulevard, Carson, CA 90746 (“Premises”). 
On July 13, 2012, Tenant and Sublessee entered a sublease for the
Premises (“Sublease”).  On May 31, 2022,
the Lease expired and possession of the Premises was returned to Landlord.
 
            b.
Lease Terms and Damages
            Section
2.01(a) of the Lease requires Tenant to pay the Minimum Annual Rent (“MAR”) set
for each year in monthly installments.  When
the Lease term expired, the monthly MAR payment was $6,054.57.  The current outstanding MAR balance is
$74,290.02.
            Section
2.01(a) of the Lease also requires Tenant to pay Percentage Rental equal to the
product of the Percentage Rental rate in the data sheet and gross sales that
year in excess of the “Annual Breakpoint” also in the data sheet.  Section 3.02 requires Tenant to provide
adequate financial records of such gross sales within 20 days of the end of
each month and 45 days of the end of each Lease year.  Since August 2020, Defendants have failed to
either pay the Percentage Rental or provide the financial records of gross
sales.
            The
Lease identified “Additional Rent” as all sums
of money required to be paid or reimbursed by Tenant to Landlord under the
Lease.  This included utilities under
section 12.01(a).  Before the Lease
ended, Defendants were obligated to pay $1,198.82 per month for electricity
usage.  Outstanding utilities total
$27,385.88.
            Under section 2.08, Additional Rent
also includes a 10% late charge on all payments made over ten days after the
due date.  Outstanding late charges total
$8,569.60.
            Section 6.02 also holds Defendants
liable for any costs Landlord incurs removing any signage necessary to “de-identify”
the Premises.  Landlord paid $3,636.92 to
have this signage removed.
            Section
27.22 allows the prevailing party in any action based on a breach of the Lease
to recover attorney’s fees and costs from the non-prevailing party.  
 
            c.
Enforcement
            Section
19.01 of the Lease defines an event of default as (1) the failure to pay any
MAR, Percentage Rental, and Additional Rent 10 days after written notice from
Landlord; and (2) failure to comply with any other covenant of this Lease 20
days after written notice.  
            Landlord
sent Tenant written notice and demand to pay all outstanding amounts (“Demand
Letter”) in February, March, and June 2022. 
The June 2022 Demand Letter listed the total amount owed as $110,245.50.
 
            d.
Third-Party Beneficiary
            Under
section 19.01 of the Lease, Tenant’s liability under the Lease was limited to
$40,000 plus available insurance proceeds. 
The parties intended to rely on Sublessee for any amounts owed in excess
of this amount.  
            Landlord
is entitled to bring an action for breach of the Sublease as a third-party beneficiary.  The Sublease describes the Lease, attaches
it, and states that the Sublessee agrees to perform and observe all Tenant
obligations thereunder.
            
            e.
Prayer for Relief
            Landlord
seeks $40,000 in damages from Tenant and $113,882.42 in damages from
Sublessee.  As to both, Landlord also
seeks consequential damages, legal interest, and attorney’s fees and
costs.  
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
November 2, 2022, Landlord personally served Tenant with the Complaint and
Summons.
            On
November 27, 2022, Landlord personally served Sublessee with the Complaint and
Summons.
            On
December 21, 2022, Tenant filed an Answer to the Complaint.
            On
February 23, 2023, Landlord filed and served the FAC.
            On
August 16, 2023, Department 50 (Hon. Teresa Beaudet) overruled Sublessee’s demurrer
to the FAC’s cause of action for breach of the Sublease.
            On
September 5, 2023, Sublessee filed an Answer to the FAC.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            Attachment
is a prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the
defendant’s assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the
outcome of the trial of the action.  See
Whitehouse v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et
seq.) that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v.
Appellate Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536. 
See Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176
Cal.App.3d 1108, 1115.  As the attachment
statutes are purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly
construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner,
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 879, 882.




            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is
“readily ascertainable” where the amount due may be clearly ascertained from
the contract and calculated by evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 540-41 (attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for
lease of commercial equipment).
            All
property within California of a corporation, association, or partnership is
subject to attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson,
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            The
plaintiff may apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the
order and serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the
application, and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
            The
notice of the application and the application may be made on Judicial Council
forms (Optional Forms AT-105, 115).  The
application must be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the
facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.  CCP §484.030.  
            Where
the defendant is a corporation, a general reference to “all corporate property
which is subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil
Procedure Section 487.010” is sufficient. 
CCP §484.020(e).  Where the
defendant is a partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to
“all property of the partnership or other unincorporated association which is
subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure
Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP
§484.020(e).  A specific description of
property is not required for corporations and partnerships as they generally
have no exempt property.  Bank of
America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207
Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            A
defendant who opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of
opposition and supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not
later than five court days prior to the date set for hearing.  CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of opposition may be made on a
Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155). 

            The
plaintiff may file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for
the hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
            At
the hearing, the court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right
to attach order and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is
exempt from attachment.  The defendant
may appear the hearing.  CCP
§484.050(h).  The court generally will
evaluate the attachment application based solely on the pleadings and
supporting affidavits without taking additional evidence.  Bank of America, supra, 207
Cal.App.3d at 273. A verified complaint may be used in lieu of or in addition
to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts. 
CCP §482.040.  The plaintiff has the
burden of proof, and the court is not required to accept as true any affidavit
even if it is undisputed.  See Bank
of America, supra, at 271, 273.



            The
court may issue a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff
shows all of the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is
one on which an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is sought for no purpose other than the
recovery on the subject claim (CCP §484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be
secured by the attachment is greater than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            Except
in unlawful detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the
sum of (1) the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff,
and (2) any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and
any allowable attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110.  CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak
Construction, (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must be reduced by the sum of (1)
the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has in a money judgment against plaintiff,
(2) the amount claimed in a cross-complaint or affirmative defense and shown
would be subject to attachment against the plaintiff, and (3) the value of any
security interest held by the plaintiff in the defendant’s property, together
with the amount by which the acts of the plaintiff (or a prior holder of the
security interest) have decreased that security interest’s value.  CCP §483.015(b).  A defendant claiming that the amount to be
secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative defense must
make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an attachment
against the plaintiff.
            Before
the issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an
undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any
wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the action.  CCP §489.210. 
The undertaking ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If the defendant objects, the court may
increase the amount of undertaking to the amount determined as the probable
recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP
§489.220.  The court also has inherent
authority to increase the amount of the undertaking sua sponte.  North Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior
Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            1.
Lease and Sublease
            On
June 25, 2012, VCG and Tenant entered a 120-month Lease for the Premises.  Harris Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  Section 2.01(a) of the Lease required Tenant
to pay the MAR set for each year in monthly installments.  Harris Decl., ¶11, Ex. A.  
            Section
2.06 of the Lease also identified “Additional Rent” as all sums of money
required to be paid or reimbursed by Tenant to VCG under the Lease.  Harris Decl., ¶13, Ex. A.  This included utilities like electricity under
section 12.01(a).  Harris Decl., ¶13, Ex.
A.  
            Under
section 2.08, failure to pay any charges under the Lease within ten days of the
due date would result in a 10% late charge. 
Harris Decl., ¶14, Ex. A.  
            Section
6.02 automatically renders any improvements Tenant makes to the Premises part
of VCG’s property.  Harris Decl., ¶24,
Ex. A.  VCG could designate any such
alteration that was atypical and require the Tenant to remove at its own cost
and expense.  Harris Decl., ¶24, Ex.
A.  If it did not, VCG could remove those
items and demand that Tenant pay the actual expense of such removal and related
repairs to the Premises.  Harris Decl.,
¶24, Ex. A.  
            Section
19.01(a) defines an event of default to include failure to pay rent ten days
after written notice that such amounts remained unpaid.  Harris Decl., ¶24, Ex. A.  Default based on any other breach of the
Lease required 20 days’ written notice. 
Harris Decl., ¶24, Ex. A.  In the
event of such default, VCG could continue the Lease while enforcing its right to
recover all rent from Tenant as it became due. 
Harris Decl., ¶24, Ex. A.  VCG agreed
under section 19.01(g) to limit Tenant’s liability to $40,000 after available
insurance proceeds.  Harris Decl., ¶24,
Ex. A.  
            Section
27.22 required Tenant to reimburse VCG for any attorney’s fees and costs incurred
to enforce the Lease.  Harris Decl., Ex.
A.  Such expenses would qualify as
Additional Rent.  Harris Decl., Ex.
A.  
            On
July 13, 2012, Tenant and Sublessee entered a Sublease for the Premises.  Harris Decl., ¶6, Ex. B.  Section 6 identified the purpose of the
Sublease as the operation of a Subway restaurant pursuant to a franchise
agreement with Doctor's Associates Inc. 
Harris Decl., ¶7, Ex. B.  Under
section 4 of the Sublease, Sublessee agreed to perform all of Tenant’s obligations
under the attached Lease and make all rental payment thereunder to VCG.  Harris Decl., ¶7, Ex. B.  Under section 6, if Sublessee defaulted under
the Lease, VCG could demand, receive, and collect from Sublessee any monies due
thereunder.  Harris Decl., ¶7, Ex.
B.  
            Sublessee
has admitted the authenticity of both the Lease and Sublease.  Turner Decl., ¶¶ 2-4, Exs. G-H.
            On
May 31, 2022, the Lease expired and possession returned to Landlord.  Harris Decl., ¶9.
 
            b.
Breach and Damages
            Ledgers
since May 2019 show Defendants owe $74,290.02 in MAR, $27,385.88 in unpaid
electricity usage charges, and $8,569.60 in late fees for a total of
$110,245.50.  Harris Decl., ¶¶ 15-22, Ex.
F.  The final ledger also reflects an
August 2, 2022 invoice for $3,636.92 Landlord paid to have Tenant signage
removed.  Harris Decl., ¶25, Exs. F, I.  This raises the principal owed to
$113,882.42.  Harris Decl., ¶9, Ex. F.
            Landlord
sent Demand Letters in February, March, and June 2022.  Harris Decl., Exs. C-E.  The February 2022 Demand Letter advised
Tenant it had five days to pay the rent that had accrued since August
2020.  Harris Decl., ¶26, Ex. C.  The March 2022 Demand Letter informed Tenant
that Landlord would now charge a 10% late charge on all outstanding rent
balances.   Harris Decl., ¶27, Ex.
D.  The June 2022 Demand Letter sent to
Sublessee’s attorney asserted Tenant owed $110,245.50 in rent.  Harris Decl., ¶28, Ex. E.  It also warned Tenant that if it did not have
its signage removed at its own expense within five days, Landlord would do so
and seek to recover this cost from Tenant. 
Harris Decl., ¶28, Ex. E.  All
three Demand Letters’s letterheads asserted that VCG had assigned the Lease to
Landlord.  Harris Decl., Exs. C-E.
            Counsel
for Landlord estimates attorney’s fees of $50,000 and costs of $5,000.  Turner Decl., ¶6.
 
            2.
Sublessee’s Evidence
            On
December 22, 2023, Sublessee sent Landlord an offer to compromise the matter
for $40,000.  Opp. Ex. A.  The offer cited section 19.01(g) of the
Lease, which limited Tenant’s liability for default to that amount.  Opp. Ex. A. 

 
            D. Analysis
            Landlord
applies for right to attach orders against Defendants Tenant
and Sublessee in the amount of $168,882.42 each, including $5,000 in costs and
$50,000 in attorney’s fees.
 
            1.
A Claim Based on a
Contract and on Which Attachment May Be Based
            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).
            Landlord
claims $113,882.42 in damages plus attorney’s fees and costs.  Harris Decl., ¶9, Ex. F.  Its claims are based on Sublessee’s breach of
the Sublease and Tenant’s breach of the Lease. 
Harris Decl., Exs. A-B.  Landlord
has contract claims on which to base
attachment.
 
            2. An Amount Due That is Fixed
and Readily Ascertainable 
            A
claim is “readily ascertainable” where the damages may be readily ascertained by
reference to the contract and the basis of the calculation appears to be
reasonable and definite.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537,
540-41.  The fact that the damages are
unliquidated is not determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a standard by
which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by which the
damages can be determined by proof.  Id.
(citations omitted).
            Section
2.01(a) of the Lease required Tenant to pay VCG the MAR set for each year in
monthly installments.  Harris Decl., ¶11,
Ex. A.  Section 2.06 of the Lease also
identified “Additional Rent” as all sums of money required to be paid or
reimbursed by Tenant to VCG under the Lease. 
Harris Decl., ¶13, Ex. A.  This
included utilities like electricity, 10% late fees on all amounts overdue by ten
days, VCG’s cost to remove Tenant improvements if Tenant does not do so upon VCG’s
demand, and attorney’s fees and costs incurred through VCG’s enforcement of the
Lease.  Harris Decl., Ex. A.  
            Ledgers
since May 2019 show Defendants owe $110,245.50 in MAR, unpaid electricity usage
charges, and late fees.  Harris Decl., ¶¶
15-22, Ex. F.  The final ledger also
reflects a $3,636.92 invoice Landlord paid to have Tenant signage removed,
including a deposit to TDI signs.  Harris
Decl., ¶25, Exs. F, I.  This raises the
principal owed to $113,882.42.  Harris
Decl., ¶9, Ex. F.  Counsel estimates
attorney’s fees of $50,000 and costs of $5,000. 
Turner Decl., ¶6.
            Sublessee
argues that section 19.01(a) of the Lease only entitles Landlord to recover
these amounts from Tenant.  Harris Decl.,
¶24, Ex. A.  Opp. at 4.  That was true under the Lease, but the
Sublease changed that.  Sublessee agreed
under to pay VCG all amounts Tenant owed under the Lease.  Harris Decl., ¶7, Ex. B.  If Sublessee defaulted under the Lease, VCG
could demand, receive, and collect any monies due thereunder from Sublessee.  Harris Decl., ¶7, Ex. B.  
            Sublessee
then asserts section 19.01(g) of the Lease limits his liability for breach to
$40,000.  Harris Decl., ¶24, Ex. A.  Not so. 
Paragraph 4 of the Sublease states that Sublessee assumed all of
Tenant’s obligations under the Lease to make rental payments.  It does not state that Sublessee is entitled
to all of Tenant’s rights under the Lease, most particularly the cap on
liability.  Paragraph 6 of the Sublease
makes clear that Landlord may   collect
from Sublessee all monies due upon default. 
No language in the Sublease suggests Sublessee would in exchange receive
the right to the same protections Tenant had, including a $40,000 limit on
damages.
            Damages
of $113,882.42 + $50,000 + $5,000 = $168,882.42 are ascertainable as to both
Defendants.
 
            3. Probability of Success
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            Strict
compliance is required with statutory requirements for affidavits for
attachment.  Anaheim National Bank v.
Kraemer, (1932) 120 Cal.App. 63, 65. 
All documentary evidence, including contracts and canceled checks, must
be presented in admissible form, and admissibility as nonhearsay evidence or
exception to the hearsay rule, such as the business records exception.  Pos-A-Traction, Inc., v.
Kepplly-Springfield Tire Co., (C.D. Cal. 2000) 112 F.Supp.2d, 1178,
1182.  For business records, evidence
should be presented to establish that the record was made in the regular course
of business, at or near the time of the act or event, and the custodian of
records or other qualified witness must identify the record and its mode of
preparation, as well as the sources of information and method and time of
preparation.  Id.
            On
June 25, 2012, VCG and Tenant entered a 120-month Lease for the Premises.  Harris Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  Although Landlord asserts that VCG is its
predecessor-in-interest (Harris Decl., ¶5), it does not submit an assignment or
other documentation of this relationship as evidence.  However, the Demand Letters indicate that VCG
assigned the Lease to Landlord.  Harris
Decl., Exs. C-E.  
            Section
19.01(a) defines an event of default to include failure to pay rent, but only
ten days after written notice that such amounts remained unpaid.  Harris Decl., ¶24, Ex. A.  Default based on any other breach of the
Lease, like failure to remove Tenant property when asked, requires twenty days’
written notice.  Harris Decl., ¶24, Ex.
A.  In the event of such default, Landlord
could continue the Lease while enforcing its right to recover all rent from
Tenant as it became due.  Harris Decl.,
¶24, Ex. A.
            On
July 13, 2012, Tenant and Sublessee entered a Sublease for the Premises.  Harris Decl., ¶6, Ex. B.  Under section 4 of the Sublease, Sublessee
agreed to perform all obligations under the attached Lease and make all rental
payment thereunder to VCG.  Harris Decl.,
¶7, Ex. B.  Under sections 6 and 7, if
Sublessee defaulted under the Lease, VCG could demand, receive and collect any
monies due thereunder.  Harris Decl., ¶7,
Ex. B.  
            Landlord
issued Tenant three Demand Letters in 2022 based on rent unpaid.  Harris Decl., Exs. C-E.  The June 2022 Demand Letter also advised
Tenant to remove signage from the Premises within five days.  Harris Decl., Ex. E.  Landlord did not pay to have the signage
removed until August 2022, well after the 20 days required under the Lease.  Over a year later, Landlord’s ledgers confirm
Tenant and Sublessee have not paid the $113,882.42 owed under the Lease.  Harris Decl., Ex. F.
            Landlord
has demonstrated a probability of success on the merits.
 
            4.
Attachment Based on Commercial Claim
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson, (“Kadison”)
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            These terms “trade,”
“business,” and “profession” encompass almost any activity engaged in for
profit with “frequency and continuity.”  Advance
Transformer Co. v. Superior Court, (1974) 44 Cal.App.3d 127, 139. 
The purpose of the attachment statutes is to confine attachment to
commercial situations and prohibit their use in consumer transactions.  Kadison, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d
at 4.
            Section 6 of the
Sublease stated its purpose was for Sublessee to operate a Subway restaurant
pursuant to a franchise agreement. 
Harris Decl., ¶7, Ex. B.  The
claim against Sublessee is a commercial claim.

Description of Property to be Attached
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268. The requirement of
specificity avoids unnecessary hearings where an individual defendant is
willing to concede that the described property is subject to attachment.  Ibid. 
A general list of categories - e.g., “real property, personal
property, equipment, motor vehicles, chattel paper, negotiable and other
instruments, securities, deposit accounts, safe-deposit boxes, accounts
receivable, general intangibles, property subject to pending actions, final money
judgments, and personal property in decedents’ estates” – is sufficient.  Ibid. 
            Landlord
seeks to attach Sublessee’s real property, personal property, equipment, motor
vehicles, chattel paper, negotiable and other instruments, securities, deposit
accounts, safe deposit boxes, accounts receivable, general intangibles,
property subject to pending actions, final money judgments, and personalty in
estates of decedents.  The description of
attachable property is
adequate.
 
6. Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose 
            Attachment
must not be sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon
which attachment is based.  CCP §484.090(a)(3).  Landlord seeks attachment for a proper
purpose.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The
applications for right to attach orders are granted against Defendant Salehi for
$168,882.42 and against Defendant Subway Real Estate, LLC for $95,000 ($40,000
cap plus $55,000 in attorney’s fees and costs). 
The proposed right to attach order for Defendant Salehi is defective because
it does not describe the property to be attached and must be modified.  No right to attach order shall issue until
Landlord posts a $10,000 undertaking for each.
