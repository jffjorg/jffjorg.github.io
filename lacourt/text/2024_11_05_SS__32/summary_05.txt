And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for costs and sanctions filed by Plaintiff Cielo Guzman against Defendants Dial Transport Inc. and Venerando Bautista. The motion was filed after Defendants canceled the deposition of Dr. Mehta, an expert witness, without providing prior notice. Plaintiff incurred $936 in fees from the deposition service due to the cancellation.

The judge denied the motion, finding that Plaintiff failed to show that the cancellation was frivolous and in bad faith. The judge noted that Plaintiff received prior notice that Dr. Mehta required payment in advance of the deposition and that Plaintiff failed to cite which California Rule of Court was violated by the purported conduct. Therefore, sanctions under rule 2.30 are not warranted.

The judge also found that the cancellation of the deposition was not frivolous and in bad faith, and that Plaintiff's assertions did not demonstrate bad faith and improper motive. Therefore, the motion for costs and sanctions is denied.
