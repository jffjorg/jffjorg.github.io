```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to deem the Requests for Admission (RFAs) admitted. The plaintiff moved for an order deeming the truth of all specified matters and documents in the RFAs to be admitted because the defendant failed to serve timely and verified responses to the RFAs. The defendant opposed the motion, arguing that the plaintiff did not engage in meaningful meet and confer efforts as required by Code of Civil Procedure § 2016.040.

The court finds that the defendant's unverified responses are not in "substantial compliance" with the Code and therefore grants the plaintiff's motion. The court orders that the RFAs be deemed admitted and that the plaintiff shall give notice of this order and file a proof of service of such.
