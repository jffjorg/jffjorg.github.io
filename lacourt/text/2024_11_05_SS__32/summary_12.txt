And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of Ana Sahagun, Esq., counsel for Carlos Escobar Morales, to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in client-attorney communication, but the judge found that counsel did not provide the minimum notice period required by law. The judge also found that counsel's declaration only indicated that the client's address had been confirmed through a property and asset search, which was insufficient to confirm that the address is current. As a result, the judge denied the motion on procedural grounds. The judge ordered counsel to provide notice of the ruling and file proofs of service of such. Failure to comply with the court's orders may result in the motion being denied with prejudice or sanctions.
