And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for trial preference filed by Plaintiff Alejandro Nieves, Jr. The motion seeks a preferential trial date, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 36, subdivision (b), for a trial within 120 days from the date of the hearing. The plaintiff is under the age of 14 and alleges that he suffered a traumatic brain injury after a 500-pound metal gate collapsed and pinned him to the ground.

No opposition has been filed, and the judge finds that the plaintiff has a substantial interest in the case. Therefore, the judge grants the motion for trial preference. The trial will remain as scheduled, but will not proceed later than March 5, 2025. The plaintiff is required to provide notice of the court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
