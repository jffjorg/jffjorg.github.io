**Significant Statements**
```
"...where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Los Defensores v. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1202)
"Discovery sanctions must be tailored in order to remedy the offending party's discovery abuse, should not give the aggrieved party more than what it is entitled to, and should not be used to punish the offending party." (Karlsson v. Ford Motor Co. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1202)
"...the Court has insufficient evidence to conclude that Plaintiff willfully failed to obey the Court's order."
