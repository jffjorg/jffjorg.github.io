```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion by Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) to apply or impress its lien against Rigoberto Zetina's settlement. The court has reviewed the parties' briefs and arguments, as well as the relevant laws and case citations.

The court finds that LAUSD is a passive beneficiary of the recovery and is therefore required to contribute to the plaintiff's attorney fees under the common fund doctrine. However, the court will not engage in apportionment analysis at this time, pending further briefing and filing of a motion to apportion attorney's fees.

The court denies LAUSD's motion and directs the parties to meet and confer to determine if an agreement may be reached. The court also orders LAUSD to provide notice and file a proof of service of such notice.

The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further briefing and argument by the parties.
