And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on two motions: a motion to continue trial and a motion to be relieved as counsel. The motion to continue trial is granted in part, with the court ordering the parties to meet and confer to propose a new trial date on which all witnesses will be available. The motion to be relieved as counsel is denied, with the court finding that counsel has not shown sufficient information for the court to grant the motion.
