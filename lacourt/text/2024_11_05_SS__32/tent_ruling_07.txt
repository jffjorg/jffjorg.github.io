[1] Unlike
in In re Marriage of Sahafzadeh-Taeb & Taeb (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th
124, 141-42, here, there is insufficient evidence that Stolpman’s misrepresented
to the Court that he was ready for trial. Moreover, the Court notes that the
October 1, 2024 minute order states: “At 8:35 a.m. counsel for plaintiff called
to represent he would not appear in the courtroom until 9:30 a.m. as he is
coming from Santa Barbara.” He appeared at 9:36 a.m. (Min. Order, 10/1/24.)
