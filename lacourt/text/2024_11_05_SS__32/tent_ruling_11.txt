successful litigant, who might otherwise receive no benefit because his
recovery might be consumed by the expenses, (2) correlative prevention of an
unfair advantage to the others who are entitled to share in the fund and who
should bear their share of the burden of its recovery, and (3) encouragement of
the attorney for the successful litigant, who will be more willing to undertake
and diligently prosecute proper litigation for the protection or recovery of
the fund if he is assured that he will be promptly and directly compensated
should his efforts be successful.” (Kaplan, supra,
79 Cal.App.3d at 710.)
