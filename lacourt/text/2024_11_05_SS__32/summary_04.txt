Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to reopen discovery for the limited purpose of deposing four witnesses who were not previously disclosed in the discovery responses. The court finds that the defendants acted diligently and that there is time for the depositions to be completed by the trial date. The court also denies the defendants' request for a 28-day trial continuance, finding that there is insufficient good cause for such a continuance. The parties are ordered to meet and confer prior to any further motion.
