MOTION
 
Plaintiff Mikayel Tumanyan (“Plaintiff”) moves to deem Requests for
Admission, Set One admitted. Defendant Alejandro Gonzalez opposes and Plaintiff
replies.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This case involves an automobile accident whereby on January 27, 2023,
Plaintiff Mikayel Tumanyan (“Plaintiff”) alleges Defendant Alejandro Gonzalez (“Defendant
Gonzalez”) negligently operated and backed up his motor vehicle as to collide
with the front of Plaintiff’s parked vehicle, who was unrestrained at that
moment. 
 
 The complaint was filed on September
6, 2023, for two causes of action: (1) negligence; and (2) negligence per se
based on violation of California Vehicle Code § 22106 against Defendant
Gonzalez. 
 
Defendant Gonzalez filed an answer on October 17, 2023. 
 
On January 22, 2024, Plaintiff Tumanyan filed an Amendment to
Complaint, having discovered the true name of defendant Doe 1 to be Co-Defendant
Alma Rodriguez (“Rodriguez”)
 
On April 9, 2024, Defendant Rodriguez filed her answer and demand for
jury trial.
 
Non-jury trial is scheduled on March 5, 2025.
 
On October 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Order that
Matters in Request for Admissions be Deemed Admitted against Defendant
Alejandro Gonzalez, along with the Declaration of Plaintiff’s attorney, Adam J.
Krolikowski. Plaintiff’s proposed order was filed subsequently on October 21,
2024. Also on October 21, 2024, Defendant Gonzalez filed his Opposition or
otherwise “Declaration of Michael T. Haw (“Haw Decl.”) to which Plaintiff
replied to on October 29, 2024. 
 
 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Legal Standard
 
 A
responding party must respond to each propounded request for admission with
either a substantive answer or an objection to the particular request. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2033.210.) 
 
A propounding party may move for an order deeming
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted if the responding party fails to serve a timely
response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2033.280, subd. (b); 2033.250,
subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve a timely
response “waives any objection to the requests, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product” unless the Court grants it
relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall
make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Id. at subd. (c).) 
 
Discussion
 
On July 11, 2024, Plaintiff Tumanyan propounded and served on
Defendant Gonzalez, Request for Admissions, Set One (“RFAs”) and now moves the
Court for an order pursuant to Sections 2023.010 et seq. and 2033.280 of the
Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) that the truth of all specified matters and
documents in said RFAs be deemed admitted. (Mot., pg. 2.) Plaintiff makes the
instant motion on the grounds that Defendant Gonzalez failed to serve timely
verified responses to Plaintiff Tumanyan’s RFAs and, instead, Defense Counsel
served unverified responses on July 26, 2024. (Id.) Defense Counsel
included the following statement in the unverified responses:
 
“UNVERIFIED RESPONSE We have been
unable to communicate with Defendant, ALEJANDRO GONZALEZ, and are therefore
unable to provide verified responses to this Request For Admission. However, in
the spirit of discovery we have provided unverified responses based on the
information known. If the information is not known, no information is
provided.” 
 
(Krolikowski Decl., ¶ 2,Ex B.)
 
Plaintiff
asserts that unsworn responses are tantamount to no responses at all. (See
Allen-Pacific, Ltd. v. Superior Court (1997) 57 Cal. App. 4th 1546,
1550–1551, 67 Cal. Rptr. 2d 804, disapproved on other grounds in Wilcox
v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal. 4th 973, 983 n.12, 90 Cal. Rptr. 2d 260, 267,
987 P.2d 727; Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal. App. 3d 632,
636, 253 Cal. Rptr. 762.)
 
In sum, Plaintiff concludes that Defendant’s unverified and unsworn
responses are deemed under the law as no response, as well as a failure to
serve a timely response and argues that the Court should deem the underlying
RFAs admitted due to Defendant’s unverified and untimely responses. Plaintiff further
argues that a failure to serve a timely response waives any objections to the
requests, including based on privilege or on the protection for work product
under CCP §§ 2018.010 et seq. and 2033.280(a). 
 
In response, Defense Counsel, Michael T. Haw submits a declaration
(“Haw Decl.”) in lieu of an Opposition. (Haw Decl., ¶ 2.) Counsel Haw declares
that on October 4, 2023, his office received the file for this case and began
attempts to make contact with Defendant Gonzalaz and on October 17, 2024, made
contact with Defendant Gonzalez. (Id., ¶¶ 4-5.) At that time, Counsel
Haw obtained permission to represent Gonzalez in the matter and filed
Gonzalez’s Answer to the Complaint. (Id., ¶ 5.) 
 
On July 22, 2024, Haw’s office tried to contact Defendant without
success. (Id., ¶ 18.) On July 25, 2024, Haw’s office initiated a
claimant search with Loya Insurance Group to locate and make contact with
Defendant. (Id., ¶ 20.) Defense Counsel also contacted Plaintiff’s
Counsel to request a one-day extension for Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s
RFAs which Plaintiff granted. (Id., ¶ 20.) On July 26, 2024, Defense
Counsel again received a response from the claimant search that they were
unsuccessful in locating Defendant Gonzalez. (Id., ¶ 21.) Thus, Defense
Counsel served Defendant’s unverified responses to Plaintiff’s RFAs upon
Plaintiff’s Counsel. (Id.) From August 1, 2024 until August 27, 2024,
Defense Counsel continuously sought updates on claimant’s search and
consistently received the response that they were unsuccessful in locating
Defendant. (Id., ¶¶ 22-26.) 
 
Then, on August 28, 2024, Defense Counsel retained a private
investigator to locate Defendant which who notified Defense Counsel on
September 3, 2024, that they had made contact with Defendant. (Id., ¶¶
27-28.) Defense Counsel then subsequently attempted to make contact with
Defendant on September 27, October 14, and October 15 of 2024 but were
unsuccessful in making contact with Defendant thereafter. (Id., ¶
30-32.) Nevertheless, Defense Counsel argues that the instant motion should be
denied on the grounds that Plaintiff’s Counsel did not engage in meaningful
meet and confer efforts as required by CCP § 2016.040. (Opp., pg. 3.) Defense
argues that Plaintiff’s unfulfilled meet and confer obligations is basis alone
to deny the instant motion. (Id.)
 
In Reply, Plaintiff argues Defendant offers no legal authority in its
Opposition for the denial of the instant motion. (Reply, pg. 1.) Furthermore,
Plaintiff argues that this Court is required to enter an order deeming admitted
the matters specified in the RFAs unless it finds that the responding party has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response “that is in
substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Reply, pgs. 1-2.) Given an
unverified response is not in “substantial compliance” with the Code, Plaintiff
argues that the instant motion must be granted and the RFAs must be deemed
admitted. (Id.)
 
Because no verified responses have been provided, the motion is
granted.
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem RFAs, Set One Admitted. 
 
Plaintiff shall give notice of this order and file a proof of service
of such.
