## Tentative Ruling Summary 

**Case Number:** 22STCV23696
**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023
**Dept:** 68
**Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant:** L.A. Law Inc. and F. Bari Nejadpour
**Defendant/Cross-Complainant:** Shahrzad Shahili

**Background:** 

This case involves a dispute between an attorney, F. Bari Nejadpour, and his former client, Shahrzad Shahili. L.A. Law Inc., the law firm where Nejadpour works, is also a party. Shahili originally sued the law firm for unpaid legal fees. The law firm counter-sued, alleging Shahili breached a retainer agreement. 

Shahili has filed a second amended cross-complaint (SACC) against the law firm and Nejadpour, alleging five causes of action:

1. **Professional Negligence/Legal Malpractice:** Shahili claims Nejadpour provided negligent legal advice and representation.
2. **Breach of Fiduciary Duty:** Shahili alleges Nejadpour breached his fiduciary duty as her attorney.
3. **Fraud and Deceit:** Shahili claims Nejadpour made false representations about his experience and the outcome of her case.
4. **Breach of Contract:** Shahili claims Nejadpour breached the retainer agreement by not having professional liability insurance and failing to release her files.
5. **Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress:** Shahili claims Nejadpour's actions caused her emotional distress.

**Analysis:**

The judge considered each cause of action:

* **First and Second Causes of Action (Negligence and Breach of Fiduciary Duty):** The judge found these claims insufficiently detailed and sustained the demurrer, giving Shahili leave to amend.
* **Third Cause of Action (Fraud):** The judge found this claim sufficiently detailed and overruled the demurrer.
* **Fourth Cause of Action (Breach of Contract):** The judge found this claim sufficiently detailed and overruled the demurrer.
* **Fifth Cause of Action (Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress):** The judge found this claim insufficiently detailed and sustained the demurrer, giving Shahili leave to amend.

**Order:**

The judge ordered Shahili to amend her First, Second, and Fifth Causes of Action within 20 days. The demurrer to her Third and Fourth Causes of Action was overruled. 


**English Text Summary:**

The judge has reviewed the legal arguments presented by both sides in this case, which involves a dispute over legal fees and alleged malpractice. The judge has ruled that Shahili's claims of negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligent infliction of emotional distress need to be more detailed. 

Shahili has been given 20 days to revise and clarify these claims. Meanwhile, the judge has rejected the law firm's argument against Shahili's claims of fraud and breach of contract.

**Tentative Ruling**
**Case Number:** 22STCV23696
**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023
**Dept:** 68

**Plaintiff/Cross-Defendants:** L.A. Law Inc. and F. Bari Nejadpour (Cross-Defendants)
**Responding Party:** Defendant/Cross-Complainant: Shahrzad Shahili

**Background:** The present case arises from Shahrzad Shahili's alleged breach of a retainer agreement with L.A. Law Inc. and F. Bari Nejadpour (Cross-Defendants) for failure to pay outstanding legal services fees and costs. Cross-Defendants have filed a demurrer to Shahili's Second Amended Cross-Complaint (SACC), which alleges five causes of action against Cross-Defendants for professional negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud and deceit, breach of contract, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.

**Analysis:**

1. **Entire Complaint:** Despite the Court's previous ruling on the statute of limitations issue, Cross-Defendants again devote a section of their demurrer to this issue. No new facts are pled in the SACC, and the Court has already ruled on this issue.
2. **First Cause of Action (Professional Negligence/Legal Malpractice):** Shahili's SACC pleads that she was forced to take a lower settlement offer because Nejadpour yelled at her to take it, and that Nejadpour and his associate did not know how to take the deposition of Shahili's husband. However, Shahili's SACC does not specify how accepting the $200,000 settlement was injurious to her or what amount she thinks she should have received. Cross-Defendants' demurrer to this cause of action is sustained with leave to amend.
3. **Second Cause of Action (Breach of Fiduciary Duty):** Shahili has pled that Cross-Defendants owed her a fiduciary duty as her attorneys, but the facts are vague and do not specify how they breached this duty. Cross-Defendants' demurrer to this cause of action is sustained with leave to amend.
4. **Third Cause of Action (Fraud and Deceit):** Shahili's SACC alleges that Nejadpour made misrepresentations to her at their first meeting, including promises of a $1,000,000 settlement. The other elements of fraud are also pled. Cross-Defendants' demurrer to this cause of action is overruled.
5. **Fourth Cause of Action (Breach of Contract):** Shahili's SACC incorporates the retainer agreement as Exhibit A, which indicates that Nejadpour told her he had professional liability insurance when he did not. Shahili's SACC also pleads that Nejadpour did not release her file to her after termination of her representation. Cross-Defendants' demurrer to this cause of action is overruled.
6. **Fifth Cause of Action (Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress):** Shahili has not pled facts sufficient for a cause of action for emotional distress. Cross-Defendants' demurrer to this cause of action is sustained with leave to amend.

**Order:**

1. Cross-Defendants' Demurrer to Shahili's First, Second, and Fifth Causes of Action is sustained with leave to amend.
2. Cross-Defendants' Demurrer to Shahili's Third and Fourth Causes of Action is overruled.
3. Shahili is given 20 days leave to amend.

**Case Number:** 22STCV23696
**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023
**Dept:** 68
**Parties:** Law Offices of L.A. Law Inc., F. Bari Nejadpour (Cross-Defendants) vs. Shahrzad Shahili (Defendant/Cross-Complainant)

**Background:**

- Cross-Defendant L.A. Law filed a complaint on July 21, 2022, alleging five causes of action against Shahili for breach of contract, quantum meruit for services rendered, account stated, book account, and fraud.
- Shahili's Second Amended Cross-Complaint (SACC) alleges five causes of action against Cross-Defendants L.A. Law and F. Bari Nejadpour for professional negligence legal malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud and deceit, breach of contract, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.

**Demurrer Analysis:**

- The demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.
- Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.
- Shahili must show actual damage, not nominal damage, speculative harm, or the threat of future harm.

**Causes of Action Analysis:**

1. **First Cause of Action for Professional Negligence Legal Malpractice:** Sustained with leave to amend. Shahili's SACC does not clearly state the actual loss or damage she sustained.
2. **Second Cause of Action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty:** Sustained with leave to amend. Shahili's allegations are not specific enough to show how Cross-Defendants breached their fiduciary duty.
3. **Third Cause of Action for Fraud and Deceit:** Overruled. Shahili has pled sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for fraud and deceit.
4. **Fourth Cause of Action for Breach of Contract:** Overruled. Shahili has pled that Cross-Defendants breached the retainer agreement.
5. **Fifth Cause of Action for Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress:** Sustained with leave to amend. Shahili has not pled sufficient facts to show what her damages were or why this should be a separate cause of action.

**Order:**

1. Cross-Defendants' Demurrer to Shahili's First, Second, and Fifth Causes of Action is sustained with leave to amend.
2. Cross-Defendants' Demurrer to Shahili's Third and Fourth Causes of Action is overruled.
3. Shahili is given 20 days leave to amend.
