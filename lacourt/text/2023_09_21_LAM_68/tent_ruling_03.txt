Judgment on the Pleadings
Christopher
L. Boggs vs. Cetera Financial Group, Inc., et al., 23STCV01348
Moving Parties:
Defendants and Cross-Complainants Cetera Financial Group, Inc. and First Allied
Securities, Inc.

Opposing
Party: Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Christopher L. Boggs

Background
Plaintiff filed this lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that he has
no liability on 4 promissory notes that he gave in favor of Defendants.  He claims that the 4 year statute of limitations
ran.  He also seeks injunctive relief.
Plaintiff’s complaint pleads that he was personally responsible for
four promissory notes as part of a forgivable advance with Defendants. Under
the terms of the promissory notes, if Plaintiff left Defendants’ broker-dealer
group, this would result in an acceleration of the notes with the lump sum of
any debt remaining being due immediately. On or about November 23, 2018, Boggs
resigned. Defendants sent him a demand for the amounts due and owing on the
promissory notes on December 12, 2018.
Plaintiff argues in his complaint, filed on January 20, 2023, that he
is entitled to declaratory judgment because the notes provided for a four year
statute of limitations upon acceleration. Whether November 23, 2018, or
December 12, 2018, is used as the date for the acceleration, four years have
passed.
Defendants and Cross-Complainants Cetera Financial Group, Inc. and
First Allied Securities, Inc. filed this motion for judgment on the pleadings
on August 23, 2023. In Defendants’ motion, they argue that Plaintiff and
Cross-Defendant Christopher L. Boggs (Plaintiff) cannot maintain his complaint
because no controversy exists that would allow him declaratory judgment.
Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings is premised on their
contention that the statute of limitations would have been tolled from April 6,
2020, to October 1, 2020, under the tolling provision of California Emergency
Rule 9, issued during the COVID-19 pandemic. They argue that this means that
four years would not yet have passed at the time they filed the Cross-Complaint
on January 31, 2023, because they would have had an extra 178 days past the
four year statute of limitations period. Defendants argue that this tolling
means that no actual controversy would exist for Plaintiff’s complaint because
the statute of limitations would not yet have run when Defendants filed their
Cross-Complaint.
The Court agrees with Defendants that Emergency Rule 9 extended the
statute of limitations.
“The Advisory Committee comment on
Emergency rule 9 states that “Emergency rule 9 is intended to apply broadly to
toll any statute of limitations on the filing of a pleading in court asserting
a civil cause of action.”  Committee
for Sound Water & Land Development v. City of Seaside (2022) 79
Cal.App.5th 389, 402.
““A tolling provision suspends the running
of a limitations period.”  (Shalabi v.
City of Fontana (2021) 11 Cal.5th 842, 845, 280 Cal.Rptr.3d 597, 489 P.3d
714.)  In other words, “the limitations
period stops running during the tolling event, and begins to run again only
when the tolling event has concluded. As a consequence, the tolled interval, no
matter when it took place, is tacked onto the end of the limitations period,
thus extending the deadline for suit by the entire length of time during which
the tolling event previously occurred.”  (Lantzy v. Centex Homes (2003) 31 Cal.4th
363, 370–371, 2 Cal.Rptr.3d 655, 73 P.3d 517.)” 
Committee for Sound Water & Land Development v. City of Seaside
(2022) 79 Cal.App.5th 389, 403.
Defendants have filed a Cross Complaint within the statute of limitations
as extended.
The Court disagrees with Plaintiff’s contention that the Emergency Rule
was an improper exercise of authority that only the Legislature could exercise.
Order
The Court declares that Plaintiff is not entitled to a declaration that
Defendants claims on the identified promissory notes are time barred.  Further, Plaintiff is not entitled to injunctive
relief precluding the Defendant attempts to recover on the promissory notes.
Given the status of this case with the Cross Complaint, no judgment
shall be entered at this time as this ruling does not resolve all issues
between the parties.
