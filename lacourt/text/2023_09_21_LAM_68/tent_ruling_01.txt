Nowparvar vs. Jeremy Daniels-Stock, et al., 20STCP00529
Motion to
Enforce Settlement
Moving Party:
Petitioner Bahram Nowparvar

Responding
Parties: Respondents JDS Minions and Jeremy Daniels-Stock

Background
Petitioner Bahram Nowparvar (Petitioner) filed this motion to enforce
settlement.
“On January 3, 2023, the Parties signed
Stipulation for Settlement and Mutual Release of all Claims on the first day of
a three-day arbitration hearing before the Hon. Jacqueline Connor with ADR
Services, Inc. [Ex.1].  The Settlement
provides for payment of $100,000 plus Petitioner’s ADR Services Arbitration
Fees [$20,950], reduced by $25,000 if Respondents made timely payments of $75,000
plus Arbitration Fees by July 1 [Ex.1].  ADR
Services, Inc. charged Petitioner and Respondents equally for Arbitration fees
of $20,950. Because Respondents paid only $75,000 by July 1, Respondents
currently owe $45,950 (100,000 + 20,950 – 75,000) [Ex.2].”  (Motion 2:2-8.)
Respondents paid $75,000 by the July 1, 2023 deadline.  However, no ADR Services arbitration fees were
paid to Petitioner.  It is the amount of
the arbitration fees that is the crux of this dispute.  Petitioner alleges that the amount of those
fees that Respondents should have paid was $20,950 because both parties were
charged equally for arbitration and that is the amount that Petitioner paid.  Petitioner provided the invoices that were
sent to both parties by ADR Services with his supplemental briefing.  Petitioner has requested that the Court enter
judgment against Respondents in the amount of $45,950 ($20,950 for the
arbitration fees plus the extra $25,000).
Respondents argued in both their original and their supplemental opposition
that Petitioner never told them prior to July 1, 2023 the amount of the ADR Services
arbitration fees. It was only after Respondents had timely paid the $75,000
amount that Petitioner sent them a letter with the ADR Services fees amount.  Respondents also argue that they should pay
less than the $20,950.  They claim that
they should only pay $8,800 because that amount reflects what they paid for the
arbitration itself and not the pre-arbitration motions.  Respondents also argue that they did not know
the amount that Petitioners paid or the amount that might have been refunded to
Petitioner.
Petitioner argues in his supplemental reply that Respondents’ should
have known all along how much they were to pay for the ADR Services arbitration
fees because the parties were charged the same amount.  He also argues that “ADR Services arbitration
fees” means all fees associated with the arbitration process, not just the fees
for the arbitration itself.
Analysis
The Court agrees with Petitioner that “ADR Services arbitration fees”
means all fees associated with the arbitration.
It is noted by the Court that Respondents articulate various reasons
that they claim they did not know the precise amount of the ADR Services
arbitration fees.  Assuming that they are
truthful in this claimed confusion they did nothing to obtain that information
from Petitioner.  “There were times when
emails were received showing that one or the other party owed funds, or both.  Ultimately, Respondents and counsel did not
know what Petitioner paid or was refunded.” 
(Decl. Howard R. Daniels-Stock ¶ 7.) 
(Bold added.)  “Under the
Settlement Agreement I have always been willing and able to comply, but I am
unable to pay an amount that I do not know.”  (Decl. Jeremy Daniels-Stock ¶ 10.)  (Bold added.)
If the Court were to believe Respondents, they knew before July 1, 2023
that the amount they had to pay for ADR Services arbitration fees, was unknown to
them.  If that were true, the Court would
have expected that they would have sought that information so that they could
make timely payment and save $25,000. 
The fact that they claim to have known that they lacked the necessary
information to make the payment, but did nothing to obtain the information leads
the Court to conclude that they are engaged in after-the-fact rationalization
to justify their failure to make timely payment of the arbitration fee.
Respondents were obligated under the settlement agreement to pay the ADR
Services arbitration fees in the amount of $20,950.  They did not do so.  Under their settlement agreement they were
obligated to pay $100,000 plus the ADR Services arbitration fees and were only
entitled to a reduction if timely payment was made.  It was not. 
They paid only $75,000.
Therefore Petitioner is entitled to entry of judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6 in the
amount of $45,950.
The Court shall also “strike” the opposition of Respondents insofar as
it is made on behalf of the suspended corporation JDS Minions.  (Since the papers were also filed on behalf
of the individual Respondent Jeremy Daniels-Stock, this order lacks any practical
impact.)
Order
1.      Petitioner’s
motion to enter judgment pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure § 664.6 is GRANTED in the amount of $45,950.00.
