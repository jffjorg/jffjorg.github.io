And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between Bahram Nowparvar (Petitioner) and Jeremy Daniels-Stock, et al. (Respondents). The parties signed a settlement agreement on January 3, 2023, which provided for payment of $100,000 plus arbitration fees to Petitioner. Respondents paid $75,000 by July 1, 2023, but failed to pay the arbitration fees. The dispute centers on the amount of the arbitration fees, with Petitioner seeking judgment for $45,950.

The Court finds that Respondents knew or should have known the amount of the arbitration fees, but failed to obtain the information and instead made a claim of ignorance. The Court concludes that Respondents are engaged in after-the-fact rationalization to justify their failure to make timely payment of the arbitration fee.

As a result, the Court grants Petitioner's motion to enter judgment in the amount of $45,950, which includes the amount of the arbitration fees ($20,950) and the reduction of $25,000. The Court also strikes the opposition of Respondents insofar as it is made on behalf of the suspended corporation JDS Minions.

## English Summary

The Judge tentatively rules in favor of Bahram Nowparvar, granting his motion to enforce the settlement agreement with JDS Minions and Jeremy Daniels-Stock.  The dispute centers around the amount of arbitration fees Respondents are obligated to pay. 

The original settlement agreement stipulated a total payment of $100,000 plus the ADR Services arbitration fees, with a $25,000 reduction if Respondents paid $75,000 and the fees by July 1st. While Respondents paid the $75,000 on time, they did not pay the $20,950 arbitration fees, leading to this motion.

Respondents argued they were unaware of the precise amount of the arbitration fees. However, the Judge found this argument unconvincing, stating that Respondents had a duty to seek this information and that their claim of ignorance seemed like an attempt to justify their late payment. 

Therefore, the Judge grants the motion and orders Respondents to pay $45,950 to Petitioner, consisting of the unpaid arbitration fees and the $25,000 reduction they forfeited due to late payment.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Bahram Nowparvar vs. Jeremy Daniels-Stock, et al. The case involves a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between the parties. The settlement agreement required the Respondents to pay $100,000 plus ADR Services arbitration fees, with a reduction of $25,000 if timely payment was made. The Respondents paid $75,000 by the July 1, 2023 deadline, but did not pay the ADR Services arbitration fees. The Petitioner argues that the Respondents should have paid the full amount of $20,950 in ADR Services arbitration fees, while the Respondents claim that they should only pay $8,800. The Court agrees with the Petitioner that the ADR Services arbitration fees include all fees associated with the arbitration process, and that the Respondents should have paid the full amount. The Court finds that the Respondents' claim that they did not know the amount of ADR Services arbitration fees is not credible, and that they should have sought the information in order to make timely payment. Therefore, the Court grants the Petitioner's motion to enter judgment in the amount of $45,950.
