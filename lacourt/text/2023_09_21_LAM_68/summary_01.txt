And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between Bahram Nowparvar (Petitioner) and Jeremy Daniels-Stock, et al. (Respondents). The parties signed a settlement agreement on January 3, 2023, which provided for payment of $100,000 plus arbitration fees to Petitioner. Respondents paid $75,000 by July 1, 2023, but failed to pay the arbitration fees. The dispute centers on the amount of the arbitration fees, with Petitioner seeking judgment for $45,950.

The Court finds that Respondents knew or should have known the amount of the arbitration fees, but failed to obtain the information and instead made a claim of ignorance. The Court concludes that Respondents are engaged in after-the-fact rationalization to justify their failure to make timely payment of the arbitration fee.

As a result, the Court grants Petitioner's motion to enter judgment in the amount of $45,950, which includes the amount of the arbitration fees ($20,950) and the reduction of $25,000. The Court also strikes the opposition of Respondents insofar as it is made on behalf of the suspended corporation JDS Minions.
