Inc., vs. Shahrzad Shahili, 22STCV23696

L.A. Law Inc. and F. Bari Nejadpour (Cross-Defendants)
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Shahrzad Shahili
Demurrer to Second Amended Cross-Complaint
I.
BACKGROUND
Cross-Defendant L.A. Law filed its complaint on July
21, 2022, alleging five causes of action against Shahili for (1) breach of
contract, (2) quantum meruit for services rendered, (3) account stated, (4)
book account, and (5) fraud. These causes of action arise out of Shahili’s
alleged breach of a retainer agreement with Cross-Defendant’s law offices for
failure and refusal to pay outstanding legal services fees and costs.
            The current iteration of Shahili’s
is Cross-Complaint is her Second Amended Cross-Complaint (SACC), filed on June
20, 2023. In the SACC, Shahili alleges five causes of action against
Cross-Defendants L.A. Law and F. Bari Nejadpour for (1) professional negligence
legal malpractice; (2) breach of fiduciary duty; (3) fraud and deceit; (4)
breach of contract; and (5) negligent infliction of emotional distress. These
causes of action all arise out of the attorney-client relationship that Shahili
had with Cross-Defendants. (SACC, at p. 3.) Shahili alleges in her SACC that
Nejadpour made a number of misrepresentations to her at the beginning of their
attorney-client relationship, including what the cost of the litigation would
be, what Nejadpour could get for her in the case, and who would be representing
her during the pendency of the case. She also pleads that she was unhappy with
the settlement that Cross-Defendants obtained for her and had to retain other
counsel.
            Cross-Defendants filed this demurrer
on August 14, 2023. Shahili opposes.
II. ANALYSIS 
A. The Demurrer
As a
general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the
face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts
alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Id.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
Where a
demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the
plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC
(2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable
possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to
sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245). 
1. Entire
Complaint
            Despite this Court previously
overruling Defendants’ statute of limitations argument, Defendants have once
again devoted a section of their demurrer to this issue. There are no new facts
pled in the SACC that would change the Court’s previous analysis of this issue.
The Court has ruled on this issue.
2. First
Cause of Action for Professional Negligence Legal Malpractice 
            The elements for a claim of
negligence by an attorney are (1) the duty of the attorney to use such skill,
prudence and diligence as members of his profession commonly possess and
exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between
the breach and the resulting injury, and (4) actual loss or damage resulting
from the attorney’s negligence. (See Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011)
51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)
            “Proof of legal malpractice requires
proof not only of negligence by the lawyer but also of causation, a trial
within a trial to establish that, but for the lawyer’s negligence, the client
would have prevailed in the underlying action.” (See United Community Church
v. Garcin (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 327, 334; Sukoff v. Lemkin (1988)
202 Cal.App.3d 740, 744.) 
Shahili must have sustained actual damage, as
opposed to nominal damage, speculative harm, or the threat of future harm. (See
Jackson v. Johnson (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1355.)
In Shahili’s SACC, she pleads that she was forced to
take a lower settlement offer because Nejadpour yelled at her to take it. (SACC,
¶ 16(a).) Next, she pleads that Nejadpour and his associate Winchester did not
know how to take the deposition of Shahili’s husband, so time and money were
wasted when they attempted to take his deposition. (SACC, ¶ 16(b).) Shahili
also alleges that numerous representations were made to her during the
representation that were not true, including that Winchester was experienced
with family law. (SACC, ¶ 16.)
Shahili’s SACC does not say how accepting the
$200,000 settlement was injurious to her, or what amount she thinks she should
have received, other than mentioning that Nejadpour promised her $1,000,000.
Her SACC is still unclear as to the actual loss or damage she sustained.
Cross-Defendants’ demurrer to Shahili’s First Cause
of Action is sustained with leave to amend.
                        3. Second
Cause of Action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty
            “The elements of a cause of action
for breach of fiduciary duty are: (1) existence of a fiduciary duty; (2) breach
of the fiduciary duty; and (3) damage proximately caused by the breach.” (Stanley
v. Richmond (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1086; Gutienez v. Girardi (2011)
194 Cal.App.4th 925, 932 [claim for breach of fiduciary duty against attorney
who represented client].)
            Shahili has pled that
Cross-Defendants’ owed her a fiduciary duty as her attorneys. However, the
facts that she has pled are not specific as to how they breached this fiduciary
duty. She alleges that they took advantage of her because of her limited ability
to read and write English, but she does not specify how they took advantage of
her. (SACC, ¶ 25.) She also pleads vague facts regarding the trust and
confidence that she placed in Cross-Defendants, but the FACC is unclear how
they specifically breached the trust and confidence. (SACC, ¶¶ 26-27.)
            This cause of action still appears
to be substantially similar to Shahili’s legal malpractice claim, as it has the
same factual allegations and is based on the attorney-client relationship.
            Cross-Defendants’ demurrer to
Shahili’s Second Cause of Action is sustained with leave to amend.
4. Third
Cause of Action for Fraud and Deceit
            Cross-Defendants’ demur to this
cause of action on the basis that it does not plead facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action for fraud and deceit.
            The elements of fraud are: (1)
misrepresentation, (2) knowledge of its falsity, (3) intent to defraud, (4)
justifiable reliance, and (5) resulting damage. (See Gil v. Bank of America,
Nat. Ass’n (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1371, 1381; Barbara A. v. John G.
(1983) 145 Cal.3d 369, 376.) A fraud cause of action requires all elements of
the cause of action be pleaded with particularity. “This particularity
requirement necessitates pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom,
and by what means the representations were tendered.” (See Lazar v. Superior
Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645 (citations omitted).)
            Previously, Shahili’s
cross-complaint had not pled that Nejadpour had knowledge of the falsity or the
intent element. This time, she has pled that he knew the misrepresentations
were false and made them in order to induce Shahili to enter into the
attorney-client relationship in order to pay Cross-Defendants and follow their
advice for Cross-Defendants’ own gain. (SACC, ¶¶ 32-33.) The other elements
appear to be met because Shahili pled that Nejadpour made the
misrepresentations to her at their first meeting. (SACC, ¶ 11.) She also pleads
that she was damaged as a result of the misrepresentations. (SACC, ¶¶ 34-36.)
            Cross-Defendants’ demurrer to Shahili’s
Third Cause of Action is overruled.
                        5. Fourth Cause of Action for Breach of
Contract
            “A cause of action for breach of
contract requires the following elements: (1) existence of the contract; (2)
plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance; (3) defendant’s breach;
and (4) damages to plaintiff as a result of the breach.” (See CDF
Firefighters v. Maldonado (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1226; Maxwell v.
Dolezal (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 93, 98.)
            In her SACC, Shahili has
incorporated the retainer agreement as Exhibit A. Shahili’s SACC states that
Nejadpour told her that he has professional liability insurance when he did
not, and that he did not release her file to her after the termination of her
representation. Paragraphs 19 and 20 on page 7 of the retainer agreement
indicate that (1) Nejadpour has professional liability insurance, and (2) that the
Attorney will release promptly to Client her papers and property upon
termination of the representation. Therefore, Shahili has pled that there was a
breach of contract.
            Cross-Defendants’ demurrer to
Shahili’s Fourth Cause of Action is overruled.
6.
Fifth Cause of Action for Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress
            Negligent infliction of emotional
distress is not a separate tort, but is a species of negligence. (Marlene F.
v. Affiliated Psychiatric Med. Clinic, Inc. (1989) 48 Cal.3d 583, 588.)
Thus, the traditional elements of duty, breach of duty, causation, and damages
apply. (Burgess v. Sup.Ct. (Gupta) (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1064, 1072.)
            Shahili has still not pled facts
sufficient for a cause of action for emotional distress. She has not pled
sufficient facts to show what her damages were. Nor has she pled why this
should be a separate cause of action from her professional negligence cause of
action.
            Cross-Defendants’ demurrer to
Shahili’s Fifth Cause of Action is sustained with leave to amend.

Cross-Defendants’ Demurrer to Shahili’s First,
Second, and Fifth Causes of Action is sustained with leave to amend. 
2.   
Cross-Defendants’ Demurrer to Shahili’s Third
and Fourth Causes of Action is overruled.
3.   
Shahili is given 20 days leave to amend.
