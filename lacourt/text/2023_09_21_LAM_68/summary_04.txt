And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's individual PAGA claims to arbitration. The plaintiff's representative/non-individual PAGA claims will be stayed pending arbitration and litigated in court. The judge has interpreted the Representative Action Waiver section of the arbitration agreement to mean that only the representative claims would be litigated in court, while the individual PAGA claims would proceed in arbitration. This decision is based on the recent California Supreme Court decision in Adolph v. Uber Techs., Inc. (2023), which held that when a plaintiff's individual PAGA claims are compelled to arbitration, the plaintiff's representative/non-individual PAGA claims may still be stayed pending arbitration and litigated in court.

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Maribel Martinez vs. Infosys Limited, regarding a motion to compel arbitration. The Defendant, Infosys Limited, has filed a motion to compel arbitration of the Plaintiff's individual and representative PAGA claims, arguing that the arbitration agreement between the parties is enforceable. The Plaintiff, Maribel Martinez, opposes the motion, arguing that the Representative Action Waiver clause in the arbitration agreement is invalid and that her representative and individual PAGA claims should be litigated in court.

The Judge agrees with the Defendant's interpretation of the Representative Action Waiver clause, finding that the clause does not apply to individual PAGA claims. Therefore, the Judge grants the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration of the Plaintiff's individual PAGA claims, while staying the litigation of the Plaintiff's representative/non-individual PAGA claims pending arbitration. The Judge's ruling is based on a recent California Supreme Court decision, Adolph v. Uber Techs., Inc. (2023), which held that a Plaintiff's individual PAGA claims may be compelled to arbitration without stripping the Plaintiff of standing to litigate non-individual claims in court.

Summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling is for the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration of Maribel Martinez's individual PAGA claims against Infosys Limited. The Judge agrees with the Defendant's interpretation of the arbitration agreement's Representative Action Waiver section, which states that the waiver only applies to representative/non-individual PAGA claims, and not individual PAGA claims. The representative/non-individual PAGA claims will be stayed pending the arbitration and heard in court. This outcome is allowed due to a recent California Supreme Court decision, Adolph v. Uber Techs., Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104, which held that when a plaintiff's individual PAGA claims are compelled to arbitration, their representative/non-individual PAGA claims may still be stayed pending arbitration and litigated in court.
