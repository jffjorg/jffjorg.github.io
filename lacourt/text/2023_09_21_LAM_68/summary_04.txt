And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's individual PAGA claims to arbitration. The plaintiff's representative/non-individual PAGA claims will be stayed pending arbitration and litigated in court. The judge has interpreted the Representative Action Waiver section of the arbitration agreement to mean that only the representative claims would be litigated in court, while the individual PAGA claims would proceed in arbitration. This decision is based on the recent California Supreme Court decision in Adolph v. Uber Techs., Inc. (2023), which held that when a plaintiff's individual PAGA claims are compelled to arbitration, the plaintiff's representative/non-individual PAGA claims may still be stayed pending arbitration and litigated in court.
