And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Christopher L. Boggs vs. Cetera Financial Group, Inc., et al. The case involves a dispute over four promissory notes that Boggs gave to the defendants, and whether the statute of limitations has run on the notes. The defendants argue that the COVID-19 pandemic tolled the statute of limitations, extending the deadline for suit. The court agrees with the defendants that the pandemic did toll the statute of limitations, and that therefore the notes are not yet time-barred. The court denies Boggs' request for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, and instead finds that the defendants' claims on the notes are still viable. The court notes that the case is still ongoing, and that no final judgment has been entered.
