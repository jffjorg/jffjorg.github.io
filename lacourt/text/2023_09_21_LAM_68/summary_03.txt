And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Christopher L. Boggs vs. Cetera Financial Group, Inc., et al. The case involves a dispute over four promissory notes that Boggs gave to the defendants, and whether the statute of limitations has run on the notes. The defendants argue that the COVID-19 pandemic tolled the statute of limitations, extending the deadline for suit. The court agrees with the defendants that the pandemic did toll the statute of limitations, and that therefore the notes are not yet time-barred. The court denies Boggs' request for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, and instead finds that the defendants' claims on the notes are still viable. The court notes that the case is still ongoing, and that no final judgment has been entered.

## English Summary

The tentative ruling in this case addresses a motion by Defendants, Cetera Financial Group, Inc. and First Allied Securities, Inc., seeking judgment on the pleadings filed by Plaintiff, Christopher L. Boggs. 

The crux of the dispute is whether the statute of limitations has run on Defendants' claims against Plaintiff regarding four promissory notes he signed as part of a forgivable advance agreement. Plaintiff argues that the four-year statute of limitations expired, while Defendants contend that the COVID-19 pandemic statute of limitations tolling provision extends the deadline. 

The Court agrees with Defendants, finding that Emergency Rule 9, which tolled statutes of limitations during the pandemic, applies in this case. This means the statute of limitations has not yet run, and Defendants' cross-complaint is timely. 

Therefore, the Court denies Plaintiff's request for a declaratory judgment that his liability on the notes is time-barred and dismisses his request for injunctive relief.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Christopher L. Boggs vs. Cetera Financial Group, Inc., et al. The plaintiff, Christopher L. Boggs, filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that he has no liability on four promissory notes that he gave to the defendants. He also seeks injunctive relief.

The defendants, Cetera Financial Group, Inc. and First Allied Securities, Inc., filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiff's complaint is barred by the statute of limitations. They contend that the statute of limitations was tolled during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that therefore, the four-year period has not yet expired.

The judge agrees with the defendants that the Emergency Rule 9, issued during the pandemic, tolled the statute of limitations. The judge also agrees that the defendants filed their cross-complaint within the extended statute of limitations period.

As a result, the judge declares that the plaintiff is not entitled to a declaration that the defendants' claims on the promissory notes are time-barred. The plaintiff is also not entitled to injunctive relief precluding the defendants' attempts to recover on the promissory notes.

The judge notes that the status of the case is that the defendants have filed a cross-complaint, and therefore, no judgment shall be entered at this time, as this ruling does not resolve all issues between the parties.

Summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling in Case Number 23STCV01348, scheduled for a hearing on September 21, 2023, in Dept 68, pertains to a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings by Defendants Cetera Financial Group, Inc. and First Allied Securities, Inc. in response to the lawsuit filed by Plaintiff Christopher L. Boggs seeking a declaratory judgment that he has no liability on four promissory notes given in favor of Defendants. The Judge agrees with Defendants that California Emergency Rule 9 tolled the four-year statute of limitations and extends it by 178 days, which means that Defendants' Cross Complaint was filed within the statute of limitations. The Judge declares that Plaintiff is not entitled to a declaration that Defendants' claims on the identified promissory notes are time-barred and denies Plaintiff's request for injunctive relief precluding Defendants' attempts to recover on the promissory notes. However, no judgment will be entered at this time as the ruling does not resolve all issues between the parties.
