And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel a second independent medical examination (IME) of the plaintiff, Mandy Lambert. The defendants had requested the second IME to determine the effects of the nerve blocks and trigger point injections that the plaintiff received after the first IME. The judge found that the defendants had good cause to conduct the second IME, as the first IME was limited in scope and did not provide a comprehensive examination of the plaintiff's injuries. The judge also found that the defendants had met the requirements for the motion, including making a good faith effort to meet and confer with the plaintiff's counsel and providing sufficient details about the scope and nature of the second IME. The second IME is scheduled for October 3, 2024, and will be conducted by Dr. Barry Ludwig, a neurologist.
