 Case Number:  23TRCV03183    Hearing Date:   September 23, 2024    Dept:  P Having reviewed the request for entry of default judgment as
to Bianca Guevera, the court DENIES the request.  The Proof of Service
attests to substituted service of Guevara on March 19, 2024.  However, the
notes suggest that the residence is not that of the defendant. 
Specifically, the process server states: “Spoke to female thru door, she said
Bianca did not live there, however, she knew her.  She denied it was the
mothers home. Left copies at door.” 
Code of Civil Procedure section 415.20(b) permits substitute
service “if a copy of the summons and complaint cannot with reasonable
diligence be served…by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the
person’s dwelling house, usual place of abode, [or] usual place of
business.”  In this case, the only information given to the process server
was that the occupant of the home (identified only as Jane Doe) knew the
defendant.  That individual expressly and explicitly stated that defendant
did not live there, nor did defendant’s mother.
 Given the above, there is no legal service of process on
Defendant Guevera and the court is without jurisdiction to enter a default
judgment against her.
