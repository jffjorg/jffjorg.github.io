```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to deny the request for entry of default judgment against Bianca Guevera. The reason for this decision is that the process server did not provide sufficient proof of service, as the individual they spoke to (Jane Doe) knew Bianca Guevera but denied that Bianca lived at the residence. According to the Code of Civil Procedure, substituted service is only allowed if service cannot be made with reasonable diligence by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person's dwelling house, usual place of abode, or usual place of business. Since Jane Doe did not confirm that Bianca Guevera lived at the residence, the judge concludes that there was no legal service of process and therefore lacks jurisdiction to enter a default judgment against Bianca Guevera.
