And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The plaintiff is seeking to add an additional claim for treble damages to the original complaint. The defendant challenged the motion on grounds of bad faith and prejudice, arguing that the proposed amended complaint is a "sham" and only presented for the purpose of "intimidation." However, the judge found that the motion is sufficiently supported and the delay in filing the motion is explained in context of later discovery of facts upon proceeding with collection efforts. The judge also found that the claimed prejudice is insufficient to outweigh the liberal policy for leave to amend. The trial remains more than one year away, allowing the parties sufficient time to adjudicate any potential arguments pre-trial. The plaintiff is ordered to file a separate copy of the first amended complaint within 10 days of the order.
