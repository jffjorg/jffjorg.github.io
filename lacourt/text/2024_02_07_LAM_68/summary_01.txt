```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to lift the stay as to co-defendants Solgen Construction, LLC and Cross River Bank. The stay was imposed on the entire case after Sunlight Financial, LLC filed a notice of stay of proceedings based on its Chapter 11 Bankruptcy petition. However, the judge finds that a bankruptcy stay only applies to the bankrupt party and not the entire action. Therefore, the stay is lifted as to Solgen Construction, LLC and Cross River Bank, but remains in place as to Sunlight Financial, LLC. The judge reserves consideration of any potential exceptions to relief from the stay as to non-bankruptcy petition co-defendants.
