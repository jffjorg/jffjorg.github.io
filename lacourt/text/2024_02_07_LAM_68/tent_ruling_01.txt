SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff Rex Wise alleges defendants Solgen Construction,
LLC, Sunlight Financial, LLC and Cross River Bank, denies ever executing a
30-year loan agreement for the financing of solar panels to Plaintiff’s
residence. Plaintiff sought to cancel the contracts, but defendants refused. 
 
Plaintiff alleges a Public Injunction enjoining Solgen
Construction, LLC from engaging in solar panel installations without adhering
to certain standards, due to prior fraudulent activities.
 
On August 1 and 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint and
first amended complaint for Fraudulent Concealment; Negligence; Violations of
The Elder Abuse And Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act (Welfare &
Institutions Code §15610.07, Et Seq.); Violations Of The Rosenthal Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act (Civil Code §1788, Et Seq.); Violations Of The Home
Solicitation Sales Act (Civil Code §1689.5, Et Seq.); Violations Of Business
And Professions Code §7150, et seq.; Violations Of The Truth In Lending Act (15
U.S.C. § 1601, Et Seq.); Violations Of The Credit Services Act (Civil Code
§1789.10, Et Seq.); and, Violations Of The Unfair Competition Law (Business
& Professions Code §17200, et seq.)
 
On November 1, 2023, Sunlight Financial LLC filed a notice
of stay of proceedings based on the filing of a Chapter 11 Bankruptcy petition
on October 31, 2023. On November 2, 2023, the court stayed the entire case.
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff Rex Wise moves to terminate the stay as to
co-defendants Solgen Construction, LLC and Cross River Bank. Plaintiff moves
for relief on grounds that the bankruptcy stay should only apply to the
bankrupt party, rather than the broadly imposed stay on the entire action.
Plaintiff filed a notice of non-opposition; the court electronic filing system
otherwise shows no opposition to the motion. 
 
A bankruptcy stay only applies to the bankrupt party. (11
U.S.C.A. § 362; Higgins v. Superior Court (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 973,
979–980; Freiberg v. City of Mission Viejo (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1484,
1488; Barnett v. Lewis (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 1079, 1088; U.S. v. Dos
Cabezas Corp. (9th Cir. 1993) 995 F.2d 1486, 1491.) The court finds no
basis for the stay to remain in place for the entire action, as currently
presented to the court. The court therefore lifts the stay as to the
non-bankrupt defendants Solgen Construction, LLC and Cross River Bank.
 
Any and all concerns regarding potential exceptions to relief
from the stay as to non-bankruptcy petition co-defendants are not considered in
the instant unopposed motion. While Plaintiff addresses the standard under a
potential indispensable party exception, in that complete relief cannot be
specifically accorded amongst the parties without all parties participating,
the factual basis of any such consideration is not presented in the subject
motion. (Maximum Technology v. Superior Court (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 935,
938; U.S. v. Dos Cabezas Corp. (9th Cir. 1993) 995 F.2d 1486, 1491.) The
court therefore reserves any consideration, if and when pertinent.
 
The unopposed motion to lift the stay as to Solgen
Construction, LLC and Cross River Bank is granted. The stay remains in place as
to Sunlight Financial LLC.
 
Motion to Compel Arbitration and Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel on calendar for February 8 and 14, 2023, respectively.
 
Plaintiff to provide notice.
