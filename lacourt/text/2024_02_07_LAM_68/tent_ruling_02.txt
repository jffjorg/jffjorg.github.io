REQUESTED
Motion
for Leave to Amend to File a First Amended Complaint
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION & PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
Assignor State Compensation Insurance Fund provided workers
compensation insurance to defendant Prime Executive Cars, LLC on August 15,
2022 and October 16, 2022. The policy premiums totaled $214,151.68 ($151,801.22
+ $62,350.46). No portion of the policies were paid. State Compensation
Insurance Fund assigned the debt to plaintiff Creditors Adjustment Bureau for
collection. 
 
On August 9, 2023, plaintiff filed a complaint for breach of
contract, open book account, account stated, and reasonable value. Defendant
answered on November 15, 2023.
 
RULING: Granted
Plaintiff
Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. moves for leave to file a first amended
complaint. Plaintiff moves for leave in order to add additional an additional
claim for treble damages. Defendant in opposition challenges the motion on
grounds that the proposed amended complaint comes in “bad faith” in that the
proposed amended complaint constitutes a “sham” pleading in that said claims
are “false” and only presented for the purpose of “intimidation.” Defendant
also claims prejudice as a result of the proposed amendment, and that the
subject amendment, if filed, would be subject to sanctions under Code of Civil
Procedure section 128.7. Plaintiff in reply emphasizes the liberal pleading
standard for amendments, and denies any showing of prejudice or bad faith.
Plaintiff also challenges any request for 128.7 sanctions. 
 
A
motion for leave to amend must comply with the requirements set forth in
California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324, which states as follows:
 
“(a)      Contents of motion
A
motion to amend a pleading before trial must:
(1)              
Include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended
pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from previous
pleadings or amendments;
(2)              
State what allegations in the previous pleading are
proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number,
the deleted allegations are located; and 
(3)              
State what allegations are proposed to be added to the
previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located.
 
(b)        Supporting declaration
A
separate declaration must accompany the motion and must specify:
(1)        The effect of the amendment;
(2)        Why the amendment is necessary and
proper;
(3)        When the facts giving
rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and 
(4)              
The reasons why the request for amendment was not made 
earlier…” (emphasis added).
 
Dilatory delays and prejudice to the opposing parties is a
valid ground for denial. (Hirsa v.
Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490.)  Prejudice exists where the amendment would
require delaying the trial, resulting in loss of critical evidence, or added
costs of preparation such as an increased burden of discovery. (Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488.) 
 
Leave to amend is generally liberally granted. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473(a); Mesler v. Bragg
Management Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 296.) The court will not generally
consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading in ruling on a motion
for leave, instead deferring such determinations for a demurrer or motion to
strike, unless the proposed amendment fails to state a valid claim as a matter
of law. (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Marker, U.S.A.) (1989) 213
Cal. App.3d 1045, 1048; California
Casualty Gen. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 280–281
disapproved of on other grounds by
Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390.) 
 
The motion was filed approximately four months after the
initial complaint, and lacks any specific explanation for the timing of the
motion. [Declaration of Kenneth Freed.] The court
finds the motion is sufficiently supported, and the delay explained in context
of later discovery of facts upon proceeding with collection efforts. (See Hataishi
v. First American Home Buyers Protection Corp. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1454,
1469.) The vociferous counter arguments, while very
strongly advocated, improperly rely on extrinsic inference beyond the scope of
the pleadings. (See Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.
(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604.)
 
The court in its discretion
further finds any claimed prejudice insufficiently outweighs the liberal policy
for leave to amend. The trial remains more than one year away, thereby allowing
the parties sufficient time to adjudicate any potential arguments pre-trial. (Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-487; Hulsey v.
Koehler (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1150, 1159.) If
Plaintiff had pled the subject claim for damages in the initial complaint, the
court would still be in the same position of leaving it up to Defendant to
challenge the alleged pleading regardless of any pre-litigation negotiations or
strategic positions.
 
The motion is therefore granted. Moving
party to file a separate copy of the first amended complaint within 10 days of
the order.
 
Trial date of February 10, 2025.
 
Plaintiff
