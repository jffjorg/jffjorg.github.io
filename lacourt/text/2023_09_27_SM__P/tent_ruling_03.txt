Investments, Inc. v. Dr. T House LLC, Case No. 23SMCV01850
Hearing Date
September 27, 2023
Plaintiff’s Motion
to Compel Defendant’s Responses to Written Discovery and that Matters in RFAs
be Deemed Admitted (UNOPPOSED) 
 
In this unlawful
detainer case plaintiff served form interrogatories, requests for production of
documents and requests for admission on defendant, who did not respond.
Viewsign moves for an order compelling responses to the interrogatories and
RFPs and deeming the RFAs admitted and requests sanctions. The motion is
unopposed. 
 
Responses to
written discovery requests in an unlawful detainer are due five days after
service. Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §2030.260(b). If the party in receipt of
written discovery does not timely respond, moving party can move for an order
compelling responses and, in the case of RFAs, deeming them admitted. Cal. Code
of Civ. Proc. §2030.290, 2031.300(c), 2033.28(b). 
 
Viewsign served
discovery, but House did not respond. Zakari declaration ¶¶8-10. House provides
no opposition or evidence to refute this claim. House is respond to the
interrogatories and requests for production within 5 days, with verified
responses. The requests for admission are deemed admitted.
 
Since House
provided no explanation for the failure to respond, sanctions are appropriate. House’s
counsel seeks sanctions of two hours billed at $400 per hour plus a $60 filing
fee. This amount is reasonable; the court awards $860 in sanctions, payable
within 30 days. GRANTED.
