And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion by the plaintiff, Von Neitsch, to file a first amended complaint in a dental malpractice action. The plaintiff wants to add a cause of action for breach of contract and identify the defendant, M. Naysan, Inc. dba Bedford Dental Group, rather than just "Bedford Dental Group". The judge notes that courts are generally liberal in allowing amendments to pleadings unless there would be prejudice to the opposing party. The opposing party, Bedford Dental Group, argues that the plaintiff delayed in bringing this motion, but the judge finds that the plaintiff's previous self-representation and the fact that counsel analyzed all claims and brought the motion after retention mean that there is no undue prejudice. Therefore, the judge grants the motion.
