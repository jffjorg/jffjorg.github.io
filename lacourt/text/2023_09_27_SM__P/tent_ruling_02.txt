Von Neitsch v.
Bedford Dental Group et al., Case No. 22SMCV01853
Hearing Date
September 27, 2023 
Plaintiff Von
Neitsch’s Motion for Leave to File First Amended Complaint 
 
Plaintiff in this
dental malpractice action seeks leave to amend to identify defendant M. Naysan,
Inc. dba Bedford Dental Group (rather than “Bedford Dental Group”) and add a
cause of action for breach of contract. 
 
Courts exercise
liberality in allowing amendments to pleadings absent prejudice to the adverse
party. Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.
A motion for leave to amend should only be denied if the opposing party can
show meaningful prejudice as a result of granting the motion. Id.
 
Plaintiff initiated
this case in pro per and retained counsel on July 15, 2023. Counsel determined
the facts supported a claim for breach of contract, and Bedford Dental must be
identified as defendant Naysan’s dba.
 
Defendants argue
the case was filed in October 2022, and plaintiff delayed in bringing this
motion. Von Neitsch was previously self-represented, and counsel Wales moved
expeditiously to analyze all claims and bring this motion after his retention.
Wales declaration ¶¶3-5. 
 
Trial is scheduled
for March 4, 2024, over five months away, and discovery is open. The court
finds no undue prejudice. Given the liberal policy regarding amendments, the
motion is GRANTED.
