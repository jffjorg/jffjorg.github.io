And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for a protective order and appointment of a discovery referee filed by Galleon Technology, Inc. against Electronics Design, LLC. The defendant's representative, Arash Shamoeil, has engaged in abusive behavior during deposition, including refusal to answer relevant questions, use of profanity, and personal attacks on plaintiff's counsel and court reporter. While Shamoeil's conduct has been inappropriate, the court does not find that "exceptional circumstances" exist to justify the appointment of a discovery referee. Instead, the court will order Shamoeil to answer all questions unless his attorney instructs otherwise, and will impose sanctions if he fails to comply. The court will also consider ordering further deposition to occur at the courthouse, so the parties can seek judicial intervention if necessary.
