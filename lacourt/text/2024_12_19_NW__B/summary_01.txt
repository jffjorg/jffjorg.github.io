And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for reconsideration of the County's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Farideh Raubitschek, tripped and fell on August 11, 2020, due to a hole in the sidewalk at 4600 Via Marina, Marina Del Rey, California. The plaintiff alleges that the County was negligent in its ownership and control of the sidewalk. The County filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted on August 19, 2024. The plaintiff then filed a motion for reconsideration, which the County opposed.

The judge notes that the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration is an attempt to revisit the summary judgment ruling, which is not allowed due to the filing of a notice of appeal on December 6, 2024. The judge rules that the trial court does not retain jurisdiction to rule on the instant motion and that the proceedings regarding relief from summary judgment are stayed. Therefore, the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration is off calendar.
