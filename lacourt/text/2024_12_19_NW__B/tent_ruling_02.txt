AL. VS DAVID WEAVER, ET AL. (21STCV43996)

 

 
Petitioner
Elisabeth Richardson’s Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action
or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability 
 
Respondent:
NO OPPOSITION
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Petitioner
Elisabeth Richardson’s Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action
or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability is
DENIED.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from a December 3, 2020, motor vehicle
accident in which Plaintiffs Elisabeth Richardson (“Petitioner”), Yasmine Hunt
(“Hunt”), and Isabella Yerena (“Claimant”), by and through her guardian ad
litem Petitioner (collectively “Plaintiffs”) allege that Defendants David
Weaver (“Weaver”), the City of La Verne (“La Verne”) and Does 1 through 50
operated their motor vehicle in a negligent or reckless manner as to collide
with Plaintiff’s vehicle and cause injuries thereof. On December 2, 2021,
Plaintiffs brought suit alleging two causes of action: (1) motor vehicle
negligence; and (2) general negligence.
 
On June 8, 2022, Petitioner was approved as guardian ad
litem for Claimant.
 
On October 13, 2023, Petitioner filed a notice of
settlement.
 
On June 7, 2024, this action was reassigned
to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective June 24, 2024.
 
On November 15, 2024, Petitioner filed the
instant Petition to Confirm Minor’s Compromise of Claim or Action or
Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability on
behalf of Claimant.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Petitioner
seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive $4,500.00
from the City of La Verne.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
An enforceable settlement of a minor’s or
incompetent’s claim can only be consummated with court approval. (Cal. Prob.
Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 372.) For this purpose,
a petition for approval must be presented to the court and until it is granted,
there is no final settlement. (Scruton v. Korean Air Lines Co. (1995) 39
Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1606.) Any settlement agreement therefore is voidable by
the minor’s guardian ad litem. (Ibid. at 1606.) 
 
Prob. Code § 3600, et seq., governs how the
settlement proceeds are to be paid. Pursuant to § 3601, the order shall approve
payment of reasonable expenses from the settlement as follows: 
 
“The court making the order or giving the
judgment referred to in Section 3600, as a part thereof, shall make a further
order authorizing and directing that such reasonable expenses (medical or
otherwise and including reimbursement to a parent, guardian, or conservator),
costs, and attorney’s fees, as the court shall approve and allow therein, shall
be paid from the money or other property to be paid or delivered for the
benefit of the minor or incompetent person.”
 
(Prob. Code § 3601(a).) 
 
In cases pursuant to Prob. Code § 3601, “unless
the court has approved the fee agreement in advance, the court must use a
reasonable fee standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s
fees payable from money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a
minor or a person with a disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 7.955(a)(1).)
In doing so, “[t]he court must give consideration to the terms of any
representation agreement made between the attorney and the representative of
the minor or person with a disability and must evaluate the agreement based on
the facts and circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made, except
where the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a
disability contemplated that the attorney's fee would be affected by later
events.” (CRC Rule 7.955(a)(2).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Petitioner seeks court approval for a
settlement under which Claimant would receive $4,500.00. Of this amount,
$128.61 will be used for medical expenses, $1,125.00 for attorney’s fees, and
$663.70 for costs. Therefore, Claimant would receive a net settlement amount of
$2,582.69. (See MC-350 Item 16.)
 
The Petition sets forth information that bears
upon the reasonableness of the compromise pursuant to CRC Rule 7.950. (MC-350 Attachment
8.) Additionally, attorney’s fees are reasonable as they represent 25% of the
total settlement amount. (MC-350 Attachment 13a.) Claimant’s counsel provides
their retainer agreement as Attachment 11b(3). Costs are reasonable considering
the extent of litigation. Petitioner provides the name and address of the
parent and money to be delivered as Attachment 18b(5).
 
However, Petitioner fails to provide reasoning for
the settlement apportionment. Petitioner and Hunt are to receive $18,000.00 and
$70,000.00, respectively. (See MC-350 Item 11b(5).) Petitioner does
provide a copy of the settlement agreement as Attachment 11b(6), but this
agreement does not provide reasoning for the settlement apportionment.
Accordingly, the Petition is denied.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES the
petition to confirm minor’s compromise. 
 
This is Petitioner’s second petition denied for
deficiencies. Petitioner is put on notice that further deficient filings risk
sanctions pursuant to CCP § 128.7 and CRC Rule 2.30.
 
Moving party to give notice.
