TRIAL
  DATE: NONE



 
I.      
BACKGROUND  
This
is a personal injury suit. On June 4, 2021, Plaintiff Farideh Raubitschek
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants County of Los Angeles
(“County”), E & S Ring Management Corp. (“E & S”), and Does 1 to 25
alleging two causes of action: (1) premises liability; and (2) negligence.
Plaintiff alleges that, on or about August 11, 2020, they tripped and fell over
a hole in the sidewalk at or near 4600 Via Marina, Marina Del Rey, California,
90292, suffering injury as a result. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’
negligent ownership or control of the subject sidewalk caused the hole.
On
August 21, 2023, the County filed a motion for summary judgment (“MSJ”) on
Plaintiff’s complaint. 
On
June 5, 2024, the case was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in
Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.
On
August 19, 2024, the Court granted summary judgment in the County’s favor.
On
September 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for reconsideration on
the County’s MSJ.
On
December 3, 2024, the County filed an opposition.
Plaintiff
has not filed a reply. However, on December 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice
of appeal on the order granting summary judgment.
 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
C.C.P. §1008(a) provides, as follows:  “When an application for an order has been
made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or
granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order
and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application
to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and
modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application
shall state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what
judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.”
 
III.      
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
moves for reconsideration of the County’s motion for summary judgment based on
the discovery of new, essential facts and circumstances which provide
justification for the Court to reconsider, modify, amend, or revoke its prior
ruling. (Motion p. 2:1-7.)
 
Jurisdiction
As a preliminary matter, the Court addresses
whether it retains jurisdiction to rule upon the instant motion after Plaintiff
filed a notice of appeal on December 6, 2024.
“Generally, the filing of a notice of appeal
‘divests the trial court of further jurisdiction in the cause.’” (Avenida
San Juan Partnership v. City of San Clemente (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 1256,
1267.) “[T]he perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial court upon
the judgment or order appealed from or upon the matters embraced therein or
affected thereby, including enforcement of the judgment or order, but the trial
court may proceed upon any other matter embraced in the action and not affected
by the judgment or order.” (CCP § 916(a).) An appeal is perfected when the
notice of appeal is filed. (Kroger Co. v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (2012)
210 Cal.App.4th 952, 959.)
Here, Plaintiff filed their notice of appeal
from summary judgment on December 6, 2024. The notice of appeal and instant
motion both seek relief from the same ruling and, consequently, proceedings
regarding relief from summary judgment are stayed in this trial court pursuant
to CCP § 916. Therefore, the trial court does not retain jurisdiction to rule
upon the instant motion.
IV.   
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s
motion for reconsideration is off calendar.
