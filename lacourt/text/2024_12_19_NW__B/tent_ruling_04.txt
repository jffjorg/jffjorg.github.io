On June 6, 2024, the action was reassigned to  the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East,  effective June 24, 2024. On June 12, 2024, Defendant filed the instant  motion for terminating sanctions. On November 5, 2024, the instant motion was  called for hearing. Defense counsel was ordered to file a declaration five days  prior to the instant hearing regarding meet and confer status and status of  discovery responses. (See November 5, 2024, Minute Order). The Court  notes that counsel failed to do so. The instant motion remains unopposed.   II.    LEGAL STANDARD Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2023.030 permits  the Court, in its discretion, to impose the following types of terminating  sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a “misuse of the discovery  process”: (1) An order striking out the pleadings or  parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery  process. (2) An order staying further proceedings by  that party until an order for discovery is obeyed. (3) An order dismissing the action, or any  part of the action, of that party. (4) An order rendering a judgment by default  against that party. (CCP § 2023.030(d).)  Conduct that is a “misuse of the discovery  process” includes failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of  discovery and disobeying a court order to provide discovery. (CCP § 2023.010(d)  and (g).) “Imposition of sanctions for misuse of discovery lies within the  trial court's discretion, and is reviewed only for abuse.” (Doppes v.  Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 991.) “The trial court  should consider both the conduct being sanctioned and its effect on the party  seeking discovery[.]” (Ibid. at 992.) Sanctions should be tailored to  the harm created by the withheld discovery and should not be used as  punishment. (Ibid.) The court should also consider whether the discovery  misconduct was “willful” and whether the requesting party was prejudiced by the  other’s failure to comply. (Do It Urself Moving & Storage, Inc. v.  Brown, Leifer, Slatkin & Berns (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 27, 37.) Lastly, courts have held that terminating  sanctions are warranted when a party repeatedly fails to propound adequate  discovery responses, even after the court imposed monetary sanctions. (Liberty  Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. LcL Administrations, Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th  1093.) For example, in Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128  Cal.App.4th 262, the Court of Appeal held that five motions to compel created a  record “replete with evidence of [appellant’s] failures to answer discovery  requests.” (Ibid. at 279–280.)   III.   DISCUSSION Defendant makes this motion on the grounds  that Plaintiff failed to comply with the court’s order to provide verified  responses, without objections, to Defendant’s Demand for Production of  Documents by May 27, 2024. (See May 7, 2024 Minute Order.) Plaintiff  also failed to pay Court-ordered sanctions in the amount of $430.00. (Korff  Decl. ¶ 11.) However, Plaintiff did provide responses to Defendant’s form  interrogatories, set one, special interrogatories, set one, and requests for  admissions, set one. (Ibid. at ¶ 6.) Defendant filed three corresponding  motions to compel further responses in relation to discovery motions. (Ibid.)  They are also set to be heard on December 19, 2024. “A decision to order terminating sanctions  should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a  history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not  produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in  imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009)  174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) Here, Plaintiff did provide responses to Defendant’s  other discovery motions. While failure to comply with the Court’s May 7, 2024,  order constitutes a misuse of discovery, Defendant fails to provide evidence  that less severe sanctions would not produce Plaintiff’s compliance. Defense  counsel also failed to file a declaration regarding efforts to meet and confer  as ordered by the Court. Therefore, the Court does not find terminating  sanctions appropriate at this time. However, considering Plaintiff’s failure to  comply with the Court’s May 7, 2024, order, the Court awards Defendant’s  requested sanctions in the amount of $860.00. This amount includes the $430.00  in sanctions awarded in May which Plaintiff has failed to pay.   IV. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion  for terminating sanctions is DENIED but the request for additional sanctions is  granted. Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, are ordered  to pay defense counsel sanctions in the amount of $860.00 within 15 days of  this hearing. Moving party is ordered to give notice.     Dated: December 18,  2024                             __________________________________ Hon.

TIME:  8:30 A.M.
 
COMPLAINT
  FILED: MAY 2, 2022
TRIAL
  DATE: NONE


 I.      
BACKGROUND  On May 2, 2022, Plaintiff Noah Cvengros (“Plaintiff”)
filed this action against Defendant Sam Tucker (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 10
alleging one cause of action for motor vehicle negligence.On March 4, 2024, Defendant filed three
motions to compel further responses against Plaintiff, as to the following
discovery documents: (1) Form Interrogatories, Set One; (2) Requests for
Admissions, Set One; and (3) Special Interrogatories, Set One (“Discovery
Motions”). Plaintiff also requests sanctions in the total amount of $4,065
($1,355 per motion).On June 6, 2024, the action was reassigned to
the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective as of June 24, 2024.The motions remain unopposed. II.         
LEGAL
STANDARDInterrogatoriesCal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.300 provides, in pertinent part, that
“[o]n receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that
any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under
Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit
or too general.” (CCP § 2030.300(a).) Unless notice of a motion to compel further responses is given within 45
days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response. (CCP § 2030.300(c).)  Request for
AdmissionsCCP § 2033.290 provides, in pertinent part, that “[o]n receipt of a
response to requests for admissions, the party requesting admissions may move
for an order compelling a further response if that party deems that either or
both of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular request is evasive
or incomplete. (2) An objection to a particular request is without merit or too
general.” (CCP § 2033.290(a).) Unless notice of a motion to compel further responses is given within 45
days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response. (CCP § 2033.290(c).)Under California law, the objecting party has the burden of justifying
its objections when the propounding party requests that the Court order further
responses. (Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.)
Further, under CCP § 2023.010, it is a misuse of discovery to make unmerited
objections. (CCP § 2023.010(e).)  III.      
DISCUSSION Meet and Confer
RequirementA motion to compel further responses shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration. (CCP §§ 2030.300(b) and 2033.290(b).) Here, defense counsel
provides a declaration demonstrating diligent efforts to meet and confer with
opposing counsel. (Silva Van Vo Decl. ¶ 13; Exh. E [meet and confer letter].)
On February 9, 2024, defense counsel sent a Meet and Confer Letter to opposing
counsel, outlining the deficiencies in Plaintiff’s responses and offering
fourteen additional days for further response. (Ibid.) Defense counsel
did not receive a response nor supplemental discovery. Therefore, the Court
finds Defendant’s meet and confer efforts to be sufficient pursuant to CCP §
2030.300(b).) Form Interrogatories,
Set OneDefendant moves to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One Nos. 2.5-2.6, 6.1-6.7, 8.5, 17.1, 20.1, and
20.3-20.10.The motion is granted. Plaintiff generally fails to provide any response
to these interrogatories, with or without objection. Each interrogatory is
related to discoverable matter. Therefore, Plaintiff is ordered to provide
verified, objection-free, supplemental responses to Form Interrogatories, Set
One, Nos. 2.5-2.6, 6.1-6.7, 8.5, 17.1, 20.1, and 20.3-20.10. Requests for
Admissions, Set OneDefendant moves to compel the Plaintiff's further responses to Requests
for Admissions, Set One, Nos. 4-9 and 12-13.The motion is granted. Plaintiff’s responses are generally riddled with
typing errors and what appear to be incoherent drafting notes. Plaintiff is
ordered to provide verified, clear, objection-free, supplemental
responses to Requests for Admissions, Set One, Nos. 4-9 and 12-13. Special
Interrogatories, Set OneDefendant moves to compel the Plaintiff’s further responses to Special Interrogatories,
Set One, Nos. 2-9 and 11-14.The motion is granted.. Plaintiff’s responses to Nos. 2-4 are generally
riddled with typing errors and what appear to be incoherent drafting notes.
Plaintiff’s responses to Nos. 5, 9, and 11, are incomplete. Plaintiff fails to
provide any responses to Nos. 6-8 and 12-14.Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified, clear, objection-free,
supplemental responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 2-9 and 11-14.  Monetary Sanctions“The court may impose a monetary sanction against a party engaging in
the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct”
under CCP § 2023.030(a). A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)Here, Plaintiff failed to completely and coherently respond to discovery,
constituting a misuse of the discovery process. Therefore, monetary sanctions
are appropriate.Defendant requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,355 per
motion, representing a $60 filing fee, four hours preparing each motion and an
anticipated three hours for the hearing of each motion at an hourly rate of
$185. (Silva Van Vo Decl. ¶ 15.) The Court reduces monetary sanctions to $615
per motion, representing three hours of work per motion at an hourly rate of
$185 and a $60 filing fee, as each motion is largely identical, and no
oppositions were filed. Therefore, the Court awards monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff in the total amount of $1,845. IV.   
CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, Defendant’s Discovery
Motions are GRANTED.The Court ORDERS that Plaintiff provides verified, complete and
code-compliant responses, without objections, to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories,
Set One Nos. 2.5-2.6, 6.1-6.7, 8.5, 17.1, 20.1, and 20.3-20.10, Special
Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 2-9 and 11-14, and Requests for Admissions, Set
One, Nos. 4-9 and 12-13, within 15 days of this order. Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, are also ordered to pay defense
counsel $1,845.00 in monetary sanctions within 15 days of this order.Moving party is ordered to give notice.  Dated: December
