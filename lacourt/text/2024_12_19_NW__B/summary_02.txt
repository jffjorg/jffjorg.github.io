And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition to confirm a minor's compromise. The petition was filed by Elisabeth Richardson, the guardian ad litem for a minor, seeking court approval for a settlement with the City of La Verne for $4,500.00. The settlement would provide $2,582.69 to the minor, with the remaining amount going towards medical expenses, attorney's fees, and costs. However, the judge denied the petition due to deficiencies in the petition, including the failure to provide reasoning for the settlement apportionment. The judge also noted that the petition does not provide sufficient information about the reasonableness of the compromise, attorney's fees, and costs.
