TIME:  8:30 A.M.
 
COMPLAINT
  FILED: JANUARY 5, 2022
TRIAL
  DATE: NONE



 
I.      
BACKGROUND  
This
is a contract action. On January 5, 2022, Plaintiff Legacy Global Private
Security Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Scott Brown
(“Brown”), 360 Global Management (“Global Management”), Urban Treez (“Urban”),
and Does 1 through 25 alleging four causes of action: (1) breach of contract;
(2) tortious interference with business relationship; (3) common counts; and
(4) fraud. Plaintiff alleges that, in April 2021, Defendants breached their
agreement with Plaintiff by failing to pay Plaintiff pursuant to the terms of
their agreement. (Complaint ¶ 14.) Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants lured
Plaintiff into providing security services without the intention of paying
Plaintiff for services. (Ibid. at ¶ 36.)
On
June 6, 2024, the case was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in
Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.
On
November 14, 2024, the Court dismissed Defendant Scott Brown without prejudice for
Plaintiff’s failure to obtain default judgment against Brown.
On
November 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for reconsideration on the
Court’s November 14, 2024, order.
No
opposition has been filed.
 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
C.C.P. §1008(a) provides, as follows:  “When an application for an order has been
made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or
granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order
and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application
to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and
modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application
shall state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what
judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.” (CCP § 1008(a).)
 
III.      
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
moves for reconsideration of the Court’s dismissal order of Brown based on new
facts and law. (Motion p. 2:2-4.)
Plaintiff
argues that, due to the One Judgment Rule, Plaintiff has been unable to obtain
default judgment against Brown until securing default against Co-Defendant
Herbal Solutions LLC (“Herbal Solutions”). (Motion p. 2:15-16.) Plaintiff
claims they have been unable to secure default against Herbal Solutions because
of “significant procedural obstacles,” including the court clerk rejecting
Plaintiff’s attempts due to “technicalities with the Proofs of Service.” (Ibid.
at 17-20.)
Plaintiff
fails to provide any new facts or law warranting this motion. In fact,
Plaintiff acknowledges that they made these same arguments at the Order to Show
Cause hearing which resulted in Brown’s dismissal. (See Rafii
Declaration.) Therefore, Plaintiff fails to meet the legal standard required by
CCP § 1008.
 
IV.   
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s
motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
