Background
 
This action arises in
connection with the employment of Nichole Martinez (“Plaintiff”) by Defendant
Southern California University of Health Sciences (“SCUHS”) as its Director of
Health Systems Business
Development. Plaintiff alleges that she began working for SCUHS in
this role on September 24,
2015, pursuant to a year-to-year employment contract.  In 2017, SCUHS hired Defendant the
Chiropractic Business Academy (“CBA”) to provide
consulting services. According
to Plaintiff, her job at SCUHS was put in jeopardy by her refusal
to participate in
“Scientology-based marketing.” Plaintiff allegedly complained to Defendants
Robb Russell (“Russell”) and Melissa Nagare (“Nagare”) weekly regarding CBA’s
practices but,
in response, Defendants started
treating Plaintiff rudely and disciplining her without cause,
resulting in her eventual
termination.
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint, filed on
January 14, 2020, alleges eleven causes of action: (1)
religion/religious creed
discrimination in violation of the Fair Housing Employment Act
(“FEHA”) against CBA, SCUHS,
(2) harassment based on religion/religious creed, (3) retaliation
in violation of the FEHA
against CBA, SCUHS, (4) wrongful termination in violation of public
policy against CBA, SCUHS, (5)
failure to take reasonable steps to prevent harassment and
discrimination in the workplace
against CBA, SCUHS, (6) retaliation in violation of California
Labor Code §1102.5 against CBA
and SCUHS, (7) employer’s breach of the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing
against SCUHS, (8) unfair business practices (violation of Business
and Professions Code § 17200),
(9) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (10) negligent
hiring and retention against SCUHS,
and (11) defamation.

On March 2, 2021,
Plaintiff filed a Request for Dismissal as to CBA.
 
On December 8,
2023, Defendants SCUHS, Russell, and Nagare (collectively “Defendants”) moved
for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication as to all
causes of action alleged in the Complaint. Plaintiff opposed the motion. On
February 28, 2024, the court continued the hearing to allow Defendants to
submit a copy of Exhibit 34 and correct the index of exhibits by March 1, 2024.

 
Defendants complied
by submitting a corrected index of exhibits and lodging with the court Exhibits
32 and 34. Defendants also submitted updated objections to Plaintiff’s
evidence. Plaintiff responded by submitting updated objections to the
Defendants’ evidence. The matter is once again before the court. 
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
The purpose of a motion for
summary judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism
to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite
their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”¿ (Aguilar
v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal. 4th 826, 843.) “Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) Summary
adjudication may be granted as to one or more causes of action within an
action, or one or more claims for damages. (CCP § 437c(f).)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
A defendant moving for summary
judgment bears two burdens: (1) the burden of production – presenting
admissible evidence, through material facts, sufficient to satisfy a directed
verdict standard; and (2) the burden of persuasion – the material facts presented
must persuade the court that the plaintiff cannot establish one or more
elements of a cause of action, or a complete defense vitiates the cause of
action. (CCP § 437c(p)(2);¿Aguilar,¿supra, 25 Cal.4th at p.
850-851.) A defendant may satisfy this burden by showing that the claim “cannot
be established” because of the lack of evidence on some essential element of
the claim.¿¿(Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 574,
590.)¿¿Once the defendant meets this burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff
to show that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that
cause of action or defense thereto.”¿(Ibid.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
“On ruling on a motion for summary
judgment, the court is to ‘liberally construe the evidence in support of the
party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in
favor of that party.’” (Cheal v. El Camino Hospital¿(2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 736, 760.) On a summary judgment motion, the court must therefore
consider what inferences favoring the opposing party a factfinder could
reasonably draw from the evidence. While viewing the evidence in this manner,
the court must bear in mind that its primary function is to identify issues
rather than to determine issues. [Citation.]” (Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co.¿(1999)
75 Cal.App.4th¿832, 839.)¿
 
II.        Evidentiary Objections
 
Plaintiff submits evidentiary objections to certain facts
stated in Defendants in the Separate Statement. 
 
Objection
No. 1, 6 and 7 are sustained. 
 
Objections
Nos. 2, 3, and 4 are overruled. 
 
The
court declines to rule on Objection No. 5. Objection No. 5 objects to the fact
stated in the separate statement, Undisputed Material Fact 12, rather than a
particular piece of evidence. Plaintiff’s updated proposed order specifies that
Plaintiff is objection to four pieces of evidence in Objection No. 5: the
Declaration of Melissa Nagare, Paragraph 19, and the three portions of the
Deposition of Melissa Nagare at 358:9-13; 427:9-433:1, 440:15-25. Accordingly,
the objection is not in proper form. (CRC, rule 3.1354 subd. (b), (c).) The
court has no obligation to rule on objections not presented in proper form. (Vineyard Springs Estates v. Superior Court (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 633, 642; Demps
v. San Francisco Housing Authority  (2007) 149
Cal. App. 4th 564, 578.)

Defendants object to
the above exhibits on the basis that the Declaration of Rosie Zilifyan does not
sufficiently lay the foundation for any of the exhibits listed above. 
 
Ms. Zilifyan’s
declaration attests as follows: 
 
I am an
attorney at law, duly authorized to practice law before all of the courts of
the State of California. I am a Trial Attorney for Shegerian & Associates,
the attorney of record for plaintiff, Nichole Martinez, in this case. I am
familiar with the files, pleadings, and facts in this case, and I could and
would competently testify to the following facts on the basis of my own
personal knowledge.
 
(Zilifyan Decl. ¶ 1.) Ms. Zilifyan than goes on to assert
that all the exhibits relied on by Plaintiff are a true and correct copy of the
exhibit. While affidavits and declarations may be filed in support of a motion
for summary judgment, such affidavits or declarations “shall be made by a
person on personal knowledge, shall set forth admissible evidence, and shall
show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters
stated in the affidavits or declarations.” (CCP, § 437c(d) [italics added].)

 
The
counteraffidavit concludes with the allegation that the ‘facts stated herein
are within the personal knowledge of the affiant, and the affiant, if sworn as
a witness, can testify competently thereto.’ Where the facts stated do not
themselves show it, such bare statement of the affiant has no redeeming value
and should be ignored. 


(Snider v. Snider (1962) 200 Cal.App.2d 741, 754, see also
Gamboa v. Northeast Community Clinic (2021)
72 Cal.App.5th 158, 169.)
 
The court is not
satisfied that Ms. Zilifyan’s declaration properly authenticates the exhibits
relied on by Plaintiff because her declaration is devoid of any facts “sufficient to sustain a
finding” that the exhibits are what Ms. Zilifyan claims them to be. (Evid.
Code, § 1400.) For example, Exhibit 9 is supposed to be Plaintiff’s rebuttal
for a counseling record, it includes a scan of a word document and scans emails
with hand written annotations on them, including the words “World Institute of
Scientology” without explanation of who authored the documents and emails and
who made the annotations. Exhibit 12 is the cover of the book titled “Breaking
the Code,” based On the Works Of L. Ron Hubbard. However, there are no facts to
show that this is the cover of the book Plaintiff was told to read nor any
admission by Defendants that this is indeed the cover of the book Plaintiff was
required to read. Accordingly, Ms. Zilifyan’s testimony does not sufficiently
provide facts to support the finding that the evidence is what Ms. Zilifyan’s
purports it to be. If the exhibits Plaintiff relies on to oppose this Motion
were provided by Defendants, then it was incumbent on Plaintiff to point to
deposition transcripts or discovery responses wherein Defendants admitted to
the authenticity of the exhibits now being relied upon by Plaintiff. Plaintiff
failed to do this. 
 
Moreover, Defendants had no basis to object to Plaintiff’s
Exhibit 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 15,  when Defendants relied on the same evidence.
(See Serri v. Santa Clara University
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 830, 856 [“Since
Defendants had relied on this very same evidence, there was no merit to these objections,
and they should not have been sustained”].) More importantly, the Defendant’s objections are also not in
proper form as the objections are not numbered. (CRC, rule 3.1354 subd. (b),
(c).) Therefore, the court declines to rule on Defendants’ objections.

III.      Discussion
 
A.        Summary
of Facts 
 
The following facts
are undisputed unless supported by citation to the evidence. On September 17,
2015, Plaintiff was hired by Defendant SCUHS for the position of Director of
Health System Business Development. (Undisputed Material Fact (“UMF”) 1.) According
to the job description for the Director of Health System Business Development,
the director is responsible “for the growth and development of SCU
Health System service offerings, including Spine Care, Human Performance, and
Sports Medicine, as well as any other programs that may be established in the
future to bring new business. (Plaintiff’s Compendium of Evidence (“PCOE”) Ex.
7; Defendants’ Compendium of Evidence (“DCOE”) Ex. 1.) This goal would “be
accomplished via development and implementation of individualized strategic
marketing programs as well as by developing a measurable outcome matrix using a
systematic approach that will allow them to track and report applied efforts on
a regular basis.” (PCOE Ex. 7; DCOE Ex. 1.) Job duties included developing and
implementing proactive business development and growth strategies to increase
program value with the approval of management. (PCOE Ex. 7; DCOE Ex. 1.) 
 
Defendants assert that the
ability to have a quantifiable measurement for marketing was not just a
requirement but critical to measuring Plaintiff’s success. (Nagare Decl. ¶ 10,
DCOE Ex. 1 , 2.) Plaintiff asserts that to measure marketing performance
against goals, SCUHS’ front office staff was required to input patient
information and where these patients were coming from into the electronic
medical records (“EMR”).  Plaintiff
alleges that they failed to do so and thus she was unable to measure market
performance.  It was not her
responsibility to enter such data and she “complained numerous times that the
front office was not doing their job” and she should not have been disciplined
for the front office’s shortcomings, especially when she put management on
notice. (Martinez Decl. ¶ 18.) Apart from Plaintiff’s declaration, there is no
evidence that Plaintiff informed Defendants that SCUHS front office was not
inputting patient information. Plaintiff did not present any evidence that it
was the front office’s staff's responsibility to acquire such information, or
that Plaintiff informed management of the need for data for her to create
quantifiable measurement for marketing. 
 
At SCUHS, Robb Russell
(“Russell”) was the Plaintiff’s supervisor. (PCOE Ex. 2 [Nagare Depo. at p.
70:19-23], PCOE Ex. 3 [Russell Depo. at p. 65:12-18].) Melissa Nagare
(“Nagare”) was Plaintiff’s initial supervisor and Russell’s supervisor. (PCOE
Ex. 2 [Nagare Depo. at pp. 70-2-6; 74-5-10], PCOE Ex. 3 [Russell Depo. at pp.
65:22-24, 66:9-13].) Ms. Nagare asserts that SCUHS was not seeing any results
from Plaintiff’s marketing activities because the marketing effort did not
result in new patients and Plaintiff was not tracking the results of
advertisement or promotional events as confirmed by the financial reports
produced by the Accounting Department. (Nagare Decl. ¶ 12; DCOE Ex. 41 [Nagare
Depo. at pp. 79:23- 80:19; 99:15-25: 159:3-8], Ex. 43 [Russel Depo. at pp.
114:10-115:3].) Defendants maintain that Plaintiff was not meeting the revenue
goals she was expected to meet. (DCO Ex. 3, 4, 9, 13.) Accordingly, SCUHS hired
Chiropractic Business Academy (“CBA”) as a consultant to
provide training and courses on business development and marketing on
developing measurable plans to track and report marketing efforts. (Nagare
Decl. ¶ 13.) At her deposition, Ms. Nagare admitted that before hiring CBA as a
consultant, Plaintiff received no written or verbal warning that she was not
meeting her job duties. (PCOE Ex. 2 [Nagare Depo. pp. 100:12-24;
101:12-24; 102:16-20; 103:17- 25; 106:13-22; 108:11-17; 112:13-17].)
 
Plaintiff asserts
that in August 2017, her working conditions changed when Defendants entered
into a consulting agreement with CBA. (Martnez Decl. ¶ 8; Nagare Decl. ¶ 13.)
Ms. Nagare asserts that the decision to use CBA was a joint decision and she
was not aware of CBA’s use of materials developed by L. Ron. Hubbard. (Nagare
Decl. ¶ 14.) Mr. Russell asserts that he did not know there was a “link between
Scientology and CBA” but that he did “know that some of their business
principles were based on the writing of the founder of Scientology” but that he
did “not know if those business practices are part of Scientology” because he
was not a Scientologist. (PCOE Ex. 3 (Russell Depo. at p. 123:3-10].) According
to the Consultant Agreement with CBA, the services that were to be provided
include consulting services related to the implementation of “CBA Management
Systems” and “Other ancillary services” such as “Workshops on Marketing, New
Patients, Office Organization, Massage Center, Staff Management, Front Desk
Mastery, Report of Findings and Office Expansion” and “Front Desk and Marketing
Online Training Programs.” (DCOE Ex. 14; PCOE Ex. 5.)
 
Defendants admit that
CBA used the book “Breaking the Code: The Mysteries of
Modern Management” (hereinafter “Breaking the Code”), based on the works of L.
Ron Hubbard as training material. (Nagare Decl. ¶¶ 17, 18; PCOE Ex. 1 [Martinez
Depo. at p. 108:5-6], PCOE Ex. 2 [Nagare Depo. at pp. 189:14-15, 219:6-7].) On
at least five occasions, Plaintiff asserts that she informed Ms. Nagare that
she did not want to do training or coaching with CBA because it was
uncomfortable to Plaintiff and she believed their tactics were unethical.  Ms. Nagare responded by informing Plaintiff
that everybody was required to do coaching with CBA. (PCOE
Ex. 1
[Martinez Depo. at pp. 251:10-15, 260:12-15].) Plaintiff asserts
that Ms. Nagare did not take Plaintiff’s concerns about CBA being
Scientology-based seriously and that on one occasion she laughed at Plaintiff’s
concerns. (Martinez Depo. at p. 249:9-14.) Moreover, at the time Plaintiff was
to produce her Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation (“SBAR”)
report in May of 2018, Plaintiff informed her supervisor, Mr. Russell, that she
felt uncomfortable and it was against her Christian principles to read other
religious practice books, such as Breaking the Code.
(Martinez Depo. at p. 289:10-10, PCOE Ex. 3 [Russell Depo. at pp. 119:17-120:1,
314:2-16, 314:20-25 ].) Plaintiff states that she felt that if
she did not read Breaking the Code and did not revise her honest SBAR report,
she faced the possibility of being written up and fired. (Martinez Depo. at pp.
284:14-21, 287:10-19, 304:19-23]; Russell Depo. at p. 316:17-23, 322:19-323:4.)
After Plaintiff submitted the initial SBAR, her supervisor, Mr. Russell,
complained that the SBAR did not address the issues based on the format in
Breaking the Code. (Russell Depo. at p. 299: 6-14].) Russell
instructed Plaintiff to redo the SBAR report and read Breaking the Code or she
would possibly be written up or fired. (PCOE Ex. 1 [Martinez Depo. at p. 284:
14-21], PCOE Ex. 3 [Russell Depo. at p. 323:10-17].) 
 
According to
Plaintiff, reading “Breaking the Code” was a requirement of her training until
she made a complaint to Cindy Scheibel (“Scheibel”) of Human Resources, about
being forced to read the book. (PCOE Ex. 1 [Martinez Depo. at pp. 171:8-9,
174:17-14, 270:2-24, 289:10-17, 355:1-4, 355:18-19].) Plaintiff
states that she complained to Scheible about having to read Breaking the Code”
sometime after obtaining the first counseling record, during the end of May or
mid-June, and obtaining her second counseling record. (PCOE Ex. 1 [Martinez Depo.
at pp. 354:16-355:4].) Plaintiff asserts that she recalls
making at least three complaints to Ms. Scheibel about her supervisor, Mr.
Russell, making her read the book, Breaking the Code,  and verbally instructing her that she had to
attend training sessions with Ethan Danberg (“Dangberg”) from CBA. (Martinez Depo. at pp. 178:11-20, 179:8-21, PCOE Ex. 3 [Russell Depo. at pp. 190:1-9, 299:20-25,
321:10-16, 314:2-25, 316:17-23].)  Mr.
Russell’s supervisor, Ms. Nagare, was aware that Russell required Plaintiff to
read the book and attend the training sessions, but she did not see it as a
problem. (PCOE Ex. 2 [Nagare Depo. at pp. 304:3-12,
379:20-380:5].) 

 
On May 10, 2018,
Plaintiff received her first counseling record, with the admission that she had
been given no prior “written” warning about the problem. (PCOE Ex. 2 [Martinez
Depo. at p. 335:6-17.) Ex. 6; DCOE Ex. 19.) The problem was described as “The
Ouch/IPC patient visit statistics is in the condition of non-existence and has
been since September 1, 2017 and prior.” (PCOE Ex. 6; DCOE Ex. 19.)  The improvement required for overall new
patients to be enrolled in order “to reach normal, affluence, or power
condition” “by the end of fiscal year 17-18” a “Completed Staff Work describing
the situation, data, and solutions” being submitted “no later than close of
business May 21, 2018.” (PCOE Ex. 6; DCOE Ex. 19.) The “Suggested Means of
Improvement” was for Plaintiff to “Review chapters 9-18 of Breaking the Code”
and that “Coaching sessions with Ethan Danberg from CBA are available.” (Martinez
Depo. at pp. 342:1-343:2, 344:6-10; PCOE Ex. 6; DCOE Ex. 19.) “Failure to
comply with  the above within the
specified period will result in further disciplinary action up to and including
termination.” (PCOE Ex. 6; DCOE Ex. 19.) 
 
On July 16, 2018, Plaintiff
received a second counseling record, which was revised after Plaintiff
complained to Human Resources about having to read Breaking the Code. (PCOE Ex.
1 [Martinez Depo. at p. 354:1-9], PCOE Ex. 10; DCOE Ex. 25.) The counseling
record noted that Plaintiff failed to comply with: “[a] key component” of
producing “a document describing the situation, data, and solutions, in the
so-called SBAR format. An SBAR was submitted by the employee email on
May 25, 2018 but it was deemed to be insufficient by her manager because it
included considerable rationalizations (excuses) and was judged to lack
sufficient content as well. A resubmission of the SBAR was requested but not
produced. Following the employee’s concerns, conveyed to human resources and
relayed to the manager, this Counseling Record and [sic] has been modified.”
(PCOE Ex. 10; DCOE Ex. 25.) 
 
The “Improvement Required”
stated: 
 
A document describing the situation, background, assessment
and recommendations (SBAR) submitted for review no later than the end of
business, July 18, 2018. Out of necessity, the SBAR document will include
information that describes the current ecosystem in which the Health System
exists and it is reasonable to include such so long as it is the basis for
future planning, not rationalization of past performance. Recommendation shall
be specific (defining what constitutes success), measurable (quantifiable) and
set target dates for implementation and completion.
 
(PCOE Ex. 10; DCOE Ex. 25.) 
 
The “Suggested Means of
Improvement” states
 
The employee may search for resources, including published
and or web-based descriptions of the SBAR format, as adapted to business
situations. 
 
Failure to comply with the above within the specified period
will result in further disciplinary action up to and including termination. 
 
(PCOE Ex. 10; DCOE Ex. 25.) 
 
On July 27, 2018, Plaintiff
received her third  and final counseling
record for failing to follow manager directives. (PCOE Ex. 11; DCOE Ex. 35.)
According to the counseling record, on June 6, 2018, Plaintiff was informed by
Ms. Nagare that she needed to review and approve all marketing events based on
“ROI analysis” for which Plaintiff was responsible and that Ms. Nagare would be
responsible for approving all Health System marketing expenditures for the
remainder of the 2017-2018 fiscal year. (PCOE Ex. 11; DCOE Ex. 35.) Plaintiff
submitted the ROI information on June 14, 2018, rather than the date Plaintiff
provided of  June 11, 2018, and failed to
obtain approval for a marketing event and instead informed Mr. Russell and Ms.
Nagare that SCUHS had committed to the event on July 12, 2018. (PCOE Ex. 11;
DCOE Ex. 35.)
 
On July 25, 2018, Ms. Nagare
noticed Plaintiff’s daily check-in referenced a health fair which had not been
approved because the ROI analysis was still incomplete. (PCOE Ex. 11; DCOE Ex.
35.) Plaintiff insisted the ROI analysis had been sent on June 24, 2018,
“however neither Dr. Nagare nor Dr. Russell have any record of such a message.
Dr. Nagare requested Ms. Martinez forward the email, but Ms. Martinez has not done
so at this time. Ms. Martinez sent an updated ROI analysis on July 25, 2018
which had the 7/12/2018 event listed as approved, but the ROI analysis for all
the events were still incomplete.” (PCOE Ex. 11; DCOE Ex. 35.) The “Improvement
Required” was for Plaintiff to comply with her supervisors’ directive and to
strive to meet all deadlines. (PCOE Ex. 11; DCOE Ex. 35.)
 
Sometime on or about September
12, 2018, Plaintiff’s position was eliminated. (PCOE Ex. 3 [Russell Depo. at p.
425:1-11].) Plaintiff was given three options: (1) apply for the new position,
(2) not apply for the new position and be paid out on her employment contract,
or (3) apply for the job, not get the job, and be paid out. (Nagare Decl. ¶ 27;
[PCOE. Ex. 2 [Nagare Depo. at pp. 456:16-457:12, 457:25-458:6, 477:9-18].) Plaintiff
asserts that her position was not eliminated but instead transferred to another
employee, Sherise Bright, for less pay. (Martinez Depo. at p. 382:8-25, PCOE
Ex. 2 [Nagare Depo. at pp. 456:16-457:12, 476:10-11, 479:18-20].) 
 
On September 19, 20218,
Plaintiff sent an email to Scheibel stating that the organization chart made it
clear to Plaintiff that her position was being absorbed into an existing
position held by Sherise Bright and that Mr. Russell requested that Plaintiff
“stay on through October, and transfer knowledge to Sherise as she does not
have any background or knowledge” about SCUHS’ health system. (PCOE Ex. 15;
DCOE Ex. 37.) Plaintiff states that as her position was “eliminated” there
should be no reason for her to train anyone. (PCOE Ex. 15; DCOE Ex. 37.) 
 
Plaintiff states that
she felt her supervisor, Mr. Russell, and Ms. Nagare retaliated against her by
giving her counseling reports despite doing “exactly what I was asked to do;” giving
her additional counseling reports after complaining to Human Resources; and for
deciding to terminate Plaintiff’s position and giving her the option to apply
for a lower level position that was “underneath” Plaintiff’s experience. (PCOE
Ex. 1: [Marinez Depo. at pp. 300:8-21, 1-12].) 
 
On January 14, 2020,
Plaintiff filed this action alleging the eleven causes of action set forth
above (infra, pp. 1-2).  Defendants
now move for summary judgment or, in the alternative,  summary adjudication as to all causes of
action in Plaintiff’s Complaint. 
 
B.        Defendants Seek Summary Judgment or
Adjudication on Three Issues
 
Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1350 requires the party moving for summary judgment, or summary adjudication,
to submit a Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (“UMF”), that
“contains only material facts” and that separately identifies: 
 
(A)
 Each cause of action, claim for damages, issue of duty, or affirmative
defense that is the subject of the motion; and
 
(B)
 Each supporting material fact claimed to be without dispute with respect
to the cause of action, claim for damages, issue of duty, or affirmative
defense that is the subject of the motion.
 
(CRC, rule 3.1350(d).) 
 
According to Defendants’
Separate Statement, the Motion pertains to the following three issues: 
Issue No. 1:
Plaintiff Failed to Meet Her Job Requirements. (UMF 1-20.) 
 
Issue No. 2:
Plaintiff Cannot Establish She was Subjected to An Adverse Employment Action
Due to Her Religion or Religious Creed and Her First Six Causes of Action and
Derivative Claims (Seventh through Eleventh Causes of Action) Fail as a Matter
of Law. (UMF 21-31.) 
 
Issue No. 3:
Plaintiff Cannot Establish She was Subjected to Harassment, Extreme and
Outrageous Conduct or that Any Defendant Uttered Defamatory Statements About Her
and Her Claims for Individual Liability Against Melissa Nagare and Rob Russel
Fails As a Matter of Law. Further, there is No Evidence of Oppression, Fraud or
Malice Entitling Plaintiff to Punitive Damages. (UMF 32-36.) 
 
Defeating summary judgment
requires only a single disputed material fact. (See CCP § 437c(c) [a motion for
summary judgment “shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there
is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to a judgment as a matter of law”] [italics added].) Thus, any
disputed material fact means the court must deny the motion – the court has no
discretion to grant summary judgment. (Zavala v. Arce (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 915, 925, fn. 8; Saldana v. Globe-Weis Systems Co. (1991)
233 Cal.App.3d 1505, 1511-1512.)¿¿¿¿
 
i.          Triable Issues of Material Fact Exists as to Issue No. 1
 
In UMF No. 11, Defendants
maintain that revenue targets were set by the Board of Regents of SCUHS, but
Defendants failed to cite admissible evidence in support of this material fact.
Accordingly, UMF No. 11 is disputed. 
 
Defendants UMF No. 9 states
numerous facts, including the fact that CBA’s webinars were offered in email
blasts, but were not mandatory. However, Defendants fail to cite evidence to
show that Plaintiff knew or was informed that the CBA webinars were not
mandatory or that she could opt out of the CBA trainings. Accordingly, UMF No.
9 is disputed.  Defendants failed to meet
their initial burden. 
 
Moreover, according to the
Plaintiff’s deposition testimony, Ms. Nagare told Plaintiff that “everybody”
had to do coaching with CBA. (PCOE Ex. 1 [Martinez Depo. at pp. 251:10-15,
260:12-15].) Plaintiff’s supervisor, Mr. Russell, admitted during his
deposition that he told Plaintiff that she had to read the book Breaking the
Code and attend coaching with a CBA representative. PCOE
Ex. 3 [Russell Depo. at pp. 190:1-9, 299:20-25, 321:10-16, 314:2-25,
316:17-23].) Accordingly, triable issues of fact exist as to UMF No. 9. 
UMF No. 18 states
that Plaintiff complained for the first time about working with CBA to Scheibel
only after she received her second warning or her second counseling record.
(PCOE Ex. 10, DCOE Ex. 25.) In support of this fact, Defendants cite the
Declarations of Ms. Nagare and Mr. Russell, where they assert they gave
Plaintiff the second warning on July 9, 2019. (Nagare Decl. ¶¶ 24, 25, Russell
Decl. ¶ 12.) Defendants also cite to DCOE Exhibit 25 which is the July 16,
2018, counseling record, that references the fact that the counseling record had
been “revised” “[f]ollowing the employee’s concerns, conveyed to Human
Resources and relayed to the manager [.]” (DCOE Ex. 25.) Although DCOE Exhibit
25 references the fact that the second counseling record had been revised due
to the Plaintiff's concerns, the reason for the revision is not stated and the
evidence cited is insufficient to show that Plaintiff complained about working
with the CBA and that the complaint was, in fact, Plaintiff’s first time making
a complaint about CBA to Human Resources. Accordingly, Defendants failed to
meet their initial burden that UMF No. 18 is not disputed. 
 
Moreover,
at her deposition, Plaintiff testified that she told Ms. Nagare that did not
want to work with the CBA because it made her uncomfortable but was told the
coaching was required. (PCOE Ex. 1 [Martinez Depo. at pp.
251:10-15, 260:12-15].) Plaintiff further asserts that she made at least three
complaints to Ms. Schiebel about the CBA. (PCOE Ex. 1 [Martinez
Depo. at pp. 178:11-20, 179:8-21].) Defendants fail to rebut this evidence.
Therefore, triable issues of fact exist as to UMF No. 18. 
 
UMF
No. 19 asserts that Plaintiff’s SBAR was deficient and that she was asked to do
a rewrite because it “rationalized her failure to do things instead of finding
solutions for her deficiencies.” (UMF 19.) Whether the initial SBAR that
Plaintiff submitted was deficient is a triable issue of fact as Plaintiff
explains that several programs run by SCUHS that had not become operational
until the middle or end of the fiscal year, that the services for the OUCH
program were in a residential area with no heavy drive-by traffic, and the
operating hours did not meet the needs of the urgent care target market because
“outside of the flu season, most people will visit urgent cares after work or
on the weekends.” (DCOE Ex. 26.) The court finds that a trier of fact could
find that Plaintiff’s initial SBAR was not deficient and did not rationalize
Plaintiff’s deficiencies but the deficiencies of SCUHS programs. (See Binder v. Aetna Life
Ins. Co.
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 840 [“The trial court may not weigh the evidence in
the manner of a factfinder to determine whose version is more likely true.¿Nor
may the trial court grant summary judgment based on the court's evaluation of
credibility.”].) Accordingly, Defendants failed to meet their initial burden of
showing that UMF No. 19 is undisputed. 
 
UMF No. 20 also states
various facts, including the fact that “SCU Health tracked the referral source
to new patients, which showed Plaintiff’s events and ads rarely resulted in new
patients.” (UMF 20.) In support of UMF No. 20, Defendants cite the “07.27.18
Counseling Record and supporting documents” but the counseling record and
supporting documents fail to show that Plaintiff’s events failed to bring in
new patients. (DCOE Ex. 35.) Moreover, despite Defendants citing Exhibits 28 to
36 in further support of UMF No. 20, the Declaration of Robb Russell refers to
many of the exhibits as “supporting documentation” without explaining who
authored the exhibits. (Russell Decl. ¶ 14.) Therefore, DCOE Exhibits 28 to 36
are not properly authenticated and UMF No. 20 is disputed. 
 
Defendants
failed to meet their initial burden of showing no triable issues of material
fact exist as to Issue No. 1 because UMF Nos. 11, 18, 19, and 20 are disputed.
Therefore, summary adjudication is denied as to Issue No. 1. 
 
ii.         Triable Issues of Material Fact Exists as to Issue No. 2
 
UMF No. 24 contains several
facts, including the fact that the CBA never asked SCUHS’ employees to read the
book Breaking the Code. (UMF No. 24.) However, none of the evidence cited in
support of UMF No. 24 supports the proposition that the CBA never required SCUHS’
employees to read the book Breaking the Code. Accordingly, UMF No. 24 remains
disputed. 
 
Moreover, Plaintiff’s
opposition cites her first counseling record showing that she was instructed by
her supervisor, Mr. Russell, to read the book. 
The counseling record itself suggested that the failure to comply with
any of the recommendations could result in further disciplinary action,
including termination. (PCOE Ex. 6; DCOE Ex. 19.) Plaintiff presents
evidence that Ms. Nagare was aware that Mr. Russell was requiring Plaintiff to
read the book and attend training sessions. (PCOE Ex. 2 [Nagare Depo. at pp.
304:3-12, 379:20-380:5].) Plaintiff also presents evidence that one of the
reasons her first SBAR was rejected by her supervisor was because it did not
address issues based on the format in Breaking the Code. (PCOE Ex. 3 [Russell
Depo. at p. 299: 6-14].) Lastly, Plaintiff asserts that Mr. Dangberg told her
that if she did not do the CBA coaching, it would affect her performance
evaluation and the ability to do her job and would have possible ramifications
from her superiors. (PCOE Ex. 1 [Martinez Depo. at p. 208:16-14].) 
 
Therefore, UMF No. 24 is
disputed. 
 
UMF No. 25 states
that “[t]he training sessions offered by CBA were recommended but were not
mandatory.” (UMF No. 25.) While Defendants admit that the CBA webinars were offered
in email blasts, they fail to cite evidence to show that the webinars were not
mandatory and that this fact was communicated to all SCUHS employees, including
Plaintiff. (Nagare Decl. 16.) Accordingly, Defendants fail to meet their
initial burden of showing that UMF No. 25 is undisputed. Moreover, Plaintiff
asserts that Ms. Nagare informed her that “everybody” had to do coaching
with CBA. (PCOE Ex. 1 [Martinez Depo. at pp. 251:10-15, 260:12-15].)
Plaintiff’s supervisor, Mr. Russell admitted during his deposition that he told
Plaintiff that she had to read the book Breaking the Code and attend coaching
with a CBA representative. (PCOE Ex. 3 [Russell Depo. at pp.
190:1-9, 299:20-25, 321:10-16, 314:2-25, 316:17-23].) 
 
Therefore, UMF No. 25
is disputed. 
 
UMF No. 27 states: “It
was only after Plaintiff received her second warning on July 9, 2018, that
Plaintiff, for the first time, and eleven months after working with CBA,
complained to SCU’s Cindy Scheibel, from the Human Resources Department, about
the alleged Scientology training used by CBA and the warnings she had
received.” As in UMF No. 18, in support of UMF No.
27 Defendants cite to the Declarations of Ms. Nagare and Mr. Russell, where
they assert they gave Plaintiff the second warning on July 9, 2019. (Nagare
Decl. ¶¶ 24, 25, Russell Decl. ¶ 12.) Defendants also cite DCOE Exhibit 25
which is the July 16, 2018, counseling record, that references the fact that
the counseling record had been “revised” “[f]ollowing the employee’s concerns,
conveyed to Human Resources and relayed to the manager [.]” (DCOE Ex. 25.)
Although DCOE Exhibit 25 references the fact that the second counseling record
had been revised due to the Plaintiff's concerns, the reason for the revision
is not stated and the evidence cited is insufficient to show that Plaintiff
complained about working with the CBA and that the complaint was the first time
Plaintiff made a complaint about CBA to Human Resources. Accordingly, UMF No.
27  is disputed. 
 
UMF No. 28 states
several facts including the fact that “Plaintiff never revised her SBAR [sic]
Instead, she told her coworkers she was going to sue SCU if she was written up
one more time[.]” (UMF 28.) In support of UMF No. 28, Defendants cite DCOE Exhibit
26 which is the SBAR itself, but it does not show that Plaintiff failed to
submit a revised SBAR. Defendants also cite DCOE Exhibit 27 but Exhibit 27 is
hearsay and not admissible for its truth. Moreover, even if DCOE Exhibit 27 was
admissible, it fails to show that Plaintiff failed to submit a revised SBAR.
Accordingly, Defendants fail to meet their initial burden of showing that UMF
No. 28 is undisputed. 
 
UMF No. 29 contains
several statements of purported material facts, including the fact that “SCU
tracked the referral source to new patients, which showed Plaintiff’s events
and ads rarely resulted in new patients.” (UMF 29.) In support of UMF No. 29,
Defendants cite the “07.27.18 Counseling Record and supporting documents” but the
supporting documents fail to show that Plaintiff’s events failed to bring in
new patients. (DCOE Ex. 35.) Moreover, the Declarations of Ms. Nagare and Ms.
Russell fail to state facts or cite admissible evidence to show that
Plaintiff’s events and ads failed to bring in new patients. (Nagare Decl. ¶ 26,
Russel Decl. ¶ 14.) Therefore, the Defendants fail to meet their initial burden
of showing that UMF No. 29 is undisputed. 
 
UMF No. 30 states several facts, including the following: 
 
Due to the lack of improvement in the marketing department
SCU decided to outsource its marketing by hiring Healthcare Success . . . It
was evident Plaintiff’s job performance had not improved and the department was
not meeting its goals.
 
(UMF 30.) In support of UMF 30,
Defendants cite to the Declarations of Ms. Nagare and Mr. Russell, but the
Declarations fails to explain who decided that the Marketing Department had not
made any improvements, let alone the determination that Plaintiff’s performance
had not improved. (Nagare Decl. ¶ 27, Russell Decl. ¶ 15.) Defendants also cite
the deposition testimony of  Ms. Nagare,
but the relevant portions of the deposition testimony are missing from DCOE and
Exhibit 41. (DCOE Ex. 41 [Nagare Depo. at pp. 118 & 195.) Therefore,
Defendants fail to show that UMF No. 30 is undisputed. 
 
Defendants
failed to meet their initial burden of showing no triable issues of material
fact exist as to Issue No. 2 because UMF Nos. 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, and 30 are
disputed. Therefore, summary adjudication is denied as to Issue No. 2. 
 
iii.       Triable Issues of Material Fact Exists as to Issue No. 3
 
UMF No. 32 states the following
facts: 
Neither Nagare nor Russell had knowledge of Plaintiff’s
Christian beliefs . . . They never took any actions to force Plaintiff to read
any Scientology materials, to require her to attend any group or one-on-one
meetings during which Scientology was discussed or otherwise engaged in any
conduct based on religion. 
 
(UMF 32.) 
 
Defendants present evidence
that Mr. Russell does not recall Plaintiff ever informing him that she was
Christian, just that Plaintiff objected to the CBA assignment due to
Scientology. (DCOE Ex. 44 [Russell Depo. at p. 314: 17-25].) Defendants cite to
page “0133” of the deposition testimony of Melissa Nagare, but the page is not
included in DCOE Exhibit 41. Mr. Russell’s declaration asserts that he never
discussed Plaintiff’s religious faith. (Russell Decl. ¶ 16.) Similarly, Ms.
Nagare asserts that she never made any religion-based statement or required Plaintiff
to read or attend any Scientology-based material or meetings. (Nagare Decl. ¶
28.) 
 
While the court finds that
Defendants met their initial burden of showing that Plaintiff’s religious
beliefs were never discussed, Plaintiff met her subsequent burden of showing
that triable issues of fact exist. Plaintiff asserts she told her supervisor, Mr. Russell, that
it was against her Christian principles to read other religious practice books
like Breaking the Code. (PCOE Ex. 1 [Martinez Depo. at p. 289:10-10],
PCOE Ex. 3 [Russell Depo. at pp. 119:17-120:1, 314:2-16, 314:20-25 ].) Moreover,
whether Breaking the Code teaches Scientology-based practices is a disputed
issue of fact because the contents of the book are at issue and the book has
not been presented into evidence.  No
expert testimony has been offered as to whether the book contains Scientology
principles. 
 
Plaintiff further asserts that
during the coaching sessions with Mr. Dangberg from CBA, she was told to “use
the teachings that they use in the church to have me suppress any memories or
negativity going on in my brain that will allow me to be more creative.” (PCOE
Ex. 1 [Martinez Depo. at p. 207:16-22].) Plaintiff asserts that during the
coaching sessions with Mr. Dangberg, he would dig into Plaintiff’s personal
life and relationships to assess “what negative aspects of my past are coming
to the forefront of my mind to block my ability to do my job properly.”
(Martinez Depo. at p. 209:21-210:17.) Plaintiff asserts that Mr. Dangberg told
her that part of L. Ron Hubbard’s training was to help “people suppress
negative aspects in their life or their memories that allow them to overcome
different barriers, you know, to their current life.” (Martinez Depo. at p.
213:6-11.) Whether the coaching sessions with the CBA are based on Scientology
principles remains a disputed issue of fact as neither party has presented
evidence as to what principles are practiced by the Church of Scientology and
whether those practices differed or were similar to the ones Plaintiff was
“coached” on when attending CBA coaching or training. 
 
Moreover, Defendants failed to
rebut Plaintiff’s evidence that Ms. Nagare informed Plaintiff that CBA coaching
was mandatory. (Ex. 1 [Martinez Depo. at pp. 251:10-15, 260:12-15].)
Plaintiff’s supervisor, Mr. Russell, did the same. (PCOE
Ex. 3 [Russell Depo. at pp. 190:1-9, 299:20-25, 321:10-16, 314:2-25,
316:17-23].)
 
Based on the above, the court
finds that a triable issue of material fact exists as to UMF 32. Therefore,
summary adjudication is denied as to Issue No. 3. 
 
Defendants’ Motion is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
For the reasons set forth above,
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication
is denied. Defendants to give notice.
