And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Animal Protection and Rescue League, Inc., has filed a motion to amend its complaint to substitute Laurie Ginor for deceased Michael Ginor as the defendant. The court has denied the motion, finding that the plaintiff has failed to establish that amending the complaint is warranted. The court has considered the plaintiff's arguments that Laurie Ginor is the successor-in-interest to Michael Ginor and that amending the complaint is necessary for complete relief. However, the court has found that the plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its claims and has not complied with the applicable rules of court. The court has also found that the plaintiff's delay in seeking to amend the complaint has prejudiced the defendant.
