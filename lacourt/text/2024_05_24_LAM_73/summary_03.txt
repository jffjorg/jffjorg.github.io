And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is that the Motion to Compel Compliance with Subpoena for Records of Third Party Witness is DENIED. The case arises from a complaint for elder abuse filed by Claudia Neuman against Evie Ryland. Ryland exercised undue influence on Marian Neuman, Claudia Neuman's stepmother. The Neumans subpoenaed records from the Kohan Foundation, who complied with the subpoena and sent the redacted records to the Neumans. The Court finds that Kohar properly complied with the Neumans' subpoena and the requested records were sent to the Neumans with redactions pursuant to the parties' agreement.
