Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant/Cross-Complainant NC Dynamics LLC's motion for leave to file a second amended cross-complaint. NC Dynamics seeks to assert claims against OKK in addition to TMG. The Court finds that NC Dynamics has sufficiently complied with the procedural requirements outlined in California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324.

On the other hand, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant The Machine Group, Inc.'s motion to compel further discovery responses is denied. TMG's motion is untimely, as it was filed 13 days after the deadline. The Court finds that TMG's argument that the 45-day deadline should run from the date of production is unpersuasive.

The Court grants NC Dynamics' motion for leave to file a second amended cross-complaint and orders Defendant/Cross-Complainant to file the proposed second amended cross-complaint in 10 days. The Court denies TMG's motion to compel further discovery responses.

The hearing is set for May 24, 2024.
