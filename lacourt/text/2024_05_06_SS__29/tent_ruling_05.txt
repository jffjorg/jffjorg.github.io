Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s Counsel Erick B. Novik, Esq. and
Kevin Salute, Esq. of Novik Law Group. 
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On September 29, 2021, Raquel Salomon
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against City of Los Angeles, 7353 Milwood
Avenue, Elkana Arik Aharoni aka Arik Aharoni and Does 1 through 100 for general
negligence and premises liability arising out of a trip and fall occurring on
October 19, 2020.  On August 31, 2022,
Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint.
On February 22, 2024, Erick B. Novik of the
Novik Law Group (“Counsel”) filed this motion to be relieved as counsel. No
opposition has been filed. 
The motion was initially scheduled to be
heard on April 5, 2024, and was continued to May 6, 2024.  The Court withdraws the tentative ruling
issued prior to the April 5 hearing and replaces it with this ruling.
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration and Order to be Relieved as Counsel.  Counsel provides the client’s last known
address and phone number and outlines the efforts made to contact the client.
 
The motion
satisfies all substantive and procedural requirements and is granted.
 
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is GRANTED.
Subsequent to
the filing of the motion, certain dates listed in the proposed Order were
modified.  Counsel is ordered to submit a
revised proposed order with the modified dates.
The order is
effective upon filing of a proof of service showing service of the signed order
on the client.
Moving counsel to
give notice.
