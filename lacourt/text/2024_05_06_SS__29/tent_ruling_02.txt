 Case Number:  20STCV43004    Hearing Date:   May 6, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Compel the Deposition of Plaintiff Rafael H.
Salgado filed by Defendant Memo’s Scaffolding Norwalk, Inc.
 
Tentative
The motion to compel is granted.
The request for sanctions is denied.
Background
On November 10, 2020, Rafael H. Salgado and
William Salgado (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed their complaint against
Memo’s Scaffolding Norwalk, Inc. (“Memo’s Scaffolding”), and Does 1 to 30,
asserting causes of action for Strict Liability and Negligence/Negligence Per
Se arising from a fall on November 19, 2019. 
Memo’s Scaffolding filed its answer on September
8, 2021.
On January 11, 2023, Plaintiffs amended their
complaint to name Gordon S. Gibson, Inc., dba Gordon Gibson Construction
(“Gibson”) as Doe 1. Gibson filed its answer to the complaint on May 3, 2023.
On June 9, 2023, Memo’s Scaffolding filed a
cross-complaint against Gibson.  Gibson filed an answer to the
cross-complaint on June 20, 2023.
On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff William Salgado
filed a request for dismissal of his claims in the complaint with prejudice.
On January 19, 2024, the parties filed a
stipulation continuing trial dates from March to September 2024.
On March 12, 2024, the Court granted the motion
of Plaintiff’s counsel to be relieved.
As it relates to this motion, Gibson noticed the
deposition of Plaintiff Rafael H. Salgado (“Plaintiff”) for October 10, 2023
and then re-noticed the deposition for November 10. (Danishwar Decl., ¶¶ 2-3
& Exhs. 1-2.)  After correspondence among counsel, Plaintiff’s
counsel agreed to produce Plaintiff for deposition on November 16; when a
conflict arose for Gibson’s counsel, the deposition was rescheduled for
December 8. (Id., ¶¶ 4-6 & Exhs. 3-5.)  Memo’s
Scaffolding noticed the deposition of Plaintiff for December 8.  (Id.,
¶ 6 & Exh. 5.)
Plaintiff did not appear for his deposition on
December 8.  (Id., ¶ 11 & Exh. 8.)
On January 5, 2024, Memo’s Scaffolding filed
this motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff.  Memo’s
Scaffolding also seeks sanctions.
No opposition was filed.
The motion came on for hearing on April 15,
2024.  The Court continue the hearing to
May 6, 2024, and set a schedule for supplemental submissions from the parties.
Memo’s Scaffolding filed a supplemental
declaration on April 19.  No supplemental
submission was received from Plaintiff.
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.010.)  Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through
2025.280 provide the requirements for (among other things) what must be
included in a deposition notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and
how and when the notice must be served. 
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280, subd. (a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated
by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having
served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., 2025.450, subd. (a).)  Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id., subd. (b).)   
When a
motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)  
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d),
defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond
to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party
or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Id.,
§ 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion
After several prior attempts, Memo’s Scaffolding noticed the deposition
of Plaintiff for December 8.  (Danishwar Decl., ¶ 6 & Exh. 5.)  Plaintiff did not appear. (Id., ¶ 11 & Exh. 8.)  
 
Memo’s
Scaffolding need not show anything more. 
It has satisfied all substantive and procedural requirements for the
requested relief.
 
The
motion to compel is granted.
 
The
request for sanctions is denied.  The
notice of deposition was served (properly) on Plaintiff’s counsel.  By that time, however, there had been a
breakdown in communication between Plaintiff and his counsel.  Accordingly, the Court does not know whether Plaintiff
was even aware of his obligation to appear for deposition.  Under these circumstances, the Court finds
that the imposition of a sanction against Plaintiff would be unjust.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
GRANTS Defendant’s motion to compel the depositions of Plaintiff. 
 
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff Rafael H. Salgado to appear
for deposition and answer questions under oath on May __, 2024, at 10:00 am, by
remote electronic means, using a link to be provided to Plaintiff by counsel
for Memo’s Scaffolding.
 
The
Court DENIES Defendant’s request for sanctions.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
