Background
This case arises out of an alleged
slip and fall incident in a Sprouts market on North Western Avenue in San Pedro
on October 11, 2019.
 
On September 20, 2021, Edith Reynolds
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against SF Markets, LLC; Sprouts Farmers Market;
Sprouts Farmers Market dba Sprouts; and Does 1 to 25, asserting causes of
action for negligence and premises liability. 
On September 30, 2021, Plaintiff amended her
complaint to name Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. as Doe 1. (Plaintiff named
additional defendants on November 5, 2021, and subsequently filed a request to
dismiss those defendants on May 23, 2022.)
On December 3, 2021, Defendant SF Markets,
LLC (“SF”) filed an answer. 
On October 12 and 14, 2022, Plaintiff amended
her complaint to name Single Source Security, Inc. dba Protos Security as Doe 1
and Single Source Security, LLC as Doe 2.
On February 28, 2023, Single Source Security,
LLC filed an answer to the complaint and a cross-complaint against Prudent
Security Solutions, Inc. (“Prudent”) and Does 1 through 500.
On March 1, 2023, Plaintiff amended her
complaint to name Prudent as Doe 3.
On May 10, 2023, SF filed a cross-complaint
against Single Source Security, LLC dba Protos Security and Roes 1 through
50.  On the same day, SF amended the
cross-complaint to name Prudent as Roe 1.
On July 20 and 21, 2023, Prudent filed an
answer to the complaint and a cross-complaint against SF; First Washington
Realty, Inc. (“First Washington”); GRI Park Plaza, LLC (“GRI”); Sprouts Farmers
Market; Sprouts Farmers Market dba Sprouts; and Moes 1 through 30.
On August 1, 2023, SF, First Washington, and
GRI filed an answer to Prudent’s cross-complaint.
As is relevant to the motions before the
Court and set for hearing on May 6, 2024, SF served Prudent with discovery on
September 13, 2023, including Form Interrogatories (Set One); Special
Interrogatories (Set One); Requests for Production (Set One); and Requests for
Admission (Set One).  (Crossin Decls., ¶
2 & Exhs. A.)  Prudent did not
respond to the discovery.  SF sent a
letter to Prudent on November 28, but no discovery responses were
received.  (Id., ¶ 3 & Exhs. B.)
On March 13, 2024, SF filed these three discovery
motions. 
No timely opposition was filed.
On April 29, 2024, Prudent filed statements
of non-opposition that attached verified responses to all of the discovery
requests.
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor
must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) Requests for admission may be
propounded on a party without leave of court 10 days after the service of the
summons on, or appearance by that party, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.020(b).)
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On September 13, 2023, SF served Prudent with
Form Interrogatories (Set One); Special Interrogatories (Set One); Requests for
Production (Set One); and Requests for Admission (Set One).  (Crossin Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs. A.)  Prudent did not respond to the
discovery.  
After SF filed these motions, and only
shortly before the hearing, Prudent served verified responses to all of the
discovery requests.
The motions to compel Prudent to provide initial
responses to the form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for
production are denied as moot.
The motion for an order deeming admitted as
true by Prudent the matters specified in the requests for admission is
denied.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)
The requests
for sanctions as to the form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and
requests for production are denied.  
 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, subdivision
(c), and section 2031.300, subdivision (c), authorize an award of sanctions
against a party or attorney “who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” a motion to
compel initial responses; here, no opposition was filed.  And sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 “do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary
sanctions for misuse of discovery.”  (City
of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th
466, 504.)  (The Court is aware that the California Supreme Court has
granted review of the City of Los Angeles case, but the Court notes that the
order granting review, filed on January 25, 2023, states that pending review,
the appellate opinion “may be cited,” including “for its persuasive
value.”  The Court finds the reasoning of Justice Moor in the City
of Los Angeles case to be persuasive.)
 
The requests for sanctions as to the requests for admission is
granted.  
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c), mandates an
award of sanctions against a party or attorney “whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated” the
motion for a deemed-admitted order.  
 
Given the relatively straightforward nature of a motion for a
deemed-admitted order, and the economies of scale associated with preparing
multiple, parallel discovery motions, the Court sets sanctions in the amount of
$560, calculated based on two hours of attorney time, multiplied by counsel’s
reasonable billing rate of $250 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee.  (Crossin Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
Conclusion
The Court DENIES as moot the motion to compel Prudent to
provide initial responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Special
Interrogatories (Set One).

The Court DENIES as moot the motion to compel Prudent to provide initial
responses to Requests for Production (Set One).

Prudent as to Requests for Admission (Set One) 
 
The Court DENIES the requests for sanctions on the
motions relating to interrogatories and requests for production.
 
The Court GRANTS the request for sanctions on the motion relating
to requests for admission.

Acker & Whipple law firm, jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions
under the Civil Discovery Act to SF in the amount of $560 within 30 days of
notice.
