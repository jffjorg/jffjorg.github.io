And here is the English text to summarize the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge grants the Defendant's motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Rafael H. Salgado. The Plaintiff did not appear for his deposition on December 8, 2023, despite multiple notices and rescheduling. The Judge finds that the Defendant has satisfied all substantive and procedural requirements for the requested relief. The Judge denies the Defendant's request for sanctions, finding that the imposition of a sanction against the Plaintiff would be unjust, given the breakdown in communication between the Plaintiff and his counsel. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to appear for deposition on May [date], 2024, and answers questions under oath by remote electronic means.
