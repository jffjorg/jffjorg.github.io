```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to compel the inspection of the plaintiff's vehicle is denied as moot, as the inspection has already taken place. The motion to compel non-party Sierro Orlando to comply with a subpoena duces tecum is also denied without prejudice, as there is no proof of service of the motion on the subpoenaed non-party. The judge finds that the defendants have acted with substantial justification and that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust. The judge also denies both parties' requests for sanctions.
