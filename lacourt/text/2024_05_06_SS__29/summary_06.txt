And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the Plaintiffs' motion for a protective order without prejudice. The Plaintiffs argued that the Defendant's expert witness designation was improper because two neurologists would be testifying on the same subject matter, resulting in cumulative and duplicative testimony. However, the judge notes that the issue of potentially duplicative or cumulative testimony is best addressed by the trial judge, and not by the court. The judge has also noted that this case does not involve the risk of undue burden or expense associated with deposing unnecessary or duplicative experts. The Plaintiffs' motion for a protective order is denied without prejudice.
