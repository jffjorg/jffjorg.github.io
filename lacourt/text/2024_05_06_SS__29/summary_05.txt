And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by plaintiff's counsel, Erick B. Novik, Esq., and Kevin Salute, Esq. of Novik Law Group. The motion was filed on February 22, 2024, and no opposition was filed. The judge notes that the court may order an attorney to be changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment, and that an attorney is permitted to withdraw where conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the representation. The judge also notes that the requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case. The motion is granted, but counsel is ordered to submit a revised proposed order with modified dates. The order is effective upon filing of a proof of service showing service of the signed order on the client.
