 Case Number:  21STCV03573    Hearing Date:   May 6, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion for Terminating and Monetary Sanctions

 
Tentative
 
The request for terminating sanctions is denied.
 
The request for monetary sanctions is granted.
 
Background
On
January 29, 2021, Plaintiff Olivia Navarro (“Plaintiff”) filed her complaint
against Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Defendant”), Miguel, and Does 1 through
25 for Negligence and Premises Liability causes of action arising from television
falling on Plaintiff on February 15, 2019.
 
On February
21, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel Downtown L.A. Law Group was disqualified from
representing Plaintiff in this matter. Joseph Farzam Law Firm was substituted
in as attorney on December 6, 2023.
 
On March 8, 2024, the Court ordered Plaintiff to appear
for deposition within 30 days of notice and to pay monetary sanctions in the
amount of $615.
 
Defendant gave notice of this ruling by email on March
12, 2024.
 
On March 19, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for
March 25.  (Bell Decl., ¶ 27 & Exh.
F.)  Plaintiff did not appear (Id.,
¶ 28.)  Plaintiff was actually in the
parking lot of the office of Defendant’s counsel, but Plaintiff’s counsel was unable
to attend because of engine trouble with his motorcycle.  (Navarro Decl., ¶ 3-4; Bell Decl., ¶ 28;
Allen Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.)  The next day,
Plaintiff’s counsel reached out, apologized, and asked when Defendant wanted to
reschedule the deposition.  (Allen Decl.,
Exh. 3.)
 
On April 8, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for
terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions. Plaintiff filed an opposition on April
23, and Defendant filed a reply on May 1. 
 
Legal Standard
When a party fails to obey
an order compelling attendance and testimony at a deposition, “the court may
make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction,
an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 [of the Civil
Discovery Act.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (h).)  “In lieu of, or in
addition to, this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 ….”  (Ibid.)
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice
to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing,
may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a
misuse of the discovery process: ... (d) The court may impose a terminating
sanction …."  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) “Misuses of the
discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following: ... (d) Failing
to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. ... (g)
Disobeying a court order to provide discovery."  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010.)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
A
“terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary
discovery sanction is never justified.” 
(Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.) 
Discussion
Defendant requests terminating sanctions as Plaintiff has
failed to comply with the Court’s of March 8, 2024, to appear for deposition. 
 
The request is denied. 
The Court understands that Plaintiff has failed to sit for a deposition
throughout the course of this litigation, and violating even one court order on
one occasion is a very serious matter. 
Nonetheless, a terminating sanction requires evidence of repeated,
willful abuse, and there is not sufficient evidence in the record here to
support the extreme sanction that Defendant seeks.
 
Defendant has made a sufficient showing for monetary
sanctions, but not nearly in the amount sought. 
Spending more than 32 hours of time on a sanctions motion is not
reasonable.  More than $3,500 in
cancellation fees is not reasonable.  Sanctions
under the Civil Discovery Act are limited to the reimbursement of “reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)  Sanctions are not designed to punish.
 
The Court sets sanctions in the amount of $1,575,
calculated based on 3 hours of attorney time, multiplied by counsel’s
reasonable billing rate of $205 per hour, plus $900 in cancellation fees, plus
the $60 filing fee.  (See Bell Decl., ¶¶
29, 32-33.)
 
Sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff’s counsel only,
as the expenses incurred by Defendant were the result of the conduct of
counsel, not Plaintiff herself.
 
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion for
terminating sanctions.
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion for
monetary sanctions.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff’s counsel, the Joseph
Farzam Law Firm, to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act to
Defendant in the amount of $1,575 within 30 days of notice of this order.
Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
