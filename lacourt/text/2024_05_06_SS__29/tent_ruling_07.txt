 Case Number:  21STCV46825    Hearing Date:   May 6, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendants’ Motion to Compel Inspection of Plaintiff’s
Vehicle 
 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
This case arises out of an alleged automobile
accident on January 2, 2020, at or near the Port of Long Beach in Long Beach,
California.  On December 23, 2021, Plaintiff Alfred Leon Ackerson
(“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this action asserting a cause of action
for negligence against Defendants Shippers Transport Express, Jose Cruz, and
DOES 1-50, for negligence/negligence per se cause of action.
On July 25, 2022, Defendants Shippers Transport
Express, Inc. and Jose Cruz (collectively, “Defendants”) filed their Answer to
the Complaint.
On May 31, 2023, Defendants served Plaintiff
with a demand for inspection of a vehicle.  (Warren Decl., ¶ 4 &
Exh. A.)  Plaintiff did not serve a response to the
discovery.  (Id., ¶ 6.)  Defendants’ investigator
apparently obtained information that the vehicle may be in the possession of
non-party Sierro Orlando in Baldwin Park, California, but Mr. Orlando
reportedly told Defendants’ investigator that he did not have possession of the
vehicle.  (Id., ¶¶ 7-8.)
Defendants previously filed a motion with
regard to this requested vehicle inspection. 
When Defendants did not appear at the hearing on February 8, 2024, the
motion was placed off calendar.   
On February 21, 2024, Defendants filed this new
motion to compel the inspection of Plaintiff’s vehicle. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on April 23, 2024.  Defendant
filed a reply on May 1, 2024.  
Legal
Standard
A party must respond to demands for inspection
within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a
party to whom the demand is directed does not provide a timely response, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate
statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
When a party moves to compel initial responses
to demands for inspection, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the
discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of
“the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
Defendants move
for an order (1) compelling Plaintiff to produce the vehicle at issue for
inspection and (2) compelling non-party Sierra Orlando to comply with a
subpoena duces tecum.
The motion to
compel Plaintiff to produce the vehicle for inspection is denied as moot.  The requested vehicle inspection occurred on
April 17, 2024.  (Gomez Decl., ¶¶
3-4.)  
The motion to
compel non-party Sierra Orlando to comply with a subpoena duces tecum, or to do
anything else, is denied without prejudice. 
There is no proof of service of the motion on the subpoenaed non-party.
Defendants’
request for sanctions, which appears in their reply, is denied.  A request for sanctions must appear in a
notice of motion and motion (or, on discovery motions, in an opposition).
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is denied.  Defendants’
motion is moot because, after the motion was filed, Plaintiff complied with the
request for the inspection.  Under these
circumstances, the Court finds that Defendants have acted with substantial
justification and that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust.
Conclusion
The
Court DENIES Defendants’ motion.
 
The
Court DENIES both parties’ request for sanctions.
 
Moving
party is to give notice.
