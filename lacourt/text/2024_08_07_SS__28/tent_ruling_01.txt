On

litem for Plaintiff Dalilah Villalobos. 
On
October 29, 2020, the Court appointed Maria Dominguez to serve as guardian ad
litem for Plaintiff Catalina Villalobos. 
On
May 6, 2022, Defendants Final Touch Construction & Design, Luis Anthony
Echeverria, and Luis M. Echeverria filed an answer and a cross-complaint against
Cross-Defendants Roes 1-25 for equitable/implied

On

Echeverria, Luis M. Echeverria, and Roes 1-100 for negligence, wrongful death and survival action,
equitable/implied indemnity, comparative contribution, apportionment of fault,
and tort of another. 
On
November 29, 2022 and January 4, 2023, the Court dismissed Defendants Lorraine
Garcia and Gus Garcia without prejudice at Plaintiffs’ request. 
On
June 14, 2023, Cross-Complainant Chantra Sun filed a notice of settlement. 
On
July 9, 2024, Petitioner Laura Eggleston
(“Eggleston”) filed a petition for approval of minor’s compromise.  Also on July 9, 2024, Petitioner Maria Dominguez
(“Dominguez”) filed a petition for approval of minor’s compromise. The petitions were set for hearing on August 7, 2024. 
On
August 5, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration stating that minor
Plaintiffs have been appointed guardians in guardianship cases pending in San
Bernardino County superior court’s probate court.  As a result, Counsel asks the Court to modify
the petitions’ responses to Section 18 of the petitions.  Counsel also states that attorneys for the
guardians in the San Bernardino cases “have agreed a structured settlement in
the best interest of the Plaintiffs and on August 1, 2024, received approval
from the Probate Court to proceed with the structured settlement on behalf of
their clients.”  Counsel has not provided
additional information about the structured settlement. 
PETITIONERS’ REQUESTS 
Petitioner Laura Eggleston asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of minor Plaintiff Dalilah Villalobos. Petitioner Maria Dominguez asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of minor Plaintiff Catalina Villalobos. 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Dalilah Villalobos 
The petition
states that the gross settlement amount is $108,000.00, to consist of (1) a lump
sum payment of $5,000 by Chantra Sun, (2) a lump sum payment of $93,125 by
Final Touch Construction & Design, and (3) a lump sum payment of $9,875 by
Luis M. Echeverria. 
Although
the petition asks that the net settlement amount of $81,383.48 be invested in a single-premium deferred
annuity, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court, counsel’s
August 5, 2024 letter asks the Court to modify the petition by striking Section
18b(3) and checking Section 18a(3).  
The
Court will not modify the petition.  Petitioner
should submit an amended petition along with information explaining how the net
settlement proceeds will be “deposit[ed] or transfer[red],” with any necessary attachments.  (See Section 18a(3), subdivisions (a)-(e).) 
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice. 
B.   Catalina Villalobos 
The
petition states that the gross settlement amount is $108,000.00, to consist of
(1) a lump sum payment of $5,000 by Chantra Sun, (2) a lump sum payment of
$93,125 by Final Touch Construction & Design, and (3) a lump sum payment of
$9,875 by Luis M. Echeverria. 
Section
12 of the petition states that total medical expenses were $1,070.00, which
Petitioner paid.  Sections 12 and 16b do
not, however, show that Petitioner will be reimbursed for this payment from the
settlement proceeds.  The Court cannot
approve a petition for minor’s compromise unless it shows that all medical
expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed from
the settlement proceeds. 
Although
the petition asks that the net settlement amount of $81,822.48 be invested in a
single-premium deferred annuity, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of
the court, counsel’s August 5, 2024 letter asks the Court to modify the
petition by striking Section 18b(3) and checking Section 18a(3).  
The
Court will not modify the petition.  Petitioner
should submit an amended petition along with information explaining how the net
settlement proceeds will be “deposit[ed] or transfer[red],” with any necessary attachments.  (See Section 18a(3), subdivisions (a)-(e).) 
 The Court denies the petition
without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff
Dalilah Villalobos’s claims filed by
Petitioner Laura Eggleston on July 9,
2024. 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of minor
Plaintiff Catalina Villalobos’s claims filed by Petitioner Maria Dominguez on
July 9, 2024. 
Petitioners
are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioners
