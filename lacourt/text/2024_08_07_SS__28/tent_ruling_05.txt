On
November 27, 2023, the clerk entered Care Transportation’s default. 
On
April 22, 2024, Plaintiffs filed JUD-100 forms and declarations in support of a
default judgment. 
On
June 4, 2024, the Court issued a minute order stating that Plaintiffs had not
filed the required CIV-100 form.  
On
July 31, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a CIV-100 form requesting $1 million in special damages, $12 million in general damages, and $754.73 in costs. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS         
Plaintiffs
asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant Care
Transportation Services, LLC and award Plaintiffs $13,000,754.73. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
A request
for default judgment must include “dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against
specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a
showing of grounds for each judgment . . . .” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(7).)  Plaintiffs have not complied with this
requirement. 
Section
2f of the CIV-100 form is blank. 
Plaintiffs’
declarations do not establish a prima facie case for $12,000,000 in general
damages and $1,000,000 in special damages.  
Plaintiffs
have not submitted evidence of fraud, malice, or oppression that would support
a punitive damage award or evidence that
would allow the Court to determine the effect of such an award on Care
Transportation.  (See Del Junco v.
Hufnagel (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 789, 791 [reversing default judgment’s
punitive damage award because record contained no proof of defendant’s
financial condition].) 
The
Court denies the application for default judgment. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court
DENIES without prejudice Plaintiffs’ application for default judgment filed on July 31, 2024. 
Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
