Here is the summary in English:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Magic Mountain, LLC's motion for leave to file an amended answer. The amended answer will include new affirmative defenses of estoppel, res judicata and collateral estoppel, and waiver. The motion was filed in response to Defendant's discovery of facts supporting these affirmative defenses in January 2024. Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that Defendant did not act diligently and that the amendment will not prejudice Plaintiff. The Court finds that allowing the amendment will not prejudice Plaintiff and grants the motion. Defendant is ordered to file and serve the first amended answer within 30 days of the hearing on this motion.
