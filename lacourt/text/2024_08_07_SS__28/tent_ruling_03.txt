LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.010 provides in part: 
“(a) Any party may obtain discovery within the scope
delimited by Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 2017.010), and subject to the
restrictions set forth in Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 2019.010), by
inspecting, copying, testing, or sampling documents, tangible things, land or
other property, and electronically stored information in the possession,
custody, or control of any other party to the action. 
* * *
 “(c) A party may demand that any other party produce
and permit the party making the demand, or someone acting on the demanding
party’s behalf, to inspect and to photograph, test, or sample any tangible
things that are in the possession, custody, or control of the party on whom the
demand is made. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010,
subds. (a), (c).) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides in part: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c)  . . . [T]he court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). . . .” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subds. (a), (b), (c).) 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 provides in part: 
          “(a) On receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding
party deems that any of the following apply: 
* * *
  “(3) An objection in the response is without merit or
too general. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
each of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(3) In lieu of a separate statement required under
the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a
concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute. 
“(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45
days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party
and the responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any
right to compel a further response to the demand. 
* * *
  “(h) Except as provided in subdivision (j), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subds. (a), (b), (c), (h).) 
DISCUSSION 
         On
January 10, 2024, Plaintiff served a demand to inspect Castillo’s truck and its
event data recorder.  On January 26,
2024, Castillo’s counsel served objections to Plaintiff’s demand. 
          Plaintiff filed a motion to compel Castillo’s compliance
with the inspection demand.  Plaintiff
cites Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.010 and 2025.480 as authority for
the motion, but neither statute authorizes a motion to compel on these facts.  Plaintiff apparently intended to file a motion
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 (which Plaintiff does not cite),
but this statute authorizes a motion to compel only when the party to whom the
demand for inspection is directed fails to serve a timely response.  Here, Castillo’s counsel served timely objections. 
If
Plaintiff believed the objections were “without merit or too general,” Plaintiff
could have filed a motion to compel further responses under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.310.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3).) 
Plaintiff did not file a motion under this statute, which requires the
moving party to file a separate statement or (if the Court allows) “a concise
outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(3).)   Plaintiff
contends that a separate statement was not required under California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b), which excuses a separate statement “[w]hen no response
has been provided to the request for discovery.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  Here, however, Castillo’s counsel served
timely objections to the inspection demand. 
Therefore, a separate statement was required. 
The
Court denies Plaintiff's motion. 
Intervenor
asks the Court to impose sanctions on Plaintiff.  Sanctions are mandatory under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.300 unless the Court “finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c); see Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h)
[same standard for motions to compel further responses].)  The Court finds that Plaintiff did not act
with substantial justification and that the imposition of sanctions would not
be unjust. 
Intervenor
requests $2,255.00 in sanctions based on eleven hours of attorney time at a
rate of $205.00 per hour.  Counsel spent
four hours evaluating and analyzing Plaintiff’s moving papers and five hours
preparing the opposition.  Counsel anticipated spending two hours to appear and
argue at the hearing.  The Court awards
sanctions of $615.00 based on three hours of attorney time. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Deborah Russell’s “Motion
to Compel Defendant Oscar Castillo’s Production of the Subject 2006 Nissan 2600
White Box Truck (License Plate 94526S2).” 
The
Court grants Intervenor Infinity Insurance Company’s request for sanctions and
orders Plaintiff Deborah Russell and her
counsel to pay Intervenor Infinity
Insurance Company $615.00 by September 6, 2024. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. Plaintiff is ordered to file a proof of service of this ruling with
the Court within five days.
