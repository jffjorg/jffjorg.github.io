And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving, opposition, reply, and ex parte papers in this case. The plaintiff seeks to modify the court's February 28, 2024 order, reopen discovery, and continue the trial. The defendant opposes the motion.

The court construes the plaintiff's motion as a motion to reopen discovery under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050. However, the court denies the motion because the plaintiff has not provided a meet and confer declaration showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.

The court grants in part the plaintiff's ex parte application to continue the trial, continuing the trial for 30 days or to the next available date, based on the plaintiff's counsel's medical condition. The court does not reopen or continue discovery.

The court denies the plaintiff's motion to modify the order and reopen discovery. The court's final ruling is that the court denies the motion to modify the order and reopen discovery, grants in part the ex parte application to continue the trial, and continues the trial for 30 days or to the next available date.
