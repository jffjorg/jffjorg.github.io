PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of Plaintiff
Reyna Escobar. 
DISCUSSION 
The petition
provides the following information: 
Gross
settlement amount: $1,890.00 Total
medical expenses: $4,450.00 Reductions:
$3,532.50 Payment/reimbursement
from proceeds: $917.50 Attorney’s
fees: $472.50 Non-medical
costs: $0 Net
balance: $500.00
The petition
lists two figures for attorney’s fees: $540.00 in Section 13a and $472.50 in
Section 16c.  The Court awards $472.50
because that amount is 25% of the gross settlement amount (as stated in counsel’s
supporting declaration) and $472.50 is the amount listed in the proposed order. 
The
Court grants the petition. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Petitioner Desiree Escobar’s petition to approve the compromise of
minor Ryan Escobar’s claims, including an attorney fee award of $472.50. The Court orders that the net balance of $500.00 be
transferred to Petitioner Desiree Escobar for the benefit of minor Plaintiff Reyna
Escobar under the California Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
