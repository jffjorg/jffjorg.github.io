English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel further responses to discovery requests and a motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, WC Insurance Agency LLC, Omni Safe Insurance Agency LLC, and Joshua Sawicki, filed the motion to compel further responses after defendants, James S. Bekhor Insurance Services Inc. and JSB Holdings LLC, failed to respond to discovery requests. The plaintiff also seeks sanctions for defendants' failure to respond. The judge finds that the motion is untimely for most requests and must be denied in part. However, the judge grants the motion for the documents requested in the Amended Deposition Notices and orders defendants to produce the documents within 30 days. The judge also denies the motion to compel further responses for non-deposition discovery. The hearing on the motion for summary judgment is continued to March 15, 2024.
