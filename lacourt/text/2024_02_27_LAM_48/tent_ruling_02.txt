[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING
  IN PART MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES; CONTINUING MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
 
Dept. 48

MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES
Plaintiffs
WC Insurance Agency LLC, Omni Safe Insurance Agency LLC, and Joshua Sawicki served
various discovery requests on Defendants James S. Bekhor Insurance Services Inc.
(“JSB Insurance”) and JSB Holdings LLC (“JSB Holdings”).  (See Mankey Decl. ¶ 6 & Exs. 2, 5, 6, 9, 10,
12, 13, 15, 16, 18.)  The parties granted
each other extensions to respond and to file discovery motions.  (See Mankey Decl. ¶¶ 7-8, 15; id., Ex.
25 at pp. 4-5.)
On
December 1, 2023, Plaintiff Joshua Sawicki filed a motion to compel further responses
to discovery and for sanctions of at least $18,860.00.
On
January 16, 2023, Defendants filed an objection to the motion.
At the January 25, 2024 hearing, the Court
continued the hearing and ordered the parties to meet and confer and file a joint
statement for the requests to compel production of documents for deposition.
A.        The Motion’s Memorandum Complies with This Department’s Procedures.
Defendants
object to Plaintiff’s failure to serve the memorandum of points and authorities
until January 12, 2024.  (Objections at p.
2.)
A
party moving to compel further responses must file a Separate Statement or follow
the Court’s alternative method of outlining the disputes.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b), 2031.310,
subd. (b); California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b).)  This Department requires the parties to meet and
confer on the substantive issues before filing a joint statement, following the
procedures outlined in Exhibit A of Department 48’s Courtroom Information (available
on the court’s website).  This Department
also specifies: “After the Joint Stipulation is filed, each party may file a supplemental
memorandum of law not later than ten days before the hearing date.  A supplemental memorandum may not exceed five
pages in length.  No other separate memorandum
of points and authorities may be filed by either party in connection with the motion.”
Plaintiff’s
motion complies with these procedures.  However,
for the reasons set forth below, that is the extent of the motion’s compliance.
B.        The
Motion Does Not Comply with Electronic Filing Requirements.
Defendants
object to the “improper, confusing, difficult to navigate” form of the motion, which
“seeks to compel further responses to up to approximately 16 different discovery
requests, which are not electronically bookmarked, as required.”  (Objections at p. 2.)
Under
the Court’s First Amended General Order for electronic filing, the table of contents
and all attachments, including exhibits, must be bookmarked.  (General Order No. 2019-GEN-014-00, at ¶¶ 6(b)-(d);
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(f)(4).)
Plaintiff’s
motion contains no bookmarks, which is particularly troublesome for a 168-page Joint
Statement with 11 different sections.  If
Plaintiff continues to electronically file noncompliant documents, the Court may
strike the filings or issue sanctions.
C.        Plaintiff Did Not Provide Proper Notice
of His Request for Sanctions.
“A
request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every person, party,
and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify the type of sanction
sought.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.040.)
The
Notice of Motion states that “Plaintiff Joshua Sawicki will, and hereby does, move
this Court for an [order] to compel Defendants’ Further Responses To Discovery and
Production of Documents and for Sanctions.” 
Plaintiff did not identify the specific parties against whom sanctions are
sought, the type of sanction sought, or the amount of monetary sanctions.
It
was not until Plaintiff’s January 12, 2024 supplemental memorandum’s Introduction
section that Plaintiff requested that Defendants “pay monetary sanctions of at least
$18,860.00” and “be prohibited from introducing or entering into evidence in this
case any documents that Defendants themselves have not produced to date and testimony
or other evidence of the subject matters of the interrogatories to which they did
not provide timely substantive responses.” 
Defendants did not have notice of the type or amount of sanctions before
that.
At the original hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel
argued that sanctions are nevertheless mandatory because the governing statutes
state that the Court “shall impose” a monetary sanction against the unsuccessful
party.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480,
subd. (j) [depositions]; 2030.300, subd. (d) [interrogatories]; 2031.310, subd.
(h) [production of documents].)]
The same statutes also provide an exception
to mandatory monetary sanctions: when the Court finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.
Here, Defendants were substantially justified
in opposing Plaintiff’s motion.  Additionally,
the Court denies the majority of Plaintiff’s motion, so sanctions against Defendants
would be unjust.
D.        The Motion is Brought By Only One Plaintiff, But It Seeks Discovery
Responses to Requests Propounded by Other Plaintiffs.
The
Notice of Motion, Joint Statement, and supporting memorandum state that they are
being brought by only Plaintiff Joshua Sawicki. 
However, some of the requests were propounded by a different defendant.  (See Mankey Decl. ¶ 6 & Exs. 2, 5, 6, 9, 10,
12, 13, 15, 16, 18.)
Plaintiff
WC Insurance Agency, LLC d/b/a BMP Insurance propounded (1) Special Interrogatories
to Defendant James S. Bekhor Insurance Services, Inc. D/B/A Active Insurance, Set
One; (2) Special Interrogatories to Defendant JSB Holdings, LLC, Set One; (3) Requests
for Production of Documents for James S. Bekhor Insurance Services, Inc. D/B/A Active
Insurance, Set One; (4) Requests for Production of Documents for JSB Holdings, LLC,
Set One; (5) Requests for Admission to James S. Bekhor Insurance Services, Inc.
D/B/A Active Insurance, Set One; and (6) Requests for Admission to JSB Holdings,
LLC, Set One.  (Mankey Decl., Exs. 2, 6, 10,
13, 16, 18.)
Plaintiff
Joshua Sawicki cannot compel further responses to these requests.
E.        The Motion is Untimely For Most Requests
and Must Be Denied In Part.
In
the absence of a written agreement between the parties, a motion to compel further
responses to RFPs, interrogatories, and RFAs must be filed within 45 days after
the insufficient response.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.300, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (c), 2033.290, subd. (c).)  This deadline is jurisdictional and “renders the
court without authority to rule on motions to compel other than to deny them.”  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th
1403, 1409-1410.)
On
October 18, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendants’ counsel to confirm the
parties’ current deadlines and proposed new deadlines.  (Mankey Decl., Ex. 26 at pp. 1-2.)  Included in the chart was a timeline for meeting
and conferring about the discovery issues, Defendants’ additions to the Joint Statement,
and Plaintiff’s deadline to file a motion to compel further responses.  Plaintiff stated a current deadline of October
24, 2023 for “File and serve Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses and Production
of Documents,” noted that the
“Current deadline is pursuant to CCP 2030.300(c) and can be extended,” and
proposed a new deadline of November 6, 2023.
On
October 20, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendants’ counsel to confirm their
phone discussion the day before.  (Mankey
Decl., Ex. 26 at p. 1.)  Plaintiff’s counsel
confirmed: “Your clients agree to provide substantive responses to discovery and
responsive documents by November 6, 2023, in order to eliminate the need for a discovery
motion (which is currently scheduled for hearing on Nov. 28, 2023).”  The remainder of the email confirmed the dates
for depositions and Plaintiff’s motion for summary adjudication.
Plaintiff
did not file a motion on November 6, 2023, and there is no evidence of a later written
agreement between the parties to extend the filing deadline.  At the original hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel argued that by extending Defendants’
time to respond, that also extended the deadline to file a motion.  But November 6, 2023 was the last written extension
for filing a motion.  Although Plaintiff granted
Defendants additional time to respond before requiring a motion, Defendants did
not confirm any additional time for filing that motion.
On
November 16, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel informed Defendants’ counsel that “we will
be filing the attached motion on Monday, November 20, given the continued failure
of the Defendants to satisfy their discovery obligations despite our efforts to
meet and confer,” and requested any of Defendants’ arguments for the Joint Statement
by the end of November 17.  (Mankey Decl.,
Ex. 25 at pp. 1-2.)  Defendants’ counsel replied
that he was out of town and would get back to her on Sunday.  Plaintiff’s counsel replied that she would “wait
until December 1 to file the motion to compel and will include your arguments if
you get them to me by noon on November 30.” 
There is no evidence of a response or agreement by Defendants to extend the
filing deadline to December 1, 2023.
At the original hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel
argued that when a party does not respond at all, there is no 45-day deadline to
move to compel responses.  That is correct.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300, 2031.320.)  However, even when Defendants provided only objections,
those objections are a complete response. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.240, 2031.240.)  This argument is also perplexing in light of Plaintiff’s
exhibits and presentation of the motion. 
Counsel’s October 18, 2023 email made clear that the motion deadline was
“pursuant to CCP 2030.300(c) and can be extended.”  (Mankey Decl., Ex. 26 at pp. 1-2.)  The motion is captioned “NOTICE OF MOTION TO COMPEL
DEFENDANTS’ FURTHER RESPONSES . . .”  The
Joint Statement includes Defendants’ original responses and “PLAINTIFF’S REASONS
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSE.”  In all respects,
this motion was presented as—and is—a motion to compel further responses, and it
is subject to the 45-day filing deadline.
This
motion was filed on December 1, 2023—long after Defendants’ 2022 responses, and
after the parties’ last written and agreed-upon motion deadline of November 6, 2023.  This Court has no jurisdiction to rule on the
merits of the motion.
The motion is DENIED for all non-deposition
discovery.
F.         Defendants
Must Produce the Documents Requested in the Amended Deposition Notices.
At the original hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel
argued that the request to compel production of documents for deposition was timely.  The depositions of each Defendant’s PMK occurred
on November 21, 2023.  (Mankey Decl. ¶ 14
& Exs. 27-28.)  The motion is therefore
timely with respect to the depositions.  (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (b).) 
The Court therefore ordered the parties to file a joint statement for these
items after meeting and conferring.  Defendants
did not respond to Plaintiff’s attempts to meet and confer, and they did not provide
arguments for the joint statement.
Plaintiff seeks an order requiring production
of documents and permitting Plaintiff to reopen the depositions of Jeremy Bekhor
and Defendants’ PMKs after substantive responses and documents have been produced.  (First Joint Statement at p. 154.)
1.         The
Motion is Denied for the Deposition of Jeremy Bekhor Individually.
Jeremy
Bekhor, individually, is no longer a party to this action and was not served with
notice of this motion.  Neither counsel’s
declaration nor the Joint Statement provide any information about his deposition
notice or subpoena.  (See Mankey Decl. ¶ 14,
First Joint Statement at p. 154.)  The motion
is DENIED as to Jeremy Bekhor individually.
2.         Defendants Must Produce the Requested
Documents.
Plaintiff took the deposition of Defendants’
PMK on November 21, 2023.  (Mankey Suppl.
Decl. ¶ 4.)  Defendants did not serve any
written objections or responses to either of the Amended Deposition Notices, and
they did not produce any documents.  (Mankey
Suppl. Decl. ¶ 4.)
Defendants’ January 16, 2024 objection to
the motion did not substantively respond to any discovery requests.  After the original hearing, the parties met and
conferred, and Defendants indicated that they were willing to produce documents.  (Mankey Suppl. Decl. ¶¶ 8-11.)  Defendants did not provide any objections to Plaintiff
before the joint statement was due, and they have not provided any documents or
argument for the joint statement.  (Mankey
Suppl. Decl. ¶¶ 11-12.)
When a party fails to serve timely responses
to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve timely responses
waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection
of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (a).)
The motion is GRANTED for the documents
requested in the Amended Deposition Notices. 
Defendants must produce responses, without objections, within 30 days.
MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION
On the Court’s own motion, the Hearing on
Motion for Summary Judgment is CONTINUED to March 15, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
Moving party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
