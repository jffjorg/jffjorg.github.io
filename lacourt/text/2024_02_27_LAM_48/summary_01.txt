And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motions to quash the subpoenas and continues the hearing on the motion to compel further discovery responses. The plaintiff seeks to quash two subpoenas served by the defendant for the plaintiff's medical records and billing records. The defendant argues that the requests are reasonable and relevant to the plaintiff's claimed injuries. The judge finds that the plaintiff has put her physical and mental health at issue for these injuries, and the defendant is entitled to her medical records as they relate to these injuries. The motion to quash is denied with respect to the medical records. The defendant is willing to withdraw its request for billing records if the plaintiff is not seeking damages for those records. The plaintiff has not responded to this offer, and the motion is denied with respect to the billing records. The judge orders Kaiser Permanente to produce the requested records within 60 days. The hearing on the motion to compel further discovery responses is continued to May 2, 2024.
