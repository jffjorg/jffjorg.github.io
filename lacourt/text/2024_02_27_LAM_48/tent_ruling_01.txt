  CASE NO.: 20STCV25735
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF’S MOTIONS
  TO QUASH SUBPOENAS; CONTINUING HEARING ON MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
February 27, 2024



 
On July 9, 2020, Plaintiff
Hilda Rodriguez-Guzman filed this action against Defendants The Accelerated
Schools and Johnathan Williams.
Pending
before the Court are two discovery motions.
MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENAS
On
November 7, 2023, Defendants served two subpoenas on Kaiser Permanente for
Plaintiff’s medical records (Department of Psychiatry) and billing records. 
On
December 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to quash the subpoenas or for a
protective order to limit the subpoenas. 
Plaintiff argues that the requests violate her right to privacy and
records prior to 2016 are not relevant.
“‘[F]or
discovery purposes, information is relevant if it might reasonably assist a party
in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement’ and ‘[a]dmissibility
is not the test and information, unless privileged, is discoverable if it might
reasonably lead to admissible evidence.’ 
These rules are applied liberally in favor of discovery . . . and (contrary
to popular belief) fishing expeditions are permissible in some cases.”  (Cruz v. Superior Court (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th
646, 653, citations omitted.)  The Court must
“balance the public need against the weight of the privacy right,” and only serious
invasions of privacy will bar discovery. 
(Crab Addison, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 958,
966.)  There is not an egregious invasion
of privacy every time there is a request for private information, and courts must
“place the burden on the party asserting a privacy interest to establish its extent
and seriousness of the prospective invasion.” 
(Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 557.)
Plaintiff
alleges that she suffers “severe and permanent emotional and mental distress
and anguish, humiliation, embarrassment, fright, shock, pain, discomfort and anxiety”
due to Defendants’ actions.  (Complaint ¶
81; see Complaint ¶¶ 105, 134, 164, 208, 238, 270, 278, 301, 305-306, 308, 331,
378, 397.)  There is no privilege for communications
relevant to a patient’s health if that issue has been tendered by the patient.  (Slagle v. Superior Court (1989) 211 Cal.App.3d
1309, 1313.)  “A patient tenders the issue
of his physical health if he files an action for personal injuries but only as to
information which relates to the claimed injuries.”  (Ibid.)  As Defendants set forth, Plaintiff’s
discovery responses and deposition also asserted physical, mental, and emotional
injuries.  (Opposition at pp. 3-4.)  Accordingly, Plaintiff has put her physical and
mental health at issue for these injuries, and Defendants are entitled to her
medical records as they relate to these injuries.  As to Plaintiff’s request to limit the time
period of the record, Defendants’ request for records since 2012 is reasonable
and relevant because Plaintiff was employed by Defendants since September 2007,
became a Health Service Coordinator in 2012, and was terminated in July 2019.  (Complaint ¶¶ 16, 41.)
The
motion to quash is DENIED with respect to the medical records.
For
the billing records, Defendants are willing to withdraw this request on the
condition that Plaintiff is not seeking those damages.  (Opposition at p. 5.)  Plaintiff has not responded to this
offer.  At the hearing, Plaintiff should
inform the Court and Defendants if she is willing to stipulate to this
condition.  Otherwise, the motion is
DENIED with respect to the billing records because Plaintiff alleges damages
that include “medical and related expenses for care and procedures both now and
in the future.”  (Complaint ¶ 80; see,
e.g., Complaint ¶¶ 104, 133, 163, 205, 237, 269, 307, 309 [“Plaintiff has been
forced to incur expenses for medical care, X-rays, and laboratory costs, and is
informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Plaintiff will in the future be
forced to incur additional expenses of the same nature.”].)
The
motion to quash is DENIED.
Kaiser
Permanente is ordered to produce the requested records pursuant to the subpoena
within 60 days.
The
request for sanctions is denied.  Defendants
do have a legitimate discovery interest in Plaintiff’s medical records related to
her claimed injuries.  Therefore, the Court
finds that Defendant was substantially justified in opposing the motion.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.090, subd. (d).)
Defendants’
request for sanctions is also denied.
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER
On
November 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses to
Request for Production of Documents, Set Three.
On
January 19, 2024, the parties stipulated to continue the hearing on the motion
because, after meeting and conferring, Defendant agreed to produce further
documents and responses.
As
of the date of the Court’s tentative ruling, the parties have not provided any other
updates.  The Court cannot determine
which RFPs are still at issue and which ones have been resolved by Defendant’s
supplemental production.
Accordingly,
on the Court’s own motion, the Hearing on Motion to Compel Further Discovery
Responses is CONTINUED to May 2, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley
Mosk Courthouse.
Five
court days before the hearing, the parties are ordered to file a Joint
Statement outlining the remaining disputes, following the procedures outlined
in Exhibit A of Department 48’s Courtroom Information (available on the Court’s
website).  If the matter is fully
resolved, then Plaintiff shall take the hearing off calendar.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit.  If all parties in the case submit on the
tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are required unless a
companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference) is also on
calendar.
 
        
Dated this 27th day of February 2024
