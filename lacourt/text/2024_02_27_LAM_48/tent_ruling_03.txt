[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFFS’
  MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
February 27, 2024



 
On November 9, 2021, Plaintiffs
Carina Herrera Garrett and Randy T. Garrett filed this action against Defendant
General Motors LLC arising from Plaintiffs’ purchase of an allegedly defective vehicle.
On
June 22, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel further responses.
MOTION DEFICIENCIES
For
a motion to compel further, Plaintiffs must meet and confer with Defendant and file
a Separate Statement or follow the Court’s alternative method of outlining the disputes.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b); California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b).)  This Department
requires the parties to follow the procedures outlined in Exhibit A of Department
48’s Courtroom Information (available on the Court’s website) and file a joint statement.
The
parties did not follow Department 48’s procedures for a joint statement.
DISCUSSION
A
party may move to compel a further response to a demand for production of documents
if the demanding party deems that the statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete; the representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete,
or evasive; or an objection in the response is without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)  The motion must set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)
Plaintiffs
seek further responses to six categories of documents: (1) the subject vehicle (RFP
Nos. 1, 7); (2) Defendant’s knowledge and investigation of defects in similar vehicles
(RFP Nos. 20-27, 32, 41, 44-51, 56, 65); (3) defects in similar vehicles (RFP Nos.
87, 100); (4) Defendant’s Song-Beverly and buyback policies and procedures (RFP
Nos. 110, 111); (5) communications with third parties about defects in similar vehicles
(RFP Nos. 125, 127, 128, 129, 131-135); and (6) other documents about the subject
vehicle’s defects (RFP Nos. 139, 142, 143).
RFP

and produce selected documents.  Defendant’s
objections are overruled.  The motion is GRANTED.
RFP
Nos. 20-27, 32, 41, 44-51, 56, 65 seek Defendant’s knowledge and investigation of
the same brake defects in the same make of vehicle.  Defendant responded that no documents would be
produced.  These requests are limited to the
same defects and vehicle alleged by Plaintiffs, and they are relevant to Defendant’s
knowledge and willfulness.  Defendant’s objections
are overruled.  The motion is GRANTED.
RFP
Nos. 87, 100 seek executive summaries, summaries, reports, analyses, evaluations,
or memoranda about problems with the same brake system and engine.  Defendant responded that no documents would be

knowledge and willfulness.  Defendant’s objections
are overruled.  The motion is GRANTED.

and manuals provided to authorized repair facilities.  Defendant responded that no documents would be
produced.  Defendant’s objections are overruled.  The motion is GRANTED.

Nos. 125, 127, 128, 129, 131-135 seek communications between Defendant and any government
agency or entity regarding defects in the same brake system and engine, all Early
Warning Reports submitted to NHTSA and all complaints about the same brake system
and engine, and all TREAD submitted about the same brake system and engine.  Defendant responded that no documents would be
produced.  These requests are relevant to
Defendant’s knowledge and willfulness.  Defendant’s
objections are overruled.  The motion is GRANTED.
RFP
Nos. 139, 142 seek documents reflecting performance standards relating to the same
brake system and engine.  These requests are
limited to the same defects and vehicle alleged by Plaintiffs, and they are relevant
to Defendant’s knowledge and willfulness. 
Defendant’s objections are overruled. 
The motion is GRANTED.
RFP
No. 143 seeks all documents including electronically stored information and electronic
mails, concerning Technical Service Bulletin 19-NA-032.  Defendant agreed to produce a copy of the bulletin.  The request for all documents about the bulletin
is overbroad.  The motion is DENIED.

motion is GRANTED IN PART as set forth above. 
Defendant is ordered to provide verified, supplemental responses within 10
days.
The
requests for sanctions are DENIED.
