Roles:
  - Judge: the author of the tentative ruling
  - Plaintiff: Ultimate Action, LLC
  - Defendant: Patricia Schwartz and Insignia PMG
Significant Statements:
  - "The court may impose terminating sanctions, include an order striking pleadings, and order dismissing an action, or an order rendering judgment by default against a party, for conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process."
  - "It is unclear why these matters are framed so evasively in Defendant's opposition."
  - "The party seeking information may raise in response whatever legitimate and important countervailing interests disclosure serves, while the party seeking protection may identify feasible alternatives that serve the same interests or protective measures that would diminish the loss of privacy."
  - "The court must indulge in a 'careful balancing' of the right of a civil litigant to discover relevant facts, on the one hand, and the right of the third parties to maintain reasonable privacy regarding their sensitive personal affairs, on the other."
  - "The questions here, however, relate to the amounts Insignia's owners invested in the company, their ownership shares obtained thereby, and the manner by which profits were allocated among them. Given the minimal showing here, any privacy interest or intrusion resulting from these questions, whether belonging to Insignia or its owners, is de minimis, and in any event overborne by Plaintiff's interest in obtaining discovery concerning the facts of this case and Insignia's potential alter ego liability."
