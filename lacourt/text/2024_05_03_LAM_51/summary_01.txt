And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff's case is based on a conspiracy between the defendant and Wanda Webster to interfere with and disrupt the business of Excelsior Online Tutoring (EOT), as well as misappropriation of trade secrets. However, the court finds that the defendant has met his initial burden to show that he did not conspire to interfere with and disrupt the business of EOT and he did not tell Webster any confidential information or trade secrets. The court also finds that the plaintiff's evidence is speculative and lacks concrete evidence to support their claims. Therefore, the court grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
