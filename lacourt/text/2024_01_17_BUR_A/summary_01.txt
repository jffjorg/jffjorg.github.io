  - Without inclusion of Eran's adverse claim, the plaintiff is not likely to succeed on the merits.
  - The court finds that the plaintiff's showing falls short of that required to show success in proving title.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, which sought to prevent the defendant from foreclosing on a property. The plaintiff, Ann Shabtay, claims that her son Eran Shabtay has no authority to encumber the property, and that the defendant's attempt to foreclose is invalid. The judge finds that the plaintiff's quiet title claim is missing a crucial element, namely Eran's adverse title claim, and that the plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient evidence to support her claim. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has failed to provide any information reflecting the current title of the property. As a result, the judge concludes that the plaintiff is unlikely to succeed on the merits of her claim, and therefore denies the motion for a preliminary injunction.
