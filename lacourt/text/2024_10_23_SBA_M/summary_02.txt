And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Shean Washington v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc., et al. (Case No. 23TRCV02425). The case involves a "Lemon Law" claim brought by Plaintiff Shean Washington against Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc., et al., regarding a 2017 Honda Odyssey that suffers from widespread defects.

The judge has denied Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents, finding that Defendant's responses were adequate and complied with the applicable statutes. The judge has also denied Plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that Defendant had a reasonable justification for its actions.

However, the judge has granted Plaintiff's motion to compel deposition, in part, ordering the deponent to appear for deposition at a date and time to be agreed upon by the parties. The judge has also denied Plaintiff's request to strike objections and has warned that it will impose sanctions if the parties fail to cooperate in the future.

The judge has ordered Defendant to give notice of this ruling.
