And here is a summary in English text:

The Honorable Gary Y. Tanaka issued a tentative ruling in the case of Shean Washington v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc., et al. The case is a Lemon Law case brought by Plaintiff Shean Washington concerning a 2017 Honda Odyssey. The vehicle suffers from widespread defects, including transmission, engine, electrical, and emission system defects.

The Plaintiff moved to compel further responses to requests for production of documents, set two, and to compel the deposition of a person most knowledgeable and to request sanctions. The Defendant served responses to requests for production of documents indicating inability to comply with certain requests.

The Judge denied the motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents, set two, as the Defendant's responses were fully compliant with CCP § 2031.230. The Judge granted the motion to compel deposition, in part, ordering the deponent to appear for the deposition at a date and time that can be agreed upon by the parties.

The Judge also stated that the issues contemplated in this motion could have easily been resolved by the parties without the need for court intervention and warned that the Court will not hesitate to impose sanctions in the future if such conduct persists.

The Judge denied the Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions as the notice of motion was defective and the Defendant provided facts showing substantial justification for its actions.
