DISCUSSION
 
Defendant
Margo L. Schweichler moves this court for an order compelling Plaintiff Maria
Mokhtari to provided verified responses, without objection, to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Request for
Production and Inspection of Documents, and Request for Admissions. Defendant
further moves this court for an order imposing monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff and/or Plaintiff’s attorney of record in the amount of $860.00 per
motion. 
 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests,
the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300,
2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to
serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.)
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may
also move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2033.280(b).)
 
On March 8, 2024, Defendant propounded to Plaintiff Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories,
Request for Production and Inspection of Documents, and Request for Admissions.
(Weissman Decl., ¶2, Exh. A.) Plaintiff failed to serve any responses to the
discovery requests within the time permitted by law. (Weissman Decl. ¶3.)
Defendant attempted to resolve this matter informally by reaching out to
Plaintiff’s counsel prior to filing the motion. (Weissman Decl. ¶4.) Counsel
for Plaintiff responded they would provide responses within two weeks, which
would have been May 6, 2024. (Weissman Decl. ¶5.) To date, Defendant has not
received any responses from Plaintiff. (Weissman Decl. ¶5.) 
 
As such, Defendants’ unopposed
motion to compel Plaintiffs’ discovery responses to Defendants’ Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, Request for
Production and Inspection of Documents, Set One and Request for Admissions, Set
One is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to produce verified discovery responses
without objection in 20 days.
 
Sanctions
 
Defendants request monetary sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $860.00 per motion or $3,440.00 total.

 
If a propounding party moves for and
obtains a court order compelling a response, the court shall impose monetary
sanctions against the party failing to timely respond to interrogatories and
demands for inspection unless that party acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c),
2033.280(c); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at 404.) 
 
Defense counsel contends they spent approximately
2 hours preparing each motion, anticipate spending another hour reviewing the
opposition and reply per motion, and another hour appearing at the hearing per
motion.  Counsel’s hourly rate of $200.00
(Weissman Decl. ¶6.) Counsel also seeks $60.00 for filing fees per motion. (Weissman
Decl. ¶6.) 
 
Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED, in the reduced
amount of $1,240.00, total. The court finds only one hour necessary for
attending the hearing on the four motions. Moreover, no opposition has been
filed and meeting and conferring with is a professional obligation.
