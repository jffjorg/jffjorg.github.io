Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motions to compel the Plaintiff's discovery responses and impose monetary sanctions. The Plaintiff failed to respond to the Defendant's discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Request for Production and Inspection of Documents, and Request for Admissions. The Defendant requested monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,440.00, but the Judge reduced the amount to $1,240.00, citing the Plaintiff's failure to oppose the motions and the Defendant's counsel's professional obligation to meet and confer. The Judge also orders the Plaintiff to produce verified discovery responses without objection within 20 days.
