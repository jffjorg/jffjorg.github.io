Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Casa Verde's special motion to strike (anti-SLAPP motion) as to all 15 causes of action in Planet 13's complaint. Casa Verde argued that the claims arise from protected activity under CCP 425.16, but the court found that Casa Verde did not meet its burden to show that the claims arise from protected activity.

Specifically, the court found that the allegations of fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, and aiding and abetting do not arise from protected activity. The court also found that the entry into a Stock Repurchase Agreement (SRA) is not protected activity, and that the post-judgment collection activities are not protected speech.

The court granted Casa Verde's request to strike certain articles, court documents, and administrative ruling documents, but denied the request to strike the "truth of the hearsay statements in the documents."

The court's tentative ruling is subject to change after further review and discussion at the hearing scheduled for September 13, 2024.
