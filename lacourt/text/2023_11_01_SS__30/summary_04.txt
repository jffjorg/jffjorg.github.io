The judge also granted the defendant's motions to compel responses to the request for production of documents and special interrogatories, ordering the plaintiff to serve verified responses, without objection, within 20 days. Additionally, the judge awarded sanctions in the amount of $750 against the plaintiff and in favor of the defendant, payable within 30 days. The judge reduced the requested sanctions of $1,000 to $750, citing the lack of opposition from the plaintiff.
