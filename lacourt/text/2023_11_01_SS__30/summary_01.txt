And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion for Terminating Sanctions filed by Defendant Jack Douglas Barnes. The Court grants the motion, dismissing the Complaint with prejudice. The Court finds that Plaintiff Madeeha Rasul has failed to respond to valid discovery requests and has violated the Court's orders. Specifically, Plaintiff failed to appear at scheduled medical examinations and has not responded to attempts to meet and confer about future examinations. The Court notes that Defendant has attempted to resolve the issue without the Court's intervention, but Plaintiff has failed to cooperate. The Court concludes that terminating sanctions are appropriate in this case, as Plaintiff has flagrantly disregarded the Court's orders and Defendant has been prejudiced by Plaintiff's failure to provide medical examinations. The purpose of discovery sanctions is to protect the interests of the party entitled to discovery, not to punish the noncompliant party. The Court finds that the circumstances now permit the use of terminating sanctions, and the Complaint is dismissed with prejudice.
