Case Number: 21STCV09412
Hearing: September 23, 2024
TENTATIVE
RULING
 
The
Parties’ Motion for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement is CONDITIONALLY GRANTED
as the settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable.  Specifically, the Parties’ Motion for Final
Approval of Class Action Settlement is GRANTED CONTINGENT on Counsel submitting
declaration(s) that adequately address the following:
 
·       The Administrator’s
declaration states that “seven hundred forty-five (745) Class Members […] did
not submit timely and valid Requests for Exclusion and are therefore deemed
Settlement Class Members, representing 99.65% of the Class.” (Islas Decl. ¶13.)
There are zero opt outs represented (Id. at ¶8), which would appear to total
100% representation.  Please submit a
supplemental declaration from the Administrator confirming whether this discrepancy
is a typographical error, otherwise explaining further.
 
·      
Class Counsel must submit a declaration
identifying the name of the expert and attaching a cost ledger or invoices if
possible to justify their request for reimbursement for expert fees of $4,860.00.  
 
Only if Plaintiffs’ Counsel adequately addresses the
above will the Parties’ Motion for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement be
UNCONDITIONALLY GRANTED.  If Class
Counsel file the supplemental papers by 12 noon on September 20, 2024, then the
Court will review the supplemental papers prior to the September 23, 2024
hearing, and the Court will rule on the Parties’ Motion for Final Approval of
Class Action Settlement at the September 23, 2024 hearing.  Otherwise, the Court will allow the parties
additional time to submit the supplemental papers and set the matter for a
non-appearance case review in 2-3 weeks.
 

 
The essential terms are:
 
A.         The Gross Settlement Amount (GSA) is $1,575,000,
non-reversionary. (¶3.1.)

The Court hereby sets a
Non-Appearance Case Review for April 1, 2025, 8:30 a.m.,  Department 1.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a wage and hour class action. On
March 10, 2021, Plaintiff commenced this Action by filing a Complaint alleging
causes of actions against Defendants for: (1) failure to pay overtime wages;
(2) failure to pay minimum wages; (3) failure to provide meal periods; (4)
failure to provide rest periods; (5) waiting time penalties; (6) wage statement
violations; and (7) unfair competition. (“Action”). 
 
On June 24, 2021,
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint adding a cause of action for civil
penalties under the Private Attorneys’ General Act (“PAGA").  
 
On October 13, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint alleging new facts and information
against the remaining defendants and adding an additional cause of action for
failure to reimburse necessary business expenses based on information Plaintiff
obtained during her pre-mediation investigation. Along with the Second Amended
Complaint, Plaintiff concurrently filed a request for dismissal of individual
defendant John Jenkins from the Action without prejudice. The Second Amended
Complaint is the operative complaint in the Action (the “Operative Complaint”).
 
On March 2, 2023, the
Parties participated in an all-day mediation presided over by Mark Rudy, Esquire,
where the Parties agreed to globally resolve all class and PAGA claims in the
Action. A fully executed copy of the Amended Class and PAGA Settlement
Agreement (“Settlement Agreement”) is attached as Exhibit 1 to the Declaration
of Vedang J. Patel (“Patel Decl.”) ISO Prelim. 
 
The Court granted
Preliminary Approval on April 26, 2024. Notice was given to the Class Members
as ordered (see Declaration of Lluvia Islas (“Islas Decl.”).) Now before the
Court is the Motion for Final Approval of the proposed class action settlement.

 
SETTLEMENT
CLASS DEFINITION
 
“Class” means all persons employed by Defendants in California and
classified as a nonexempt, hourly-paid employee who worked for Defendants
during the Class Period.    (Settlement
Agreement, ¶1.5.)
·      
“Class Period” means the period from March 10,
2017, through March 31, 2023.  (¶1.12.)
·       “Aggrieved Employee” means a person employed by Defendants in
California and classified as a non-exempt, hourly-paid employee who worked for
Defendants during the PAGA Period. (¶1.4.)
·       “PAGA Period” means the period from February 1, 2020, through the end
of the pay period in which March 31, 2023, falls. (¶1.31.)
The
parties stipulate to class certification for settlement purposes only. (¶12.1.)
 
TERMS
OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
 
The essential terms are as follows:
 
·       The Gross Settlement Amount (GSA) is $1,575,000,
non-reversionary. (¶3.1.)
o   Based on its records, Defendants estimate that, as of
the date of this Settlement Agreement, (1) there are 688 Class Members and
105,000 Total Workweeks during the Class Period and (2) there are 467 Aggrieved
Employees who worked 26,354 Pay Periods during the PAGA Period. (¶8) Defendants
represent that there are approximately 105,000 Workweeks worked during the
Class Period.  In the event the number of
Workweeks worked by Class Members during the Class Period increases by more
than 10%, or 10,500 Workweeks, then the Gross Settlement Amount shall be
increased proportionally by the Workweeks in excess of 115,500 Workweeks
(105,000 Workweeks + 10,500 Workweeks) multiplied by the Workweek Value.  The Workweek Value shall be calculated by
dividing the originally agreed-upon Gross Settlement Amount ($1,575,000.00) by
105,000, which amounts to a Workweek Value of $15.00.  Thus, for example, should there be 120,000
Workweeks in the Class Period, then the Gross Settlement Amount shall be
increased by $67,500.00 ((120,000 Workweeks – 115,500 Workweeks) x $15.00 per
Workweek). (¶8.1)
§  The total workweeks were 113,056 -- under the 10%
threshold.  Thus, the escalator clause
was not triggered. (Islas Decl. ¶11)
 
·       The Net Settlement Amount (Net) ($884,650.00) is the GSA minus the following:
o   Up to $525,000 (33 1/3%) for attorney fees (See
Amended Order Granting Preliminary Approval ¶7); 
o   Up to $40,000 for litigation costs (Ibid.);

o   Up to $7,500 for a Class Representative
Enhancement Payment to the Named Plaintiff (See Amended Order Granting Preliminary
Approval ¶7.); and
o   Up to $14,100 for settlement administration
costs (¶3.2.3.) and
o   Payment of $75,000 (75% of $100,000 PAGA
Payment) to the LWDA. (¶3.2.5.)  
 
·       Defendant will pay their share of taxes in addition to
the GSA. (¶3.1.)
 
·       No claim form is required. (Ibid.)
 
·       Funding of Settlement: Defendants
shall fully fund the Gross Settlement Amount and the amounts necessary to fully
pay Defendants’ share of payroll taxes by transmitting the funds to the
Administrator no later than 15 days after the Effective Date. (¶4.3.) 
 
·      
Individual Settlement Payment Calculation:  An
Individual Class Payment calculated by (a) dividing the Net Settlement Amount
by the total number of Workweeks worked by all Participating Class Members
during the Class Period and (b) multiplying the result by each Participating
Class Member’s Workweeks. (¶3.2.4.)
o   Tax Allocation:
20% wage claims; 80% interest and penalties. (¶3.2.4.1.)
 
·      
PAGA
Payments: The Administrator will
calculate each Individual PAGA Payment by (a) dividing $25,000.00 by the total
number of PAGA Period Pay Periods worked by all Aggrieved Employees during the
PAGA Period and (b) multiplying the result by each Aggrieved Employee’s PAGA
Period Pay Periods.  Aggrieved Employees
assume full responsibility and liability for any taxes owed on their Individual
PAGA Payment. (¶3.2.5.1.)
o  
Tax
Allocation: IRS 1099 Forms. (¶3.2.5.2)  
 
·       Response Deadline:
“Response Deadline” means forty-five (45) days after the Administrator mails
Notice to Class Members and shall be the last date on which Class Members may:
(a) fax, email, or mail Requests for Exclusion from the Settlement or (b) fax,
email, or mail his or her Objection to the Settlement.  Class Members to whom Notice Packets are
resent after having been returned undeliverable to the Administrator shall have
an additional 15 calendar days beyond the date the Response Deadline has
expired. (¶1.40.) The deadline and extension also apply to workweek challenges.
(¶7.6.)
o   If the number of valid Requests for Exclusion
identified in the Exclusion List exceeds 3% of the total of all Class Members,
Defendants may elect to withdraw from the Settlement. (¶9.)
 
·       Uncashed Settlement Checks: The face of each check shall prominently state the
date (not less than 180 days after the date of mailing) when the check will be
voided. (¶4.4.1.) For any Class Member whose Individual Class Payment check or
Individual PAGA Payment check is uncashed and cancelled after the void date,
the Administrator shall transmit the funds represented by such checks to the cy
pres recipient, Legal Aid at Work, for use in Los Angeles County.  The Parties, Class Counsel, and Defense
Counsel represent that they have no interest or relationship, financial or
otherwise, with the intended cy pres recipient. (¶4.4.3.)
o  
Legal Aid at Work, 180 Montgomery Street, Suite
600, San Francisco, California 94104, is a nonprofit legal services organization that assists low-income, working
families.
 
·       The settlement administrator will be Phoenix Class
Action Administration. (¶7.1.)
 

The proposed settlement was
     submitted to the LWDA on November 30, 2023. (Patel Decl. ISO Prelim,
     Exhibit 3 thereto)

 

Notice of
     Final Judgment will be posted on the Settlement Administrator’s website. (¶7.8.1.)

 

Scope of the release: Release of Claims. Effective
     on the date when Defendants fully fund the entire Gross Settlement Amount
     and all employer payroll taxes owed on the Wage Portion of Individual
     Class Payments, Plaintiff, Class Members, and Class Counsel will release
     claims against all Released Parties as follows: (¶5.)

o  
Release by Participating Class Members: For the duration of the
Class Period, all Participating Class Members, on behalf of themselves and
their respective former and present spouses, representatives, agents,
attorneys, heirs, administrators, successors, and assigns, release and
discharge Released Parties from all claims, debts, liabilities, demands,
obligations, guarantees, actions, or causes of action of whatever kind or
nature, whether known or unknown,  that
were alleged in the Operative Complaint or that reasonably could have been
alleged, based on the facts stated in the Operative Complaint and that were
ascertained in the course of the Action, including those arising out of or
related to: (1) all claims for failure to pay overtime wages; (2) all claims
for failure to pay minimum wages; (3) all claims for failure to provide
compliant meal periods or compensation in lieu thereof; (4) all claims for
failure to authorize and permit compliant rest periods or compensation in lieu

reimburse necessary business expenses; and (10) all claims asserted through
California Business & Professions Code section 17200, et seq. arising out

“Released Claims”).  The Released Claims
include all related claims of any kind for premium pay, liquidated damages,
statutory penalties, civil penalties, restitution, interest, injunctive relief,
punitive damages, and other damages, costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees
arising from the alleged violation of any provision of common or statutory law
that were or reasonably could have been raised as part of Plaintiff’s claims in
the Operative Complaint, including but not limited to claims under California
Labor Code sections 96, 98.6, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 210, 226, 226.3, 226.7,
227.3, 232, 232.5, 246 et seq., 404, 432, 510, 512, 558, 1102.5, 1174, 1174.5,
1194, 1194.2, 1197, 1197.1, 1197.5, 1198.5, 2699, 2802, and 2810.5, all provisions
of the California Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders that provide the
same or similar protections, and sections 16600 et seq., 16700 et seq., and
17200 et seq. of the California Business and Professions Code. (¶5.2.)
§ 
Except as set forth in Section 5.4 of this Agreement,
Participating Class Members do not release by virtue of this Agreement any
other claims, including claims for vested benefits, wrongful termination,
violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act, unemployment insurance,
disability, social security, workers’ compensation, or claims based on facts
occurring outside

have no effect on the releases of claims that Class Members and Aggrieved
Employees have agreed to in other executed agreements. (¶5.3)
§ 
Plaintiff and each Participating Class Member acknowledge that the
Released Claims in Paragraph 5.2 immediately above are also intended to include
in their effect the release of all Released Claims whether or not Plaintiff and

Plaintiff and Participating Class Members may hereafter discover facts or legal
arguments in addition to or different from those they now know or currently
believe to be true with respect to the claims and causes of action in this case
which are the subject matter of the Released Claims.  Regardless, the discovery of new facts or
legal arguments shall in no way limit the scope or definition of the Released
Claims and, by virtue of this Agreement, Plaintiff and Participating Class

approved by the Court shall have, fully, finally, and forever settled and
released all of the Released Claims as defined above. (¶5.5)
o   Release by Aggrieved Employees: For the duration of
the PAGA Period, all Aggrieved Employees, on behalf of themselves and their
respective former and present spouses, representatives, agents, attorneys,
heirs, administrators, successors, and assigns, are deemed to release and
discharge the Released Parties from all claims for any and all PAGA remedies
that were alleged in, or reasonably could have been alleged in, or that were
based on, arise from, or relate to the facts stated in the Operative Complaint,
the PAGA Notice, and that were ascertained in the course of the Action,
including any right, claim, or demand for civil penalties pursuant to Labor
Code sections 210, 226.3, 558, 1174.5, 1197.1, and 2699 in connection with
alleged violations of Labor Code sections 96, 98.6, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204,
210, 226, 226.3, 226.7, 227.3, 232, 232.5, 246 et seq., 404, 432, 510, 512,
558, 1102.5, 1174, 1174.5, 1194, 1194.2, 1197, 1197.1, 1197.5, 1198.5, 2699,
2802, and 2810.5 and of California Business and Professions Code sections 16600
et seq., 16700 et seq., and 17200 et seq.

claims even if they, or any of them, request to be excluded from the Settlement
in accordance with Paragraph 7.5, below. (¶5.4.)
o  
“Released Parties” means: Defendants and each of their respective
former, present, and future owners, parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries, and

o   Named Plaintiff will also provide a general release
and CC § 1542 waiver. (¶5.1)
 
ANALYSIS
OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
 
A.    
Does a presumption of fairness
exist? 

The
Court preliminarily found in its Order of April 26, 2024 that the presumption
of fairness should be applied.  No facts
have come to the Court’s attention that would alter that preliminary
conclusion.  Accordingly, the settlement
is entitled to a presumption of fairness as set forth in the preliminary
approval order.
 
B.     Is the settlement fair, adequate, and reasonable?
The
settlement was preliminarily found to be fair, adequate and reasonable.  Notice has now been given to the Class and
the LWDA.  
 
  Reaction of the class members to the
proposed settlement. 
Number of class members: 282
(Islas Decl. ¶3.) 
Number of notice packets
mailed: 745 (Id. at ¶5.) 
Number of undeliverable
notices: 6 (Id. at ¶7.) 
Number of opt-outs: 0 (Id. at ¶8.)
Number of objections: 0 (Id. at ¶9.)
Number of participating
class members: 745 (Id. at ¶13.)
Average individual
payment: $1,216.97 (Ibid.)
Highest individual
payment: $2,542.15 (Ibid.)
Lowest individual payment:
$8.02 (Ibid.)
Number of Aggrieved
Employees: 499 (Id. at ¶14)
Average PAGA payment:
$50.10 (Ibid.) 
Highest PAGA payment:
$83.89 (Ibid.)
Lowest PAGA payment: $1.01
(Ibid.)
 
The Administrator’s declaration states that “seven
hundred forty-five (745) Class Members […] did not submit timely and valid
Requests for Exclusion and are therefore deemed Settlement Class Members,
representing 99.65% of the Class.” (Islas Decl. ¶13.) There are zero opt outs
represented (Id. at ¶8), which would appear to total 100% representation.
 Please submit a supplemental declaration
from the Administrator confirming whether this discrepancy is a typographical
error, otherwise explaining further.
 
The Court finds that the notice was given as
directed and conforms to due process requirements.  Given the reactions of the Class Members and
the LWDA to the proposed settlement and for the reasons set forth in the
Preliminary Approval order, the settlement is found to be fair, adequate, and
reasonable.
 
C.    
Attorney Fees and Costs
            Class
Counsel requests an award of $525,000
(33 1/3%) in fees and $21,760.15 in
costs. (MFA at 22:13-19.) The
Settlement Agreement provides for up to $525,000 (33 1/3%) of the settlement amount in fees and $40,000
in costs (¶3.2.2; See also Amended Order Granting Preliminary Approval ¶7). 
 
“Courts recognize two
methods for calculating attorney fees in civil class actions: the
lodestar/multiplier method and the percentage of recovery method.”  (Wershba
v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224, 254.)  Here, class counsel
request attorney fees using the percentage method, as crosschecked by lodestar.
(MFA at pp. 22-29.) 
 
In common fund cases, the
Court may employ a percentage of the benefit method, as cross-checked against
the lodestar. (Laffitte v. Robert Half
Int’l, Inc. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 503.) The
fee request represents approximately one-third of the gross settlement
amount, which is the average generally awarded in class actions.  (See In
re Consumer Privacy Cases (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 545, 558, fn. 13
[“Empirical studies show that, regardless whether the percentage method or the
lodestar method is used, fee awards in class actions average around one-third
of the recovery.”].) 
 
Class Counsel has provided
information, summarized below, from which the lodestar may be calculated:

(MFA

Counsel’s percentage-based
fee request is higher than the unadjusted lodestar, and would represent
application of a multiplier of approximately 1.36.
 
Here, the $525,000 (33
1/3%) fee request represents a reasonable percentage of the total funds paid by
Defendant. Notice of the fee request was provided to class members in the
Notice, and no one objected. (Islas Decl. ¶9, Exhibit A thereto.)
 

            As for costs, Class Counsel is
requesting a cost amount of $21,760.15. This is less than the $40,000 cap
estimated at preliminary approval, which was disclosed to Class Members and not
objected to. (Islas Decl. ¶9,
Exhibit A thereto.) Costs include,
but are not limited to: Mediation ($12,500), Filing Fees ($2,268.80), Case
Anywhere ($1,668) and Expert
Fees ($4,860). (Bibiyan Decl. ISO Final ¶20.)  Provided that Class Counsel provide adequate supplemental documentation
to justify the expert fees (including the identity of the expert and an invoice
or cost ledger), the costs appear to be reasonable in amount and
reasonably necessary to this litigation. 
 
Based on the above, the Court
hereby awards $525,000 (33 1/3%) in fees and $21,760.15 in costs (contingent on Class Counsel providing adequate supplemental
documentation relating to the expert fees).
 
D.   
Incentive Award
The class representative, Camila
Moya, seeks an enhancement payment of $7,500 for her contributions to
the action. (MFA at 15:20-22.)  
 
In connection with the
final fairness hearing, named Plaintiffs must submit declarations attesting to
why they should be entitled to an enhancement award in the proposed
amount.  The named Plaintiffs must
explain why they “should be compensated for the expense or risk he has incurred
in conferring a benefit on other members of the class.”  (Clark v. American Residential Services LLC
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 785, 806.)  Trial
courts should not sanction enhancement awards of thousands of dollars with
“nothing more than pro forma claims as to ‘countless’ hours expended, ‘potential stigma’ and ‘potential risk.’
Significantly more specificity, in the form of quantification of time and
effort expended on the litigation, and in the form of reasoned explanation of
financial or other risks incurred by the named plaintiffs, is required in order
for the trial court to conclude that an enhancement was ‘necessary to induce
[the named plaintiff] to participate in the suit . . . .’”  (Id.
at 806-807, italics and ellipsis in original.)
 
Plaintiff represents that
her contributions to this litigation include: engaging in communications with
her attorneys, gathering and reviewing documents, remaining available for
mediation, and reviewing the settlement. She estimates spending 23 hours on the
case. (Declaration of Camila Moya ¶¶15-18.) 
 
Based
on the above, as well as the benefits obtained on behalf of the class, the Court
hereby grants the enhancement payment in the amount of $7,500 to
Plaintiff. 
 
E.     Settlement Administration Costs
            The settlement administrator, Phoenix Settlement
Administrators, is requesting $14,100 for the costs of settlement
administration. (Islas Decl. ¶15.) This equals the cost of $14,100 provided for in
the Settlement Agreement (¶3.2.3) and disclosed to class members in the Notice,
to which there were no objections. (Islas Decl. ¶9, Exhibit A thereto.) Based on the above, the Court hereby awards
costs in the requested amount of $14,100.
