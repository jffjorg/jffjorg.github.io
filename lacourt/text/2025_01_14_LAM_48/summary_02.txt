And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff's motion for relief from waiver of objections to discovery. The Plaintiff, David A. Pougatsch, D.P.M., failed to serve responses to discovery propounded by Defendant Som Kohanzadeh, M.D., by the September 12, 2024 deadline. The Plaintiff's counsel suffered an accident and concussion on September 5, 2024, which caused the delay. The Plaintiff's new counsel served responses on October 31, 2024. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's failure to provide responses by the deadline was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and therefore grants the motion.
