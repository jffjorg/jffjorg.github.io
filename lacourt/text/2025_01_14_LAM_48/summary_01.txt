And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's motion to tax costs is granted. As a result, the defendant, Target Corporation, shall not recover its costs in this action. The ruling is based on the fact that the defendant's costs were filed in an ineffective manner, as a cost memorandum is not a valid means of seeking costs in a Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) case. The judge also noted that the defendant's failure to file a motion for discretionary costs, as required by law, has forfeited its claim for costs.
