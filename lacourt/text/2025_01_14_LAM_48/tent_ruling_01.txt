  CASE NO.: 22STCV34888
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
  TO TAX COSTS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
January 14, 2025



 
On
October 14, 2024, the Court entered judgment in favor of Defendant
Target Corporation and against Plaintiff Daniel Husband.
On
October 28, 2024, Defendant filed a memorandum of costs.
On
November 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to tax costs.
A
prevailing defendant in a FEHA action may be awarded fees and costs only when the
court finds the action was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless when brought,
or the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.  (Gov. Code, § 12965, subd. (c)(6).)  This prohibition on recovery also applies to fees
and costs that would otherwise be recoverable under Code of Civil Procedure section
998.  (Gov. Code, § 12965, subd. (c)(6).)  “By making a cost award discretionary rather than
mandatory, Government Code section 12965(b) [now section 12965, subdivision (c)(6)]
expressly excepts FEHA actions from Code of Civil Procedure section 1032(b)’s mandate
for a cost award to the prevailing party.” 
(Williams v. Chino Valley Independent Fire Dist. (2015) 61 Cal.4th
97, 105.)
A
cost memorandum is a request for the clerk to award the costs a prevailing party
would be entitled to as a matter of right under Code of Civil Procedure section
1032.  (Neeble-Diamond v. Hotel California
By the Sea, LLC (2024) 99 Cal.App.5th 551, 557.)  “The clerk has no authority to exercise discretion
in awarding costs, let alone to make the frivolousness finding required by section
12965,” so a cost memorandum is an ineffective means of seeking costs in a FEHA
case.  (Ibid.)  If a prevailing FEHA defendant fails to file a
motion for discretionary costs, it forfeits its claim for costs, even if the plaintiff
does not respond to the ineffective cost memorandum.  (Id. at p. 558.)
The
motion to tax costs is GRANTED.  Defendant
shall not recover its costs in this action.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
