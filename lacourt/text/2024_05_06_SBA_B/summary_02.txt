English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to amend the cross-complaint to combine the two currently-filed cross-complaints into one. The judge finds that the defendant has complied with the relevant rules and that there is no prejudice to the plaintiff. The judge orders the defendant to file the amended cross-complaint within five days and orders defense counsel to clarify which counsel is representing the defendant. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's refusal to stipulate to the filing of the amended cross-complaint in January 2024 has resulted in the delay in resolving the issue.
