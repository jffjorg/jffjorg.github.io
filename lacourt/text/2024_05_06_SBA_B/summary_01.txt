And here is the English text summarizing the judicial tentative ruling:

The court has considered the motion to set aside the default and default judgment. The defendant, Jocelyn Young, requests that the court set aside the default and default judgment, pursuant to CCP § 473.5 and 473(d), and under extrinsic fraud and/or mistake. The defendant argues that she was not properly served with the summons and complaint, and that she was unaware of the lawsuit. However, the court finds that the defendant was served with the summons and complaint and that she had actual knowledge of the lawsuit. The court further finds that the motion is untimely filed as it was not filed within a reasonable time. The court rejects the defendant's factual assertions of lack of knowledge of the suit long ago as not credible. Therefore, the motion is denied.
