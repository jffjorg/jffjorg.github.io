SUMMARY OF
ACTION AND ANALYSIS
On July 11,
2024, this Court sustained the demurrers of Defendants Sutton National
Insurance Company (Sutton) and 818 Restoration and Construction, LLC (818
Restoration) to Plaintiff Chinyere Valerie Ibe’s (Plaintiff) Fourth, Fifth, and
Seventh Causes of Action with leave to amend and to her Sixth Cause of Action
without leave to amend. Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint (SAC) was due on
August 12. Instead of filing her SAC, on that date she filed her first request
for an extension of time to file the SAC, with a hearing set for November 8.
 
On August 19,
2024, this Court sustained the demurrer of Bamboo IDE8 Insurance Services, LLC
(Bamboo IDE8). The Court gave Plaintiff leave to amend her First Second, Third,
Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Causes of Action. Plaintiff’s SAC was then due on
Monday, September 18, 2024. On Friday, September 16, 2024, the Plaintiff filed her
second request for an extension of time to file the SAC, with a hearing date of
December 4.
 
On October 1,
2024, the Court granted the ex parte applications of 818 Restoration and Bamboo
IDE8 dismissing them from the case because plaintiff had not filed her
SAC.  On October 3, 2024, the court
granted the ex parte application of Sutton Insurance, dismissing it on the same
basis.
 
The court deems
moot the first motion set for hearing today. 
Plaintiff’s SAC was due on August 12, 2024, but she instead filed this
motion for more time to do so.  As a
result, Sutton and 818 Restoration have been dismissed from the action.  The court also notes that plaintiff has
failed to appear for any of the previously mentioned hearings.  Although a separate motion for leave is on
calendar for December 4, 2024, should plaintiff and counsel for Bamboo IDEA8
appear at today’s hearing, the court will inquire as to whether that hearing is
still necessary.
