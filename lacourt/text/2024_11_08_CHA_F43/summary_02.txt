And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has deemed the plaintiff's motion for extension of time to file a Second Amended Complaint moot. The plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint was due on August 12, 2024, but she instead filed a motion for an extension of time, which was granted. However, the plaintiff did not file the Second Amended Complaint by the new deadline, and as a result, the defendants Sutton National Insurance Company and 818 Restoration and Construction, LLC were dismissed from the action. The judge notes that the plaintiff has failed to appear at any of the previous hearings and that a separate motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint is still pending.
