And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by Defendant Janessa Rodriguez is overruled. The demurrer was filed on behalf of both Defendant Rodriguez and Defendant FB Insure Select, LLC, but the notice page indicates the wrong date and time, and refers to two different departments in the Spring Street Courthouse, violating the statutory requirements and due process. Additionally, Defendant Rodriguez cannot represent Defendant FB Insure, which is a corporation that must be represented by an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California. The demurrer does not indicate what facts are missing from the Complaint, and the memorandum in support of the demurrer does not address the allegations made in the Complaint. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled, and Defendant Rodriguez is to file and serve an answer to the Complaint within 20 days.
