Discussion
 
Petitioner moves to have the mechanic’s lien recorded

relevant moving statute to release the lien. Under Civil Code section 8484 the
petition for release order be verified by the petitioner and allege the
following:
 
(a) The date of recordation of the
claim of lien. A certified copy of the claim of lien shall be attached to the
petition.
(b) The county in which the claim of
lien is recorded.
(c) The book and page or series number
of the place in the official records where the claim of lien is recorded.
(d) The legal description of the
property subject to the claim of lien.
(e) Whether an extension of credit has
been granted under Section 8460, if so to what date, and that the time for
commencement of an action to enforce the lien has expired.
(f) That the owner has given the
claimant notice under Section 8482 demanding that the claimant execute and
record a release of the lien and that the claimant is unable or unwilling to do
so or cannot with reasonable diligence be found.
(g) Whether an action to enforce the
lien is pending.
(h) Whether the owner of the property
or interest in the property has filed for relief in bankruptcy or there is
another restraint that prevents the claimant from commencing an action to
enforce the lien.
 
(Civil Code, § 8484.) The Petition contains all the required
information, is verified, and attaches a certified copy of the lien.
Additionally, service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing complies with Civil
Code section 8486, subdivision (b), which requires service to “be made in the
same manner as service of summons, or by certified or registered mail, postage
prepaid, return receipt requested . . . .” (Civ. Code, § 8486, subd. (b).) The
papers were served by certified mail with return receipt requested. (Proof of
Service, filed 06/25/24.) 
 
The Petition also seeks attorney’s fees and costs in
connection with the instant proceeding under Civil Code section 8488,
subdivision (c) but does not indicate the amount sought or provide evidence
supporting the request. For the sake of judicial efficiency, the hearing is
continued to allow Petitioner to file and serve a supplemental declaration
regarding the amount and propriety of the attorney’s fees and costs sought.
