v. FB Insure Select, LLC, et al.
DEMURRER(CCP § 430.10, et seq.)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Janessa Rodriguez’s
Demurrer to the Complaint is OVERRULED. DEFENDANT RODRIGUEZ IS TO FILE AND
SERVE AN ANSWER TO THE COMPLAINT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 

On February 8, 2023, Plaintiffs Ken
Koury (“Plaintiff”), in propria persona, filed the Complaint in this action
against Defendants FB Insure Select, LLC (“Defendant FB Insure”) and Janessa
Rodriguez (“Defendant Rodriguez”). Defendant Rodriguez filed the instant
Demurrer to the Complaint on behalf of both Defendants on March 15, 2023. The
notice page indicates the Demurrer will be heard on August 7, 2024 at 8:30 am
in Defendant 25 and 26 in the Spring Street Courthouse. (Demurrer, p. 1.) The
Demurrer, however, was reserved for July 18, 2024 at 10:30 am in Department 26
in the Spring Street Courthouse. 
 
On March 29, 2023, the Court
entered default against Defendant FB Insure. On July 10, 2023, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set
One. (Minute Order, 07/10/23.)
 
No opposition to the Demurrer has
been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The Demurrer is accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41. However, notice of the Demurrer is improper in that it sets forth the
wrong date and time, and refers to two different departments in the Spring
Street Courthouse. Failure to give notice of a motion is not only a violation
of the statutory requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones
v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) 
 
The Court additionally notes that
Defendant Rodriguez cannot represent Defendant FB Insure; a corporation must be
represented by an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California.
It is black letter law that corporation cannot represent itself in court. (Clean
Air Transport Systems v. San Mateo County Transit Dist. (1988) 198
Cal.App.3d 576, 578 (citing Merco Constr. Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal Court
(1978) 21 Cal.3d 724, 729-730).) This rule applies to all entities regarded as
separate from their owners, including partnerships and unincorporated
associations. (See Clean Air Transport Systems, supra, 19 Cal.App.3d at
578.) The Court will only consider the Demurrer on behalf of Defendant
Rodriguez.
 
The Demurrer is brought for
failure to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action. (Citing Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) However, the Demurrer does not indicate what
facts are missing from the Complaint. Instead, it repeatedly states that the
Complaint sets forth certain facts. (Demurrer, pp. 1:25-3:13.) The memorandum
in support of the Demurrer also does not address what facts are missing from
the causes of action for (1) violation of Title 47 United States Code, section 227 and 47
C.F.R. § 64.1200; and (2) violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act. It
appears to be premised on Defendants’ version of the facts regarding the
parties’ dispute. This is not a proper basis for a demurrer. A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that
appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30; Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)
Based on the foregoing, the Demurrer to the Complaint is overruled. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Janessa Rodriguez’s
Demurrer to the Complaint is OVERRULED. DEFENDANT RODRIGUEZ IS TO FILE AND
SERVE AN ANSWER TO THE COMPLAINT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
