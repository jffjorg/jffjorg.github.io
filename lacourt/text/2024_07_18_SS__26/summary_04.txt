And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on HMA Development, Inc.'s Petition to Release Property from Mechanic's Lien to October 17, 2024 at 10:00 AM in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The Petitioner had filed the petition on June 13, 2024, but failed to provide the relevant moving statute to release the lien. However, the Petition does contain all the required information, is verified, and attaches a certified copy of the lien. The Petitioner is also seeking attorney's fees and costs, but did not provide evidence or specify the amount sought. To allow for judicial efficiency, the Judge has ordered the Petitioner to file and serve a supplemental declaration regarding the amount and propriety of the attorney's fees and costs by September 19, 2024.
