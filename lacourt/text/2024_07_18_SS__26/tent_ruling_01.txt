On July 25, 2022, Plaintiff Elias
Zepeda (“Judgment Creditor”) filed the Complaint in this action against Defendants
Bungalow 40, LLC, Houman Arasteh, and Santa Monica Hudson Associates Limited
Partnership (“Judgment Debtor SMHALP”). Default judgment was entered against
Judgment Debtor SMHALP on October 10, 2022 in the amount of $4,000.00
principal, $800.00 attorney’s fees, and $427.90 costs. (Default Judgment,
10/10/22, ¶6.) 
 
On April 18, 2023, Judgment
Creditor filed a Memorandum of Costs After Judgment, Acknowledgment of Credit,
and Declaration of Accrued Interest in the total amount of  $1,184.40. (Memo of Costs, filed
04/18/23, ¶1.) Of these costs, $1,000.00 were for post-judgment attorney’s
fees. (Ibid.) Judgment Creditor filed a second post-judgment Memorandum
of Costs on September 28, 2023, seeking an additional $1,000.00 in attorney’s
fees and $14.20 for e-filing. (Memo of Costs, filed 09/28/23, ¶1.) On October
16, 2023, Judgment Creditor filed a writ of execution. 
 
Judgment Debtor SMHALP filed the instant Motion For Order
Requiring Acknowledgement Of Satisfaction Of Judgment And For Attorney Fees on
May 22, 2024. Judgment Creditor filed an opposition on June 12, 2024 and
Judgment Debtor SMHALP replied on July 15, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Judgment Debtor SMHALP moves pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 724.050, which states in relevant part:
 
(a) If a money judgment has been
satisfied, the judgment debtor, the owner of real or personal property subject
to a judgment lien created under the judgment, or a person having a security
interest in or a lien on personal property subject to a judgment lien created
under the judgment may serve personally or by mail on the judgment creditor a
demand in writing that the judgment creditor do one or both of the following:
 
(1) File an acknowledgment of
satisfaction of judgment with the court.
(2) Execute, acknowledge, and deliver
an acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment to the person who made the
demand.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 724.050, subd. (a).) “If the judgment
has been satisfied, the judgment creditor shall comply with the demand not
later than 15 days after actual receipt of the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
724.050, subd. (c).) If the judgment creditor does not comply, the judgment
debtor may move for an order from the Court, as follows: “If the court
determines that the judgment has been satisfied and that the judgment creditor
has not complied with the demand, the court shall either (1) order the judgment
creditor to comply with the demand or (2) order the court clerk to enter
satisfaction of the judgment.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 724.050, subd. (d).) 
 
Although Judgment Debtor SMHALP argues that even a partial
satisfaction of judgment obligated Judgment Creditor to deposit the checks and
allow the Court to order Judgment Creditor to file an acknowledgement of
satisfaction of judgment, there is a separate statute concerning acknowledgment
of partial satisfaction of judgment. Specifically, Code of Civil Procedure
section 724.110 has its own requirements concerning partial satisfaction.
Therefore, Judgment Debtor SMHALP must demonstrate full satisfaction of the
judgment for the relief sought under Code of Civil Procedure section 724.050.
 
The principal amount of the judgment entered on October 10,
2022 was $4,000.00, plus $800.00 in attorney’s fees and $427.90 in costs, for a
total of $5,227.90. (Default Judgment, ¶6.) The judgment also indicates that
waived fees of $229.50 must be paid directly to the Court. (Id. at ¶7.) The
Court’s record shows that the $229.50 fee was paid on December 18, 2023, as
declared by counsel for Judgment Debtor SMHALP. (Motion, Browne Decl., ¶7 and
Exh. D.) When accounting for the judgment and the memoranda of costs, filed on
April 18, 2023, an additional $1,000.00 was added for attorney’s fees, $184.20
in costs, and $272.14 interest. (Memo of Costs, 04/18/23.) The letter sent by
Judgment Creditor’s counsel to Judgment Debtor SMHALP on September 20, 2023,
however, included more than these additional fees and costs. The letter
included an additional $1,000.00 in attorney’s fees, which had not been claimed
in a memorandum of costs. (Motion, Browne Decl., Exh. A.) The total owed as of
the September 20, 2023 communication from Judgment Creditor’s attorney to
Judgment SMHALP, which included daily accruing interest, was $4,000.00
principal, $1,800.00 attorney’s fees, $612.10 costs, and $494.14 interest, for
a total of $6,790.18.  
 
Judgment Debtor SMHALP sent Judgment Creditor a cashier’s
check in the amount of $5,956.74, which Judgment Creditor acknowledges
receiving. (Motion, Browne Decl., ¶4; Opp., Mehrban Decl., ¶2.) Instead of
crediting the money against the judgment, Judgment Creditor’s attorney sent the
check back because it was not for the full amount of the judgment. (Opp.,
Mehrban Decl., ¶3.) To the extent that amount did not include the amounts
claimed in the April 18, 2023 memorandum of costs and daily accruing interest,
it was not full payment of the judgment. Nor has Judgment Debtor SMHALP shown
that the remaining payment of $1,737.37 made on December 20, 2023 paid off the
amount remaining after application of the initial payment to the judgment. As
an example, Judgment Debtor SMHALP contends that interest is not calculated on
attorney’s fees and costs, which is incorrect. (See Felczer v. Apple Inc.
(2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 406, 415.) Therefore, the Motion for Requiring
Acknowledgement Of Satisfaction Of Judgment And For Attorney Fees is denied. 
 
Judgment Creditor seeks an award of attorney’s fees on this
Motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 724.080 as the prevailing
party. Judgment Creditor seeks $3,050.00 in fees based on 6.1 hours of time
billed at $500.00 per hour. The Court finds this amount excessive for a
three-page opposition memorandum. Attorney’s fees are awarded in the amount of
$1,500.00.
 
Conclusion
 
Judgment Debtor Santa Monica Associates Hudson, Ltd.’s
Motion For Order Requiring Acknowledgement Of Satisfaction Of Judgment And For
Attorney Fees is DENIED. JUDGMENT DEBTOR SANTA MONICA
ASSOCIATES HUDSON, LTD. IS TO PAY JUDGMENT CREDITOR ATTORNEY’S FEES OF
$1,500.00.
