And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the defendants' motion to vacate the entry of default and default judgment. The defendants claim that they had settled the action with the plaintiff, but the plaintiff did not give them advance warning of the request for default. The defendants argue that this constitutes a mistake, and they are entitled to relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). The judge agrees, finding that the defendants' motion was timely filed and supported by a declaration of fault. The judge also notes that the plaintiff failed to inform defense counsel that it intended to take the defendants' default, which is a violation of ethical obligations. Therefore, the judge is granting the motion and vacating the default and default judgment.
