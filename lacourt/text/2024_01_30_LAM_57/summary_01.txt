And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for preference in the setting of the trial without prejudice. The plaintiff, who is over 70 years of age, had requested a preference in the trial setting under Code of Civil Procedure Section 36(a). However, the motion and supporting declaration did not satisfy the requirement for trial preference in Section 36(a)(2, that the health of the party seeking the preference "is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing the party's interest in the litigation." Despite this, the judge has set the trial date for December 9, 2024, as the case has been pending for nearly 4 and 1/2 years and the judge wants to bring it to a conclusion within this calendar year.
