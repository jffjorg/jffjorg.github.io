And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer hearing. The Roupinian defendants' demurrer to the first, second, and sixth causes of action is sustained with leave to amend, as the relief being sought in those causes of action is the same as the relief being sought in the pending appeal from an order denying the plaintiff's motion to vacate a default judgment. The demurrer to the third, fourth, and fifth causes of action is also sustained with leave to amend, as the complaint fails to adequately allege scienter and agency. Additionally, the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for declaratory relief against Cal Western is sustained with leave to amend, as the complaint fails to adequately allege the basis for that cause of action.
