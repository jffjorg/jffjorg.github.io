And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiffs' motion for attorney's fees and costs. The court has no issue with the billing rates of the plaintiffs' attorneys, which are in line with prevailing rates for lawyers working on Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act cases in the Los Angeles County market. However, the court is reducing the plaintiffs' request for fees in certain instances. Specifically, the court is reducing the fees for time spent on a reply brief in support of a discovery motion, reviewing deposition subpoenas and notices of depositions, and drafting a motion for relief from a Code of Civil Procedure Section 998 offer. The court is also reducing the fees for the services of expert witness Anthony Micale by $3,000, as the amount of time he spent on the case seems excessive. Additionally, the court is denying the plaintiffs' request for an upward multiplier to enhance the fees. The court will add up the reductions and deduct that amount from the plaintiffs' request to arrive at a final figure for the award of fees and costs.
