 Case Number:  23STCV02597    Hearing Date:   January 30, 2024    Dept:  57 The Court is continuing Plaintiff's discovery motion that is on calendar today to February 5, 2024 at 8:30 to meet Plaintiff's discovery motion that is on calendar that day.   The Plaintiff's discovery motion that is on calendar for February 1, 2024 is being advanced to today and continued to February 5, 2024 as well.  In the Court's view, it is more efficient to hear all of the Plaintiff's discovery motions on the same day.   The Court cautions Plaintiff that the motion on calendar today, dealing with form and special interrogatories that Plaintiff propounded, is really two motions in one.  In the future, Plaintiff must file separate motions covering form and special interrogatories and pay separate filing fees.
