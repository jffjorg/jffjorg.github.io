 Case Number:  22STCV10133    Hearing Date:   April 9, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Motion of Assignee of Record Olympic West Financial Corp. for Assignment Order.
 
Plaintiff NEUFELD MARKS (Plaintiff) obtained a
Judgment against GLENDALE HOLDINGS LLC (Judgment Debtor) in the sum of $88,416.83.
Plaintiff later assigned the Judgment to assignee of record, Olympic West
Financial Corp. (Assignee)
Presently, Assignee brings a motion requesting an order
instructing Judgment Debtor and/or its successors to assign its interest in
rents and all rights to payment concerning rental property at 429 North Brand
Boulevard, to the extent necessary to pay off the Judgment. According to
Assignee, it owns the Judgment against Judgment Debtor, having a balance due of
approximately $90,572.86, which includes interest and costs but not the amount
paid.
Courts have authority to order judgment debtors to
assign rights to payments due. Cal. Prac. Guide Enf. J. & Debt.,  § 6:1422.6 (citing, e.g., Code Civ. Proc., §
708.510).
Here, the motion sufficiently shows the Judgment
Debtor’s balance owed on the Judgment. Therefore, the Court grants the unopposed
motion, as prayed. The Court will sign the proposed order submitted with the motion.
