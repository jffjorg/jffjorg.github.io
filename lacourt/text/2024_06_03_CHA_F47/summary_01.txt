The motion to compel discovery and impose sanctions is granted. The plaintiff has failed to respond to discovery requests, and the defendant is entitled to an order compelling the plaintiff to provide responses without objections. Additionally, sanctions in the amount of $460.00 are warranted against the plaintiff and his attorney, Bryan Castorina, for their failure to comply with discovery obligations. The plaintiff's responses to the discovery requests are due within 20 days of the hearing, and the sanctions must be paid within 30 days.
