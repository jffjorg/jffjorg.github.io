And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendants Eric Chen and Ying Xu to the Complaint filed by Plaintiffs George Rappard, M.D., and Los Angeles Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, LLC. The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants failed to pay medical liens for treatment provided to Defendant Yuan Luo after an accident. The judge has ruled that the Plaintiffs have stated causes of action for breach of contract, book account, account stated, accounting, interference with prospective economic relations, and conversion. The judge has also ordered the Defendants to file an answer to the Complaint within 21 days. The judge rejected the Defendants' argument that they only had a duty to withhold settlement funds and not actually pay the liens, finding that the Lien Assignments required the Defendants to pay the liens. The judge also found that the Plaintiffs have alleged intentional acts by the Defendants designed to disrupt the relationship between the Plaintiffs and Luo, and that the Plaintiffs have a cause of action for intentional interference with prospective economic relations.
