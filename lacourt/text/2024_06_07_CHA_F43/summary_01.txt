And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge sustains the demurrer filed by the defendants, David Simon and Virachai Pummarachai, to the plaintiff's second amended complaint. The plaintiff, Castaic Truck Stop, Inc., dba Village Fuel Stop, filed a complaint alleging breach of contract and negligence against the defendants. The judge rules that the plaintiff's cause of action for negligence does not allege a separate and independent duty unrelated to the duties raised by the contract. The plaintiff has not shown that it could amend the complaint to show a separate duty for Pummarachai, therefore, the Court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.
