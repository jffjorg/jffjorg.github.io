And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to enforce the stipulated judgment. The plaintiff, Xingxing Zhuo, has sought to enforce a settlement agreement made with the defendants, Ashley Christine Booker and Christopher Devon Booker, which requires the defendants to vacate the premises by March 31, 2024, and pay $18,000. The defendants failed to comply with the agreement, and the plaintiff filed a motion to enforce the settlement. The judge finds that the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement agreement, and that the plaintiff is entitled to enforce the agreement. The judge grants the plaintiff's motion and enters judgment against the defendants, awarding possession of the property to the plaintiff and ordering the plaintiff to submit a proposed writ of possession.
