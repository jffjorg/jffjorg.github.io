SUMMARY OF
ACTION
This case
involves an unlawful detainer. Plaintiff Xingxing Zhuo (Plaintiff) has filed a
motion to enforce stipulated judgment pursuant to CCP § 664.6. Plaintiff filed
this motion because Defendants Ashley Christine Booker and Christopher Devon
Booker (Defendants) have not complied with the terms of a written settlement agreement
made between the parties on March 12, 2024.
 
Pursuant to the
terms of the parties’ agreement, Defendants were to vacate the premises by
March 31, 2024, and pay a total sum of $18,000. By March 31, Defendants were
still in occupancy of the premises and had failed to pay the $18,000. On April
4, 2024, Plaintiff sought immediate enforcement of the settlement terms, and
the Court entered judgment on that day.
 
On April 12,
2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to enforce stipulated judgment and a proposed
written judgment. The judgment was granted and entered on April 12. Plaintiff
now seeks to enforce that judgment. No opposition has been filed.
 
ANALYSIS
CCP § 664.6
provides that “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed
by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the court,
for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties,
the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement
until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”
 
When
considering a CCP § 664.6 motion, “the trial court must determine whether the
parties entered into a valid and binding settlement of all or part of the case.
In making this determination, trial judges, in the sound exercise of their
discretion, may receive oral testimony or may determine the motion upon
declarations alone.” (Corkland v. Boscoe (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 989, 994;
Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 565.)
 
Plaintiff has
made this motion pursuant to CCP § 664.6. The parties stipulated to the settlement
of this case. The Court, by virtue of Plaintiff filing this motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement.
 
Plaintiff
provided a declaration indicating that Defendant failed to comply with the
terms of the settlement agreement. Therefore, it is appropriate for the Court
to enforce the settlement and enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement. 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion to enforce the stipulated judgment is granted. Judgement is entered
against Defendants. Possession of the property is awarded to Plaintiff.
Plaintiff is ordered to submit a proposed writ of possession.
