```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer to the third cause of action for open book account is waived due to improper notice. The defendant's notice of demurrer did not adequately specify the grounds for the demurrer, including the cause of action being challenged, which precluded the plaintiff from addressing the issue on the merits. The court finds that the defendant waived the demurrer to the third cause of action for open book account.

The court also sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action for account stated with leave to amend. The plaintiff's complaint alleges that an account was stated in writing between the parties, but fails to allege facts as to how it arrived at the balance of $427,014.00 being due based on the monthly fixed charge the defendant agreed to pay. The court finds that the plaintiff must show that the defendant agreed to pay a monthly fixed charge and also that a balance was then struck and agreed to be the correct sum owing from the debtor to the creditor. The plaintiff is granted 20 days leave to amend the second cause of action. The court sets an Order to Show Cause (OSC) re Second Amended Complaint for January 8, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
