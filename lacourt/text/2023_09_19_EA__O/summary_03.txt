And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment against the defendant, GV Yummy Inc. The application is denied without prejudice for two reasons. Firstly, the service of summons and complaint on the defendant was improper. The plaintiff served an employee of the defendant, Heidi Gao, but service on an employee does not effectuate service of summons and complaint. According to California Code of Civil Procedure section 416.10, service on a corporation must be made on an agent for service of process or one of the designated officers or managers of the corporation.

Secondly, the plaintiff has not filed adequate evidence to support default judgment. The plaintiff has not filed a request for court judgment, which requires a brief summary of the case, declarations or other admissible evidence, interest computations, and a proposed form of judgment. The plaintiff has only filed an authenticated lease and eviction notice, which is insufficient to support default judgment.

Therefore, the application for default judgment is denied without prejudice. The plaintiff may refile the application with proper service and evidence to support default judgment.

The primary reason for denial is that Plaintiff failed to properly serve Defendant. Service was attempted on an employee, Heidi Gao, rather than one of the designated individuals listed in California law.  

Additionally, the judge found that Plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to support the requested judgment, particularly regarding damages and attorney fees.

The application is denied without prejudice, meaning Plaintiff can refile with corrected service and complete evidence.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice for two reasons. First, the service of the summons and complaint on the defendant corporation was improper. According to the California Code of Civil Procedure section 416.10, service on a corporation must be made on a designated person, such as an agent for service of process, an officer, or a person authorized by the corporation to receive service. However, the plaintiff served an employee of the corporation, which does not comply with the statute. Second, the plaintiff has not filed all necessary material for a Request for Court Judgment, including evidence of damages and a computation of attorney fees. The plaintiff's Declaration for Default Judgment by Court was inadequate and did not comply with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 585. Therefore, the application for default judgment is denied without prejudice.
