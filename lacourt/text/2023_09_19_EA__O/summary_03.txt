And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment against the defendant, GV Yummy Inc. The application is denied without prejudice for two reasons. Firstly, the service of summons and complaint on the defendant was improper. The plaintiff served an employee of the defendant, Heidi Gao, but service on an employee does not effectuate service of summons and complaint. According to California Code of Civil Procedure section 416.10, service on a corporation must be made on an agent for service of process or one of the designated officers or managers of the corporation.

Secondly, the plaintiff has not filed adequate evidence to support default judgment. The plaintiff has not filed a request for court judgment, which requires a brief summary of the case, declarations or other admissible evidence, interest computations, and a proposed form of judgment. The plaintiff has only filed an authenticated lease and eviction notice, which is insufficient to support default judgment.

Therefore, the application for default judgment is denied without prejudice. The plaintiff may refile the application with proper service and evidence to support default judgment.
