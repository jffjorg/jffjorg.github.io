And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling discusses the Defendant's motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of the Plaintiff's case. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant did not pay two loans, one for $94,788 and one for $29,000, and that the Defendant's demurrer was sustained with leave to amend. The Plaintiff failed to file an amended complaint, and the case was dismissed. The Plaintiff now seeks reconsideration of the dismissal, arguing that the court failed to provide notice of the hearing dates regarding the status of his amended complaint and OSC to dismiss his case.

The court notes that the motion is untimely and that the Plaintiff's declaration does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. However, the court finds that the Plaintiff's explanation for not attending the hearing is corroborated by the lack of notice of hearing dates.

The court also notes that while it has the authority to correct an earlier erroneous ruling, the Plaintiff's failure to file an amended complaint is grounds for dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2). The court sustains the demurrer and dismisses the case, and is not inclined to grant the Plaintiff's relief. The motion is thus TBD at the hearing.
