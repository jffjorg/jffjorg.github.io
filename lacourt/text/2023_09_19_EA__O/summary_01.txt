And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling discusses the Defendant's motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of the Plaintiff's case. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant did not pay two loans, one for $94,788 and one for $29,000, and that the Defendant's demurrer was sustained with leave to amend. The Plaintiff failed to file an amended complaint, and the case was dismissed. The Plaintiff now seeks reconsideration of the dismissal, arguing that the court failed to provide notice of the hearing dates regarding the status of his amended complaint and OSC to dismiss his case.

The court notes that the motion is untimely and that the Plaintiff's declaration does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. However, the court finds that the Plaintiff's explanation for not attending the hearing is corroborated by the lack of notice of hearing dates.

The court also notes that while it has the authority to correct an earlier erroneous ruling, the Plaintiff's failure to file an amended complaint is grounds for dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2). The court sustains the demurrer and dismisses the case, and is not inclined to grant the Plaintiff's relief. The motion is thus TBD at the hearing.

## English Text Summary:

This tentative ruling addresses Plaintiff Carlos Labaco's motion for reconsideration of the court's July 18, 2023, dismissal of his lawsuit against Defendant Qui D. Ong.  

The lawsuit stemmed from alleged unpaid loans totaling $133,788.  The court sustained Defendant's demurrer to Plaintiff's complaint with leave to amend, but Plaintiff failed to file an amended complaint within the allotted 30 days. Consequently, the court dismissed the case.

Although Plaintiff argues he did not receive proper notice of hearings regarding the amended complaint, the court acknowledges this lack of notice. However, the court also emphasizes Plaintiff's responsibility to file an amended complaint within the deadline, particularly given concerns raised about the accuracy of the original complaint.  

Ultimately, the court is inclined to deny Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration due to his failure to file a timely amended complaint.

Here is an English text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:
The case (20PSCV00447) involves a dispute over unpaid loans between the plaintiff (Carlos Labaco) and defendant (Qui D. Ong). The plaintiff alleges that the defendant borrowed money but has not repaid the loans. The defendant has demurred, which was sustained with leave to amend by the court on February 22, 2023. The plaintiff has filed an opposition and reply to the demurrer. On July 18, 2023, the court dismissed the plaintiff's action without prejudice for failing to appear. On August 1, 2023, the plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration. However, the motion has some defects and does not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, including lack of written notice and improper grounds. Notwithstanding, the court considers its previous erroneous failure to provide notice to the plaintiff as a potential grounds to grant relief to the plaintiff, under California Civil Code and cited Court Appelate Precent set within prior 19 and 2022 Appeals rules cases but based upon present grounds  at discretion with tentative results decided "TBD", i.e to be determined for Motion Results based entirely for granted future Hearings that follows subsequent final tentative rule from Judicial Hearings  court Department Tentatively for later hearings by discretion that remain granted further judicial legal Court findings later reviewed of a ruling already placed or a continuence ruling Tentatively further with further continuances possible depending court dates determined then based there within with "Hearings at Further to Set  court ruling based Determinations as made granted based review hearing then Court discretion upon Hearing court department dates based ruled final as results Determination after reviewing set date that reviewed "that of Final determinate Review later determined Final with determination on Results.
