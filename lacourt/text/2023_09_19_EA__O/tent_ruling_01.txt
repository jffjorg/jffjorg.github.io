  Case Number:  20PSCV00447    Hearing Date:   September 19, 2023    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF DISMISSAL is TBD.
 
Background
 
This case arises from alleged unpaid
loans. Plaintiff alleges that he gave Defendant two loans: 
one in November 2018 for $94,788 and
another loan in February 2019 for $29,000. To date, 
Defendant has not paid the payments,
including the promised profits, for a total of $133,788. 
 
On July 10, 2020, Plaintiff filed
suit.[1]

 
On July 15, 2021, Plaintiff filed his
Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) for Breach of Contract 
and Fraud. 
 
On January 24, 2023, Defendant filed a
demurrer, which on February 22, 2023, the court
sustained with 30 days leave to amend.
 
On April 28, 2023, the court issued a
Notice Re: Continuance of Hearing and Order about the 
Status Conference Re: Amended
Complaint.
 
On May 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the demurrer. 
 
On June 9, 2023, Defendant filed a reply in support of the demurrer.[2]
 
On June 16, 2023, the court issued a minute order regarding the status
conference re: amended complaint stating, in pertinent part, the following: 
 
The Court states it has read and considered the minute order from
February 22, 2023, indicating the Defendant's Demurrer - without Motion to
Strike filed by Qui D. Ong was Sustained with leave to amend. Further, the
Court finds the Plaintiff has failed to file an Amended Complaint since said
ruling. Order to Show Cause Re: Plaintiff's Failure to Appear on June 16, 2023
is scheduled for 07/18/2023 at 09:00 AM in Department O at Pomona Courthouse
South. Order to Show Cause Re: Why Court Should not Dismiss the Case in its
Entirety is scheduled for 07/18/2023 at 09:00 AM in Department O at Pomona
Courthouse South.
            Defense
Counsel to give notice. (emphasis added).
 
On July 18, 2023, the court dismissed Plaintiff’s action,
stating the following, in pertinent part: “There is no appearance by or for the
Plaintiff this date. The Court states it has read and considered the minute
order from February 22, 2023, indicating the Plaintiff was granted 30 days
leave to amend and has yet to file an Amended Complaint. The Court orders the
Amended Complaint (3rd) filed by Carlos Labaco on 07/15/2021 dismissed without
prejudice.” That same day, the court filed a Certificate of Mailing, indicating
that the court provided notice to Plaintiff of the court’s ruling. 
 
On August 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
A formal
notice of ruling is required to set the time limit running to file a motion for
reconsideration. The 10-day time limit runs from service of notice of entry of
the order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).) 
 
Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 1008: 
 
When an application for an order has
been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or
granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order
may, within 10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of
the order and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law,
make application to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider
the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the
application shall state by affidavit what application was made
before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new
or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1008)
(emphasis added)
 
Discussion
 
Here, the
motion has a few defects. 
 
First, the
motion is untimely. Ten days from date of the court’s notice of entry of order
is July 28, 2023, but Plaintiff filed the motion on August 1, 2023. 
 
Second,
Plaintiff’s declaration does not comply with most of the requirements set forth
above; merely, the declaration states that Plaintiff did not receive notice of
the “last few hearings.” 
 
Third,
Plaintiff states that it was not just the June 16, 2023 ruling that he did not
receive notice of, but, without specificity, “other” hearings; the court is
uncertain as to the “other” hearings Plaintiff is referring to. 
 
That said, a review of the docket corroborates
Plaintiff’s contention that he did not receive notice of hearings. 
 
First, as for
the court’s 4/28/23 filing of Notice Re: Continuance of Hearing and Order about
the Status Conference Re: Amended Complaint indicating the hearing previously
set for 5/11/23 is moved to 6/16/23, it appears the court did not provide
notice to Plaintiff because the Certificate 
of Mailing
only bears Defendant’s current counsel (Lloyd) and previous counsel (Sprague). Second,
as for the June 16, 2023 order, Defense Counsel was to give notice, but the 
court docket provides no such proof of
service. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s explanation as to why he 
did not attend the 7/18/23 hearing is
corroborated by the lack of notice of hearing dates regarding 
the status of his amended complaint
and OSC to dismiss his case should Plaintiff not appear. 
 
Therefore, even if the motion does not
meet the strict requirement of CCP section 1008, a court 
has the inherent authority to correct
an earlier erroneous ruling. And here, the court erred in 
failing to provide notice of the
6/16/23 hearing to Plaintiff—which triggered the dismissal of 
Plaintiff’s case. (See In re
Marriage of Barthold (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1308, quoting Le 
Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1108 [“If a court believes one of its prior interim 
orders was erroneous,
it should be able to correct that error no matter how it came to acquire that 
belief.”].) 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the court notes that a
Plaintiff’s failure to file an amended 
complaint is grounds for dismissal within the court’s
discretion. (Leader v.
Health Industries of 
America, Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603, 613 [“plaintiffs'
failure to file an amended complaint 
within the time specified subjected
their entire action to dismissal in the court's discretion 
under section 581, subdivision (f)(2). Under that statute, the
court may dismiss the complaint 
when: “after a demurrer to the
complaint is sustained with leave to amend, the plaintiff fails to 
amend it within the time allowed by
the court and either party moves for dismissal.”].) 
 
Here, the court’s tentative (though
not adopted) on Defendant’s demurrer to the TAC took 
concern with Plaintiff changing the
amount of money owed to a larger 
amount than initially alleged, without
an explanation. For
that reason, during the hearing, the 
court did not adopt its tentative and
sustained the demurrer so that Plaintiff could cure the defect. 
Thus, as Plaintiff was to file an
amended complaint to ensure the truthfulness of the pleadings 
but failed to do that within 30 days
of the 2/22/23 order (and anytime soon thereafter), 
the court is not inclined to grant
Plaintiff’s relief. 
 
 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the motion is TBD at the hearing.
