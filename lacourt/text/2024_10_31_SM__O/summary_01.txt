Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiffs' Motion to Tax Costs. The Plaintiffs, Jonathan Rapore and Deborah Rapore, are seeking to tax or strike $28,162 from Defendant Thalia M. Nguyen, M.D.'s Memorandum of Costs. The Defendant made a 998 offer prior to trial, which was not accepted by the Plaintiffs. The Defendant obtained a more favorable judgment on the motion for summary judgment.

The Court finds that the Defendant's 998 offer was reasonable and made in good faith. The Plaintiffs did not provide any evidence or authority to support their argument that the offer was made in bad faith. The Court also finds that the Defendant's expert witness fees are recoverable under CCP § 998(c)(1) as the experts provided direct support for the Defendant's defense.

The Court also rules that the filing fee associated with the motion for summary judgment is allowed, as the Defendant was the prevailing party on the motion. The Court further rules that the deposition fees, jury fees, service of process fees, and court filing courtesy copy fees are allowed under CCP § 1033.5(3)(A).

The Court denies the Plaintiffs' Motion to Tax Costs, finding that the Defendant's costs are reasonable and recoverable under the law.
