Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, denying the defendants' special motion to strike the complaint under CCP § 425.16 (Anti-SLAPP) and sustaining the demurrer to the 1st cause of action for Violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 2924m without leave to amend. The 2nd-7th causes of action are overruled. The request for leave to file an amended complaint is denied for failing to abide by the procedural requirements.

The judge found that the defendants did not meet their burden to show that the plaintiff's claims arise from protected speech or conduct under CCP § 425.16. The judge also found that the 1st cause of action for Violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 2924m is not a private right of action and is therefore sustained without leave to amend.

The judge rejected the defendants' argument that the statute does not provide a private right of action and that the plaintiff has failed to plead the claims with sufficient facts. The judge also rejected the defendants' argument that the remaining causes of action fail because they are based on a violation of the statute with no private right of action.

The judge granted the defendants' request to take judicial notice of certain documents, but denied their request to take judicial notice of the truth of the facts within those documents.

The judge ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the issue of whether the defendants' submittal of the affidavit to the foreclosure trustee was done "in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest" under CCP § 425.16.
