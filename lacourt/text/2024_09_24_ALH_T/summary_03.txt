And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the Plaintiff's motion for a new trial, which was filed in response to the Court's grant of summary judgment to the Defendants. The Plaintiff argues that the Court should grant a new trial based on allegedly new evidence and changed circumstances. However, the Court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to meet the burden of showing new facts or circumstances, accident or surprise, insufficiency of the evidence, or an error in law justifying a new trial.

The Plaintiff's new evidence, which includes the deposition of the security company that serviced the bar at the time of the incident, does not provide new evidence giving rise to a duty of care. The Plaintiff's inability to recall the location, time, and circumstances of the assault, as well as the loss of video footage, makes it impossible to establish a triable issue that a duty to protect from third-party assault existed.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff's motion for a new trial is without merit and is therefore denied.
