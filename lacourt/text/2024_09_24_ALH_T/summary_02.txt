Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to tax costs in part. The plaintiff is entitled to recover costs related to expert witness fees, interpreter fees, and service of process. However, the judge reduces the plaintiff's expert witness fees from $42,150 to $27,150 and reduces the "other" costs from $2,729.38 to $1,425.60. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for prejudgment interest as untimely.
