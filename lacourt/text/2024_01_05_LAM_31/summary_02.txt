Significant Statements:

  - "A court may impose terminating sanctions by striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering default judgment." (Code Civ. Proc., ยง 2023.030, subd. (d))
  - "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly, but where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280)
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions against Quik Tow, LLC. The motion was filed due to Quik Tow's failure to respond to discovery requests, disobeying a court order compelling compliance, and failing to file an opposition to the motion. The judge has struck Quik Tow's answer and allowed the plaintiff to pursue default proceedings against Quik Tow. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial date, as the reason for the motion (Quik Tow's failure to engage in the discovery process) is no longer relevant given the granting of the terminating sanctions.

The judge has found that Quik Tow's failure to provide discovery responses was willful and that lesser sanctions would not curb the abuse. The judge has used terminating sanctions to encourage fair disclosure of discovery and prevent unfairness resulting from the lack of information.
