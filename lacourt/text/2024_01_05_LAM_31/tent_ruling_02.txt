MOTION
FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS
 
MOTION
TO CONTINUE TRIAL



 
MOVING PARTY:                   Plaintiff
Fermin Garcia
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On September
26, 2022, Plaintiff, Fermin Garcia, filed this action against Defendants, Quik
Tow, LLC (“Quik Tow”) and Ignacio Gonzalez, for wage and hour violations. 
 
            On November
14, 2022, Plaintiff served Quik Tow with the first set of discovery, including
Request for Production of Documents.  Quik
Tow did not serve responses.  After meeting
and conferring with defense counsel about the overdue responses, Plaintiff
filed motions to compel on February 21, 2023. 
The motions were heard and granted on June 22, 2023.  In particular, Quik Tow was ordered to serve
responses to the Request for Production within 30 days of the Court’s
order.  However, Quik Tow has not provided
responses to the production requests.
 
            On August
28, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion for terminating sanctions against Quik
Tow for failing to comply with the Court’s June 22, 2023 Order.  Plaintiff also requests monetary sanctions.
 
            The
motion is unopposed.[1]
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.030 gives the court the discretion to impose sanctions
against anyone engaging in a misuse of the discovery process.¿ Misuse of the
discovery process includes failure to respond to an authorized method of
discovery or disobeying a court order to provide discovery.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.010, subds. (d), (g).)¿ A court may impose terminating sanctions by
striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering
default judgment.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)¿ A violation of a
discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of terminating sanctions.¿ (Collison
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.)¿ Terminating
sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court’s
orders.¿ (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771,
795-796.)¿¿¿¿ 
            The court
should consider the totality of the circumstances, including conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful, the detriment to the
propounding party, and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain
discovery.¿ (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)¿ If a
lesser sanction fails to curb abuse, a greater sanction is warranted.¿ (Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.)¿ However, “the
unsuccessful imposition of a lesser sanction is not an absolute prerequisite to
the utilization of the ultimate sanction.”¿ (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 787.)          
            Before any
sanctions may be imposed the court must make an express finding that there has
been a willful failure of the party to serve the required answers.¿ (Fairfield
v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.)¿
Lack of diligence may be deemed willful where the party understood its
obligation, had the ability to comply, and failed to comply.¿ (Deyo, supra,
84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787; Fred Howland Co. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles
County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605, 610-611.)¿ The party who failed to comply
with discovery obligations has the burden of showing that the failure was not
willful.  (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 788; Cornwall v.
Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500,
605.)¿¿ 
            A
terminating sanction is a “drastic measure which should be employed with
caution.”¿ (Deyo, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.)¿ “A decision to order
terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.¿ But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.”¿ (Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)¿ While the
court has discretion to impose terminating sanctions, these sanctions “should
be appropriate to the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required
to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.”¿ (Deyo,
84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.)¿ “[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate
sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with
his discovery obligations.”¿ (Ibid.)¿ Discovery sanctions are not
to be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure
of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information.¿ (See
Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64 [superseded on other
grounds as stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 967,
971].)¿¿ 
III.       DISCUSSION
As the Court stated in Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at
pp. 795-796, “[t]erminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in
disobeying the court’s orders.”¿ Terminating sanctions are appropriate here for
that very reason.¿ Quik Tow did not provide responses to Plaintiff production
requests, disobeyed a Court Order compelling Quik Tow to provide responses, and
has failed to file an opposition to this motion.¿¿¿¿ 
 
The Court finds Quik Tow knew of its discovery obligations
and knew of the Court Order compelling its compliance.¿ The Court finds Quik
Tow’s failure to provide discovery responses was willful as was its
disobedience to the Court’s Order.¿ Indeed, Plaintiff met and conferred with
Quik Tow regarding the outstanding discovery responses prior to filing a motion
to compel and after the Court issued its order compelling compliance on June
22, 2023.  (See Banayan Decl., ¶¶ 3-12,
16-21.)  Given Quik
Tow’s disinterest in defending this action, failure to comply with Court Orders,
and apparent abandonment of the case, the Court finds lesser sanctions would
not curb the abuse.[2]¿¿ 
IV.       CONCLUSION
            Based on the
foregoing, the motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED.  Defendant
Quik Tow, LLC’s Answer, filed November 2, 2022 is struck.  Plaintiff may pursue default proceedings against
Quik Tow, LLC.
            Plaintiff’s
request for monetary sanctions is denied.
            Plaintiff
has also filed a motion to continue the trial date and all related dates.  The motion to continue is predicated entirely on Quik Tow’s failure to engage
in the discovery process.  Given that the
Court has granted Plaintiff’s motion for terminating sanctions against Quik Tow,
there is no good cause to continue the trial date.  Accordingly, the motion to continue the trial
date is denied without prejudice. 
            Moving party
to give notice.
Dated:   January 5, 2024
