[1] A failure to oppose a motion may
be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion.  (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 8.54(c).) 


[2] The Court was initially reluctant
to grant terminating sanctions against Quik Tow given that Quik Tow provided
responses to Plaintiff’s First Set of Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Requests for Admission. 
(See Banayan Decl., ¶ 11.)   Since
then, however, the Court granted Plaintiff’s unopposed motions compelling Quik
Tow to provide further responses to Special Interrogatories and Form
Interrogatories on December 15, 2023 and December 22, 2023, respectively.  Counsel for Quik Tow did file oppositions to
the motions and did not appear at the hearings.
