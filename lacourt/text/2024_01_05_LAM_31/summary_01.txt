And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Kerry Bensinger in the case of Monique Cooper v. B. Ruth Allen, et al. (Case No. 22STCV23823). The case involves a wrongful eviction claim, and plaintiff Monique Cooper seeks leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC). The proposed FAC adds new claims and parties, including a grandson and a trust. The motion was previously continued due to the lack of a proposed pleading and proof of service, but plaintiff has since filed an amended motion with the proposed FAC attached and proof of service. The court finds that leave should be granted to file the proposed FAC, as it is in the interests of justice and the motion is unopposed. The court grants the motion and deems the FAC filed on September 5, 2023.
