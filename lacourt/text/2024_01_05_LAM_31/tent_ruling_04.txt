MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Michael
J. Jaurigue and Amanda L. Thompson, Jaurigue Law Group
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On October 10, 2023, Michael J. Jaurigue and Amanda L.
Thompson, counsel for Plaintiff, Fredrick Smith, filed this Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel.  
 
The Motion was heard on November 30, 2023.  The Court could not grant the motion because Item
5b of the proposed order did not specify the date when the order was to be
effective.  The Court directed Counsel to
file and serve an amended Motion which includes the date when the order is to
be effective and any hearing dates that were reserved after Counsel filed this
Motion.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS 
 
California Rule of Court rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved
as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to the
client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without
compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration
in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052));
(3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other
parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving
counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
III.       DISCUSSION 
 
Michael J. Jaurigue and Amanda L. Thompson seek to be
relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff for the following reasons: “The relationship
of trust and confidence essential to the attorney-client relationship has
ceased to exist.  An irreparable
breakdown of the attorney-client relationship has arisen that makes continued
representation unreasonably difficult. 
The specific acts giving rise to this motion are confidential.  Client will not consent to counsel being
relieved pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 284(1).”  (MC-052.) 
 
 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s
request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 406.)  
 
Counsel has cured the defects noted in the Court’s previous
order.  The Motion now complies with California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  
 
IV.       CONCLUSION         
            The
unopposed motion is GRANTED and effective upon the filing of the proof of
service of this signed order upon Plaintiff.
            Counsel to
give notice.
