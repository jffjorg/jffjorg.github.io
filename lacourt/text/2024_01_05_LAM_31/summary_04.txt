And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the unopposed motion of Michael J. Jaurigue and Amanda L. Thompson, counsel for plaintiff Fredrick Smith, to be relieved as counsel. The court had previously directed counsel to cure defects in the original motion, which has now been done. The reason for the motion is that the relationship of trust and confidence between the attorneys and the client has ceased to exist, making continued representation unreasonably difficult. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The motion is effective upon the filing of the proof of service of this signed order upon the plaintiff.
