And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for an order to show cause for civil contempt against defendant's counsel, Reed Aljian. The court lacks jurisdiction to proceed with the contempt proceeding because the motion was served on Aljian via email, whereas he was required to be personally served. The court relies on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1209, 1211, and 1015-1016 to support its decision. The judge notes that a contempt proceeding must be commenced by the filing of an affidavit and a request for an order to show cause, and that the court must sign an order to show cause re contempt after notice to the opposing party's lawyer.
