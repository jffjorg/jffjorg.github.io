Discussion
Code Civ. Proc., section 1209(a)(5) provides that disobedience
of any lawful judgment, order, or process of the court constitutes contempt. 
“As a general rule, the elements of
contempt include (1) a valid order, (2) knowledge of the order, (3) ability to
comply with the order, and (4) willful failure to comply with the order.” (In
re Ivey (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 793, 798.) “A contempt proceeding is commenced by
the filing of an affidavit and a request for an order to show cause.” (Cedars-Sinai
Imaging Medical Group v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1286;
see Code Civ. Proc., sections 1211(a)-(b).) “After notice to the opposing
party's lawyer, the court (if satisfied with the sufficiency of the affidavit)
must sign an order to show cause re contempt in which the date and time for a
hearing are set forth.” (Id.)
When an alleged act of contempt is not
committed in the court’s immediate view and presence in the courtroom or in
chambers, an affidavit or declaration made under penalty of perjury describing
the facts that constitute contempt. (Code Civ. Proc., section 1211(a).) The
filing of the affidavit or declaration is a jurisdictional prerequisite to a
contempt proceeding. (In re M.R. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 49, 57.)  
Unless the
citee has concealed himself from the court, he must be personally served with
the affidavit and the order to show cause; otherwise, the court lacks
jurisdiction to proceed.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., section 1015 [in civil actions
in which a party is represented by an attorney, ‘the service of papers, when
required, must be upon the attorney instead of the party, except service of
subpoenas, of writs, and other process issued in the suit, and of papers to bring
him into contempt’]; see also section 1016.)”¿(Cedars-Sinai Imaging Medical
Group v. Superior Court, 83 Cal. App. 4th 1281, 1286-87 (2000) (italics in
original).¿)
Here, the Court lacks jurisdiction to proceed because
Plaintiff’s proof of service shows this motion was served on Aljian via email.
Plaintiff was required to personally serve Aljian. Therefore, Plaintiff’s
motion for an OSC re: contempt is DENIED.
Conclusion

Plaintiff’s motion for an OSC re: contempt is DENIED.
