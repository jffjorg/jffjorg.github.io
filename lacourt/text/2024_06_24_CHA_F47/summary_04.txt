And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on three motions to quash the service of summons filed by Defendant Zerafat Nikou. The motions were filed on October 23, 2023, December 8, 2023, and April 5, 2024. The Plaintiff, Ella Chan, filed this action against Nikou and others for Dependent Adult Abuse/Neglect, Willful Neglect, and Medical Negligence.

The Court finds that the service of summons occurred at three different addresses: 20702 Kittredge St., 6225 Shoup Ave., and 21301 Erwin St. Substitute service was used at each address. Nikou filed three motions to quash the service, claiming that there was no personal jurisdiction over her.

The Court finds that the service at the Shoup address superseded the service at the Kittredge address and the service at the Erwin address superseded the service at the Shoup address. Therefore, the first two motions to quash are moot. The third motion to quash is denied.

The Court also finds that the proof of service creates a presumption of valid service. Nikou concedes that she resided at the Erwin address at the time of the substitute service. However, Nikou does not provide any evidence to support her claim that the individual served was not the owner of the property.

Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff properly served Nikou via substitute service at the Erwin address.
