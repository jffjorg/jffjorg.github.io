MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Motion filed on 4/29/24.
 
MOVING ATTORNEY: Johnny Rundell
CLIENT: Plaintiff Kryshawn Cousins
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order relieving Johnny Rundell
as counsel for Plaintiff Kryshawn Cousins in this action.  
 
RULING: The motion is placed off calendar.  
 
On 4/29/24, attorney Johnny Rundell filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order relieving him as attorney for Plaintiff
Kryshawn Cousins (Plaintiff) in this action.
 
The proof of service for the motion indicates that it was
served on counsel for the opposing party and on Plaintiff via electronic
mail.  There is no indication that Plaintiff
agreed to accept service via email.  See
CCP 1010.6(c).  Additionally, the
declaration filed in support of the motion indicates that the motion was mailed
to the client’s last known address, return receipt requested; however, the
proof of service does not indicate such service.  (See Declaration, No.3.b.(2)(a); Proof
of Service attached to Notice of Motion).
 
Further, the motion was originally scheduled for hearing
on 11/15/24 and was advanced and continued to 6/24/24 by the Court on 5/1/24
with Plaintiff’s counsel being ordered to give notice.  (See 5/1/24 Minute Order).  On 6/5/24, Plaintiff’s counsel filed and
served a Notice of Proceedings which gave notice of the new 6/24/24 hearing
date.  The proof of service for the
Notice of Proceedings indicates that it was served only on Defendant Choosing
Independence, Inc.’s (Defendant) former counsel, WorkWise Law, PC.  On 4/9/24, Defendant filed and served a
Substitution of Attorney indicating that it had substituted ADLI Law Group PC
in place of WorkWise Law, PC.  Also, the
proof of service regarding the new hearing date gives no indication that
Plaintiff was served with notice of the new hearing date.  
 
There being no response to the motion by Plaintiff or
Defendant to cure the defects in notice, the motion is placed off
calendar.
