And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has placed the motion to relieve attorney Johnny Rundell as counsel for Plaintiff Kryshawn Cousins off calendar due to defects in notice. The motion was filed on April 29, 2024, and was originally scheduled for hearing on November 15, 2024, but was continued to June 24, 2024, with notice given to Plaintiff's counsel. However, the proof of service indicates that the motion was only served on the opposing party's counsel and not on Plaintiff, and there is no indication that Plaintiff agreed to accept service via email. Additionally, the motion was not served on Plaintiff via mail as required, and the proof of service for the notice of proceedings given on June 5, 2024, only indicates service on the opposing party's counsel. As a result, the motion is denied due to lack of proper notice.
