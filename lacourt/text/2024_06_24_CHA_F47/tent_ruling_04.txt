SUMMARY OF ACTION & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On 5/10/23, Plaintiff Ella Chan (Plaintiff) filed this
action against Defendants J28 Home Care Corp.; Edjeska Macandili; Zerafat Nikou
and Does 1-50 for: (1) Dependent Adult Abuse/Neglect, (2) Willful Neglect and
(3) Medical Negligence.  
 
On 10/4/23, Plaintiff filed a Proof of Service indicating
that Defendant Zerafat Nikou (Nikou) was served with the Summons and Complaint
via substituted service on 9/24/23 at her home located at 20702 Kittredge St.,
Canoga Park, California 91306 with subsequent mailing to the same address on
9/25/23.  On 10/23/23, Nikou filed her
first motion to quash the service at the Kittredge address which was originally
scheduled for hearing on 3/28/24.
 
On 11/15/23, Plaintiff filed an Amended Proof of Service
of Summons indicating that Nikou was served with the Summons and Complaint via
substituted service on 11/11/23 at her home located at 6225 Shoup Ave., #117,
Woodland Hills, California 91367 with subsequent mailing to the same address on
11/13/23.  On 12/8/23, Nikou filed her
second motion to quash the service at the Shoup address which is scheduled for
hearing on 6/24/24.
 
On 2/27/24, Plaintiff filed another Proof of Service
indicating that Nikou was served with the Summons and Complaint via substituted
service on 2/25/24 at her home located at 21301 Erwin St., Unit 207, Woodland
Hills, California 91367 with subsequent mailing on 2/26/24.  The same proof of service documents were
filed again by Plaintiff on 2/29/24.  
 
On 3/12/24, Nikou filed a Notice of Taking the 3/28/24
hearing on the first motion to quash the Kittredge service off calendar.  On 3/27/24, Nikou filed a Notice of
Continuance regarding the same motion indicating that the hearing on that
motion was continued to 5/20/24.  
 
On 4/5/24, Nikou filed a third motion to quash the
service at the Erwin address which was originally scheduled for hearing on
11/19/24.  On 4/12/24, the Court advanced
the 11/19/24 hearing to 4/12/24 and continued it to 6/24/24.  (See 4/12/24 Minute Order).
 
On 5/1/24, the Court continued the 5/20/24 hearing on the
first motion to quash service at the Kittredge address to 5/23/24.  On 5/7/24, Plaintiff filed an opposition to
the continued motion to quash.  On
5/16/24, Nikou filed a reply to the opposition. 

 
On 5/23/24, on its own motion, the Court continued the
hearing on the first motion to quash to 6/24/24 so that all three motions to
quash could be considered together.  (See
5/23/24 Minute Order).  
 
On 6/10/24, Plaintiff filed a combined opposition to the
motions to quash and on 6/14/24, Nikou filed a combined reply in support of the
motions to quash.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Nikou’s objections to the declaration of Neil S. Steiner
and to the exhibits attached thereto are overruled.  The subject evidence did not form the basis
for the Court’s ruling on the motions.
 
The Court finds that the service at the Shoup address
superseded the service at the Kittredge address and the service at the Erwin
address superseded the service at the Shoup address.  In turn, the Court finds that the first
motion to quash service addressing service at Kittredge address was rendered
moot by the subsequent service at the Shoup address.  Similarly, the Court finds that the second
motion to quash service addressing service at the Shoup address was rendered
moot by the subsequent service at the Erwin address.
 
CCP 415.20(b) provides: 
 
“If a copy of the summons and
complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the
person to be served, as specified in Section
416.60, 416.70, 416.80,
or 416.90,
a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the
person's dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or
usual mailing address other than a United States Postal Service post office
box, in the presence of a competent member of the household or a person
apparently in charge of his or her office, place of business, or usual mailing
address other than a United States Postal Service post office box, at least 18
years of age, who shall be informed of the contents thereof, and by thereafter
mailing a copy of the summons and of the complaint by first-class mail, postage
prepaid to the person to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and
complaint were left. Service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete on
the 10th day after the mailing.” 
 
The proof of service of the summons and complaint on
Nikou at the Erwin address indicates that after making two separate attempts to
personally serve Nikou at the Erwin address on 2/22/24 and 2/24/24, registered
process server, Jose de Jesus Felix Nava, sub-served the summons and complaint
on Nikou on 2/25/24 by leaving the documents at 3:00 p.m. with “Jane Doe,
Nissar Doe” who is described as a 5’ 4”, 150 pound, 40-year-old, middle
eastern, female with black hair and brown eyes who refused to provide a last
name.  (See Proofs of Service
filed 2/27/24 and 2/29/24).  Thereafter,
on 2/26/24, Nava mailed the summons and complaint to Nikou at the Erwin
address.  Id.  The proof of service creates a presumption of
valid service.  See Floveyor
International, Ltd. (1997) 59 CA4th 789, 795.
 
Nikou concedes that she resided at the Erwin address at
the time of the substitute service.  (See
Nikou’s 4/5/24 Decl. ¶¶2, 4).  After the
substitute service, Plaintiff’s attorney opined that the individual served was
likely the owner of the property, Nazanin Zamani.  (Nikou’s 4/5/24 Decl. ¶¶5, 9, Ex.C).  While Nikou claims that the individual described
in the proof of service is not Zamani, no declaration from Zamani is provided
stating that she was not in Nikou’s unit at the time of the service and/or that
she did not accept the documents.  (See
Nikou’s 4/5/24 Decl. ¶¶6-7).  Further,
Nikou does not state that she even asked Zamani whether she was at/in her unit
at the time of the substitute service. 
Rather, Nikou states that to the best of her knowledge, the owners did
not access her unit on 2/25/24 or any other date during her possession.  (Nikou’s 4/5/24 Decl. ¶¶8-9).  In contrast, the proof of service is signed
under penalty of perjury indicating that substitute service was effected on a
competent member of the household at least 18 years of age.  (See Proofs of Service filed 2/27/24
and 2/29/24).  
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff
properly served Nikou via substitute service at the Erwin address.  (See Proofs of Service filed 2/27/24
and 2/29/24); CCP 415/20(b).    
 
CONCLUSION
 
The first motion to quash filed on 10/23/23 and the
second motion to quash filed on 12/8/23 are placed off calendar as moot.
 
The third motion to quash filed on 4/5/24 is denied.
