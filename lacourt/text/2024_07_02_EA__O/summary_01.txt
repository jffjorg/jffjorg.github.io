And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Petitioners Alfonso Espinoza and Pedro Salazar against Respondent Philadelphia Insurance Company. The petitioners are seeking to compel arbitration of their underinsured motorist claim, but the judge finds that the motion is moot because Respondent is not disputing the matter will be arbitrated.

However, the judge notes that there is a dispute over when arbitration can take place. Respondent is seeking a stay pending a calculation of worker's compensation benefits, citing Insurance Code section 11580.2. The judge agrees with Respondent that the statute requires a stay until the worker's compensation claims are resolved, and that an insurer acts properly in delaying payment of UM benefits until medical expense amounts are determined through the workers' compensation system.

The judge also notes that the petitioners' argument that the statute is immaterial because there was no worker's compensation claim is incorrect, citing Case v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., Inc. Therefore, the judge denies the petitioners' motion to compel arbitration.
