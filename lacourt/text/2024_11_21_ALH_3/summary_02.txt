And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the motion for trial preference filed by Irma Antezana Morgan, who is 81 years old and suffers from physical and cognitive conditions. Morgan argued that she needed a preference to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation, but the Court found that she had not shown that her health necessitates a preference. The Court also noted that Morgan's refusal to reduce the number of issues in the action and insistence on proceeding with extensive discovery casts doubt on her purported need for preference. The Court highlighted that Morgan's medical provider's most recent examination was conducted six months before the declaration was signed, which raises questions about the accuracy of her claims. Additionally, the Court pointed out that Morgan did not file a reply brief responding to the defendants' arguments.
