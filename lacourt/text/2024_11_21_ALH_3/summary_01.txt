The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for attorney fees filed by plaintiff Rami Ettlinger against defendant General Motors, LLC. The Court has awarded plaintiff $17,087.57 in attorney fees and costs, as requested. The Court finds that plaintiff's counsel has reasonably incurred these fees and costs in connection with the litigation, including drafting the complaint and other filings, corresponding with opposing counsel, preparing discovery requests and reviewing discovery responses, preparing a nonparty deposition subpoena, and drafting a meet and confer letter. The Court rejects defendant's challenges to the reasonableness of these fees and costs, finding that they are supported by the evidence and are reasonable in amount. The Court also grants plaintiff's request for costs in full, finding that the costs incurred for the subpoena and motion to compel deposition of Santa Monica Buick were necessary and reasonable. The Court's decision is based on California Civil Code section 1794(d) and the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, and is consistent with precedent in similar cases.
