Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment in this medical malpractice case. The plaintiff, Tubol, alleges that the defendants, John Diaz, M.D. and John Diaz, M.D. APCS, negligently performed breast augmentation surgery, causing an infection that required the removal of the implants. The defendants argue that they complied with the standard of care, while the plaintiff presents expert testimony that the defendants breached the standard of care and caused the plaintiff's injuries. The judge finds that the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact as to causation and breach, and therefore denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment.
