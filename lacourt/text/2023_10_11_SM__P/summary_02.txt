And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for a protective order and motion for financial discovery. The plaintiff, Jane Doe, seeks to bar liability discovery and allow financial discovery into the defendant, Weinstein's, financial condition. The defendant was convicted of raping Jane Doe in a criminal proceeding and is now facing a civil lawsuit.

The court has ruled that the criminal conviction is admissible as proof of the defendant's liability for sexual battery. However, the court has denied the plaintiff's motion for a protective order because the criminal conviction is still under appeal and collateral estoppel does not apply. The court will entertain the parties' comments regarding a protective order at the hearing.

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for financial discovery, finding a "substantial probability" that the plaintiff will prevail in the action and obtain an award of punitive damages.
