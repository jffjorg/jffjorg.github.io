Here is a summary of the tentative ruling:

The defendant, Quest Diagnostics Clinical Laboratories, Inc., has moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiff's PAGA claims are barred by res judicata due to the court-approved PAGA settlement in Bigornia v. Quest Diagnostics Incorporated. The court finds that the PAGA claims are barred by res judicata and grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court concludes that the plaintiff's PAGA claims are the same cause of action alleged and settled in the Bigornia Action, and that the plaintiff was a member of the class in the Bigornia Action and was in privity with the plaintiffs in the Bigornia Action.
