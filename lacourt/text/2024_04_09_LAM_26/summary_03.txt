```
Case Number: 23STCV19867
Hearing Date: April 10, 2024
Dept: 26 Superior Court of California
County of Los Angeles
Department 26

---
Case Facts:

  * Plaintiffs Katia Zarnegar and Gita Zarnegar filed a lawsuit against defendants Kambiz Zarnegar, 21st Santa Monica Investments, LLC, and "All Persons Unknown" alleging fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, constructive/trust, accounting, negligence, and more.
  * Cross-complainants Kambiz Zarnegar and Marina Zarnegar filed a cross-complaint against cross-defendants Katia Zarnegar and Gita Zarnegar for fraud and declaratory relief.
  * Cross-defendants filed a special motion to strike the cross-complaint.

Legal Issues:

  * Whether the special motion to strike the cross-complaint is granted due to the anti-SLAPP statute (Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16).
  * Whether the litigation privilege and mediation privilege apply to bar tort liability.

Judge's Ruling:

  * Cross-defendants failed to satisfy their burden in showing that the challenged cause of action arises from protected activity.
  * The litigation privilege and mediation privilege do not apply because the mediation was not a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding, and the communications and activity in the cross-complaint consist of activity outside the mediation.
  * There is a reasonable probability of success on the merits since the claimed privileges likely would not apply.
  * The special motion to strike is denied.

Orders:

  * The special motion to strike is denied.
  * Cross-defendants are not entitled to recover attorney's fees and costs incurred in bringing this motion.
  * Moving parties are to give notice and file proof of service of such.

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge denied the special motion to strike the cross-complaint, filed by cross-defendants Katia Zarnegar and Gita Zarnegar, against cross-complainants Kambiz Zarnegar and Marina Zarnegar. The motion was filed under the anti-SLAPP statute (Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16). The judge found that cross-defendants failed to show that the challenged cause of action arises from protected activity, and therefore, the litigation privilege and mediation privilege do not apply. The court concluded that there is a reasonable probability of success on the merits and denied the special motion to strike.
