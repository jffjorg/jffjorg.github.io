And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Defendant Mike Cortez's motion to quash service of summons and complaint and/or to dismiss for non-compliance with Code of Civil Procedure sections 474, 583.210 et seq. The ruling finds that Defendant Mike Cortez made a general appearance in the case by propounding discovery and thus did not waive the ability to invoke Code of Civil Procedure section 583.210. The Court notes that Plaintiff Robin Sherry unreasonably delayed in filing the Doe amendment and that Defendant Mike Cortez was aware of his identity since at least October 16, 2020. The ruling requires Defendant Mike Cortez to file a responsive pleading within 15 days of entry of the order.
