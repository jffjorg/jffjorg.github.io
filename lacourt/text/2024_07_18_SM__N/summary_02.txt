And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Invasix, Inc. dba InMode's motion to stay the entire action pending the disposition of defendant Dr. Abedelmajid Sabour's bankruptcy proceeding. The motion was based on the argument that Dr. Sabour is indispensable to the action because plaintiffs are seeking to hold non-debtor defendants liable for Dr. Sabour's conduct, and vice versa, plaintiffs' claims arise from the alleged joint conduct and concurrent representations of Dr. Sabour and defendant Claire Jimeno. The court found that the automatic stay of judicial proceedings does not apply to non-debtor codefendants, and that the narrow exceptions to this rule do not apply in this case. The court also noted that Dr. Sabour's participation is not necessary to allow Invasix to fully present its defenses, and that the claims are intertwined but not a reason in themselves to stay the action as to all defendants.
