  Case Number:  20STCV02166    Hearing Date:   July 18, 2024    Dept:  N TENTATIVE RULINGDefendant Mike Cortez’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons and Complaint and/or to Dismiss for Non-Compliance with Code of Civil Procedure §§ 474, 583.210 et seq. is DENIED.Defendant Mike Cortez shall file a responsive pleading within 15 days of entry of this order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (b).)Defendant Mike Cortez to give notice. REASONINGDefendant Mike Cortez (“Defendant”) moves the Court for an order quashing Plaintiff Robin Sherry (“Plaintiff”)’s service of the summons and complaint upon him after making a Doe amendment naming Defendant as “JOHN DOE/DOE 1.” Defendant argues that Plaintiff has known of Defendant’s identity for more than three years before making the Doe amendment, and she failed to serve the summons within the statutorily permitted time period.Code of Civil Procedure section 474 provides, in relevant part, that “[w]hen the plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defendant, [she] must state that fact in the complaint, . . . and when his true name is discovered, the pleading or proceeding must be amended accordingly.” Defendant brings this motion to quash on the ground that Plaintiff may not avail herself of the Doe amendment procedure authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section 474 because she unreasonably delayed in filing the Doe amendment. The Court notes that a motion to quash is the proper procedure for challenging such an amendment, although it is not a motion to quash in the traditional sense. (See McClatchy v. Coblentz, Patch, Duffy & Bass, LLP (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 368, 375 [improper service of a defendant under Code of Civil Procedure may be attacked by a motion to quash].)Woo v. Superior Court (1999) 75 Cal. App. 4th 169, 176, explains the general rule of naming a party in place of a Doe defendant as follows:[A]n amended complaint that adds a new defendant does not relate back to the date of filing the original complaint and the statute of limitations is applied as of the date the amended complaint is filed, not the date the original complaint is filed. A recognized exception to the general rule is the substitution under [Code of Civil Procedure] section 474 of a new defendant for a fictitious Doe defendant named in the original complaint as to whom a cause of action was stated in the original complaint. If the requirements of section 474 are satisfied, the amended complaint substituting a new defendant for a fictitious Doe defendant filed after the statute of limitations has expired is deemed filed as of the date the original complaint was filed.The Second District Court of Appeal case A.N. v. County of Los Angeles (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1058, is also instructive here. In that case, the plaintiff filed a complaint for damages in May 2005, and in August and September 2007, less than a month before trial, the plaintiff served five defendants with the summons and complaint, naming them in place of Doe defendants. (Id. at pp. 1060, 1063.) The defendants filed motions to quash, arguing the plaintiff “had known their identity for a significant period of time but had nonetheless unreasonably delayed in naming and serving them as Doe Defendants under section 474,” and “they had been prejudiced by the delay.” (Id. at p. 1063.) The trial court granted the defendants’ motion to quash on that ground, and the appellate court affirmed the trial court’s ruling. (Id. at pp. 1060, 1063.) In so doing, the appellate court concluded (1) Code of Civil Procedure section 474 “includes an implicit requirement that a plaintiff may not unreasonably delay his or her filing of a Doe amendment after learning a defendant’s identity,” (2) “a defendant named in an action by a Doe amendment under section 474 may challenge the amendment by way of an evidence-based motion, which argues that the plaintiff unreasonably delayed his or her filing of the challenged amendment,” and (3) unreasonable delay “includes a prejudice element, which requires a showing by the defendant that he or she would suffer prejudice from plaintiff’s delay in filing the Doe amendment.” (Id. at pp. 1066-1067, quotation marks omitted.)On January 17, 2020, Plaintiff filed her initial complaint based on an incident occurring on February 6, 2019, when she was allegedly hit by Defendant Organic Pastures Dairy Co.’s vehicle, and Plaintiff named “JOHN DOE/DOE 1” as the operator of the vehicle and an employee of Defendant Organic Pastures Dairy Co. (Compl. ¶¶ 7, 10, 17, 21, 27.) It follows that Plaintiff had two years to file an action against “JOHN DOE/DOE 1” pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 335.1. On October 16, 2020, Defendant Organic Pastures Dairy Co. identified Defendant as the drive of the vehicle. (Mot., Chen Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. C.) On March 7, 2024, Plaintiff sought to name Defendant as Doe 1 via a fictitious name amendment, and on March 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed an amendment, seeking to substitute Defendant in placed of “JOHN DOE/DOE 1.” (Mot., Chen Decl. ¶¶ 6, Exs. D, E.)Assuming Plaintiff was ignorant of Defendant’s identity at the time the complaint was filed, it is clear from the above procedural history Plaintiff has been aware of Defendant’s identity since at least October 16, 2020. Plaintiff waited until March 7, 2024, to name Defendant in place of Doe 1. Plaintiff also had a deadline to serve Defendant within three years of the date of the original filing, or, January 17, 2023, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 583.210. If the Court were to allow Plaintiff three years to serve Defendant from the date she was aware of his identity, she still should have served him by October 16, 2023, but she did not do so.Plaintiff opposes the present motion on the grounds that Defendant made a general appearance in this case when he joined Defendant Organic Pastures Dairy Co. in serving a notice of taking Plaintiff’s deposition on May 5, 2021, with further discovery naming Defendant on several later dates (Opp’n, Behnam Decl. ¶¶ 5-10), and defense counsel represented to both Plaintiff and the Court that Defendant would file a responsive pleading and appear for deposition, thus estopping him from invoking Code of Civil Procedure section 583.210.Plaintiff argues that the three-year deadline set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 583.210 “does not apply if the defendant enters into a stipulation in writing or does another act that constitutes a general appearance in the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.220.) Plaintiff argues that propounding discovery constitutes a general appearance. (Creed v. Schultz (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 733, 739-740.) This is supported by case law; specifically, propounding discovery without challenging the Court’s jurisdiction constitutes a general appearance. (Factor Health Management v. Superior Court (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 246, 250.) A general appearance in the action within the statutory period for service of summons has the same effect as a valid service and filing proof of service, thereby preventing dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.210. (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.220.)Relying on Weatherby v. Van Diest (1991) 223 Cal.App.3d 506, Defendant argues that Plaintiff was still required to timely serve the amended complaint. This case is easily distinguishable, as the defendant in that case appeared three years and 46 days after the summons was issued, which did not relieve the plaintiff of the obligation to return the summons to the issuing court within three years and 60 days. (Id. at p. 508.) It is beyond dispute that Defendant’s general appearance occurred before the expiration of the three-year deadline, such that Code of Civil Procedure section 583.220 applies here. Thus, the Court need not address whether Defendant waived the ability to invoke Code of Civil Procedure section 583.220. For these reasons, Defendant Mike Cortez’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons and Complaint and/or to Dismiss for Non-Compliance with Code of Civil Procedure §§ 474, 583.210 et seq. is DENIED. Defendant Mike Cortez shall file a responsive pleading within 15 days of entry of this order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (b).)
