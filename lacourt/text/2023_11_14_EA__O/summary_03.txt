And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a defendant's motion to file an answer out of time. The defendant, Ortega, is the President and Chief Executive Officer of CU. The motion was untimely, as it was due by August 11, 2023, but was not served until August 21, 2023. The court is denying the motion on other grounds, and therefore, it is unnecessary to continue the motion for proper notice.

The court notes that the basis of the motion appears to be based on mistake or neglect, and subsection (b) of CCP section 1005 is applicable. The defendant attempted to file an answer on September 25, 2023, but was rejected by the court. An answer was also filed and received on October 20, 2023.

The court finds that the defendant is not unsophisticated, as he is the president of a company and obtained a $450,000 grant from the Commission. Therefore, the court is denying the motion and the answer filed on October 20, 2023 is deemed timely.
