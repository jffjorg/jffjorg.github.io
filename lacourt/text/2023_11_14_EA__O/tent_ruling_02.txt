 Case Number:  22PSCV01041    Hearing Date:   November 14, 2023    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
MOTION TO
SET ASIDE DEFAULT JUDGEMENT AND REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGEMENT AGAINST DEFENDANT
LARRY ORTEGA is DENIED. 
 
Background
 
This is a
complaint for recovery of administrative fines and penalties pursuant to public
utilities code. Plaintiff THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, by the
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION (“Plaintiff” or “Commission”) alleges
the following against Defendants COMMUNITY UNION, INC. (“CU”) and LARRY ORTEGA[1]:
The Commission initiated an investigation to determine whether Defendant CU
implemented the California’s One Million New Internet Users Coalition program
in accordance with the terms of approval granted by the Commission. In 2021,
the Commission issued its decision finding that CU was in violation and ordered
that CU return the $162,109 it unlawfully received and held Ortega personally
liable (pierced the corporate veil). 
 
On September
13, 2022, Plaintiff filed the instant suit.
 
On December
14, 2022, Plaintiff filed a POS indicating that CU had been served via the
Secretary of State. 
 
On January
27, 2023, default was entered against CU.
 
On February
28, 2023, the court issued the following minute order regarding the CMC and OSC
re: Failure to File POS: Defendant Larry Ortega/Community Union appears and is
self-represented. Plaintiff requests to continue the instant matters to April
27, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. for proper notice and for Mr. Ortega to seek counsel;
request is granted. Pursuant to the request of plaintiff, the Case Management
Conference scheduled for 02/28/2023, and Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to
File Proof of Service scheduled for 02/28/2023 are continued to 04/27/2023 at
08:30 AM in Department L at Pomona Courthouse South ; Plaintiff is to provide
notice.
 
On March
1, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a POS by First-Class Mail (POS-030) form indicating the Ortega had been
served via mail. Additionally, the POS (POS-010) form indicates that Ortega was
served via his “voluntary appearance at the CMC on February 28, 2023,”
citing to CCP section 410.050.[2] 
 
On April 7,
2023, default was entered against Ortega. 
 
On April 24,
2023, Ortega filed a ‘Motion to Continue to June 27, 2023.’ A review of the
motion indicates that Ortega sought to move an April 27, 2023 hearing because
of medical concerns (he had an angiogram).
 
On April 25,
2023, the court issued the following minute order regarding ‘Defendant Ortega's
Request for Continuance’: The Court is in receipt of Defendant Ortega’s
ex-parte request dated April 24, 2023, purportedly on behalf of himself and
defendant Community Union, Inc., to continue the April 27, 2023, Case
Management Conference. The Court declines to consider this document as it is
improperly before the Court for two separate reasons. First, both defendant
Ortega and defendant Community Union, Inc. are in default status. Neither
defendant Ortega nor defendant Community Union, Inc., may participate in the
matter unless and until that default status is cured by the Court upon written
motion by a party. Second, defendant Ortega is not a licensed attorney, so he
is not permitted to represent defendant Community Union, Inc., in the case
under any circumstances. As a result of the default status, the court sets an
Order to Show Cause re: Default Judgment for June 27, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. Clerk
to give notice as well as a courtesy copy to defendant Ortega. The case
management conference currently set for April 27, 2023, remains on calendar.
 
On May 9,
2023, the court clerk entered a clerk’s judgment (CCP section 585a) for
$162,109.00 against both CU and Ortega.
 
On June 7,
2023, Plaintiff filed an Abstract of Judgment (EJ-001) form. 
 
On August 21,
2023, Ortega filed the instant ‘MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT JUDGEMENT AND
REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGEMENT AGAINST DEFENDANT LARRY ORTEGA.’[3]
 
On August 28,
2023, Plaintiff filed its opposition to the motion.
On September
11, 2023, during the hearing on the motion to set aside the default, the court
continued the hearing. According to the minute order, “On the Court's own
motion, the Hearing on Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Default and Default Judgment
(CCP 473.5) scheduled for 09/11/2023 is continued to 11/14/2023 at 10:00 AM in
Department O at Pomona Courthouse South. The Defendant is ordered to file
supplemental briefing due on or before September 21, 2023. The Court notes it
will continue to accept opposition and replies.”
 
On September
28, 2023, Defendant filed his amended motion. 
 
On October
31, 2023, Plaintiff filed its opposition. 
 
On November
7, 2023, Defendant filed his reply. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
Ortega makes
the motion pursuant to CCP section 473 (a)(1), (b) and (d) on the grounds of
mistake, inadvertence and excusable neglect. (Motion p. 1.)[4] 
 
CCP section
473 subdivision (b) allows a court to vacate a prior order upon a showing that
the order was entered due to a party’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. Additionally, the motion “shall be made within a reasonable
time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.” (Code Civ. Proc.,¿§ 473, subd. (b).)¿The terms mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, and excusable neglect which warrant relief under Code
of Civil Procedure § 473(b) are defined as follows:  
 
Mistake is
not a ground for relief under section 473, subdivision (b), when ‘the court
finds that the “mistake” is simply the result of professional incompetence,
general ignorance of the law, or unjustifiable negligence in discovering the
law ....’ [Citation] Further, ‘[t]he term “surprise,” as used in section 473, refers to “some
condition or situation in which a party ... is unexpectedly placed to his
injury, without any default or negligence of his own, which ordinary prudence
could not have guarded against.” [Citation] Finally, as for inadvertence or
neglect, ‘[t]o warrant relief under section 473 a litigant's neglect must have
been such as might have been the act of a reasonably prudent person under
the same circumstances. The inadvertence contemplated by the statute does
not mean mere inadvertence in the abstract. If it is wholly inexcusable it does
not justify relief.’ [Citation]

v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 215, 229-230)
(emphasis added). 
 
Discussion
 
The court adheres to its original ruling for the
following reasons. 
 
First, as
noted by Plaintiff in opposition, Defendant filed his supplemental declaration
about one week after the court’s deadline. In untimely filing his amended
motion/supplemental brief, that further evidences that Defendant chose not to
timely file his answer. What is more, Defendant explains the untimely
supplemental brief was “due a series of physical and technical hurdles he was
unable to get this filed on time.” (Reply p. 2.) The lack of an
explanation/details (e.g., the court system would not allow him to upload the
supplemental brief) is but another theme that impaired his original motion (see
discussion below).  
 
Second, even
addressing the merits,[5] it
again fails to provide an explanation as to why Defendant could file an answer.
If anything, as noted by Plaintiff in opposition, the narrative has changed:
instead of experiencing health problems in March, Defendant experienced health
problems in January.  
 
All in all,
though mindful of the public policy strongly favors granting relief, the
evidence/declarations and arguments, when read in their totality, draw into
question the credibility and veracity of Defendant, indicating that Defendant
knew he was to file an answer and he could have filed an answer, but chose not
to timely file an answer.[6]
(See Hodge Sheet Metal Products v. Palm Springs Riviera Hotel (1961) 189
Cal.App.2d 653, 658 [“The weighing of the veracity of the affidavit was in the
province of the trial court.”].)
 
Therefore,
the court DENIES the motion.
 
September
11, 2023 Tentative Ruling 
 
While
slightly unclear, the premise of the motion appears to be that Ortega
“erroneously presumed that [his] time to file an answer to the request for
default judgment would run 90 days from date of Notice, February 28, 2023” and
that he “inadvertently failed to ask the court to extend the time I had to
Answer Plaintiff’s Complaint during the February 28, 2023 Hearing.” (Motion p.
3.) 
 
The motion
fails for a few reasons, all of which are noted by Plaintiff in opposition. 
 
First, to the
extent that Ortega presumed he had 90 days to file an answer upon service of
the summons and complaint (or after court retained jurisdiction at the February
28, 2023 CMC), Ortega has not explained why not knowing when to file an answer
constitutes as excusable neglect. Though Plaintiff is pro-per, a pro per litigant is treated
like any other party and is entitled to the same, but no greater consideration
than other litigants and attorneys. (See, e.g., Nwosu v. Uba (2004) 122
Cal.App.4th 1229, 1246-47.)[7] 
 
Second, to
the extent that Ortega could not file his answer within 30 days of service of
the summons and complaint/court retaining personal jurisdiction because of
health challenges—which were undeniably serious as he experienced a heart
attack—Ortega has not explained why he could not file his answer within 30 days
when his chest pain did not commence until March 28, 2023 and he went to the
emergency room on April 21, 2023; thirty days from February 28, 2023 is Mach
30, 2023, which is well before he went to the emergency room. (See April 24,
2023 Motion to Continue to June 27, 2023.) 
 
Third, even
using its discretion afforded by CCP section 473 subdivision (b), the court
would deny the motion because setting aside the judgment would merely forestall
the inevitable in a simple judgment enforcement action which there are no
defenses. Plaintiff would or could move for judgment by way of a motion (e.g.,
summary judgment or judgment on the pleadings), which would unnecessarily
expend resources. 
 
Lastly, to
the extent that Ortega attempts to set aside the default judgment against CU as
well, there are two problems: (i) the motion is only made on behalf of Ortega
in his individual capacity and (ii) CU requires formal representation. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing—notably as an answer was due at the latest by March 30, 2023 and
Ortega did not do so and has failed to offer a reason why—the motion is denied.
