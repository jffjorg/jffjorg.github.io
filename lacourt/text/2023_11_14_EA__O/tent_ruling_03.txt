[1] Ortega is the President and Chief Executive Officer
of CU. He is pro per. 


[2] According to the statute, “A general appearance by a party
is equivalent to personal service of summons on such party.”
 


[3] As noted by Plaintiff in opposition, notice of the
motion was untimely as it was due, pursuant to CCP section 1005(b) by August
11, 2023, but notice of the motion was not served until August 21, 2023. As the
court is denying the motion on other grounds, continuing the motion for proper
notice is unnecessary. 


[4] Subsection (a)(1) is inapplicable because while it
does allow a court to allow for an answer after the time limited the code, the
section does not apply when a defendant is in default. Additionally, subsection
(d) d inapplicable because it pertains to correct clerical mistakes. As
clerical mistakes are not at issue, this subsection will not be discussed.
Thus, as the basis of the motion appears to be based upon mistake/neglect, only
subsection (b) will be discussed. 
 


[5] Defendant’s declaration attached to the motion is
dated to September 21, 2023, which is the date that the brief was due by. 
 


[6] Defendant attempted to file an answer on September
25, 2023 but was rejected by the court. An answer was also filed and received
on October 20, 2023. 
 


[7] And as observed by Plaintiff, Ortega is not
unsophisticated as he is the president of a company and obtained a $450,000
grant from the Commission.
