Background
These consolidated cases arise from
an airplane accident occurring on October 13, 2020.
 
On June 7, 2022, Kiryl Milkhalkevich
and Alexander Moryakov (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against
Michael Hallow, Amazing Concepts, LLC, AVFUEL Corporation, Gryphon Aircraft
Services, LLC, Titus Lindstrom, Burbank Air Services, Inc. and Does 1 through
50, asserting causes of action for (1) negligence, (2) strict products
liability, and (3) negligent products liability (breach of warranty).
 
On July 14, 2022, Michael Halow and Amazing
Concepts, LLC filed a complaint against AVFUEL Corporation, Gryphon Aircraft
Services, LLC, Titus Lindstrom, Burbank Air Services, Inc. and Does 1 through
50, asserting causes of action for (1) negligence, (2) strict products
liability, and (3) negligent products liability (breach of warranty).
 
The two cases were related on
September 27, 2023, and consolidated on November 9, 2023.
 
As is relevant to the matters set for
hearing on May 8, 2024, Defendant Gryphon Aircraft Services, LLC (“Gryphon”)
served Plaintiffs Kiryl Milkhalkevich (“Milkhalkevich”) and Alexander Moryakov (“Moryakov”)
with Requests for Production (Set Two) on January 26, 2024.  (Hembree Decls., ¶ 4 & Exh. A.)  On the day that the responses were due, Plaintiffs
requested a two-week extension to respond. 
(Id., ¶ 5.)  Gryphon denied
that request.  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff did not serve responses.  (Ibid.)  
 
On March 4, 2024, Gryphon filed these
two motions to compel responses to the document requests.  Grypon also seeks sanctions.  
 
The next day, on March 5, Plaintiffs
served verified responses.  (Runia Decls.,
¶ 6 & Exhs. B.)  On or about April 2,
Plaintiffs provided further responses.  (Id.,
¶ 7 & Exhs. C.)
 
Plaintiffs filed oppositions to these
motions on April 24, along with their own requests for sanctions.  
 
Gryphon filed replies on May 1.
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) 

In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides that “[t]o the extent
authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any
other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected party,
person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose … a monetary
sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process …
pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion
In this motion, Gryphon seeks a court
order compelling Plaintiffs Milkhalkevich and Moryakov to provide initial
written responses to requests for production pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.300.  As of the
time the motions were filed, the responses were overdue and had not been
provided.  (Hembree
Decls., ¶¶ 4-5.) 
 
After the motion was filed, Plaintiffs
Milkhalkevich and Moryakov provided initial responses.  Accordingly, the motion to compel initial
responses is moot.
 
If Gryphon contends that the
responses assert waived objections or are otherwise not code compliant, Gryphon
may (after following all procedural requirements) bring a motion to compel
further responses under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310.
 
If Plaintiffs contend that they
should be relieved from waiving objections, they may seek such relief through a
noticed motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a).)
 
Gryphon’s
request for sanctions is denied.  The
motion to compel is denied as moot, and therefore Plaintiffs have not unsuccessfully
opposed the motion, as is required for an award of sanctions under the
applicable code provision.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
Plaintiffs’ request for sanctions is
denied.  The Court finds that Gryphon has
acted with substantial justification.
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES the motions to compel as moot.
 
The
Court DENIES both sides’ requests for sanctions.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to
give notice.
