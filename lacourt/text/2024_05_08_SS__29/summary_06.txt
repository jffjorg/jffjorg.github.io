And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the motions to compel responses to requests for production, as the responses have been provided after the motions were filed.

The motions to compel were filed by Gryphon Aircraft Services, LLC, and the Court finds that the motions are moot. The Court orders that the moving party give notice.
