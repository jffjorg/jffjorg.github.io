  Case Number:  21STCV00422    Hearing Date:   May 8, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion
to Set Aside Default Judgment and for Leave to File Answer filed by Defendant
Maciel Luna 
 
Tentative
 
The
motion is granted.
 
Background 
 
This action arises from a motor vehicle collision that
occurred on March 1, 2019. On January 6, 2021, Plaintiff Kelly Anna Klein
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant Maciel Luna (“Defendant”)
alleging causes of action for motor vehicle and general negligence. 
 
On April 9, 2021, Plaintiff filed a proof of service of
summons (the “2021 Proof of Service”) which indicates that Defendant was
personally served with the summons and complaint by personal service on April
5, 2021, at 7923 Cleon Ave., Sun Valley, CA 91352. The 2021 Proof of Service is
executed by a registered process server named Antoine Mitchell. According to
the 2021 Proof of Service, the person served with the summons and complaint was
a Hispanic female who 30 years old, approximately 140 pounds, and has brown
hair. 
 
On February 15, 2022, Plaintiff requested entry of
default against Defendant; however, such request was rejected because of, among
other issues, the lack of a served statement of damages. The Clerk’s office requested
that Plaintiff send an amended proof of service and a new request for entry of
default. 
 
On March 3, 2022, Plaintiff filed and served a proof of
service which states that a statement of damages was served on Defendant via
Vianey Luna by substituted service. The proof of service concerning the
statement of damages (the “2022 Proof of Service”) is executed by a registered
process server named Jim Sands. According to the 2022 Proof of Service, the
statement of damages was served on Defendant—by leaving such document with
co-occupant Vianey Luna—on February 28, 2022, at 7923 Cleon Ave., Sun Valley,
CA 91352. Vianey Luna is described as a Hispanic female who is 40 years old,
170 pounds, 5”4 in height, and has brown hair. 
 
On March 18, 2022, the Court entered default against
Defendant. 
 
On October 21, 2022, the Court entered default judgment
against Defendant in the amount of $105,868.52. 
 
On February 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed and served notice
of entry of judgment. 
 
On May 5, 2023, Defendant filed and served the instant
Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment and for Leave to File an Answer.  Plaintiff filed an opposition on March 21,
2024. On March 27, 2024, Defendant filed a reply brief. 
 
Legal
Standard 
“The court may set aside a void default judgment at any time under
section 473, subdivision (d).” (Rodriguez
v. Cho (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th
742, 749.) “In addition, the court has inherent equitable power to set aside a
default judgment at any time for extrinsic fraud or mistake.” (Ibid.) “The court may grant relief under its inherent
equity power if, because of the fraud of his opponent, the aggrieved party was prevented
from presenting his claim or defense to the court.” (Id. at p. 750, citations omitted.) “Fraud is
intrinsic and not a valid ground for setting aside a judgment when the party
has been given notice of the action and has had an opportunity to present his
case and to protect himself from any mistake or fraud of his adversary, but has
unreasonably neglected to do so.” (Ibid.) A party seeking equitable relief on the grounds
of extrinsic fraud or mistake must show the following three elements: (1) a
meritorious defense; (2) a satisfactory excuse for not presenting the defense
in the first place; and (3) diligence in seeking to set aside the default
judgment once discovered. (Ibid.) Extrinsic mistake “is not so much the fraud or
other misconduct of one of the parties as it is the excusable neglect of the
defaulting party to appear and present his claim or defense. If that neglect
results in an unjust judgment, without a fair adversary hearing, the basis for
equitable relief on the ground of extrinsic mistake is present.” (Mechling v. Asbestos Defendants
(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 1241, 1246.) “When a
default judgment has been obtained, equitable relief may be given
only in exceptional circumstances.” (Ibid., emphasis in original.) 
“When evaluating a motion to set aside a default judgment on equitable
grounds, the court must weigh the reasonableness of the conduct of the moving
party in light of the extent of the prejudice to the responding party.” (Lasalle v. Vogel (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 127, 139, internal quotations
omitted.) Where there is lack of prejudice to the opposing party, such factor
weighs in favor of setting aside default and default judgment. (Gray v. Lawlor (1907) 151 Cal. 352, 357.) 
“When service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice to a party
in time to defend the action and a default or default judgment has been entered
against him or her in the action, he or she may file a notice of motion to set
aside the default or default judgment and for leave to defend the action.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).) “The notice of motion shall be served
and filed within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the earlier of:
(i) two years after entry of a default judgment against him or her; or (ii) 180
days after service on him or her of a written notice that the default or default
judgment has been entered.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).) “A defendant
seeking to set aside a default or default judgment under section 473.5 must
show, by affidavit, that his or her lack of actual notice in time to defend the
action was not caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable
neglect.” (Shapell Socal
Rental Properties, LLC v. Chico’s FAS, Inc. (2022) 85 Cal.App.5th 198, 212.) 
 “[T]he filing of a proof of
service creates a rebuttable presumption that . . . service was proper.” (Dill
v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1441.) “[A]
registered process server’s declaration establishes a presumption affecting the
burden of producing evidence of the facts stated in the declaration.” (American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390.) “[A]
registered process server’s declaration of service establishes a presumption
that the facts stated in the declaration are true.” (Rodriguez v. Cho (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 742, 750.) 
“It is well settled that appellate courts have always been and are
favorably disposed toward such action upon the part of the trial courts as will
permit, rather than prevent, the adjudication of legal controversies upon their
merits.” (Benjamin v. Dalmo Mfg. Co. (1948) 31 Cal.2d 523, 525.) “[T]he
law strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits, [and] any doubts in
applying section 473 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from
default.” (Shapell Socal
Rental Properties, LLC v. Chico’s FAS, Inc., supra, 85 Cal.App.5th 198, 212.) “An order denying relief
is therefore scrutinized more carefully than an order granting relief and
permitting trial on the merits.” (Id. at p. 213.) “[T]he provisions of section 473 . .
. are to be liberally construed and sound policy favors the determination of
actions on their merits.” (Id. at p. 212, citation and internal quotations
omitted.) 
Discussion              
 
The Court has considered all of
the evidence in the record and the argument of both sides.  The declaration from a registered process
server creates a presumption of proper service, but the presumption is
rebuttable.  Here, the Court finds that
Defendant has rebutted the presumption. 
The Court recognizes that it is “not required to accept ... self-serving
evidence contradicting the process server’s declaration.” (Rodriguez v. Cho,
supra, 236 Cal.App.4th 742, 751.)  Nonetheless, the Court finds the written
testimony of Defendant and her sister to be credible and accepts it.
 
The Court finds that Defendant
was not properly served with the summons and complaint.  Accordingly, the default and default judgment
entered by the Court are void and are set aside.

The Court SETS ASIDE the entry of
default filed on March 18, 2022.
