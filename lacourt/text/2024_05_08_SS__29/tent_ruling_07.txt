 Case Number:  22STCV26628    Hearing Date:   May 8, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Contest Application for Determination
of Good Faith Settlement filed by Cross-Defendant and Cross-Complainant 8601
Balboa, LLC.
 
Tentative
 
The motion is denied.
 
The Court determines that the settlement is in
good faith under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6.
 
Background
On August 17, 2022, Patricia
Parsons (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against City of Los Angeles (“City”) and
Does 1 through 50 for damages based on a dangerous condition of public property
arising out of a fall on January 19, 2022 on uneven concrete on a sidewalk at
or near 8601 Balboa Boulevard in Los Angeles.
 
On December 9, 2022, City filed
its answer to the complaint and a cross-complaint against Roes 1 through 20. On
October 19, 2023, City amended the cross-complaint to name 8601 Balboa LLC (“Balboa”)
as Roe 1.
 
On February 1, 2024, Plaintiff
amended her complaint to name Balboa as Doe 1.
 
Also on February 1, 2024, Balboa
filed its answer to the cross-complaint and its own cross-complaint against City
and Roes 1 through 50. 
 
On April 16, 2024, City filed its
answer to Balboa’s cross-complaint.
 
On February 1, 2024, Balboa filed
a cross-complaint against Defendant for equitable indemnity, declaratory
relief, and contribution. Balboa also filed an answer to Defendant’s
cross-complaint. Balboa has not yet filed an answer to Plaintiff’s complaint.
 
On April 16, 2024, Defendant
filed an answer to cross-complaint. 
 
As is relevant to the matter on
calendar for May 8, 2024, City has entered into a settlement agreement with
Plaintiff. City filed an application for determination of good faith settlement
on February 14. 
 
On March 8, 2024, Balboa filed a
document labeled as an “opposition” to City’s application. No motion was filed
and no hearing date was set.
 
On March 19, Balboa filed this
motion to contest the application for determination of good faith settlement. On
April 11, City filed its opposition. On April 17, Balboa filed its reply. 
 
The hearing was initially set for
April 24 and was continued, on the Court’s own motion, to May 8.
 
Legal Standard
In a case involving two or more alleged joint
tortfeasors, a party may seek a court order under Code of Civil Procedure
section 877.6 determining that a settlement between the plaintiff and one or
more of the alleged tortfeasors is in good faith. A judicial determination of
good faith “bar[s] any other joint tortfeasor … from any further claims against
the settling tortfeasor … for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or
comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 877.6, subd. (c).)
In evaluating whether a settlement has been
made in good faith, courts consider the following factors, as set forth by the
California Supreme Court in the landmark case Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d
488: 
              1) “a rough approximation of
plaintiffs’ total recovery”;
              2) “the settlor’s proportionate
liability”;
              3)
“the amount paid in settlement”;
     
4) “the allocation of the settlement proceeds among plaintiffs”;
5) “a recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement
than he would if he were found liable after a trial”;
              6) the settling party's “financial
conditions and insurance policy limits”;
7) any evidence of “collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to
injure the interests of nonsettling defendants.”
(Id. at p. 499.) “Practical
considerations obviously require that the evaluation be made on the basis of
information available at the time of settlement.” (Ibid.)
The “good faith” concept in Code of Civil
Procedure section 877.6 is a flexible principle imposing on reviewing courts
the obligation to guard against the numerous ways in which the interests of
nonsettling defendants may be unfairly prejudiced. (Rankin v. Curtis
(1986) 183 Cal. App. 3d 939, 945.) Accordingly, under Tech-Bilt, the party asserting the lack of “good faith” may meet
this burden by demonstrating that the settlement is so far "out of the
ballpark" as to be inconsistent with the equitable objectives of the
statute. (Tech-Bilt, supra, 38 Cal.3d at 499-500.) Such a demonstration
would establish that the proposed settlement was not a “settlement made in good
faith” within the terms of section 877.6. (Ibid.) 
The Supreme Court explained that Code of
Civil Procedure section 877.6 is designed to further two equitable policies: 
1)
encouragement of settlements; and 
2) equitable
allocation of costs among joint tortfeasors. 

(Ibid.)  
Those policies would not be served by an
approach which emphasizes one to the virtual exclusion of the other. (Ibid.)
Accordingly, a settlement will not be found in good faith unless the amount is
reasonable in light of the settling tortfeasor's proportionate share of
liability. (Std. Pac. of San Diego v. A. A. Baxter Corp. (1986) 176 Cal.
App. 3d 577, 589.) Or, as the California Supreme Court has stated, a
“defendant’s settlement figure must not be grossly disproportionate to what a
reasonable person, at the time of the settlement, would estimate the settling
defendant’s liability to be.” (Tech-Bilt, supra, 38 Cal.3d at 499.)
When a motion seeking a determination under
Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 is not opposed, the burden on the moving
parties to show that the settlement was made in good faith is slight. (City
of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261
[holding that a “barebones motion” including a declaration setting forth “a
brief background of the case is sufficient”].) 
When a good faith motion is contested,
however, the moving parties have the initial burden of producing evidence in
support of the requested good faith determination. (Id. at pp. 1261-1262.)
“Section 877.6 and Tech-Bilt require an evidentiary showing, through expert
declarations or other means, that the proposed settlement is within the
reasonable range permitted by the criterion of good faith.” (Mattco Forge v.
Arthur Young & Co. (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1351.) “Substantial
evidence” is required. (Id. at p. 1352.) A declaration from a settling
defendant’s attorney that states, in conclusory fashion, that the client has little,
or no share of the liability may not be sufficient. (Greshko v. County of
Los Angeles (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 822, 834-35; see also 3 Weil & Brown,
California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023)
¶¶ 12:774, 12:872-873.)  
The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the
party opposing the good faith determination. 
The “party asserting a lack of good faith shall have the burden of proof
on that issue.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §
877.6(d); see also 3 Weil & Brown, supra, at ¶ 12:875.) 
Preliminary Issue
Although
Balboa’s motion was filed after the 25-day period set forth in Code of Civil
Procedure section 877.6, Balboa did file an “opposition” to City’s application on
March 8, 2024, within the 25-day period. Balboa should have filed a motion, rather
than a mere “opposition,” but the opposition gave the City timely notice of
Balboa’s contentions.  The Court will not
preclude Balboa from being heard based upon the mislabeling of the Court document
filed on March 8.
 
Discussion
City has
agreed to pay Plaintiff $50,000.00 in exchange for a full release of all claims
against Defendant. (Dishchyan Decl., ¶ 7 & Exh. 1.) Balboa challenges the
good faith of this settlement. To evaluate this challenge, the Court turns to a
consideration of each of the Tech-Bilt factors.
 
(1) Rough
approximation of Plaintiff’s total recovery 
 
Balboa states
that Plaintiff claims that her damages equal or exceed $100,000. (McKenzie
Decl., ¶ 4.) City does not argue otherwise. The Court finds, on this record,
that a rough approximation of Plaintiff’s total recovery is approximately $100,000.  
(2) The
settlor’s proportionate liability 
 
There is a
significant dispute regarding this factor. Balboa argues that, as an owner of abutting
property, it had no duty to pedestrians injured as a result of defects in the
sidewalk; this is the so-called Sidewalk Accident Doctrine. (E.g., Jordan v.
City of Sacramento (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1487, 1490.) But even under the
Sidewalk Accident Doctrine, the property owner may be liable if the owner created
the defect or exercised dominion or control over the abutting sidewalk. (Lopez
v. City of Los Angeles (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 244, 255-256.) And here, there
is at least some evidence that the defect may have been caused by the roots of
a tree on Balboa’s property.
Balboa argues
that City is more than 50 percent responsible for Plaintiff’s injuries. That issue,
of course, has not been adjudicated. The Court notes that Plaintiff served
settlement demands on both City and Balboa in the identical amount of $50,000. (McKenzie
Decl., ¶ 4.)  This indicates that Plaintiff
may believe that each defendant is responsible in an approximately equal
amount.
(3) The amount
paid in settlement. 
 
The
agreement requires Defendant to pay Plaintiff $50,000. 
 
(4) The
allocation of the settlement proceeds among plaintiffs. 
 
As there is
only one plaintiff, this factor does not apply here. 
 
(5) A recognition
that a settlor should pay less in settlement than she would if she were found
liable after a trial. 
 
This factor
supports the request for a good faith determination. 
 
(6) The
settling party’s financial conditions and insurance policy limits. 
 
This was not
raised by either City or Balboa. This is not a situation in which a party
argues that its limited financial means supports a good faith determination.
 
(7) Any
evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests
of nonsettling defendants. 
 
The Court
has considered the evidence and argument of Balboa and finds that there is no
evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct. There are two potentially
liable parties, and Plaintiff made a settlement demand to both. City agreed,
and Balboa did not. The Court does not find evidence of collusion by the
settling parties.
 
Summary
 
The Court
has carefully considered the evidence and the argument presented by both sides.
The Court finds that Defendant has met its initial burden of producing evidence
to support the good faith determination. Further, the Court finds Balboa has
not met its ultimate burden of persuasion as to the good faith determination. Even
if, as Balboa contends, City’s proportionate share of liability is more than 50
percent, the Court finds, taking into account all of the Tech-Bilt
factors, that as of the time of the settlement, the agreement of City to pay $50,000.00
in exchange for a release and dismissal was in good faith under Code of Civil
Procedure section 877.6.
 
Accordingly,
the motion to contest is denied.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES Balboa’s Motion to Contest the Application
for Determination of Good Faith Settlement.
 
The Court CONCLUDES that the settlement between Plaintiff and City
is in good faith under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6
 
City is
ordered to give notice.
