MOTION
            Plaintiff
Marcos Soto Mendoza (“Plaintiff”) sued Defendant Otonel Montano (“Defendant”) for
habitability violations.  Defendant demurs
to Plaintiffs’ complaint.  Plaintiff
opposes the motion.
ANALYSIS
“It is black
letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  In ruling on a demurrer, the court must “liberally construe[]” the
allegations of the complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.)  “This rule of liberal construction means that
the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the
defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.) 
Defendant argues Plaintiff’s
complaint is uncertain.  Defendant’s primary
focus is on Plaintiff’s allegations concerning Defendant’s alleged breach of the
warranty of habitability.  Defendant’s
contentions are not well-taken.  
Plaintiff alleges the
unit Defendant rented to Plaintiff was uninhabitable in several ways.  (See e.g., Complaint, ¶ 9.)  Further, a demurrer based on uncertainty “is
strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain,
because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.”  (Khoury v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616 (Khoury); see also Mahan v. Charles W. Chan
Insurance Agency, Inc. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 841, 848 fn. 3 [“‘demurrers
for uncertainty are disfavored, and are granted only if the pleading is so
incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond”’].)  For pleading purposes, Plaintiff’s allegations
suffice.  Defendant may obtain further
information regarding Plaintiff’s claims through discovery.  (Khoury, supra, 14 Cal.App.4th
at p.616.)  
The demurrer is
overruled. 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint
is overruled.  Defendant is to serve and
file an answer to the complaint within 10 days. 
Defendant is also ordered to provide notice
of this order and to file proof of service of same.
