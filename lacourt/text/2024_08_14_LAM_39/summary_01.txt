And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Otonel Montano, to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Marcos Soto Mendoza. The plaintiff is suing the defendant for habitability violations. The defendant argues that the complaint is uncertain and lacks sufficient allegations to support the claims. However, the judge finds that the complaint alleges that the defendant's rented unit was uninhabitable in several ways, and that the defendant's contentions are not well-taken. The judge also notes that demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored and are granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond.

As a result, the judge has overruled the demurrer and is ordering the defendant to serve and file an answer to the complaint within 10 days. The defendant is also ordered to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
