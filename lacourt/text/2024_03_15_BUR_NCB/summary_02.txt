**Summary:**

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the plaintiff, Panos Paul Simonian, is seeking the appointment of a neutral appraisal umpire to resolve a dispute with the defendant, Mercury Insurance Company, over the valuation of his vehicle. The defendant had previously appointed Lance Coren as the appraisal umpire, but the plaintiff moved to disqualify him after receiving a notice of disqualification from the defendant. The judge granted the motion and appointed Daryl Johnson as the new appraisal umpire. The judge also noted that the defendant's proposed umpires were not qualified in vehicle appraisal matters and were not appropriate for the case.
