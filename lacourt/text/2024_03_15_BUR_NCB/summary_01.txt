And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendants Paul Baskaron and St. Paul Trading, LLC to the cross-complaint filed by Andrew Mekhail. The judge has sustained the demurrer on the ground that the Riverside Action, which was filed earlier, involves the same parties and similar facts, and therefore has a res judicata effect on the cross-complaint. The judge has also ruled that Andrew Mekhail is an indispensable party to the cross-complaint, but this is not a sufficient ground to sustain the demurrer. The judge has dismissed the cross-complaint with prejudice. The motion to strike the cross-complaint is taken off-calendar as moot.
