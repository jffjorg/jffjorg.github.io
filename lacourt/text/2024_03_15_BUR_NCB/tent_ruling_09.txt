 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
demurrer
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations

Plaintiff RRRM
Holding Company, LLC (“Plaintiff”) alleges that it is entitled to possession of
7139 Foothill Boulevard, Tujunga, CA 91042 as the owner of the real
property.  Plaintiff alleges that on
April 27, 2002, Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant
Vigan Sardariani (“Defendant”). 
Plaintiff alleges that the lease expired and became a month-to-month
tenancy effective May 1, 2012.  Plaintiff
alleges that since September 30, 2023, rent was due and owing in the amount of
$121,000.  
The first
amended complaint (“FAC”), filed February 20, 2024, allege causes of action
for: (1) non-payment of rent; and (2) failure to vacate after termination of
tenancy. 
On February 2,
2024, the default of All Tenants, Subtenants, Named Claimants and Other
Occupants was entered.  
B.     Motion
on Calendar 
On
February 26, 2024, Defendant filed a demurrer to the FAC.  
On
March 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition brief. 
DISCUSSION 
            Defendant
demurs to the FAC on the ground that it is uncertain at paragraph 2; the 1st
cause of action is uncertain as to paragraphs 6 and 7; and the 1st
cause of action fails to state sufficient facts to state a cause of action. 
            First,
Defendant argues that the 1st cause of action fails to allege
sufficient facts for a breach of contract cause of action.  In the FAC, Plaintiff alleges that on April
27, 2002, Plaintiff’s predecessor in interest, Roland Markarian, entered into a
lease agreement with Defendant and cites to Exhibit 3.  (FAC, ¶2.) 
Plaintiff alleges that it has attached a copy of the rental agreement
with any addendums/attachments in its possession.  (Id.) 
Exhibit 3 is not identified in the FAC as an attachment.  However, if the Court looks at the “Exhibit 2”
stamped documents, there are additional documents with exhibits that that are
entitled Exhibit 1.2 (page 2 of 10), Exhibit 1.3 (page 3 of 10), Exhibit 1.7
(page 7 of 10), Exhibit 1.10 (page 10 of 10), Exhibit 1.6 (page 6 of 10),
Exhibit 9 (page 9 of 10), and Exhibit 1.5 (page 5 of 10).  The Court will consider these as the “Exhibit
3” documents.  While the rental agreement
document is not fully complete, Plaintiff has at least alleged the terms of the
rental payments to put Defendant on notice of the particular contract term at
issue in this action.  Considering
Plaintiff’s allegations in the FAC, together with the pages of the lease
agreement, Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts regarding the terms of the
agreement.  Obtaining a full copy of the
lease and any attachments/amendments thereto is better left for the discovery
stage.  The demurrer will be overruled on
this basis.  
            Second,
Defendant argues that the FAC is uncertain because Plaintiff has only attached
a part of the contract, but has omitted pages 4, 8, and 9, which makes the
agreement incomplete.  Defendant argues
that paragraph 6 is uncertain because it incorporates the prior allegations (including
paragraph 2).  However, as discussed
above, the Court will overrule the demurrer on this basis. 
            Defendant
also argues that paragraph 7 is uncertain. 
Paragraph 7 alleges that the sum of $121,000 in rent was due and owing
as of September 30, 2023.  Defendant
argues that the notice to pay rent or quit attached to the complaint is dated
September 28, 2023 and does not reference a September 30, 2023 date.  The Court notes that in its prior order on
the demurrer to the initial complaint, the complaint had alleged that Plaintiff
was seeking rent up until October 1, 2023, which would begin a new month of
rent that would be due.  The Court stated
that if Plaintiff was only seeking rental payments up until September 30, 2023
(and not a new rental period starting on October 1, 2023), then Plaintiff
should correct and clarify this in the complaint’s allegations as seeking
October 2023 rent was improper.  
            Here,
Plaintiff has amended the complaint to seek rent for the entire month of
September 2023.  Although the notice was
signed on September 28, 2023, the alleged default of the lease terms occurred
on September 1, 2023, the time when the rent was due.  The September 1, 2023 rental payment would
have covered the month of September (which is September 1 to 30, 2023). Thus,
the Court will allow the allegations to stand. 
The demurrer on this basis is overruled. 

CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            Defendant
Vigan Sardariani’s demurrer to the first amended complaint is overruled.  Defendant is ordered to answer. 
Defendant shall give notice of
this order.
