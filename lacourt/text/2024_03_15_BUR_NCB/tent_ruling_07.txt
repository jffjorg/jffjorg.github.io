[1] To dispel
confusion, there appears to be 2 deposition notices that are relevant.
Plaintiff served
an Amended Notice of Taking Deposition of Defendant Walgreen Co.’s PMQ re
Walgreens Store #9491 with 21 deposition categories and 21 RPDs. (Opp., Ex.
C.)  
Plaintiff also
served a Notice of Taking Deposition of Defendant Walgreen Co.’s PMQ with 17
deposition categories and 22 RPDs (Nos. 1-14, 25, 26, another 26, and
27-31).  (Opp., Ex. D.)  
According to the
deposition transcript, Martinez testified that she was the PMQ for the Category
Nos. 1-21.  (See Mot. at Ex. 4 and Opp.
at Ex. C [Amended Deposition Notice of Def.’s PMQ re Walgreens Store #9491];
Mot., Ex. 9 [1/9/24 Deposition Transcript].) 
However, it does not appear that the Amended Deposition Notice regarding
Store #9491 is at issue in the motion as the separate statement only includes
16 categories of deposition topics.  This
motion and the separate statement appear to be directed to the Notice of Taking
Deposition of Defendant Walgreen Co.’s PMQ (not specific to Store #9491).  (See Mot., Ex. 8; Opp., Ex. D.)
