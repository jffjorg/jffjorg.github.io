[1] Defendant argues
that Daryl Johnson served as umpire for several cases involving Mr.
Barney.  Defendant argues that Maxwell
Janisch has already been disqualified as umpire in this matter, in addition to
the fact that Mr. Barney is presently engaged as a party-appointed appraised in
another proceeding with Mr. Janisch such that they are in direct opposition. Defendant
also argues that Todd Kennaday too has opposed Mr. Barney as a party-appointed
appraiser in numerous appraisal matters and Mr. Kennaday even recently
threatened to sue Defendant in an email dated October 26, 2023.  (Opp. at pp.6-7.) Mercury has not provided
the Court with a copy of this alleged threat.
