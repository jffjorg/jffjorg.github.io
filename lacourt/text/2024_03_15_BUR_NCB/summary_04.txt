And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, John J. Kralik, has issued a tentative ruling regarding three motions to compel discovery responses filed by plaintiff binh tieu tran (Plaintiff) against defendant royal vista san gabriel (Defendant). The Plaintiff had filed two motions to compel initial responses and one motion for order deeming requests for admissions admitted. The Defendant had not complied with the discovery requests and had not requested an extension of time.

The Judge has denied the motions as moot since the Defendant has served code-compliant responses to the discovery requests. Additionally, the Judge has denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions as the Plaintiff failed to comply with California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 2023.040, which requires identifying the party against whom the sanction is sought.

The Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of this order.
