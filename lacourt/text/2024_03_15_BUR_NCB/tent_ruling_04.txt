Case
  No.: 22STCV03685

 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motions to compel discovery responses



 
There are 3
motions on calendar.  On January 26, 2024,
Plaintiff Binh Tieu Tran (“Plaintiff”) filed 2 motions to compel initial responses
from Defendant Royal Vista San Gabriel (“Defendant”) for: (1) Form
Interrogatories (“FROG”), set one; and (2) Request for Production of Documents
(“RPD”), set one.  Plaintiff also filed a
motion for order deeming Requests for Admissions (“RFA”), set one,
admitted.  
On October 6,
2023, Plaintiff served on Defendant the discovery requests.  Plaintiff argues that although defense
counsel acknowledged receipt of the discovery requests and that the case may be
transferred to another defense firm, Defendant did not make efforts to comply
with the discovery requests or request an extension of time.  As of the filing of the motions, Plaintiff states
that he has not received responses from Defendant.  
On March 4,
2024, Defendant filed an opposition to the request for sanctions, arguing that
Plaintiff has not complied with the notice requirements to properly request
sanctions.  Defendant also argues that it
has served code compliant responses such that the motions are moot. 
In light of the
Defendant’s representations that responses have been served to the FROG, SROG,
RPD, and RFA, the motions are denied as moot. 

In the notices of motion, Plaintiff did
not request sanctions.  However, in the
memorandum of points and authorities, Plaintiff requested sanctions in the
amounts of $1,286 on the FROG motion, $886 on the RPD motion, and $1,286 on the
RFA motion.  CCP
§ 2023.040 requires that the party requesting sanctions “identify every person,
party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought.”  Plaintiff has failed to comply with this
statute in making the proper request for sanctions that would put Defendant on
notice.  The requests for sanctions are
denied.  
Plaintiff shall provide
notice of this order.
