This is a tentative ruling by Judge John Kralik on the demurrer filed by Defendant Vigan Sardariani to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff RRRM Holding Company, LLC. The demurrer was filed on February 26, 2024, and the opposition brief was filed on March 5, 2024. The Court has considered the FAC, the demurrer, and the opposition brief and has found that the demurrer is uncertain and fails to state sufficient facts to state a cause of action. Specifically, the Court found that the FAC is unclear regarding the terms of the lease agreement and the rent payments due and owing. However, the Court has also found that Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts regarding the terms of the agreement and has overruled the demurrer on that basis. The Court has also considered the notices of default and the allegations regarding the rent payments and has found that the FAC is clear regarding the rent payments due and owing. Therefore, the Court has overruled the demurrer and ordered Defendant to answer the FAC.
