  order RE:
motion to vacate dismissal under ccp § 664.6 and enter judgment
  pursuant to stipulation
 



 
BACKGROUND

A.    Allegations

Plaintiff
Forwardline Financial, LLC (“Plaintiff”) alleges that it entered into a written
contract on March 16, 2022 with Defendants Torqqe Performance, LLC (“Torqqe”)
and Earl Smith (“Smith”).  Plaintiff
alleges that Torqqe breached the agreement on November 2, 2022 by failing to
remit further payment to Plaintiff under the loan and that Smith breached the
agreement by failing to cure the breach of his personal guaranty.  Plaintiff alleges that it has suffered
$39,947.26 in damages.  
The complaint,
filed May 3, 2023, alleges causes of action for: (1) common counts; (2) common
counts; (3) common counts; (4) breach of contract; and (5) breach of contract.
B.     Relevant
Background and Motion on Calendar 
On
June 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed proofs of service showing that Defendants were
each personally served with the summons and complaint on May 16, 2023.  
On June 16,
2023, Torqqe filed an answer to the complaint. 

On June 29,
2023, the default of Earl Smith was entered. 

On September 21,
2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement of Entire Case. 
On September 27,
2023, the Court noted at the Case Management Conference that a notice of
settlement had been filed.  The Court set
an OSC re: Dismissal (Settlement) for September 25, 2024.  The case is still active and has not yet been
dismissed. 
On December 15,
2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the dismissal under CCP § 664.6 and
enter judgment pursuant to stipulation. 
The Court is not in receipt of an opposition brief. 
DISCUSSION 
            Plaintiff
moves for an order vacating the dismissal and entering judgment pursuant to the
stipulation, relying on CCP § 664.6.  
            The
Stipulation of Entry of Judgment and Installment Payments and Dismissal of
Action with Consent to Court Retaining Jurisdiction Pursuant to CCP § 664.6
(“Stipulation”) is attached as Exhibit 1 to the motion.  The Stipulation provides that $2,000 shall be
paid on or before the 1st of each and every consecutive month
commencing on or before August 1, 2023 through and including March 1, 2025
until the total sum of $40,000 is paid in full. 
(Stipulation, ¶2(A).)  Upon
payment of the $40,000 amount, Plaintiff will dismiss the action with
prejudice.  (Id., ¶3.)  If Defendants default and fail to cure the
default, they will be in breach of the Stipulation and Plaintiff may seek
judgment of the $40,000 settlement amount, less any payments paid, plus
interest, costs, and attorney’s fees.  (Id.,
¶¶3, 7-9.)  The Stipulation is signed by
Plaintiff’s authorized agent, Smith (as an individual), and Smith (as
authorized agent for Torqqe).  (Id.
at p.7.)  
            Plaintiff’s
counsel, Jon O. Blanda, states that Defendants have made payments totaling
$4,000 in the months of August and September of 2023, but failed to make
payments thereafter.  (Blanda Decl.,
¶4.)  Mr. Blanda states that Plaintiff
has emailed defense counsel but Defendants have failed to cure the
default.  (Id., ¶5.)  Plaintiff seeks $36,000 (balance), plus
interest at 10% from the date of the default beginning October 1, 2023.  (Id., ¶¶6-7.)  
            Preliminarily,
the Court notes that the action has not been dismissed.  The action is still active.  The OSC re: Dismissal (Settlement) is set for
September 25, 2024.  Thus, Plaintiff’s
request to vacate the dismissal is moot as no dismissal has been entered in
this action.
            Second,
while Torqqe has answered and paid first appearance fees, Smith has not
appeared in the action, has not paid first appearance fees, and is
defaulted.  In order to obtain a
stipulated judgment against both Torqqe and Smith, Smith’s first appearance
fees must be paid. 
            As
Smith’s first appearance fees have not been paid, the Court will continue the
hearing to provide time for Smith’s first appearance fees to be paid.  The Court also notes that the motion was
served on Torqqe’s counsel, but the motion was not served on Smith.  While Smith has not appeared in this action
and he is a defaulted defendant, this motion affects Smith’s rights.  As such, the Court will order Plaintiff to
serve the moving papers on Smith.  
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
Plaintiff
Forwardline Financial, LLC’s motion to vacate the dismissal under CCP § 664.6
and enter judgment pursuant to stipulation is continued to April 5, 2024.  Plaintiff is ordered to serve the motion
papers on Defendant Earl Smith.  In
addition, as stated more fully in the Court’s written ruling, the Court cannot
enter a stipulated judgment against Defendant Earl Smith until his first
appearance fees have been paid.  
Plaintiff
shall
give notice of this order.
