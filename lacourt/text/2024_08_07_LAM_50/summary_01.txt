And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for sanctions against HG Long in the amount of $3,210. The plaintiff alleged that HG Long's actions were made in bad faith, were frivolous, and were solely intended to cause unnecessary delay. The judge found that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim. The judge noted that HG Long's anti-SLAPP motion was filed in a timely manner and that the email communication from HG Long to the plaintiff did not contain any false or misleading statements. The judge also found that HG Long's failure to file a responsive pleading with the court did not constitute bad faith. The judge concluded that the plaintiff's motion for sanctions was without merit and denied the motion.
