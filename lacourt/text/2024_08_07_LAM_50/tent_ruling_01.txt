[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
MOTION FOR
  SANCTIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF $3,210 UNDER CODE OF CIVIL
  PROCEDURE § 128.5 AGAINST HG LONG
 



            
Background
On August 14, 2023,
Plaintiff Larry Link (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants
Victoria Billings and 5523 Harold Way, LLC (jointly, “Defendants”). The
Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) disability discrimination, (2)
retaliation for request for accommodation, (3) failure to pay wages owed at
termination, (4) failure to pay wages owed after termination, 
(5)
harassment, and (6) “retaliation eviction.” 
Plaintiff now moves for an order “imposing sanctions in the amount of
$3,210 against HG LONG.” Defendants oppose. 
Discussion
In the motion, Plaintiff asserts that “the
Court should order sanctions in the amount of $3,210 against HG LONG pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure § 128.5 on the grounds
that they [sic] have engaged in bad-faith actions or tactics that are frivolous
or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay…” (Mot. at p. 4:10-12.) 
Pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 128.5, subdivision (a), “[a] trial court may order
a party, the party’s attorney, or both, to pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred by another party as a result of actions or
tactics, made in bad faith, that are frivolous or solely intended to cause
unnecessary delay.” For purposes of Code of Civil
Procedure section 128.5, “‘Actions or tactics’ include, but are not limited to, the making
or opposing of motions or the filing and service of a complaint,
cross-complaint, answer, or other responsive pleading,” and “Frivolous’ means
totally and completely without merit or for the sole purpose of harassing an
opposing party.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
128.5, subd. (b).) 
As an initial
matter, as noted by Defendants, Code of Civil Procedure
section 128.5, subdivision (f)(1)(B) provides that “[i]f the alleged action or tactic is the making or opposing
of a written motion or the filing and service of a complaint, cross-complaint,
answer, or other responsive pleading that can be withdrawn or appropriately
corrected, a notice of motion shall be served as provided in Section 1010, but shall not be filed with or presented
to the court, unless 21 days after service of the motion or any other period as
the court may prescribe, the challenged action or tactic is not withdrawn or
appropriately corrected.” In Nutrition Distribution, LLC v. Southern SARMs,
Inc. (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th
117, 120, cited by
Defendants, the Court of Appeal noted that “[a]s reflected in the
plain language and legislative history of former [Code
of Civil Procedure section 128.5] subdivision (f), and confirmed by the
August 2017 amendments to that provision, a 21-day waiting period applies to a
motion for sanctions under section 128.5 that, as
here, is directed to allegedly improper actions or tactics that can be
withdrawn or appropriately corrected.” 
As discussed below, Plaintiff’s instant
motion concerns, inter alia, Defendants’ anti-SLAPP motion. However,
Plaintiff does not appear to show that he complied with the requirements of Code of Civil
Procedure section 128.5, subdivision (f)(1)(B). 
In addition, in the motion, Plaintiff notes
that on October 20, 2023, Defendants filed an anti-SLAPP motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 to strike the
sixth cause of action of the Complaint and paragraph 22 of the Complaint. The motion
was filed by H.G. Long of Dennis P. Block & Associates, APC on behalf of
Defendants. In the instant motion, Plaintiff asserts that “Defendant’s
[sic] attorney knew or should have known that their motion to strike was in
violation of Code of Civil Procedure 425.16(f)
which states that the motion be filed within 60 days after the service of the
complaint.” (Mot. at p. 5:9-12.)
In his opposition to Defendants’ anti-SLAPP motion, Plaintiff also
argued that the motion was untimely. However, as noted by Defendants, the Court’s
January 16, 2024 Order on Defendants’ anti-SLAPP motion noted that “the Court
does not find that Plaintiff has demonstrated that the instant motion should be
denied as untimely.” (January 16, 2024 Order at p. 3:13-14; see discussion on
this point at pp. 2:3-3:14.) The Court does not find that
Plaintiff has shown here that Defendants’ anti-SLAPP motion was made in bad faith, was frivolous, or was solely intended to
cause unnecessary delay, to the extent that is what Plaintiff is arguing. (Code Civ. Proc., §
128.5, subd. (a).) 
Plaintiff also appears to
reference an October 18, 2023 email from Defendants’ counsel, and asserts that “[c]onsidering
the proximity of the filing of the motion[1] to
the communication sent to the Plaintiff (2 days), Defendant’s attorney
intentionally made false and misleading statements to the Plaintiff. This is
supported by the fact that Defendant’s attorney has not filed a responsive
pleading with the court as of November 12, 2023, as stated in her email
communication of October 18, 2023.” (Mot. at pp. 2:25-3:2.)
An Exhibit “B” attached to Plaintiff’s motion consists of an October
18, 2023 email from “HG Long” to Mr. Link. The Court notes that an Exhibit “B” does
not appear to be referenced in Plaintiff’s supporting declaration and is thus not
authenticated. In any event, the October 18, 2023 email does not indicate that
Defendants’ counsel will file “a responsive pleading with the court as of
November 12, 2023,” as Plaintiff appears to contend. (Mot. at pp. 2:27-3:1.) The
October 18, 2023 email provides, inter alia, as follows: 
 
“Our office has been retained by
Victoria Billings and 5523 Harold Way LLC. We just got a copy of the complaint
and will be filing a responsive pleading shortly. Further, we are advised that
you have served discovery on our clients. We will need an extension of at least
three weeks to prepare responses to your discovery. Please allow an extension
up to and including November 13, 2023. Further, we need at least one week to
file a responsive pleading to the complaint you filed. Please do not attempt to
file any more requests for default as we will respond to the complaint by next
Friday on behalf of all defendants.” (Mot., Ex. B.) 
As discussed, on October 20, 2023, H.G. Long of Dennis P. Block &
Associates, APC filed an anti-SLAPP motion on behalf of Defendants. The Court
does not see how Defendants’ counsel purportedly made any “false and misleading
statements” in the October 18, 2023 email. (Mot. at p. 2:26.) 
Lastly, Plaintiff asserts that “[a]s of November 12, 2023, Defendant’s
[sic] attorney has not notified the court that they have been retained by the
Defendant, 23 days from her email communication of October 18, 2023…This
refutes the assertion made in HG LONG’s email communication that she has been
retained by the Plaintiff.” (Mot. at p. 5:17-21.) But as discussed, on October
20, 2023, H.G. Long of Dennis P. Block & Associates, APC filed an
anti-SLAPP motion on behalf of Defendants. It is unclear what Plaintiff means with
respect to the assertion that Defendants’ counsel should have “notified the
Court” that they were retained by Defendants. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court does not find that Plaintiff has
shown any “actions or tactics, made in bad faith,
that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 128.5, subd. (a).) 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion
for sanctions is denied.
