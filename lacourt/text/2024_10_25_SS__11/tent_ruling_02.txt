[1] Plaintiff admits that he e-signed the employment agreement
(see Najarro Decl., ¶¶ 4-5) yet claims he does not remember seeing it.  (See id. at ¶ 3.)  Lack of memory is
not a defense.  Nor is failure to
read.  (See, e.g., Ramos v. Westlake Services LLC (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 674, 687 [“[T]he fact
that [the plaintiff] signed a contract in a language he may not have completely
understood would not bar enforcement of the arbitration agreement.  If [the plaintiff] did not speak or understand
English sufficiently to comprehend the English Contract, he should have had it
read or explained to him.”].)
