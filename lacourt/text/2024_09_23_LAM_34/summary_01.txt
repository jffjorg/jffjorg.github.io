```

As for the summary of the tentative ruling, the judge has denied the motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin Defendant from foreclosing on the Subject Property. The judge found that Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of their case and that the documentary evidence presented by Defendant demonstrates that Plaintiffs were involved in repairing the Subject Property and that the improvements were made with Defendant's knowledge and consent. The judge also found that Plaintiffs have available remedies at law and that the court cannot find irreparable harm.
