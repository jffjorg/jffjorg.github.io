MOTION TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH DEPOSITION
SUBPOENA
(Neena Sachinvala, M.D.)
 
Motion filed on 6/7/23.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendants Michael Meadows and Althea
Meadows
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiffs Alex Alvarado and Patricia
Alvarado
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order compelling nonparty Neena Sachinvala, M.D.
to comply with the deposition subpoena.  

 

RULING: The motion is denied.      
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of disputes between
neighbors.  Plaintiffs Alex Alvarado and
Patricia Alvarado (Plaintiffs) and Defendants Michael Meadows and Althea
Meadows (the Meadows) own neighboring properties in a common interest
development managed by Defendant Ridgeview Saugus Homeowners Association (the
HOA) and governed by a Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions
(CC&Rs).  
 
Without citing any evidence, the Meadows claim that
Plaintiff Patricia Alvarado has alleged to have suffered physical and emotional
damage due to the Meadows’ actions and Dr. Sachinvala has been treating
Patricia Alvarado regarding the injuries she has alleged.  (See Motion, p.3:3-5).
 
Based on the foregoing, the Meadows personally served Dr.
Sachinvala with a deposition subpoena for personal appearance and production of
documents.  (Blake Decl. ¶3, Ex.A -incorrectly
cited as Ex.1 in the motion).  On 4/20/23,
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA), Dr. Sachinvala’s employer,
provided a lengthy response to the deposition subpoena stating that they will
not produce Dr. Sachinvala for a deposition, nor would they produce the
documents that were requested.  (Blake
Decl. ¶4; Ex.B - incorrectly cited as Ex.2 in the motion). Therefore, on
6/7/23, the Meadows filed and served (on Plaintiffs and the HOA) the instant
motion seeking an order compelling nonparty Neena Sachinvala, M.D. to comply
with the deposition subpoena.  Plaintiffs
have opposed the motion and the Meadows have filed a reply to Plaintiffs’
opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
The instant motion is made pursuant to CCP 1987.1 and CCP
2025.480.  (See Notice of Motion,
p.2:1-2; Memorandum of Points & Authorities, p.4:1-16). 
 
CCP 2025.480 provides in relevant part:
 
“(a) If a deponent fails to answer
any question or to produce any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing under the deponent's
control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena,
the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that
answer or production.
(b) This motion shall be made no
later than 60 days after the completion of the record of the deposition, and
shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.
(c) Notice of this motion shall
be given to all parties and to the deponent either orally at the
examination, or by subsequent service in writing. If the notice of the motion
is given orally, the deposition officer shall direct the deponent to attend a
session of the court at the time specified in the notice.”
 
The proof of service for the motion does not show that it
was served on the deponent, Dr. Sachinvala and/or the VA, the entity that responded/objected
to the subpoena of behalf of Dr. Sachinvala. 
(See Proof of Service pdf pp.47-48).  Nor has a separate proof of service been
filed showing that the instant motion was served on Dr. Sachinvala and/or the VA.  (See eCourt, generally).  No response to the motion has been filed by
or on behalf of Dr. Sachinvala to cure this defect in notice.    
 
Additionally, the motion is not accompanied by a separate
statement as required.  See CRC
3.1345(a)(5).  Further, the Meadows have
failed to address the issues, arguments and authorities set forth in the VA’s
response to the subject subpoena.  (See
Blake Decl., Ex.B; Motion, generally); CRC 3.1345(c).  
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is denied.    Dept. F47

MOTION TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH DEPOSITION
SUBPOENA
(Michelle Elliott-Zwirn, M.D.)
 
Motion filed on 6/7/23.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendants Michael Meadows and Althea
Meadows
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiffs Alex Alvarado and Patricia
Alvarado
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order compelling nonparty Michelle Elliott-Zwirn,
M.D. to comply with the deposition subpoena. 


 

RULING: The motion is denied.      
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of disputes between
neighbors.  Plaintiffs Alex Alvarado and
Patricia Alvarado (Plaintiffs) and Defendants Michael Meadows and Althea
Meadows (the Meadows) own neighboring properties in a common interest
development managed by Defendant Ridgeview Saugus Homeowners Association (the
HOA) and governed by a Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions
(CC&Rs).  
 
Without citing any evidence, the Meadows claim that
Plaintiff Patricia Alvarado has alleged to have suffered physical and emotional
damage due to the Meadows’ actions and Dr. Elliott-Zwirn has been treating
Patricia Alvarado regarding the injuries she has alleged.  (See Motion, p.3:3-5).
 
Based on the foregoing, the Meadows personally served Dr.
Elliott-Zwirn with a deposition subpoena for personal appearance and production
of documents.  (Blake Decl. ¶3, Ex.A -incorrectly
cited as Ex.1 in the motion).  On 5/5/23,
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA), Dr. Elliott-Zwirn’s employer,
provided a lengthy response to the deposition subpoena stating that they will
not produce Dr. Elliott-Zwirn for a deposition, nor would they produce the
documents that were requested.  (Blake
Decl. ¶4; Ex.B - incorrectly cited as Ex.2 in the motion). Therefore, on
6/7/23, the Meadows filed and served (on Plaintiffs and the HOA) the instant
motion seeking an order compelling nonparty Michelle Elliott-Zwirn, M.D. to
comply with the deposition subpoena.  No
opposition has been filed to the instant motion.  However, a reply has been filed indicating
that Plaintiffs served an opposition to the motion.  Based on the arguments in the reply, it
appears that the opposition served, but not filed, to the instant motion makes
the same arguments as the oppositions to the motions regarding Dr. Sachinvala
and Dr. Bean-Mayberry.
 
ANALYSIS
 
The instant motion is made pursuant to CCP 1987.1 and CCP
2025.480.  (See Notice of Motion,

be given to all parties and to the deponent either orally at the
examination, or by subsequent service in writing. If the notice of the motion

MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES
(Requests for Production of Documents, Set
3)
 
Motion filed on 7/17/23.  Amended Notice filed 7/20/23.
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiffs Alex Alvarado and Patricia
Alvarado
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Michael Meadows 
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order compelling
Defendant Michael Meadows to provide further responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests
for Production of Documents, Set 3, Nos. 22, 26, and 29.  Additionally, Plaintiffs request sanctions be
imposed against Defendant Michael Meadows and his counsel of record Fitzgerald
Kreditor Bolduc Risbrough LLP in the amount of $3,440.00.

 

RULING: The motion is denied.  Defendant Michael Meadows’ request for
sanctions is granted.      
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of disputes between
neighbors.  Plaintiffs Alex Alvarado and
Patricia Alvarado (Plaintiffs) and Defendants Michael Meadows and Althea
Meadows (the Meadows) own neighboring properties in a common interest
development managed by Defendant Ridgeview Saugus Homeowners Association (the
HOA) and governed by a Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions
(CC&Rs).  In part, Plaintiffs have
sued the Meadows for operating a pool cleaning business out of their home.  (See Complaint, generally).  
 
On 3/7/23, Plaintiffs
propounded Requests for Production of Documents, Set 3, on Michael Meadows (Mr.
Meadows).  On 4/6/23, Mr. Meadows
responded with only objections to certain of the requests.  The parties met and conferred during which
time they extended the deadline to file a motion to compel further
responses.  Mr. Meadows never served
further responses.
 
Therefore, on
7/17/23, Plaintiffs filed and served the instant motion seeking an order
compelling Defendant Michael Meadows to provide further responses to
Plaintiffs’ Requests for Production of Documents, Set 3, Nos. 22, 26, and
29.  Additionally, Plaintiffs request
sanctions be imposed against Defendant Michael Meadows and his counsel of
record Fitzgerald Kreditor Bolduc Risbrough LLP in the amount of $3,440.00.  Mr. Meadows has opposed the motion,
requesting sanctions in the amount of $1,200.00 against Plaintiffs and their
counsel, Lubin Pham + Chaplin LLP.  Plaintiffs have filed a reply to the
opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Upon receipt of
a response to a request for production, the propounding party may move for an
order compelling further response to the request if the propounding party deems
that any an objection in the response is without merit or too general.  CCP 2031.310(a)(3).  The motion must set forth specific facts
showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the request.  CCP 2031.310(b)(1).
 
Request 22 seeks
“All documents concerning your Beverly Hills Route.”  The Beverly Hills Route was defined as the
pool cleaning route Mr. Meadows recently picked up, as he described in his
motion for protective order.  Mr. Meadows
responded to the request with various objections based on relevance, invasion
of defendant’s and third parties’ privacy rights, overbreadth, undue burden and
oppression. 
 
In their moving
papers, Plaintiffs contend that a further response is required because Mr.
Meadows is seeking a protective order because of his work schedule, because Mr.
Meadows was purportedly bad-mouthing Plaintiffs to his clients and because
these pool cleaning clients may also have information regarding where Mr.
Meadows’ pool cleaning business operates and how.  
 
The Court denied
Mr. Meadows request for a protective order on 4/27/23.  (See 4/27/23 Minute Order).  Therefore, the information is not needed for
purposes of opposing the request for a protective order.  The “evidence” Plaintiffs offer to support
their claim that Mr. Meadows was bad-mouthing them to pooling cleaning clients
is double-hearsay and does not seem to relate to the Beverly Hills route (i.e.,
Plaintiffs’ realtor’s client told the realtor, who relayed the information at
her deposition).  (See Chimoures
Decl., Ex.5).  Even if such evidence
could be considered, it only shows that Mr. Meadows spoke to one client, the
name of whom Plaintiff’s realtor provided at the deposition.  Id. 
Additionally, the realtor indicated that she could also provide the
contact information for the client.  Id.  Further, even if Mr. Meadows did speak to
clients on his pool cleaning route(s) about Plaintiffs, he may also have spoken
to anybody else he has come into contact with about them.  Plaintiffs have failed to show such
information is relevant to their claims against the Meadows for breach of
governing documents, nuisance, continuing trespass, intentional interference
with prospective economic relations and declaratory relief, regardless of the
fact that they are seeking punitive damages. 
Even if certain documents regarding the Beverly
Hills route contained relevant information, Plaintiffs have also failed to
establish why all documents concerning the Beverly Hills route, which could
contain third-party financial information or other private information, would
be relevant.  Finally, it appears that
Plaintiff should seek documents relating to the pool cleaning business from A
Cleaner Pool, Inc., a non-party to this action. 
The Court notes that Plaintiffs’ motion to compel A Cleaner Pool, Inc.’s
compliance with a deposition subpoena was recently denied, without prejudice,
for a second time.  (See 9/13/23
Minute Order).  
 

Request 26 seeks
“All documents concerning Echo Meadows’ [the Meadows’ daughter] reasons for
moving out of the property [the Meadows’ home].”  Mr. Meadows responded to the request with
objections based on relevance, invasion of defendant’s and third-party privacy
rights, overbreadth, undue burden, oppression, attorney client privilege,
attorney work product, vagueness and ambiguity, and the request was previously
propounded.  
 
Plaintiffs
contend that this request is relevant because Mr. Meadows testified at his
deposition that he and Echo Meadows had spoken about the Plaintiffs, that the
stress from Plaintiffs was one of the reasons Echo Meadows moved out of the
Meadows’ property, and that Echo Meadows documented that in writing.  
 
The request is
overbroad as it seeks all documents related to Echo Meadows’ reasons for moving
out of the property.  The motion and
reply focus on a “letter” Echo Meadows, a teenager, purportedly sent to the
Meadows regarding why she moved to live with her mother.  Mr. Meadows testified that he believed Echo’s
mother wrote the letter and had Echo sign it. 
(Chimoures Decl., Ex.Ex.6).  Mr.
Meadows testified regarding the substance of the letter and admitted during his
deposition that he believes that Echo moved out to live with her mother due, in
part, to the situation with the Plaintiffs. 
Id.  As such, it is not
clear how any document will further explain “Mr. Meadows’ [purported] vitriol
or bias against [Plaintiffs]” which is one of the reasons Plaintiffs claim the
documents are needed.  If Plaintiffs’
believe that Echo has information and personal experiences about the dispute
that are relevant to this case, they should seek to depose her.
 
Request 29 seeks
“All documents concerning contractors you worked with to service Joe Torres’s
pool from July 2018 to present.”  Mr.
Meadows responded to the request with objections based on relevance, privacy
rights of third parties and defendant, overbreadth, undue burden, attorney
client privilege, attorney work product, vagueness, ambiguity and the request
was previously propounded.  
 
The request is
overbroad.  Even if certain documents
regarding the contractors Mr. Meadows worked with to service Joe Torres’s pool contained
relevant information, Plaintiffs have failed to establish why all such documents,
which could contain third-party financial information or other private
information, would be relevant.  Also, as
with Request 22, it appears that Plaintiff should seek documents relating to
the pool cleaning business and its contractors from A Cleaner Pool, Inc., a
non-party to this action.  As noted
above, Plaintiffs’ motion to compel A Cleaner Pool, Inc.’s compliance with a
deposition subpoena was recently denied, without prejudice, for a second
time.  (See 9/13/23 Minute
Order).  
 
As the
prevailing party on this motion, Mr. Meadows is entitled to an award of
sanctions against Plaintiffs and their counsel, Lubin Pham + Chaplin LLP, in
the amount of $1,200.00.  CCP
2023.010(a), (c); CCP 2023.030(a); 2031.310(h); (Blake Decl. ¶¶2-3).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is
denied.  Defendant Michael Meadows
request for sanctions is granted. 
Sanctions are payable within 30 days. 

 
The Court notes
that Plaintiffs’ counsel has, again, failed to electronically bookmark the
exhibits attached to the declaration of attorney Chimoures as required.  See CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  Counsel is warned that continued and repeated
failure to comply with this requirement may result in papers not being
considered, matters being placed off calendar, matters being continued so that papers
can be resubmitted in compliance with the rule and/or the imposition of
sanctions.

MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES
(Special Interrogatories, Set 3)
 
Motion filed on 7/17/23.  Amended Notice filed 7/20/23.
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiffs Alex Alvarado and Patricia
Alvarado
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Michael Meadows 
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order compelling
Defendant Michael Meadows to provide further responses to Plaintiffs’ Special
Interrogatories, Set 3, Nos. 21 and 23. 
Additionally, Plaintiffs request sanctions be imposed against Defendant
Michael Meadows and his counsel of record Fitzgerald Kreditor Bolduc Risbrough
LLP in the amount of $2,960.00.

 

RULING: The motion is denied.  Defendant Michael Meadows’ request for
sanctions is granted.      
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of disputes between
neighbors.  Plaintiffs Alex Alvarado and
Patricia Alvarado (Plaintiffs) and Defendants Michael Meadows and Althea
Meadows (the Meadows) own neighboring properties in a common interest
development managed by Defendant Ridgeview Saugus Homeowners Association (the
HOA) and governed by a Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions
(CC&Rs).  In part, Plaintiffs have
sued the Meadows for operating a pool cleaning business out of their home.  (See Complaint, generally).  
 
On 3/7/23, Plaintiffs
propounded Special Interrogatories, Set 3, on Michael Meadows (Mr.
Meadows).  On 4/6/23, Mr. Meadows
responded with only objections to certain of the interrogatories.  The parties met and conferred during which
time they extended the deadline to file a motion to compel further
responses.  Mr. Meadows never served
further responses.
 
Therefore, on
7/17/23, Plaintiffs filed and served the instant motion seeking an order
compelling Defendant Michael Meadows to provide further responses to
Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatories, Set 3, Nos. 21 and 23.  Additionally, Plaintiffs request sanctions be
imposed against Defendant Michael Meadows and his counsel of record Fitzgerald
Kreditor Bolduc Risbrough LLP in the amount of $2,960.00.  Mr. Meadows has opposed the motion,
requesting sanctions in the amount of $1,200.00 against Plaintiffs and their
counsel, Lubin Pham + Chaplin LLP.  Plaintiffs have filed a reply to the
opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Upon receipt of
a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any an
objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.  CCP 2030.300(a)(3).  
 
Special
Interrogatory 21 asks Mr. Meadows to “Identify the properties you provide pool
cleaning services to along your Beverly Hills route.”  The Beverly Hills Route was defined as the
pool cleaning route Mr. Meadows recently picked up, as he described in his
motion for protective order.  Mr. Meadows responded to the interrogatory with various
objections based on relevance, invasion of defendant’s and third parties’
privacy rights, overbreadth, undue burden and oppression, attorney client
privilege and attorney work product, vagueness and ambiguity and the
interrogatory has been previously propounded. 

 
In their moving
papers, Plaintiffs contend that a further response is required because Mr.
Meadows is seeking a protective order because of his work schedule, because Mr.
Meadows was purportedly bad-mouthing Plaintiffs to his clients and because
these pool cleaning clients may also have information regarding where Mr.
Meadows’ pool cleaning business operates and how.  
 
The Court denied
Mr. Meadows request for a protective order on 4/27/23.  (See 4/27/23 Minute Order).  Therefore, the information is not needed for
purposes of opposing the request for a protective order.  The “evidence” Plaintiffs offer to support
their claim that Mr. Meadows was bad-mouthing them to pooling cleaning clients
is double-hearsay and does not seem to relate to the Beverly Hills route (i.e.,
Plaintiffs’ realtor’s client told the realtor, who relayed the information at
her deposition).  (See Chimoures
Decl., Ex.5).  Even if such evidence
could be considered, it only shows that Mr. Meadows spoke to one client, the
name of whom Plaintiff’s realtor provided at the deposition.  Id. 
Additionally, the realtor indicated that she could also provide the
contact information for the client.  Id.  Further, even if Mr. Meadows did speak to
clients on his pool cleaning route(s) about Plaintiffs, he may also have spoken
to anybody else he has come into contact with about them.  Plaintiffs have failed to show such
information is relevant to their claims against the Meadows for breach of
governing documents, nuisance, continuing trespass, intentional interference
with prospective economic relations and declaratory relief, regardless of the
fact that they are seeking punitive damages. 
Further, it appears that Plaintiff should seek information
relating to the pool cleaning business from A Cleaner Pool, Inc., a non-party
to this action.  The Court notes that
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel A Cleaner Pool, Inc.’s compliance with a
deposition subpoena was recently denied, without prejudice, for a second
time.  (See 9/13/23 Minute
Order).  
 

Interrogatory 23
asks Mr. Meadows to “Identify all contractors you worked with to service Joe
Torres’s pool from July 2018 to present.” 
Mr. Meadows responded to the interrogatory with various objections based
on relevance, invasion of defendant’s and third parties’ privacy rights,
overbreadth, undue burden and oppression, attorney client privilege and
attorney work product, vagueness and ambiguity and the interrogatory has been
previously propounded. 
   
 
 
 
The
interrogatory is vague and ambiguous as the term “contractors” is not
defined.  The interrogatory seeks the
name, home address, telephone number, business name, business address, and
business telephone numbers of these non-party “contractors.”  Plaintiffs’ speculation that these
“contractors” “could give further insight into their personal knowledge about
where Mr. Meadows’s business is located” is insufficient to require revealing
information such as their home address. 
Additionally, Plaintiffs have not shown that Mr. Meadows has any clear
method of determining which “contractors” he worked with to service Joe
Torres’s home from July 2018 to present as opposed to any other “contractors”
he worked with to service other homes. 
As such, the interrogatory is overly burdensome.  It is also not clear why only “contractors”
Mr. Meadows worked with from July 2018 to the present to service Joe Torres’s
home would have more information regarding where the business is located than
any other “contractors.”  Even if such
information could be deemed relevant, it appears that Plaintiff should seek such
information  relating to the pool
cleaning business and its contractors from A Cleaner Pool, Inc., a non-party to
this action.  As noted above, Plaintiffs’
motion to compel A Cleaner Pool, Inc.’s compliance with a deposition subpoena
was recently denied, without prejudice, for a second time.  (See 9/13/23 Minute Order). 
 
As the
prevailing party on this motion, Mr. Meadows is entitled to an award of
sanctions against Plaintiffs and their counsel, Lubin Pham + Chaplin LLP, in
the amount of $825.00.  CCP 2023.010(a),
(c); CCP 2023.030(a); 2030.300(d); (Blake Decl. ¶¶2-3).  The $1,200.00 in sanctions requested by Mr.
Meadows was reduced by $375.00 (2.5 hours x $150/hour) for the
appearance/argument of the motion as the Court awarded Mr. Meadows attorney
fees for such time in the motion regarding document requests which is scheduled
for hearing on the same day.  The Court
finds that 2.5  hours is sufficient to
cover the time for both motions. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is
denied.  Defendant Michael Meadows
request for sanctions is granted in the reduced amount of $825.00.  Sanctions are payable within 30 days.  
 
The Court notes
that Plaintiffs’ counsel has, again, failed to electronically bookmark the
exhibits attached to the declaration of attorney Chimoures as required.  See CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  Counsel is warned that continued and repeated
failure to comply with this requirement may result in papers not being
considered, matters being placed off calendar, matters being continued so that papers
can be resubmitted in compliance with the rule and/or the imposition of
sanctions.
