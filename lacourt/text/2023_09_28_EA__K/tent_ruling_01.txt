  Case Number:  19PSCV01127    Hearing Date:   September 28, 2023    Dept:  K Defendant Nhuan Gia
Huynh’s Motion for Mandatory Dismissal for Failure to Serve Complaint Within
Three Years of Filing the Action Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§
583.210, 583.250 is GRANTED. 
Background   
Plaintiff Cal World El Monte, LLC (“Plaintiff”)
alleges as follows:
AMCA I, LLC (“AMCA”) was
the owner of the commercial property located at 10138 E. Garvey Ave., El Monte,
CA 91733 (“Property”). The Property is a “strip mall” consisting of several
units which were occupied by businesses owned by Brian Lai (“B. Lai”),
including Central Furniture and Home Store (“Central Furniture”) and Yes 98
Cents, LLC (“Yes 98 Cents”). B. Lai is believed to be the sole member of AMCA. 
 
B. Lai, acting as a
listing broker, listed the Property for sale; the listing advertisement stated
that Yes 98 Cents was the anchor tenant of the Property. During or about April
2014, after seeing the commercial listing, Plaintiff’s representative Gary Tsai
(“Tsai”) contacted B. Lai regarding Plaintiff’s interest in the Property;
thereafter AMCA and Plaintiff began negotiations for the purchase of the
Property, including assignment of the lease agreements with Yes 98 Cents and
Liu/Central Furniture (which had been executed by Pau Cun Liu (“Liu”) on behalf
of Yes 98 Cents and by Doe 2 on behalf of Central Furniture). B. Lai made
several representations to Tsai regarding the Property’s rental income,
including providing rental agreements and operation statements for 2012-2014. B.
Lai concealed his ownership interests in Yes 98 Cents and Central Furniture. 
 
On or about April 22,
2014, AMCA and Plaintiff entered into a purchase agreement for the sale of the
Property in the amount of $5,525,000.00, which included AMCA’s assignment of
the rental agreements for the Property. Central Furniture and Yes 98 Cents
thereafter vacated the Property. When Plaintiff’s representative went to the
City of El Monte (“City”) to search for prior City-approved construction plans
on or about October 3, 2019, the representative located the Certificates of
Occupancy for the Property from June 2004 to the present, which showed B. Lai’s
ownership interests in Yes 98 Cents and Central Furniture.
On April 8, 2020, Liu’s default was
entered. On May 18, 2020, Central Furniture’s default was entered. On July 30,
2020, Plaintiff filed two “Amendment[s] to Complaint,” wherein Nhuan Gia Huynh (“Nhuan”)
was substituted in lieu of Doe 1 and Hong Gia Huynh (“Hong”) was substituted in
lieu of Doe 2.
On January 6, 2021, Plaintiff filed a
Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”), asserting causes of action against B. Lai,
AMCA, Yes 98 Cents, Central Furniture, Liu,[1] Nhuan,
Hong, Maggie Lo Huynh (“Maggie”) and Does 3-25 for:
1.                 
Fraudulent Inducement Into Contract
2.                 
Negligent Misrepresentation
3.                 
Breach of Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
4.                 
Unfair and Deceptive Business Practices (Bus. &
Prof. Code § 17200 et seq.)
The Final Status Conference is set
for June 13, 2024. Trial is set for July 16, 2024.
Legal Standard
“The summons and complaint shall be served upon a defendant
within three years after the action is commenced against the defendant. For the
purpose of this subdivision, an action is commenced at the time the complaint
is filed . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.210, subd. (a).)
“If
service is not made in an action within the time prescribed in this article: (1)
The action shall not be further prosecuted and no further proceedings shall be
held in the action. (2) The action shall be dismissed by the court on its own
motion or on motion of any person interested in the action, whether named as a
party or not, after notice to the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.250, subd.
(a).) “The requirements of this article are mandatory and are not subject to
extension, excuse, or exception except as expressly provided by statute.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 583.250, subd. (b).)
Discussion
Nhuan moves the court for an order, per Code of Civil
Procedure §§ 583.210 and 583.250, dismissing this action against him on the
basis that Plaintiff failed to serve him within three years of filing the
complaint.
Request for Judicial Notice
The court rules on Nhuan’s Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”)
as follows:
1.                 
Granted as to Exhibit 1 (i.e., summons and cover page
of complaint filed December 17, 2019); 
2.                 
Granted as to Exhibit 2 (i.e., “Amendment to Complaint
(Fictitious/Incorrect Name” filed July 30, 2020); 
3.

2021); 
4.

Default filed March 23, 2021); 
5.                 
Grant as to Exhibit 5 (i.e., Nhuan’s “Motion to Vacate Void Default Entered March 23, 2021” filed
December 8, 2022); 
6.                 
Grant as to Exhibit 6 (i.e., January 10, 2023 minute
order); and, 
7.                 
Granted as to Exhibit 7 (.e., proof of service filed
July 31, 2023).
Merits
Plaintiff’s complaint was filed
December 17, 2019. (RJN, Exh. 1.) On July 30, 2020, Plaintiff filed an
“Amendment to Complaint,” wherein Nhuan was substituted in lieu of Doe 1. (Id.,
Exh. 2.) On January 6, 2021, Plaintiff filed the SAC. (Id., Exh. 3.) On
March 23, 2021, Nhuan’s default was entered as to the SAC. (Id., Exh.
4.) On December 8, 2022, Nhuan filed a “Motion to Vacate Void Default Entered
March 23, 2021” (“Motion to Vacate”). (Id., Exh. 5.) On January 10,
2023, the court granted Nhuan’s Motion to Vacate. (Id., Exh. 6.) On July
31, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of service, which reflected that Nhuan had
been personally served with an amended summons and SAC on July 26, 2023. (Id.,
Exh. 7.)
It is undisputed that the three-year limit in section
583.210 began running with the December 17, 2019 filing of Plaintiff’s original
complaint. (Warren v. Atchison, T.& S.F. Ry. Co. (1971) 19
Cal.App.3d 24, 37; Motion, 2:9-11; Opp., 3:2-3). The above dates reflect that
Nhuan was not served until 3 years, 7 months and 9 days.
“Failure to adhere to the time constraints of section
583.210 of the Code of Civil Procedure will result in an action’s dismissal,
unless a plaintiff qualifies for an extension pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 583.240[2].” (Damjanovic
v. Ambrose (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 503, 508.)
Nhuan
acknowledges that a 33-day tolling period (i.e., between December 8, 2022 and
January 10, 2023) may have occurred pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
583.240, subdivision (c), since “the validity of service was the subject of
litigation by the parties.” However, even if this 33-day period were excluded,
service would remain untimely.
Plaintiff
argues that the court’s January 10, 2023 vacating of the default against Nhuan”
extended the three-year time limit as default was vacated after three years
from the date of filing.” (Opp., 3:7-8). Plaintiff’s argument, however, is not
supported by any legal authority. Plaintiff does not assert that any of the
exclusions set forth in Code of Civil Procedure § 583.240 apply.
The
court finds that Plaintiff failed to effectuate service upon Nhuan within the
time constraints set forth in Code of Civil Procedure § 583.210. The motion is
granted.
