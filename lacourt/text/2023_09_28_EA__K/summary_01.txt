And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the defendant's motion for mandatory dismissal of the action for failure to serve the complaint within three years of filing. The plaintiff, Cal World El Monte, LLC, filed a complaint on December 17, 2019, and failed to serve the defendant, Nhuan Gia Huynh, within the prescribed time period. Even though the court vacated the default against Nhuan on January 10, 2023, this does not extend the three-year time limit. The plaintiff does not assert any exclusions or extensions under Code of Civil Procedure § 583.240. Therefore, the court finds that the plaintiff failed to effectuate service upon Nhuan within the time constraints set forth in Code of Civil Procedure § 583.210, and the motion is granted.

The Judge has granted Nhuan's Request for Judicial Notice of several documents related to the case. Plaintiff's argument that the three-year time limit was extended as default was vacated after three years from the date of filing is not supported by any legal authority.
