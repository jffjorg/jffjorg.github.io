And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for mandatory dismissal for failure to serve the complaint within three years of filing the action. The plaintiff, Cal World El Monte, LLC, alleges that the defendant, Nhuan Gia Huynh, concealed ownership interests in Yes 98 Cents and Central Furniture, and made several representations regarding the Property's rental income. The defendant was not served until 3 years, 7 months, and 9 days after the complaint was filed, which exceeds the three-year time limit. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to effectuate service upon the defendant within the time constraints set forth in Code of Civil Procedure § 583.210, and therefore grants the motion to dismiss the action.
