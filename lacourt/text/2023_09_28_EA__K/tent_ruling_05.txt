Award is GRANTED.
Background   
On July 13, 2022, Petitioner Swift Financial, LLC, as Servicing Agent for WebBank  (“Petitioner”) filed a “Petition to
Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award” (“Petition”) as against Respondents LokiTap
LLC (“LokiTap”), Andrei Mirzoian (“Mirzoian”) and Does 1-10. On July 25, 2023,
Petitioner filed a “Notice of Motion and Motion on Petition to Confirm
Arbitration Award” (“Notice of Petition”), which set forth the September 28,
2023 hearing date.
A Case Management Conference and an Order to Show Cause Re:
Failure to File Proof of Service are set for January 2, 2024.
Discussion
Petitioner
seeks to confirm an April 6, 2023 contractual arbitration award.
Service of the
Petition and Notice of Hearing
The petition, written notice of the time and place of the
hearing on the petition, and any other papers upon which the petition is based
must be served in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for service
of such petition and notice. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1290.4, subd. (a).) If the
arbitration agreement does not specify the required manner of service and the
person being served has not yet appeared in the proceeding and has not yet
previously been served, then service of the petition within the State must be
made in the same manner as service of a summons and complaint pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 415.10 et seq. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subd. (b)(1).)
On July 13, 2023, the Petition was filed. On July 25, 2023, the
Notice of Petition was filed. On August 10, 2023, Petitioner filed two proofs
of service, which reflected that substitute service of, inter alia, the
Petition and Notice of Petition was effectuated as to LokiTap and Mirzoian on
August 8, 2023 and that copies of the aforesaid documents had been mailed to
them on August 10, 2023. Petitioner also filed a due diligence declaration as
to Mirzoian on August 10, 2023.
The court determines that LokiTap and Mirzoian were provided
with adequate notice.
