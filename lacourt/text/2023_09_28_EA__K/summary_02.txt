And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is unsure if a request for default has been filed against Liu, a defendant in the Superior Court of California (SAC). A previous request for default was entered against Liu, but no answer has been filed. The judge is considering the application of Code of Civil Procedure § 583.240, which excludes time from calculations when certain conditions exist, such as the defendant not being amenable to the process of the court or the prosecution being stayed. The judge will likely rule on how to proceed with service of process and whether Liu's lack of response will result in a default judgment.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is unclear whether Liu, a defendant, is actively litigating the case or not. A prior request for default was entered against Liu, and no answer has been filed. The judge is considering Code of Civil Procedure § 583.240, which sets rules for computing the time within which service must be made. The judge is attempting to determine whether any of the conditions outlined in the statute (such as the defendant being unavailable, a stay of prosecution, or litigation over service validity) may have affected the timing of service. The judge's goal is to clarify the situation and determine whether Liu is indeed litigating the case.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a request for entry of default against defendant Liu. The Judge notes that it is unclear whether Liu is actively litigating the case, as no Answer has been filed in response to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC). A prior request for default was entered against Liu, but it is unclear whether a new request for entry of default has been filed. The Judge cites Code of Civil Procedure § 583.240, which provides that certain conditions, such as the defendant's inability to be served or a stay in the proceedings, can toll the time for service. The Judge must determine whether Liu is litigating the case and whether the request for entry of default should be granted. The ruling highlights the importance of determining the validity of service and the plaintiff's control over the discovery of relevant facts and evidence.

The plaintiff has not served Liu with the SAC, and Liu has not filed an Answer as to the SAC.
