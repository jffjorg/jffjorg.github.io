Civil Procedure § 583.240 provides as follows: “In computing the time within
which service must be made pursuant to this article, there shall be excluded
the time during which any of the following conditions existed: (a) The
defendant was not amenable to the process of the court. (b) The prosecution of
the action or proceedings in the action was stayed and the stay affected
service. (c) The validity of service was the subject of litigation by the
parties. (d) Service, for any other reason, was impossible, impracticable, or
futile due to causes beyond the plaintiff's control. Failure to discover
relevant facts or evidence is not a cause beyond the plaintiff's control for
the purpose of this subdivision.”
