And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case between Francine Mitchell, a Hispanic female who has worked for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) for 24 years, and CDCR. Mitchell alleges racial discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, while CDCR moves for judgment on the pleadings to dismiss certain causes of action. The judge denies CDCR's motion as moot in part (i.e., as to the second through fifth causes of action) and denies it in part (i.e., as to the allegations of retaliation and harassment in the sixth cause of action). The judge notes that the court previously sustained CDCR's demurrer to the second through fifth causes of action without leave to amend, and that Mitchell's first amended complaint remains the operative pleading. The judge also declines to rule on the merits of CDCR's Request for Judicial Notice, finding it unnecessary and irrelevant to the disposition of the motion.
