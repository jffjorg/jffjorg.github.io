This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case between Francine Mitchell, a Hispanic female who has worked for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) for 24 years, and CDCR. Mitchell alleges racial discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, while CDCR moves for judgment on the pleadings to dismiss certain causes of action. The judge denies CDCR's motion as moot in part (i.e., as to the second through fifth causes of action) and denies it in part (i.e., as to the allegations of retaliation and harassment in the sixth cause of action). The judge notes that the court previously sustained CDCR's demurrer to the second through fifth causes of action without leave to amend, and that Mitchell's first amended complaint remains the operative pleading. The judge also declines to rule on the merits of CDCR's Request for Judicial Notice, finding it unnecessary and irrelevant to the disposition of the motion.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the second through fifth causes of action and the allegations of retaliation and harassment in the sixth cause of action. The defendant, California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), moves for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (SAC) does not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The court finds that the second through fifth causes of action were previously dismissed by the court on October 8, 2021, and therefore, the motion is moot in part. The court also finds that the allegations of retaliation and harassment in the sixth cause of action are not properly raised in a motion for judgment on the pleadings, and therefore, the motion is denied in part. The judge's decision is based on the legal standard governing demurrers and motions for judgment on the pleadings, as well as the court's previous ruling sustaining CDCR's demurrer to the second through fifth causes of action.

"In the case 20PSCV00291, the court has issued a tentative ruling for the
hearing on September 28, 2023, in department K. The case involves the plaintiff,
Francine Mitchell, and the defendant, California Department of Corrections and
Rehabilitation. The defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings to the
second amended complaint is denied as moot in part, and otherwise denied. The
ruling is based on the court's sustaining of the defendant's demurrer to the
second through fifth causes of action without leave to amend. However, the
plaintiff is not obligated to file a third amended complaint deleting the
second through fifth causes of action. The defendant's motion is also denied
as improper for the allegations of retaliation and harassment in the sixth
cause of action, as a motion for judgment on the pleadings does not lie as to
part of a cause of action. The court declines to rule on the merits of the
defendant's request for judicial notice as unnecessary and irrelevant to the
disposition of the motion."
