On July 8, 2019, minor Plaintiffs
J.G., A.Z., B.W., and J.C., by and through their guardians ad litem, filed this
action against the Los Angeles Unified School District and Daniel Ayon. The
complaint asserts causes of action for: (1) negligent hiring, supervision,
training and retention; (2) sexual harassment in violation of Civil Code §§
51.9 and 52; (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (4) sexual
assault/battery. The complaint alleges the named Plaintiffs attended Amestoy
Elementary School and were enrolled in an afterschool program between August
2018 and April 2019. The complaint alleges Defendant Ayon worked at the
afterschool program and sexually assaulted Plaintiffs on school grounds during
the afterschool program hours.

Angeles Unified School District, et al, related within the meaning of

meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300. The First Amended Complaint
in 20STCV01832 alleges Plaintiff A.C. also attended the afterschool program at
Amestoy and was sexually assaulted by Defendant Ayon.
 
On June 18, 2021, Judge Fujie
issued an order on the parties’ stipulation consolidating 19STCV23747,
19STCV30462, and 20STCV01832 for all purposes. 
 
On August 31, 2023, Judge Fujie
issued an order finding 19STCV23747 and 23TRCV02505 M.M. v. Daniel Ayon, et
al, were not related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule
3.300. The complaint in 23TRCV02505 alleges Plaintiff M.M. also attended the afterschool program at

hearing set for May 28, 2024 and 23TRCV02505 is currently pending in Department
M of the Torrance Courthouse with the next hearing set for June 13, 2024.
 
Standard 
 
Pursuant to Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule
3.3(f)(3), “[i]n the event that the judge designated under California Rules of
Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(A)(B)(C) to make the decision, does not order related
any of the cases set forth in the Notice of Related Cases, any party may file a
motion to have the cases related. Department 1 shall hear the motion, if the
cases are all pending in the Central District or are pending in two or more
different districts.” (See also Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D).)
 
The
Court Finds the Cases are Related 
 
As noted above, Judge Fujie issued
an order declining to relate 19STCV23747 with 23TRCV02505 on August 31, 2023. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’
motion is properly before Department 1. (Cal. R. Ct., rule
3.300(h)(1)(D), LASC Local Rule 3.3(f)(3).)  

 
Cases
are related when they (1) involve the same parties and are based on the same or
similar claims, (2) arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact, (3) involve claims against,
title to, possession of, or damages to the same property, or (4) are likely for
other reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard
by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a).)
 
Plaintiffs note six of seven plaintiffs with allegations
against Defendant Ayon have had their cases related and consolidated. Having
been filed after the consolidation order, 23TRCV02505 is the only case not made
part of the lead case. 
 
While the cases involve the same or similar claims, they do
not involve the same parties as the cases have different plaintiffs. (Cal. R.
Ct., rule 3.300(a)(1).) However, the cases do arise from the same or
substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the
determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact.
The cases arise out of allegations of a similar pattern of conduct by Defendant
Ayon during the same afterschool program. The cases will require the determination
of identical questions of law and fact regarding Defendant Ayon’s conduct,
issues surrounding any concurrent criminal proceedings, as well as the
knowledge, conduct, and potential liability of the school district. Given the
substantial similarities between the cases, they will also require a
substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges.
(Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(4).) Having a single judicial officer resolve all
disputes in cases related to Ayon’s alleged conduct promotes judicial
efficiency and guards against inconsistent rulings. 
 
The Court finds the cases are related within the meaning of
California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a) and the motion is GRANTED.
