And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the motion for reconsideration of the order denying retroactive filing of complaint. The Judge finds that Jehan Zeb Mir, the plaintiff, is a vexatious litigant subject to an expanded prefiling order, which requires him to obtain permission for all new litigation, whether in propria persona or through an attorney. The Judge rejects Mir's arguments that the prefiling order has lapsed or has been vacated, and holds that Mir remains bound by the order. The Judge also finds that Mir's lawsuits have been dismissed due to his failure to obtain prefiling permission. The motion for reconsideration is denied in its entirety.
