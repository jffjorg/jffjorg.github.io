Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the motion for reconsideration of the order denying retroactive filing of complaint. The motion was filed by Jehan Zeb Mir, who has been declared a vexatious litigant multiple times in the past. The court found that Mir failed to demonstrate that reconsideration was warranted, citing the lack of new or different facts, circumstances, or law. The court also found that Mir's arguments were based on the same contentions that were previously rejected. The court's decision is supported by the Code of Civil Procedure sections 391 and 391.7, which govern the filing of lawsuits and the treatment of vexatious litigants.
