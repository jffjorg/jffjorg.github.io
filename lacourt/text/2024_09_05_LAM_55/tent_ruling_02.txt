BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs Stephenie Jarin and LA Duchesse, LTD
brought this action against Defendant Norton Associates, LLC, alleging breach
of contract and several tort claims. 
The causes of action included in the operative
complaint are: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of the covenant of good faith
and fair dealing; (3) private nuisance; (4) violation of penal code 496; (5)
trespass; (6) battery; (7) unfair business practices; (8) intentional
infliction of emotional distress; and (9) violation of civil code section 51.9.
Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case without
prejudice.  
Defendant moves for Attorney’s Fees and Costs.
Plaintiffs oppose.  
 
JUDCIAL NOTICE
Plaintiffs’ request for judicial notice of the
complaint and judgment in the parties’ related unlawful detainer action is
granted.  
 
LEGAL STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b),
provides “Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party
is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.”
Prevailing party “includes … a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered…”
Code Civ. Proc. § 1032, subd., (a)(4).    
“A party may not recover attorney fees unless
expressly authorized by statute or contract.” Code Civ. Proc., § 1021. “In the
absence of a statute authorizing the recovery of attorney fees, the parties may
agree on whether and how to allocate attorney fees.” Brown Bark III, L.P. v.
Haver (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 809, 818. (Citing Xuereb v. Marcus
& Millichap, Inc. (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1341 (Xuereb)). “[P]arties
may agree to award attorney fees on claims sounding in both contract and tort.”
Ibid.  
The moving party bears the burden of establishing
entitlement to attorney fees. Christian Research Institute v. Alnor
(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1320.  
1. Whether Defendant is a Prevailing Party Entitled to
Recover Costs.
Here, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case. A “voluntary
dismissal of a complaint is a ‘dismissal’ within the meaning of Code of Civil
Procedure section 1032. County of Santa Barbara v. David R. (1988) 200
Cal.App.3d 98, 101) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly,
Defendant is the prevailing party regarding costs under section 1032.
Defendant’s costs totaled $1,745.15, including $1,192.60
for electronic filing and service, $380 in filing and motion fees, and $172.55
for copies of court documents. 
Plaintiffs make no objection as to these costs. Therefore,
Defendant’s motion is granted as to costs. 

2. Whether Civil Code section 1717 Prohibits Awarding
Defendant Attorney’s Fees 
Plaintiffs argue that because they voluntarily
dismissed their complaint, section 1717, subdivision (b)(2) prevents Defendant
from recovering attorney’s fees. Opposition pp. 4:9-9:8. 
Defendant argues that section 1717 does not apply because
its motion is authorized by Code of Civil Procedure 1033.5 and the attorney’s
fee provision in the lease. Reply pp. 2:12-3:9. 
Section 1717 converts an otherwise unilateral attorney
fee provision in a contract into a reciprocal provision, allowing the
prevailing party to recover attorney’s fees. Santisas v. Goodin (1998)
17 Cal.4th 599, 611 (Santisas). However, section 1717, subdivision
(b)(2) provides “When a plaintiff files a complaint containing causes of action
within the scope of section 1717 (that is, causes of action sounding in
contract and based on a contract containing an attorney fee provision), and the
plaintiff thereafter voluntarily dismisses the action, section 1717 bars the
defendant from recovering attorney fees incurred in defending those causes of
action, even though the contract on its own terms authorizes recovery of those
fees.” Id. 617. “Moreover, in those circumstances, Civil Code section
1717 cannot be circumvented by seeking fees under the general cost provisions
of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032- 1033.5) or under
section 1021 of the Code of Civil Procedure.” Exxess Electronixx v. Heger
Realty Corp. (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 698, 707 (citing, Santisas supra,
17 Cal.4th at 606-607 & fn. 4; id. at 623-624 (conc. opn. of
Mosk, J.)).
However, “if the voluntarily dismissed action also
asserts causes of action that do not sound in contract, those causes of action
are not covered by section 1717, and the attorney fee provision, depending upon
its wording, may afford the defendant a contractual right, not affected by
section 1717” Santisas, supra, 17 Cal.4th at 617.
Here, because Plaintiffs
voluntarily dismissed the complaint Civil Code section 1717 bars recovery of
attorney fees on all counts “on a contract.” This includes both the breach of
contract, and the breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims.
See Smith v. Home Loan Funding, Inc. (2011)
192 Cal.App.4th 1331, 1337. 
However, insofar as Defendant
seeks to recover attorney fees for its defense against Plaintiffs’ tort claims,
that depends on the wording of the lease’s attorney’s fee provision.
3. Whether the Attorney’s Fee Provision Includes Tort
Causes of Action
Defendant argues that all the
causes of action are inherently related to the lease and the parties’
relationship as landlord and tenant and as such should be considered actions
under the lease. Reply at p. 2:18-21.
 
“As to tort claims, the question
of whether to award attorneys’ fees turns on the language of the contractual
attorneys’ fee provision, i.e., whether the party seeking fees has ‘prevailed’
within the meaning of the provision and whether the type of claim is within the
scope of the provision.” Exxess Electronixx v. Heger Realty Corp, supra, 64
Cal.App.4th at 708 (citing Santisas, supra, 17 Cal.4th 599, 602,
608-609, 617, 619.) 
 
“Under statutory rules of contract interpretation, the
mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs
interpretation. Such intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the
written provisions of the contract. The ‘clear and explicit’ meaning of these
provisions, interpreted in their ‘ordinary and popular sense,’ unless ‘used by
the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage’
controls judicial interpretation. Thus, if the meaning a layperson would
ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous, we apply that meaning.” Santisas,
supra, 17 Cal.4th at 608 (citations omitted) (internal quotations omitted).

The “same meaning rule” is “a rule of contract
interpretation requiring that an identical phrase or word used in a contract be
given the same meaning throughout the contract in the absence of any anything
in the contract suggesting otherwise.” People ex rel. Lockyer v. R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co. (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 516, 526.
Here, the attorney’s fee
provision provides “In the event of any action or proceeding brought by either
party against the other under this lease, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to recover for the fees of its attorneys in such action or proceeding,
including costs of appeal, if any, in such amount as the court may adjudge
reasonable as attorneys’ fees. In addition, should it become necessary for
Lessor to employee legal counsel to enforce any of the provisions herein
contained, Lessee agrees to pay all attorneys’ fees and court costs reasonably
incurred.” Moving papers Ex. A at p. 21 ¶ N (emphasis added).
 
It is undisputed that Plaintiffs’
tort claims all related to the lease or the tenancy it created.  However, Civil Code section 1717 applies only
to actions “on a contract” and “has consistently been held not to afford
recovery of fees for tort claims arising out of or related to such a contract.”
Moallem v. Coldwell Banker Com. Group, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1827,
1830. In contrast, courts have held provisions allowing attorney’s fees in any
action “arising out of” the contract broad enough to apply to tort causes of
action. Id. at 1831; see Xuereb v. Marcus &
Millichap, Inc. (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1344 (interpreting
broadly an attorney fee provision applicable to any lawsuit to which “this
Agreement gives rise”).
 
Here, the operative language, “under
this lease” is closer to the narrow statutory language, “on a contract” than it
is the broad “arising out of the contract” provisions seen in other cases. 
 
This view is supported by other uses of the phrase “under
this lease” elsewhere in the lease. The phrase first appears in a provision
addressing chronic delinquency which provides “Lessor shall have the right, in
addition to all other remedies under this Lease and at law, to
require that Base Rental, as well as all additional rental due hereunder, be
paid by Lessee quarterly, in advance.” Moving papers Ex. A at p. 4 ¶ D
(emphasis added). The distinction between remedies under the lease, and
remedies at law suggests that the parties understood the phrase “under this
lease” in a narrow rather than a broad sense. 
Because Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the
complaint, Civil Code section 1717 precludes an attorney award for the counts
sounding in contract. Moreover, the lease’s attorney’s fee provision is not
broad enough to apply to the tort claims. Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for
attorney’s fees is denied.  
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, Defendants motion is
granted as to costs, but denied as to attorney’s fees.
