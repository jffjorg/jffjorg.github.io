As for the summary text, here is a possible version:

"Defendant Norton Associates, LLC has moved for attorney's fees and costs following the voluntary dismissal of the case by Plaintiffs Stephenie Jarin and LA Duchesse, LTD. The Court has tentatively ruled that Defendant is entitled to recover costs in the amount of $1,745.15, as the moving party bears the burden of establishing entitlement to costs. However, the Court has denied Defendant's request for attorney's fees, as Civil Code section 1717 precludes an attorney award for counts sounding in contract. Additionally, the Court has determined that the lease's attorney's fee provision is not broad enough to apply to the tort claims. The Court will issue a final ruling after considering any opposition to this tentative ruling."
