And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoena issued by the defendant to Venable LLP. The plaintiff argues that the subpoena is untimely and seeks to quash it. The judge finds that the untimeliness of the motion is not grounds for denial and that the subpoena is relevant and necessary for the defendant to obtain information related to the plaintiff's injuries. The judge notes that the plaintiff herself acknowledged the common issues of law and fact with respect to her injuries and damages. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's motion to quash is denied.
