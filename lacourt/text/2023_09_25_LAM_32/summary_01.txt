And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to quash a subpoena issued by the defendant to Venable LLP. The plaintiff seeks to quash the subpoena, which was served on June 30, 2023, and requires the production of documents related to the plaintiff's prior lawsuit in San Diego County (G6 Action). The defendant argues that the plaintiff has not shown good cause for quashing the subpoena, as the documents are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action and may lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

The judge finds that the untimeliness of the motion is not grounds for denial, as the failure to provide notice to the deposition officer does not invalidate the motion. The judge also finds that the documents requested are relevant, as they relate to injuries the plaintiff suffered one year prior to the elevator incident, and may be used to explore alternative causes of the plaintiff's injuries.

Consequently, the judge denies the plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoena.

English text:

This tentative ruling is for the case number 20STCV40384, scheduled for a hearing on September 25, 2023, in Dept 32. The case involves Plaintiff Ana Marie Monzon and Defendants Equitable Plaza, LLC, Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC, and Schindler Elevator Corporation.

In October 2020, Plaintiff filed a lawsuit against Defendants for negligence, premises liability, and strict products liability, stemming from injuries she sustained from a falling elevator in September 2020. Plaintiff had previously suffered a slip and fall incident in September 2019, leading to a separate lawsuit in San Diego County.

Defendant Schindler Elevator Corporation served a subpoena to Venable LLP, requesting documents related to the 2019 slip and fall incident. Plaintiff filed a motion to quash the subpoena on August 15, 2023.

The legal standard for quashing a subpoena requires good cause to be shown. The Court finds that Defendant has articulated good cause for the records, as the documents are relevant to potential alternative causes of Plaintiff's injuries.

Therefore, Plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoena is denied.
