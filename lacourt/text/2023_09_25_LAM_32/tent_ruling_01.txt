  Case No.:  20STCV40384
  Hearing Date:  September 25, 2023
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to quash 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On October 21, 2020, Plaintiff Ana
Marie Monzon filed this action against Defendants Equitable Plaza, LLC,
Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC, and Schindler Elevator Corporation. The
complaint asserts causes of action for negligence, premises liability, and
strict products liability stemming from injuries Plaintiff sustained in a
falling elevator in September 2020. 
            Plaintiff had also suffered a prior
slip and fall in September 2019, which resulted in a lawsuit in San Diego County,
Ana Marie Monzon v. G6 Hospitality, LLC (G6 Action). Plaintiff filed the
G6 Action in March 2020, seven months prior to the instant lawsuit. Believing
there to be overlapping injuries between both cases, Defendant Schindler
Elevator Corporation issued a subpoena to Venable LLP, requesting documents
related to the G6 Action. 
            On August 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to quash the subpoena to Venable LLP. Defendant filed its
opposition on September 7, 2023. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
“If a subpoena requires the attendance of
a witness or the production of books, documents, electronically stored
information, or other things …, the court, upon motion reasonably made by [a party]
. . . may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or
directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall
declare, including protective orders.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (a),
(b).) Good cause must be shown to compel a nonparty to produce documents. (See Calcor
Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 224.)   
DISCUSSION
I.
Timeliness of Motion
            Notice of a motion to quash “shall
be given to the witness and deposition officer at least five days prior to
production.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1985.3(g).) Here, Defendant served Plaintiff
with notice of the subpoena on June 30, 2023. (Chung Decl., Ex. A, B.) The
subpoena specified a production date of July 28, 2023. (Ibid.) Plaintiff
did not file this motion until August 15, 2023.
            Defendant argues that this means
Plaintiff cannot move to quash the subpoena. However, “[t]he failure to provide
notice to the deposition officer shall not invalidate the motion to quash or
modify the subpoena duces tecum . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1985.3(g).) Therefore,
the untimeliness of the motion is not grounds for denial. 
II.
Relevance
“[A]ny party may obtain discovery
regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in
that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.) The same standard applies to information sought from
nonparties. (See Catholic Mutual Relief Society v. Superior Court (2007)
42 Cal.4th 358, 366.) 
Records pertaining to injuries Plaintiff
suffered just one year prior to the elevator incident are relevant because Defendant
is entitled to explore alternative causes of Plaintiff’s injuries. Plaintiff herself
acknowledged “the common issues of law and fact with respect to [her] injuries
and damages” when she moved to consolidate the two cases. (Chung Decl., Ex. D
at 2:20-22.) With the exception of attorney-client communications and work
product, the information sought is not privileged. Plaintiff placed the requested
records at issue by alleging injuries in this case that are similar to the ones
alleged in the G6 Action. (Id. at 2:6-19.) The Court finds that Defendant
has articulated good cause for the records. (See Opp. 4:3-7.)
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to quash is
DENIED.
