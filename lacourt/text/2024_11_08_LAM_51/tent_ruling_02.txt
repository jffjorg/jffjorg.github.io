It is unclear whether Plaintiff served a copy of Rockingham. It is also unclear

Rockingham as the third party claimant as the burden of proof. (CCP § 720.360; Oxford Street Properties, LLC v.
Rehabilitation Assocs., LLC (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 296, 307.) Plaintiff
would have the burden of proof if she claimed fraudulent transfer. (See Whitehouse v. Six Corp. (1995) 40
Cal.App.4th 527, 534-535.) However, upon reviewing the Opposition, Plaintiff
has not alleged fraudulent transfer.
