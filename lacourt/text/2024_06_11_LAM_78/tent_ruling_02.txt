Plaintiff John Brosnan alleges that he rented a commercial space in Los Angeles which was part of a larger property with multiple units. In May 2019, Plaintiff parked his trailer at the property. Plaintiff’s neighbor, Salima Surani, entered his trailer and caused it to be moved to an adjacent parking lot owned by a different entity. The trailer was towed and its contents emptied. PROCEDURAL HISTORY On November 17, 2022, Plaintiff John Brosnan filed his Complaint against Defendants RHS Surani Inc., dba Popsicle Studio LA, and Salima Surani.On May 18, 2023, the Court granted Surani’s Anti-SLAPP motion to strike as to the second cause of action, sustained Surani’s demurrer to the first cause of action with leave to amend, and sustained Surani’s demurrer to the third cause of action without leave to amend.On August 9, 2023, the Court granted Defendants’ ex parte application to dismiss following Plaintiff’s failure to amend.On August 9, 2023, the Court dismissed this action with prejudice.On October 20, 2023, the Court entered judgment in favor of Defendants.On May 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to vacate order of dismissal.DISCUSSION Plaintiff moves to vacate dismissal on the grounds that the case was dismissed due to his counsel’s failure to properly respond to Defendants’ motions.Per Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b), a court may relieve a party or his counsel from a judgment, dismissal, or order against him because of his “mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” A party seeking relief must file a motion to set aside dismissal “no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 473) The six-month time limit is jurisdictional, and a court has no authority to excuse a party’s noncompliance with the time limit. (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 981-982; Arambula v. Union Carbide Corp. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 333, 340.)Here, the court entered judgment in favor of Defendants on October 20, 2023. Plaintiff did not file this motion until May 3, 2024, six months and thirteen days after the Court entered judgment in favor of Defendants. The Court no longer has jurisdiction to grant relief under Code Civ. Proc., section 473. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to vacate dismissal is denied.DATED: June 11, 2024                                                                    ________________________________ Hon.
