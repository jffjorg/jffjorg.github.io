And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies the cross-defendants' motion for terminating sanctions and their request for evidentiary sanctions. However, the court grants the cross-defendants' request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,760. The court finds that Del Sol's counsel, Ilya Alekseyeff, engaged in discovery abuse by deliberately delaying the supplemental responses and refusing to pay sanctions as ordered. The court awards Cross-Defendants additional sanctions of $2,760 for 6.9 hours of attorney time at a rate of $400 per hour and filing fees. These sanctions are imposed jointly and severally against Del Sol and Alekseyeff. The court also finds that the outstanding sanctions imposed against Del Sol are still outstanding and immediately enforceable through a writ of execution.
