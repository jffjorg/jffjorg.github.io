And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case. The motion has been denied. The court notes that no proof of service was filed with the motion. The court also finds that the plaintiff's counsel failed to properly respond to the defendants' motions, leading to the dismissal. The plaintiff's motion is denied because it was filed more than six months after the court entered judgment in favor of the defendants, and the court lacks jurisdiction to grant relief under Code of Civil Procedure, section 473.
