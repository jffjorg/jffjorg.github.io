Plaintiff Encino Newcastle Homeowner’s Association (“Encino Newcastle”) hired Defendant Del Sol Property Management (“Del Sol”) as its property manager in January 2010. Del Sol is owned and operated by Defendant Sinitsin. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants used their position to siphon money from Plaintiff, convert its property, enter improper contracts and agreements, and have refused to return Plaintiff’s books and records. Plaintiff also seeks specific performance and declaratory relief. Defendant Del Sol in turn brought a cross-complaint against the moving party and others.PROCEDURAL HISTORY On April 1, 2021, Plaintiff filed its Complaint against Del Sol and Sinitsin.On April 27, 2022, Defendants Answered and filed a Cross-Complaint against Encino Newcastle, Kourosh Yaghoobian, Giv Bastanielahabadi, and Allen Tabibi.On June 13, 2022, Cross-Defendants dismissed their cause of action for defamation.On September 28, 2022, Cross-Complainants filed their First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”).On December 20, 202, December 26, 2023, December 27, 203, and January 4, 2024, the Court granted motions to compel Del Sol’s further responses to requests for production (RPDs) and special interrogatories (SROGs).On April 17, 2024, Cross-Defendants Encino Newcastle, Kourosh Yaghoobian, and Giv Bastanielahabadi filed this motion for terminating sanctions.On May 29, 2024, Del Sol filed an opposition and dismissed Giv Bastanielahabadi as a Cross-Defendant.DISCUSSION Cross-Defendants move for terminating sanctions against Del Sol on the grounds that Del Sol failed to comply with the Court’s prior discovery orders. In the alternative, Cross-Defendants seek evidentiary sanctions. Cross-Defendants also seek monetary sanctions.“If a party…fails to obey an order compelling further response to interrogatories, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction.” (Code Civ. Proc., section 2030.300(e).) In lieu of or in addition to these sanctions, the court may impose a monetary sanction. (Id.)“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390, quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246.)  “Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.  But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)   “Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.” (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang, supra, 77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 [terminating sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and subsequently granting default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with one court order to produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions imposed against the plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various discovery statutes].) An evidence sanction prohibits a party from introducing designated matters in evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., section 2023.030(c).)“Discovery sanctions must be tailored in order to remedy the offending party's discovery abuse, should not give the aggrieved party more than what it is entitled to, and should not be used to punish the offending party.” (Karlsson v. Ford Motor Co. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1202, 1217.)¿ “Although the court has discretion in choosing a sanction, this discretion must be exercised in a manner consistent with the basic purposes of such sanctions, e.g., to compel disclosure of discoverable information.”  (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1193 (citation omitted).)  “Furthermore, the sanction chosen should not provide a windfall to the other party, by putting the prevailing party in a better position than if he or she had obtained the discovery sought and it had been favorable.”  (Ibid. (citations omitted).) Here, Cross-Defendant’s counsel testifies that he originally propounded SROGs and RPDs on Del Sol in December 2022. (Erakat Decl., ¶2.) After the Court granted Cross-Defendants’ motions to compel Del Sol’s further responses to these discovery requests, Del Sol served supplemental responses to RPDs and requested additional time to serve supplemental responses to SROGs. (Id., ¶4.) As of the date this motion was filed, Cross-Defendants have not served supplemental responses to SROGs. (Id., ¶5.) Del Sol’s counsel also had not discussed sanctions with Del Sol’s manager, stating sanctions should instead be included in the final judgment in this matter. (Id., ¶6.) The Court’s orders granting Cross-Defendant’s motions for further responses to SROGs and RPDs required Del Sol to serve further responses and pay sanctions within 20 days after the date of the order. The sanctions imposed against Del Sol were $1,720, $860, $860, $860, and $860.In opposition, Del Sol’s counsel, Ilya Alekseyeff, argues extensively that he discovered Cross-Defendants Yaghoobian and Tabibi stole from the Newcastle Homeowners Association. However, this discovery is not relevant to this motion, nor does it justify Del Sol’s failure to comply with the Court’s orders issued in December 2023 and January 2024. Alekseyeff withheld the supplemental responses to SROGs because he had not received compliance with his subpoenas and believes sanctions are not warranted because Cross-Defendants suffered no prejudice by the untimely responses. (Opp. pp.9-10.) Del Sol served supplemental responses to SROGs on May 27, 2024, about three months after the deadline set in the Court’s orders. (Opp., Exh. AA.) Alekseyeff represents that he “decided to complete…[his] independent investigation…and then provide a comprehensive response,” meaning he deliberately served late supplemental responses in violation of the Court’s orders. (Alekseyeff Decl., ¶68.) With respect to the delinquent sanctions, Alekseyeff believes that it makes “more sense to wait until the verdict in the case to resolve any financial disputes between them” and that Cross-Defendants should pursue payment of sanctions through execution. (Opp. p.4.) The Court finds that terminating and evidence sanctions are not appropriate here because Del Sol has served the missing supplemental responses to SROGs, though late. However, Alekseyeff has engaged in discovery abuse by deliberately delaying the supplemental responses and refusing to pay sanctions as ordered. The Court’s December 2023 and January 2024 orders were not ambiguous or up for interpretation. The responses and sanctions were due 20 days after those orders were issued. Alekseyeff had no reasonable basis for delaying the response and refusing to pay sanctions. The Court awards Cross-Defendants additional sanctions of $2,760 for 6.9 hours of attorney time at a rate of $400 per hour and filing fees. These sanctions are imposed jointly and severally against Del Sol and Alekseyeff. These sanctions are to be paid within five days after the date of this order. As for the outstanding sanctions, the orders imposing sanctions have the force and effect of money judgments which are immediately enforceable through a writ of execution.
