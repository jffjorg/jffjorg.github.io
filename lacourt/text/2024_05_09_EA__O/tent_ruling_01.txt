Discussion
 
Counsel Darvish of the Darvish Firm, APC seeks to be
relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs Paul Bohn and Limo World, LLC because of
various conflicts including, but not limited to, “payment of obligations relating
to expenses and fees” and “other Conflicts which make it unreasonably difficult
to represent these Clients.” (See MC-052 Form.)
 
Here, as (i) all parties have been served with notice of the
motion, (ii) Counsel has complied with the California Rules of Court by
submitting the MC-051, 052, and 053 forms, and (iii) has provided a
satisfactory explanation for the need to be relieved as counsel, the court
finds good cause to grant the motion. As for potential prejudice, there are no
substantive motions on calendar. There is an MSC set for 6/13/24, which allows
for over one month for Plaintiffs to retain new counsel, which is sufficient time.
Thus, absent an opposition by Plaintiffs, the court GRANTS the motion. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion to be relieved as counsel
is granted, effective upon serving
this court’s order relieving Counsel sent to Plaintiffs, Defendant, and all
other parties who have appeared in the case.
