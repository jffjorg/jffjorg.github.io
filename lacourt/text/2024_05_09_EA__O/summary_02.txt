And here is the English summary:

The Judge issues a tentative ruling on Edward Echneique's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The case arises from the breach of a rental agreement, and Edward filed suit against Reyna Mejina (also known as Reyna Mejia) and Jimmy Blaney. Edward argues that he was excusably negligent in failing to respond to the lawsuit, but the Judge finds that he has failed to provide any factual basis to support his claim. The Judge denies the motion to set aside the dismissal without prejudice.
