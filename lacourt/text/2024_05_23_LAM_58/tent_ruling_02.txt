Background
            Plaintiff Bishoy Hanna filed this
action on January 2, 2024 against Defendants Crystal Boultinghouse (Boultinghouse)
and Josh Freeman Stinn (Stinn). On March 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed his operative
first amended complaint (FAC) alleging cause of action for (1) conspiracy to violate
42 U.S.C. § 1983, (2) due process violation, and (3) malicious prosecution. The
complaint is vague and at times unintelligible. It is unclear whether all of
the causes of action are directed at Defendant Stinn. For purposes of this
ruling, the Court assumes all causes of action are alleged against him.
 
            Defendant Boultinghouse is an
attorney who represented the mother of a child who is the subject of a custody
dispute between the mother and Plaintiff. The FAC alleges that Stinn, a Los
Angeles Superior Court Judge, and Boultinghouse devised a plan to “deny
pleadings” made by Plaintiff in a child custody hearing. (Id. at ¶ 7.) Judge
Stinn issued a domestic violence restraining order against Plaintiff in favor
of Boultinghouse’s client. (Id. at ¶¶ 9-10.) 
 
            On March 19, 2024, the Court granted
Boultinghouse’s special motion to strike pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16.
 
            On April 8, 2024, Stinn demurred to the
FAC, arguing that the claims are barred based on absolute judicial immunity and
are insufficiently pleaded.  Plaintiff filed
no opposition. The meet-and-confer requirements have been met.  (Overton Decl., ¶ 2-3.) 
 
Judicial Notice
 
         Stinn requests the Court
to take judicial notice of the following documents: (1) Register of Actions in Giannella
v. Hanna, Superior Court case no. 23SMRO00410; (2) Register of Actions in Hanna
v. Giannella, Superior Court case no. 23STFL10014; and (3) Register of
Actions in Giannella v. Hanna, Superior Court case no. 24STFL00816.
(RJN, Exhs. 1-3.) The request is granted pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
452(d).
 
Legal Standard
 
            A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial
notice.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30,
subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the
sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of law.”  (Postley v. Harvey (1984) 153
Cal.App.3d 280, 286.)  “In the
construction of a pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its
allegations must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice
between the parties.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)  The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the
demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . ..” ’ ” (Berkley v. Dowds
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  
 
Discussion
 
Absolute Judicial Immunity
 
            Stinn argues that the claims asserted against him are barred under the
doctrine of absolute judicial immunity. (Demurrer at pp. 3-5.) 
 
The Court agrees. The allegations against Judge Stinn concern his
performance as a judicial officer, which triggers application of the doctrine
of absolute judicial immunity. (FAC ¶¶ 7-9; Howard v. Drapkin (1990) 222
Cal.App.3d 843, 851 [“Judicial immunity bars civil actions against judges for
acts performed in the exercise of their judicial functions.”].) Plaintiff
attempts to plead around this doctrine by contending that Stinn was not
engaging in his judicial functions but conspiring against him to violate his
due process rights. (FAC ¶¶ 6, 14-15.) However, these allegations are
insufficient because even judicial acts that are alleged to have been done
corruptly are covered by this doctrine. (Tagliavia v. County of Los Angeles
(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 759, 761 [“The decisions of this state uniformly and
consistently grant immunity from civil suit to judges in the exercise of their
judicial functions. [Citation.] That is true even if the acts are in excess of
the jurisdiction of the judge and are alleged to have been done maliciously and
corruptly.”].) Therefore, the doctrine of absolute judicial immunity applies to
the judicial acts performed by Stinn. 
 
The claims asserted in the FAC are barred against Stinn. In the
interest of judicial economy, the Court declines to address the remaining
arguments presented in the demurrer. 
 
Conclusion
 
            The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.  The First Amended Complaint is dismissed with
prejudice.
