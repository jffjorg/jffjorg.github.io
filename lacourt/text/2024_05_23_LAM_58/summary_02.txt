And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The court has determined that the claims asserted against Judge Stinn are barred under the doctrine of absolute judicial immunity. The court has taken judicial notice of certain documents and has determined that the plaintiff's allegations against Judge Stinn are insufficient to overcome the doctrine of absolute judicial immunity. The court has declined to address the remaining arguments presented in the demurrer and has dismissed the first amended complaint with prejudice.
