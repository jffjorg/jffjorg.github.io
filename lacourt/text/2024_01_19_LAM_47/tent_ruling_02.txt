STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a toxic tort action alleging that Plaintiff Montoya-Bautista
developed silicosis and consequential injuries by breathing in dust from
Defendants’ stone products generated by his work as a fabricator and polisher
of stone countertops.
 
Specially Appearing Defendant Stylenquaza,
LLC, moves to quash service of the summons and complaint for lack of personal
jurisdiction. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Specially Appearing Defendant
Stylenquaza, LLC, moves to quash service of the summons and complaint for lack
of personal jurisdiction. 
 
The Court has read and considered
the motion, opposition, and reply papers filed regarding this motion and
observes that they are substantively identical to the papers filed in with
respect to Specially Appearing Defendant’s Motion to Quash in the matter Martin
Melendez-Murillo v. AKG Trading (USA) Inc., LASC Case No. 23STCV08596,
which came before the Court on January 16, 2024.  
After consideration of the
arguments raised by counsel for both sides, the Court finds good cause to
authorize focused, written jurisdictional discovery regarding the issues set
forth in the papers. The Court schedules an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC)
for February 29, 2024 at 1:30 PM. The Parties shall file an Informal Discovery
Conference Statement no later than February 22, 2024. 
 
The parties are ordered to meet and
confer regarding the necessity of further discovery, including depositions,
based on the results of written discovery. If a dispute persists between the
parties, it will be addressed at the IDC. 
 
            Specially
Appearing Defendant is not deemed to have made a general appearance, and will
not do so by responding to discovery, appearing at the IDC, or by further
responding to the motion. 
 
Specially Appearing Defendant
Stylenquaza LLC’s Motion to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint is
CONTINUED to coincide with the IDC on February 29, 2024 at 1:30 PM for
rescheduling purposes only. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
