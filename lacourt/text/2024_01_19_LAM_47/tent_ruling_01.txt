STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            Petitioner seeks court approval of a
proposed transfer of structured settlement payments.  
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Petitioner seeks court approval of a
proposed transfer of structured settlement payments.  
 
A direct or indirect transfer of structured settlement
payment rights is not effective unless the transfer has been approved by a
court order finding:  
 
(1) The
transfer is in the best interest of the payee, considering the welfare and
support of the payee’s dependents. 
 
(2) The
payee has been advised in writing by the transferee to seek independent
professional advice regarding the transfer and has either received that advice
or knowingly waived, in writing, the opportunity to receive the advice.  
 
(3) The
transferee has complied with the notification requirements pursuant to
paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), the transferee has provided the payee with a
disclosure form that complies with Section 10136, and the transfer agreement
complies with Sections 10136 and 10138.  
 
(4) The
transfer does not contravene any applicable statute or the order of any court
or other government authority. 
 
(5) The
payee understands the terms of the transfer agreement, including the terms set
forth in the disclosure statement required by Section 10136.  
 
(6) The
payee understands and does not wish to exercise the payee’s right to cancel the
transfer agreement.  
 
(Ins. Code § 10139.5(a).) 
 
As a result of a personal injury settlement entered into
when he was a minor, Payee Gilbert Becerrada. became entitled to certain
structured settlement payments. (Amended Petition ¶¶ 7-9.) 
 
Mr. Becerrada, as Payee, and Petitioner Bentzen Financial,
LLC, as Assignee, have entered into a Structured Settlement Payments Purchase
Agreement, under which Payee is to sell future payments totaling $603,979.30 in
exchange for a purchase price of $246,000. (Amended Petition Exh. A §§ 4.3-4.5.)  
 
The discounted present value of the amount being sold is $373,802.24,
calculated by applying the 5.4% discount rate used by the Internal Revenue
Service to value annuities. (Exh. A. § 4.7) The purchase price was calculated
using a discount rate of 11.2%. If Payee did not sell the right to receive
structured settlement payments but instead borrowed the net amount of $246,000.00
and paid that loan back in installments with each of the payments he is now
selling, the equivalent interest rate would be 11.2%. (Id. § 4.8.) 
 
This information has been properly disclosed to Payee by
way of the disclosure form in compliance with Insurance Code § 10136, as
required by § 10139.5(a)(3). (Amended Petition, Exh. B.) Payee was advised in
writing to seek independent professional advice, both legal and financial. (Ibid.)
Payee chose not to seek an independent professional’s advice. (Amended Petition,
Exh. E.) Thus, Petitioner has complied with the statutory disclosure
requirements. (Ins. Code § 10139.5(a)(2).) 
 
The transfer agreement (Exh. A) also complies with
Insurance Code §§ 10136 and 10138 as required by § 10139.5(a)(3). It does not
contravene any applicable statute or order of any court or other governmental
authority. (Ins. Code § 10139.5(a)(4).)  
 
Copies of the relevant portions of the annuity contract
(Exh. F), qualified assignment agreement (Id.), and underlying
structured settlement agreement (Exh. G) submitted as required by Ins. Code §
10139.5(f)(2)(E)-(F). 
 
Information About Transferor 
 
Payee is 34 years old. (Declaration of Gilbert Becerra ISO
Petition attached as Exh. C to Petition. ¶ 2).  
 
Payee resides at 44 Park Ave, Venice, CA, 90291 (¶ 1.)  
 
Payee has stated that he is married to Anna Maria Gudiel,
age 36, who resides with him as a dependent as required by Insurance Code §
10139.5(c)(2). (¶ 3.) 
 
Payee has stated that he has one minor child, Gilbert
Becerrada, Jr., age 4. (¶ 3.) The Court therefore finds
that Payee has complied with section 10139.5(c)(3).
 
Payee has indicated that he is employed as a subcontractor
for package delivery, and receives income of approximately $6,500 per month,
plus $1,500 to $2,000 from his wife’s work as a take-out delivery driver. Payee
has complied with Insurance Code § 10139.5(c)(4). (¶ 4.) 
 
Payee has stated that he has no child or spousal support
obligations, as required by Insurance Code § 10139.5(c)(5). (¶ 3.) 
 
Payee has not previously attempted other transfers, as
required by Insurance Code § 10139.5(c)(6). (¶¶ 11.) 
 
In sum, Payee has provided all information required by
Insurance Code § 10139.5(c). 
 
Payee indicates how the proceeds would be used as required
by Insurance Code § 10139.5(b)(2): He intends to use the proceeds to purchase ATMs
and vending machines to start a business, to put forward a down payment on a
home, and pay off approximately $20,000 in medical debt. (¶ 15.) He has
indicated that he is not currently experiencing a financial hardship, as
required by Insurance Code § 10139.5(b)(3). (¶ 4.)  
 
Payee has indicated that the periodic payments were not
intended for necessary living expenses or medical expenses, as required by
Insurance Code § 10139.5(b)(5)-(7). (¶¶ 6-7.) 
 
Given the foregoing, the Court finds that the transfer is
fair, reasonable and in the best interest of Payee. (Insurance Code §
10139.5(a)(1) & (b)(1)-(15).)  The Payee understands the terms of the
transfer agreement, including those set forth in the § 10136 disclosure
statement, as required by Insurance Code § 10139.5(a)(5). In signing the
California Disclosure Statement and in his declaration and affidavit in support
of to the Petition, Payee has evidenced an understanding of the right to cancel
and election not to cancel the transfer agreement, as required by Insurance
Code § 10139.5(a)(6). 
 
Petitioner has, thus, met all the procedural requirements
under the Insurance Code. Petitioner has also served a copy of the notice to
all interested parties. 
 
Accordingly, the petition for approval of transfer of
structured settlement payment rights is GRANTED. 
 
Moving party to give notice, unless waived. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
