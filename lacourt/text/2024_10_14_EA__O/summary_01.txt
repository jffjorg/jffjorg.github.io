Significant Statements:

  - "The court's previous ruling sought supplemental briefing on the 'relatedness' factor because Lenso appeared to concede purposeful availment."
  - "Though the court need not address relatedness as all three prongs must be met, the court will address the matter as it was the subject of briefing."
  - "The court determines that Lenso has not purposefully availed itself of the California forum."
  - "The court determines that plaintiffs' claims do not 'relate to' defendant's forum conduct since Lenso's conduct."

Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the motion to quash service of summons and complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction brought by Wheels International Inc. DBA Lenso Wheels. The court finds that Lenso Wheels has not purposefully availed itself of the California forum. The court concludes that Lenso Wheels' conduct, which involves selling its wheels to a distributor in Arizona, is not connected to the plaintiffs' claims of negligence and products liability arising from an accident that occurred in California. The court also rejects the argument that Lenso Wheels' activity is grounded in a consumer market, finding that the company sells its wheels to distributors, not directly to consumers. The court's decision is based on the principles of specific jurisdiction set forth in International Shoe v. Washington, Ford Motor Company v. Montana Eighth Judicial District Court, LG Chem, LTD v. Superior Court of San Diego County, Jayone Foods, Inc. v. Aekyung Industrial Co. Ltd., Carretti v. Italplast, and Luberski, Inc. v. Oleficio F.LLI Amato S.R.L.
