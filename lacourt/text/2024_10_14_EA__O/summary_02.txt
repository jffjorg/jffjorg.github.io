And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the motions of the parties in a case involving the death of a California resident. The plaintiffs have amended their complaint to include EMS Distributing LLC, alleging causes of action for negligence, strict liability, and product liability. The motion was unopposed, and the insurance company has paid the maximum amount. The evidence shows that if the detached tire from Defendant Esqueda's vehicle had not occurred, the decedent would not have died.

The judge will provide a consolidated analysis of the motions, as the arguments appear to be identical. The court will consider the issue of general jurisdiction, which involves whether the defendants have sufficient contacts with California. The judge notes that EMS Distributing LLC is the seller/distributor of the wheels, and Lenso has made sporadic sales in California.

The judge will also consider the purposeful availment prong of general jurisdiction, which involves whether the defendants have intentionally availed themselves of the California market. The judge cites relevant case law, including Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc. and Ford Motor.
