 Case Number:  22SMCV00454    Hearing Date:   November 14, 2024    Dept:  I The court will GRANT the ex parte application.  Plaintiff has suffered a medical event and
the court is informed that he needs to recover. 
The court has always maintained that unforeseen medical emergencies
constitute good cause for a continuance, and that appears to be the case
here.  The FSC and trial dates are
VACATED.  The court will discuss with the
parties when a good date for a TSC would be. 
 
The application also seeks to extend the discovery cut
offs.  The court is not sure about why
that is necessary, but if all parties agree to so extend the court will extend
the deadlines as well.  Absent such an
agreement, though, the deadlines will be tied to the earlier trial date.
