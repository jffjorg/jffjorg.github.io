 Case Number:  21SMCV00085    Hearing Date:   November 14, 2024    Dept:  I The application is GRANTED to the extent it seeks to set
aside or stay the writ as to Chayes, but it is DENIED to the extent it seeks
relief as to Lei.  The court’s reasoning
as set forth in the October 7, 2024, Minute Order remains the same.  The bond is satisfactory as to Chayes, but it
does not apply by its terms if the judgment is reversed as to Chayes but
affirmed as to Lei.  Therefore, there
ought to be no writ of attachment as to Chayes, as the bond covers that.  But there is no security as to Lei and
therefore the writ will remain in place as to her.  If she is added to the bond, then the writ
should be recalled as to her as well.
