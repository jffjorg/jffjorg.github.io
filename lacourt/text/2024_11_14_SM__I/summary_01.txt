And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the ex parte application and the motion for summary judgment. The judge has also denied the defendants' request to compel the deposition of plaintiffs' experts. The court has ruled that the discovery cut-off date was not extended despite the trial date extension, and that the parties must follow the original deadlines for expert discovery. The court has also noted that the defendants failed to bring a motion to reopen discovery despite having ample opportunity to do so. The judge has stated that the defendants' arguments are legally devoid of merit and that their position is inconsistent with the words of the Legislature. The court has also emphasized that the proper procedure for reopening discovery is to bring a motion to reopen, and that the defendants failed to follow this procedure.
