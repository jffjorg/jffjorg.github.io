And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on an application to set aside or stay a writ of attachment. The application has been granted in part, allowing the writ to be set aside or stayed as to Chayes, but denied as to Lei. The judge's reasoning remains the same as outlined in an earlier minute order from October 7, 2024. The bond posted by Chayes is satisfactory, but it does not apply if the judgment is reversed as to Chayes but affirmed as to Lei. As a result, the writ of attachment will remain in place as to Lei, but should be recalled if she is added to the bond.
