And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the ex parte application filed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has suffered a medical event and the court believes that unforeseen medical emergencies constitute good cause for a continuance. As a result, the court will vacate the scheduled Future Settlement Conference (FSC) and trial dates. The court will discuss with the parties a new date for a Trial Setting Conference (TSC). Additionally, the plaintiff's application also seeks to extend the discovery cut-offs, but the court is not sure why this is necessary. If all parties agree to extend the deadlines, the court will do so. Otherwise, the deadlines will remain tied to the earlier trial date.
