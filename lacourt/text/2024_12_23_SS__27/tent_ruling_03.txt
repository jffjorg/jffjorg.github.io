I.           
INTRODUCTION
On
March 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed the present slip and fall case. On May 14, 2024,
Defendant MV Public Transportation, Inc. (“MVPT”) served its Request to
Supplement Responses to Interrogatories on Plaintiff. (Deenihan Decl., ¶ 3.) On
June 19, 2024, MVPT’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff
requesting discovery responses. (Deenihan Decl., ¶ 4.) As of the date of filing
the instant motion, Plaintiff has failed to respond to the Request to
Supplement Responses to Interrogatories or seek an extension of time to
respond. (Deenihan Decl., ¶ 5.) Consequently, on November 27, 2024, MVPT brought
the instant motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses and request for monetary
sanctions. Plaintiff does not oppose the instant motion.
 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
A party must respond to interrogatories
and requests for production of documents within 30 days after service. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a).) If
a party to whom interrogatories or requests for production of documents are
directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for
an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) The party also waives the
right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or work-product
protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel responses
to interrogatories or production of documents other than the cut-off on hearing
discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2024.020, subd.
(a), 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) No meet and confer efforts are
required before filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.)

DISCUSSION
1.  
Motion
to Compel Responses
Here, on May 14, 2024, MVPT served
its Request to Supplement Responses to Interrogatories on Plaintiff. (Deenihan
Decl., ¶ 3.) On June 19, 2024, MVPT’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter to
Plaintiff requesting discovery responses. (Deenihan Decl., ¶ 4.) As of the date
of filing the instant motion, Plaintiff has failed to respond to the Request to
Supplement Responses to Interrogatories or seek an extension of time to
respond. (Deenihan Decl., ¶ 5.)
Plaintiff did not oppose this motion. Thus, MVPT is entitled to an order
compelling Plaintiff’s responses to the Request to
Supplement Responses to Interrogatories, without objections. 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS MVPT’s
motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to MVPT’s Request to
Supplement Responses to Interrogatories. 
2.  
Request
for Monetary Sanctions
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent
part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the
misuse of the discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of
the discovery process includes failing to respond or to submit to an authorized
method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)  
Here,
the Court finds Plaintiff’s failure to respond to MVPT’s Request to Supplement
Responses to Interrogatories a misuse of the discovery process. Plaintiff has
not opposed this motion and has provided no substantial justification or other
circumstances to make the imposition of a sanction unjust. Thus, the Court
imposes a monetary sanction on Plaintiff for their failure to respond to MVPT’s
discovery requests.  
MVPT
has requested $810.00 in attorneys' fees based on two (2) hours spent preparing
the instant motion and one (1) hour to be spent at the hearing on the instant
motion. (Deenihan Decl., ¶ 6.) The hourly rate is $250 per hour. (Id.)
In addition, the filing of this motion was subject to a $60.00 filing fee. (Id.)
Considering the simplicity of the issues involved, the Court hereby reduces the
sanctions awarded from what was requested. The Court finds it reasonable to
allocate one hour for the preparation of the motion, and reduced time for the
hearing to fifteen minutes (¼ of an hour), totaling $312.50 (1.25 hours x $250)
plus the $60 filing fee. Consequently, the court hereby orders Plaintiff and
her counsel, jointly and severally, to pay sanctions in the amount of $372.50
to MVPT, payable within 30 days of today.
 
IV.        
CONCLUSION
The Court GRANTS MVPT’s motion to
compel Plaintiff’s responses to MVPT’s Request to
Supplement Responses to Interrogatories.
The Court GRANTS MVPT’s Request for
Monetary Sanctions in the amount of $372.50. 
Responses and sanctions are due within
30 days of today.
MVPT is ordered to give notice of this
ruling.
