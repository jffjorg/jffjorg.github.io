```

Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the motions for judgment on the pleadings filed by Cross-Defendants Rachel M. Darvish and Keyvan Rahbar. The motions were filed in response to the third, fourth, and sixth causes of action in the Operative Cross Complaint filed by Defendant Maryam Rouillard. The third cause of action alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress, the fourth cause of action alleges fraud, and the sixth cause of action alleges declaratory relief.

The Judge found that Darvish's motion was denied because the argument that the third cause of action fails in part because it "alleges liability on account of Annex and the shareholders initiating the liquidation action," which is privileged, was raised previously and rejected. The Judge also found that Rahbar's motion was denied because he failed to provide a showing that there has been a material change in applicable case law or statute since the ruling on the demurrer.

The Judge did, however, find that Rouillard's fourth cause of action has been sufficiently pled. The elements of fraud are misrepresentation, knowledge of falsity, intent to defraud, justifiable reliance, and resulting damage. The Judge found that Rouillard has alleged specific facts that show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered, and that the allegations of fraud are not general and conclusory.

The Judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further briefing and argument.
