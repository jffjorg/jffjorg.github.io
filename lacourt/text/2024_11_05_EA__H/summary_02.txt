And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The proposed intervenor, United Financial Casualty Company, has moved for an order to intervene in the case on behalf of its insured, DLJMK, Inc., to file an answer in intervention and to stay discovery requests against DLJMK. The court has determined that intervention is appropriate, as the proposed intervenor has a direct and immediate interest in the litigation and may be required to satisfy any judgment entered against its insured, which is currently in terminated status. The proposed intervenor seeks to assert the same defenses that would have been asserted by DLJMK, and the court finds that intervention by the proposed intervenor will not enlarge the issues in this case. Therefore, the court grants the proposed intervenor's motion for leave to intervene.
