And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling dismissing the claims against Priscilla Hernandez and Terance Newman with prejudice, and dismissing the claims against the City of Los Angeles without prejudice. The court has also ordered the case to be transferred to Department One for reassignment due to the non-writs causes of action and request for a jury trial in the cross-complaint. The individual respondents were entitled to have their claims dismissed with prejudice due to the sustaining of the demurrer without leave to amend, and the failure of the plaintiff to file an amended complaint.
