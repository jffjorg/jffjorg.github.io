Green, et al. v. Gilfert Jackson, et al.
Case No. BC548724
[Tentative] Order Granting Motion to
Remove and Expunge Lis Pendens
 
 
            Defendant
Ridgeley Drive Apartments, LLC (“Defendant” or “Ridgeley”) moves for an order
to remove and expunge the Notice of Pendency of Action (“Lis Pendens”) recorded
on August 10, 2025, as Instrument No. 20150974994 with respect to this action
and following real properties:
 
1.    
2501-2512
½ W. 54th Street, 5355-5363 ½ 3rd Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90043
2.    
2419
South Ridgeley Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90016 
3.    
750
W. Imperial Highway, Los Angeles, CA 90044 
4.    
2425-31
Ridgeley Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90016 
 
“At any time after
notice of pendency of action has been recorded, any party, or any nonparty with
an interest in the real property affected thereby, may apply to the court in
which the action is pending to expunge the notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 405.30.)  “[T]he court shall order that the notice be
expunged if the court finds that the claimant has not established by a
preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real property claim.
The court shall not order an undertaking to be given as a condition of
expunging the notice if the court finds the claimant has not established the
probable validity of the real property claim.” 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 405.32.)  
 
In
this wrongful foreclosure action, Plaintiff Goltha Green alleged that JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. (“Chase”) wrongfully foreclosed on the four multi-family
properties specified in the Lis Pendens. 
After a bench trial, the trial court (Beckloff, J.) entered judgment in
favor of Chase and several other defendants, including foreclosure purchaser
Ridgeley.  The judgment was affirmed by
the Court of Appeal in an unpublished opinion filed on August 24, 2023.  (See Burch Decl. Exh. 2-3.)  The judgment, affirmed on appeal, conclusively
determines that the real property claims set forth in the complaint lack
probable validity.  (See generally Newport
Beach Country Club, Inc. v. Founding Members of Newport Beach Country Club (2006)
140 Cap.App.4th 1120, 1126-32 [discussing rules of res judicata].)  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition and has
developed no argument to the contrary.  Accordingly,
the Lis Pendens must be expunged.  
 
Based
upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
1.         Ridgeley Drive Apartments, LLC’s motion
to remove and expunge the lis pendens is granted.
 
2.         The court shall sign the separate,
proposed order.
 
3.         Counsel for Ridgely Drive Apartments,
LLC shall provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
