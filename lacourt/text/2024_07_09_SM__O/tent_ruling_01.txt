TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc Demurrer is
OVERRULED as to the 1st cause of action for Battery and the 3rd
cause of action for IIED. Defendant Choice Hotels International Inc.’s Demurrer
is SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amend as to the 4th cause of
action for Fraudulent Concealment. 
 
            Defendant’s Motion to Strike is DENIED. Plaintiffs plead
enough facts to reach a possible finding of malice upon proof.          
 
REASONING
As
a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the
face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests
the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc.
v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such,
the court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied
factual allegations. (Id.) The only issue a demurrer is concerned with
is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Where
a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court
that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC
(2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable
possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to
sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation
Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245.)
 
Plaintiff
is only required to allege ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. (See Committee
on Children's Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
212 [“the complaint should set forth the ultimate facts constituting the cause
of action, not the evidence by which plaintiff proposes to prove those facts”);
1 Cal. Affirmative Def. § 10:2 (2d ed.) [allegations of agency, course and
scope of employment, etc. qualify as ultimate facts].) Plaintiff’s allegations
must be accepted as true on demurrer. (See Yvanova v. New Century Mortgage
Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 924 [“For purposes of reviewing a demurrer, we
accept the truth of material facts properly pleaded in the operative
complaint”].)
 
 
I.               
Demurrer to the 1st cause of action
for Battery – OVERRULED
 
“The
essential elements of a cause of action for battery are: (1) defendant touched
plaintiff, or caused plaintiff to be touched, with the intent to harm or offend
plaintiff; (2) plaintiff did not consent to the touching; (3) plaintiff was
harmed or offended by defendant's conduct; and (4) a reasonable person in
plaintiff's position would have been offended by the touching.” (So v. Shin
(2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 652, 669, as modified on denial of reh'g (Jan.
28, 2013); see also CACI 1300.)
 
“The
elements of a civil battery are: 1. Defendant intentionally did an act which
resulted in a harmful or offensive contact with the plaintiff's person; [¶] 2.
Plaintiff did not consent to the contact; [and][¶] 3. The harmful or offensive
contact caused injury, damage, loss or harm to the plaintiff.” (Piedra v.
Dugan (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1483, 1495.)
 
            As explained in Witkin Summary of California Law: “If the
striking takes place in the performance of an unlawful act, the intent to
injure is immaterial; the actor is answerable for all consequences that
directly and naturally result, though unintended. (Rest.2d, Torts § 16(1); see
38 Pepperdine L. Rev. 623 [Restatement's definition of intent for battery].)
However, if the touching is lawful, the defendant must intend to harm or offend
the victim to be liable for battery. (Austin B. v. Escondido Union School Dist.
(2007) 149 C.A.4th 860, 872, 57 C.R.3d 454.)”  5 Witkin, Summary 11th Torts § 455 (2024)
 
Plaintiffs
Amy Carol Boersma, Jonathan David Harber, Lucky Bud Jonathan Harber, and Tanyon
Jagger David Harber (collectively the “Plaintiffs”) successfully plead a cause
of action for battery as to Defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc.
(“Choice Hotels”). Plaintiffs plead that Choice Hotel intentionally chose to
not “eradicate a Cimex lectularius infestation in the hotel.” (Complaint, ¶¶
32, 46.) Plaintiffs plead Choice Hotels intentional choice not to eradicate the
infestation led harmful bed bug bites, thus harmful or offensive contact. (See
Complaint, ¶¶ 30, 46, Plaintiffs allege they did not consent to the contact.
(Complaint, ¶ 46.) Plaintiffs allege Choice Hotels actions led to “serious
injures” including “bedbug bites, itching and permanent scaring” from the
bedbug bites. (Complaint, ¶¶ 31, 44, 49.)
 
Choice
Hotel argues that Plaintiffs did not plead the requisite intent to harm in
order to successfully plead a cause of action for battery. However, this
argument is unpersuasive, as the intent is plead by stating facts to show an
intentional act which resulted in offensive contact, as Plaintiffs have plead
in the Complaint. 
            
            Demurrer to the 1st
cause of action for battery is OVERRULED.
 
 
II.            
Demurrer to the 3rd cause of action
for IIED
 
The
elements of a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress
are (1) outrageous conduct by the defendant, (2) intention to cause or reckless
disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress, (3) severe
emotional suffering, and (4) actual and proximate causation of the emotional
distress. “Conduct is extreme and outrageous when it exceeds all bounds of
decency usually tolerated by a decent society, and is of a nature which is
especially calculated to cause, and does cause, mental distress. Liability does
not extend to mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty
oppressions, or other trivialities.” (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital
(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 618.)
 
Whether
a defendant's conduct can reasonably be found to be outrageous is a question of
law that must initially be determined by the court. (See Berkley v. Dowds
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 534 [affirming order sustaining demurrer to IIED
cause of action without leave to amend based on failure to allege outrageous
conduct].) If reasonable persons may differ, it is for the jury to determine
whether the conduct was actually outrageous. (Ibid.)
 
Choice
Hotel argues Plaintiffs do not allege any facts to show extreme and outrageous
conduct by Choice Hotel, such that would exceed the bounds tolerated by
society. However, as long as the facts are stated to allege the elements of the
cause of action the demurrer will be overruled, and such is the case here.
Plaintiffs allege Choice Hotels engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct by
not eradicating the bed bug infestation when the infestation was known to Choice
Hotels at the time the Plaintiffs checked into the hotel. (Complaint, ¶ 70.)
Plaintiffs plead Choice Hotels committed acts with the requisite intent. (Id.,
¶ 71.) Plaintiffs plead facts to show severe emotional suffering. (Id.,
¶¶ 44 [“emotional injuries (including, but not limited to, severe
embarrassment, annoyance, discomfort, pain, apprehension, tension, anxiety, and
emotional distress”], 71.) Plaintiffs plead causation. (Id,, ¶¶ 49, 50.)
Choice Hotels alleged conduct regarding the bedbug infestation can be
considered outrageous conduct by a reasonable person, and thus a jury must
determine whether the conduct was outrageous. 
 
Choice
Hotels Demurrer to the 3rd cause of action is OVERRULED. 
 
III.          
Demurrer to the 4th cause of action
for Fraudulent Concealment – SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amend
 
“[T]he
elements of a cause of action for fraud based on concealment are: (1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.” (Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc.
(2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 276, 310–311, citations omitted; see also CACI 1901)
 
“In
California, fraud must be pled specifically; general and conclusory allegations
do not suffice.” (Tenet Healthsystem Desert, Inc. v. Blue Cross of
California (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 821, 837.) “This particularity
requirement necessitates pleading facts which show how, when, where, to
whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.” (Id., at pp
837–838.)  
 
“In
addition, a plaintiff is held to a higher standard in asserting a fraud claim
against a corporate defendant . . . . [where] the plaintiff must allege the
names of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations, their
authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it
was said or written.” (Id. at p. 838.)
 
Plaintiffs
plead all the requisite elements of a fraudulent concealment claim for a non-corporate
defendant. (See Complaint, ¶¶ 18, 42, 53, 81, 82, 84.) However, Plaintiffs do
not allege the names of the person(s) who made the fraudulent representations, what
these person(s) said or wrote and when exactly the fraudulent statement(s) was said.
The “less specificity” exception does not appear to apply in this instance,
since Plaintiffs should be aware of the names of the people or Choice Hotel
employees they were dealing with, and the alleged fraudulent statements made to
the Plaintiffs prior to check-in or while staying at the hotel. (See Cansino
v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469 [“Less specificity in
pleading fraud is required when it appears from the nature of the allegations
that the defendant must necessarily possess full information concerning the
facts of the controversy...”].)


            Choice Hotels Demurrer to the 4th cause of
action is SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amend. 


 
IV.          
Motion to Strike Punitives
 
CC
§3294(a) provides, “In an action for the breach of an obligation not arising
from contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the
defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff, in
addition to the actual damages, may recover damages for the sake of example and
by way of punishing the defendant.” (Cal Civ. Code § 3294, subdiv., (a).) 
 
“Malice
is ‘conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff
or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.’ (Civ.Code, § 3294,
subd. (c)(1).) Oppression is ‘despicable conduct that subjects a person to
cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person's rights.’
(Civ.Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(2).) Despicable conduct is conduct that is so
vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome that it would be
looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people. Such conduct has been
described as having the character of outrage frequently associated with crime.”
(Scott v. Phoenix Schools, Inc. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 702, 715.)
 
            “[E]ven though certain language
pleads ultimate facts or conclusions of law, such language when read in context
with the facts alleged as to defendants' conduct may adequately plead the evil
motive requisite to recovery of punitive damages.” (Monge v. Superior Ct.,
(1986)176 Cal. App. 3d 503, 510.) Furthermore, “[m]alice and oppression may be
inferred from the circumstances of a defendant's conduct.” (Id., at p.
511.)
 
            “[A] conscious disregard of the safety of others may
constitute malice within the meaning of section 3294 of the Civil Code. In
order to justify an award of punitive damages on this basis, the plaintiff must
establish that the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences
of his conduct, and that he wilfully and deliberately failed to avoid those
consequences.” (Taylor v. Superior Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 895–896.)
 
            Plaintiffs plead enough facts to allege that Choice
Hotels consciously disregarded the safety of the Plaintiffs by failing to
mitigate the bed bug issue when Choice Hotels allegedly knew of the issue prior
to, and during, the Plaintiffs stay at the hotel. (See Complaint, ¶¶ 32, 37,
38, 42, 46, 47, 70.) Plaintiffs alleged facts upon proof may lead a jury to
find Choice Hotels acted with malice, thus warranting punitive damages pursuant
to Civ. Code § 3294. (See Civ. Code § 3294, subd. (c)(1) [“Malice is ‘conduct
which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable
conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious
disregard of the rights or safety of others.”].)
 
            Choice Hotels Motion to Strike Plaintiffs request for
punitive damages is DENIED.
