**Tentative Ruling**

The Court has denied Lucas Atkins' Special Motion to Strike the Cross-Complaint under CCP 425.16 (anti-SLAPP) as the Cross-Defendant failed to meet their burden to establish that the claims within the Cross-Complaint arise from protected activity.

The Court found that the Cross-Complaint arises out of the same issue as the Complaint, the short-term rental of the Property at issue, and not from the filing of the Complaint itself. The Cross-Complaint includes factual allegations regarding the short-term rental itself, issues that arose prior to the complaint filing, and thus the Cross-Complaint is not subject to a SLAPP motion.

The Court also denied Atkins' request to strike portions of the Cross-Complaint and denied the request for attorney's fees without prejudice to hearing a noticed motion under CCP ยง 425.16(c)(1).
