And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Dr. Bruce Kadz, M.D., has moved for summary judgment, arguing that an allegedly agreed-upon written release form extinguishes all of the plaintiff, Terry Ashley's, claims against him. However, the court finds that the defendant has failed to provide admissible evidence to support his complete defense to the plaintiff's cause of action for professional negligence. Specifically, the defendant's declaration does not provide proper authentication for the evidence submitted, and the court cannot rely on hearsay evidence without an exception to the hearsay rule. Additionally, the defendant does not meet the business records exception to the hearsay rule. As a result, the court denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The court also sustains the plaintiff's objections to the defendant's evidence and finds that there are triable issues of material fact as to the defendant's complete defense.
