  Case Number:  23VECV00591    Hearing Date:   August 12, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV00591  Torres v Brooks   Tentative ruling:  Ex parte application set 8/12/2024 to continue trial: Denied.  The court issued an order on 4/11/2024 that the case will not be  continued.  The FSC is set in 6  days and no motions in limine have been filed by plaintiff, so plaintiff is not  in compliance with the court’s 7/21/2023 FSC order.  If plaintiff’s counsel is engaged in trial  when the trial date comes up on 8/21/2024, the court can trail this case.  However, plaintiff shall be in full  compliance on the FSC date of 8/13/2024.   The court notes that attorney Blake Burtchaell of Burtchaell Law in  Bakersfield is not a counsel of record in this case.   This case  was filed 18 months ago. Defendants appeared in the case in May 2023.  At the CMC on 6/20/2023, plaintiff’s counsel  was sanctioned for failure to file a CMC statement.  The CMC was continued to 8/23/2023.   On  7/19/2023, the parties were ordered to attend an MSC through the Resolve Law  program with a completion date of 2/1/2024.   There is no indication whether the parties complied with the MSC order.   On 7/21/2/23,  the court scheduled the matter for trial on 5/14/2024.   On  10/20/2023, plaintiff failed to appear for a CMC.  Defense counsel appeared.   Plaintiff was  not produced for deposition, so defendant filed a motion to compel  deposition.  The court was forced to  issue an order to compel plaintiff’s deposition and monetary sanctions were  awarded against plaintiff and his counsel.   The parties  requested a continuance of trial, and the court granted it on 4/11/2024.  “NO FURTHER CONTINUANCES” was indicated on  the court order.   Given the  court’s very clear order on 4/11/2024, and the fact that trial was continued 3  months already, no good cause is shown to continue the trial.  The court can trail the case if counsel is  engaged in trial.  Otherwise, no specific  explanation is given of the expert’s “unavailability” and “family obligations.”  The information provided is vague and is insufficient  to support the request.
