And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the ex parte application to continue the trial. The court had previously ordered that the case would not be continued, and the parties had already been granted a continuance of trial three months prior. The Judge notes that the plaintiff's counsel has not been in compliance with the court's orders, including failing to file a CMC statement and failing to produce the plaintiff for deposition. The Judge also notes that the parties have not provided sufficient explanation for the requested continuance, citing vague reasons such as expert unavailability and family obligations. The Judge orders the plaintiff to be in full compliance with the court's orders by the FSC date of 8/13/2024, and warns that the court will trail the case if counsel is engaged in trial on the original trial date of 8/21/2024.
