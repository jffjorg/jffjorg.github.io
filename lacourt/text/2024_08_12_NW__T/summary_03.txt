And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession is denied without prejudice due to the lack of proof of service on the summons and complaint, as well as the notice of application for writ of possession. The Judge concludes that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the defendant and any orders issued without proper notice and opportunity to be heard are void.

However, if the plaintiff files the proofs of service for the summons and complaint as well as the application for writ of possession prior to the hearing date, the Judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's application for writ of possession is granted. The Judge finds that the plaintiff has shown their rights to possession and has provided evidence of breach and damages. The Judge also waives the requirement for the plaintiff to post an undertaking and grants the writ of possession.
