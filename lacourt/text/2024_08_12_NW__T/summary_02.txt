Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Woodpark LLC and Micro Property Management Inc. to the First Amended Complaint filed by Cyman Lehman. The demurrer challenged the sufficiency of the first five causes of action in the complaint.

The judge found that the demurrer to the first cause of action for discrimination (age/disability) was not persuasive, and therefore, it was overruled. The judge also found that the demurrer to the second, fourth, and fifth causes of action was not persuasive, and therefore, it was overruled.

The judge found that the demurrer to the third cause of action for financial elder abuse was persuasive, but not sufficient, as it failed to plead facts to support the allegations of wrongful use and intent to defraud.

The judge also found that the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for breach of warranty of habitability was not persuasive, as it failed to plead facts to support the allegations of lack of knowledge and notice.

The judge ordered the defendants to file an answer within 20 days.

The judge's ruling is based on the facts alleged in the First Amended Complaint, including the plaintiff's physical disability, the broken elevator, and the plaintiff's fall in the garage. The judge also considered the parties' stipulation to the untimely filing of the reply brief and the lack of objection to the untimely filing of the opposition.

The judge's ruling is in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants, allowing the plaintiff's claims to proceed to the next stage of the litigation.
