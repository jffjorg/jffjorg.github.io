[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Plaintiff Ally Bank’s Application for Writ of Possession is DENIED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
Introduction 
Plaintiff Ally Bank (Plaintiff) moved for a writ of
possession against Defendant Antonio White (Defendant).
An opposition was due on July 30, 2024 and none was filed.
Discussion 
Plaintiff failed to file proofs of service on the Summons
and Complaint, as well as the Notice of Application for Writ of
Possession.  Without proofs of service,
the Court lacks jurisdiction over Defendant. 
Without proofs of service, Defendant was not provided proper notice and
opportunity to be heard on the application. 
Any orders issued without proper notice and opportunity to be heard are
void.  
Plaintiff’s application for writ of possession is DENIED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

ALTERNATIVELY, IF PLAINTIFF FILES THE PROOFS OF SERVICE FOR
THE SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF POSSESSION
PRIOR TO THIS HEARING DATE, THEN….
[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Plaintiff Ally Bank’s Application for Writ of Possession is
GRANTED.  The Court waives an undertaking
from Plaintiff Ally Bank.  
Plaintiff’s proof of service showed that Defendant was
properly served with the summons and complaint and properly notified of the
hearing on the application.  (Code Civ.
Proc. sec. 512.010.)  
Plaintiff provided a declaration to show the probable
validity of their claim and right to repossess the vehicle from Defendant
because Plaintiff provided evidence showing: Defendant’s entry into the Written
Lease Agreement (Lease) for the vehicle; Plaintiff assignor’s performance of
delivery of the vehicle; Defendant’s breach in failing to pay; and Plaintiff’s
damages.  (Code Civ. Proc sec.
512.040.)  (James Singleton Decl. pars.
5-9.)  Plaintiff further provided that
the vehicle is in the custody and control of Defendant and located at
Defendant’s residence.  (Singleton Decl.
par. 10.)  (Code Civ. Proc. sec.
512.060.)  With Defendant’s breach,
Defendant no longer has rights to possess and further refused to surrender the
vehicle.  Plaintiff has shown their
rights to possession.    
Plaintiff submitted the amount owed on the account and the
value of the vehicle.  (Singleton Decl.
pars. 6-7.)  The evidence showed that the
account balance exceeds the value of the vehicle and no equity exists for the
Defendant.  The Court finds that the
requirement to post an undertaking is waived. 
(Code Civ. Proc. sec. 515.010.)  
Plaintiff’s application for writ of possession is
GRANTED.
