And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Vanessa Valdes' motion for a protective order regarding discovery served by Plaintiff Stewart Lucas Murrey. The defendant argues that the discovery is overbroad, unduly burdensome, irrelevant, privileged, and private, but the motion is defective because it does not identify the discovery with which it takes issue and is not accompanied by a meet-and-confer declaration. The judge finds that the defendant has not made a sufficient showing of good cause to spare them from the discovery, and therefore denies the motion for a protective order.
