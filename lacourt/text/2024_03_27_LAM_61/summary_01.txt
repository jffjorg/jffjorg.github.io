And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Agustin Quiroz's motions to compel further responses to requests for production and special interrogatories from Plaintiff Chantal E. Estive. The Court held that Defendant's motion was denied in its entirety with regard to requests for production, but granted as to special interrogatories No. 6, 7, and 10. The Court also awarded sanctions against Defendant and his counsel in the amount of $2,100.

The Court found that Plaintiff's responses to Defendant's requests for production were sufficient, except for Special Interrogatories No. 6, 7, and 10, which required further response. The Court also held that Defendant's objections to Plaintiff's responses were unfounded and lacked substantial justification.

The Court cited California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.010, 2030.300, 2031.010, 2031.300, and 2033.290, as well as the case of Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403. The Court also noted that Defendant's motion was denied in its entirety with regard to requests for production, and that Plaintiff's responses to Defendant's requests for production were sufficient, except for Special Interrogatories No. 6, 7, and 10.
