Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
February 8, 2024



 
Dylan Scott Perry has filed three separate lawsuits
alleging death threats communicated through “American Dad!”: 23STCV11392 (filed
May 22, 2023), 23STCP01900 (filed June 1, 2023), and 23STCV15449 (filed July 3,
2023). 
The first lawsuit (Case No. 23STCV11392)
against The Walt Disney Company alleges intentional infliction of emotional
distress. 
The second lawsuit (Case No. 23STCP01900)
against The Walt Disney Company alleges Civil Harassment with Damages.
The third lawsuit (Case No. 23STCV15449)
against The Walt Disney Company alleges Civil Rights violations because he is
entitled to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
On January 22, 2024, Dylan Scott
Perry filed the Notice of The Motion to Consolidate without the Memorandum of
Points & Authorities. 
On February 5, 2024, at 12:00 am,
Dylan Scott Perry filed his Motion to Consolidate and Good Cause Shown for
Untimely Filing and proof of electronic service. 
As of February 6, 2024, at 6:46 am no
opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standards
“A notice of motion to consolidate
must: (A)  List all named parties in each case, the names of those who
have appeared, and the names of their respective attorneys of record; (B)
 Contain the captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated, with the
lowest numbered case shown first; and (C)  Be filed in each case sought to
be consolidated.
The motion to consolidate:(A)
 Is deemed a single motion for the purpose of determining the appropriate
filing fee, but memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers must be
filed only in the lowest numbered case; (B)  Must be served on all
attorneys of record and all non- represented parties in all of the cases sought
to be consolidated; and (C)  Must have a proof of service filed as part of
the motion.” (California Rules of Court Rule 3.350.)

“When
actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court,
it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the
actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1048, subd. (a).)  The purpose of consolidation is to enhance trial
court efficiency by avoiding unnecessary duplication of evidence and the danger
of inconsistent adjudications.  (See Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon Shield Claimants
Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978-979 (Todd-Stenberg).)
Discussion
            Here, the lead case must be the lower number, which is 23STCP01900,
not 23STCV11392. Therefore, the motion does not comply with Rule 3.350
(a)(1)(B) or 3.350 (2)(C) which requires the lowest numbered to be the lead
case. Additionally, the motion was untimely filed because it was filed three
days before the hearing. Therefore, this motion is procedurally defective. 
Accordingly,
the unopposed motion is DENIED without prejudice. 
Court
clerk to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
