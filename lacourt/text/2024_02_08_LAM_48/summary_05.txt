Here is the English text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to consolidate three separate lawsuits against The Walt Disney Company. The lawsuits, filed by Dylan Scott Perry, allege death threats, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and Civil Rights violations. The Judge found that the motion was procedurally defective because it did not comply with California Rules of Court Rule 3.350 and was filed three days before the hearing date. The Judge also noted that the purpose of consolidation is to enhance trial court efficiency, but the motion did not meet the necessary requirements to achieve this purpose.
