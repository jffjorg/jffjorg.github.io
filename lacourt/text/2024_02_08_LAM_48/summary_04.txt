Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's PMK (Presidential Master Key). The motion was filed on November 17, 2023, and the hearing was held on December 21, 2023. The court found that the plaintiffs did not engage in a good faith meet-and-confer effort with the defendant before filing the motion, as the issues presented in the Separate Statement were the defendant's objections, but the plaintiffs had only conferred with the defendant about alternative deposition dates. The court ordered the parties to substantively meet and confer before filing a joint statement and continued the hearing. The plaintiffs' counsel filed a supplemental declaration and memorandum, and the defendant did not file anything else. The court found that the defendant did not serve objections to the deposition notice and did not appear at the deposition. The court ordered the defendant to produce its PMK for deposition within 14 days. The request for sanctions was denied.
