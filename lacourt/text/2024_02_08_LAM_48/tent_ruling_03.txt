On
June 28, 2022, the Court entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff CNP Holdings LLC
and against Defendant Joel Zubaid.  On February
8, 2023, Plaintiff assigned its rights to KH Capital LLC, and on October 10, 2023,
KH Capital assigned its rights to Assignee Adam Harari.
On
January 16, 2024, Assignee filed a motion to compel Defendant’s responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request For Production of Documents, Set One.
When
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make
an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve timely responses
waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection
of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
Sanctions shall be imposed against the party who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
Defendant
did not serve responses to Assignee’s discovery and filed no opposition to this
motion.
However,
Assignee’s single motion seeks to compel production pursuant to two discovery requests.  Each category of discovery should have been filed
as a separate motion.  Assignee is ordered
to pay one additional filing fee.
Subject
to the payment of the additional filing fee, the motion to compel is GRANTED.
Defendant
is ordered to serve verified responses, without objections, to Assignee’s Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request For Production of Documents, Set One within
30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
