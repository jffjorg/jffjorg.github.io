And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Michael E. Whitaker, has issued a tentative ruling in the case 22SMCV01554. The case involves an Unlawful Detainer action initiated by Plaintiff Shideh Rostami against Defendant Samrah Meints and her spouse, John David Meints, Jr. The Plaintiff is seeking to collect on a judgment of $129,084.80 in damages, plus possession of the subject property. The Defendant has filed a Claim of Exemption, seeking to exempt her earnings from any garnishments.

The Judge analyzed the case under Code of Civil Procedure section 706.051 and found that the Defendant has demonstrated that her entire salary is necessary to support herself, her spouse, and her minor child. The Judge noted that the Defendant's financial statement does not need to trace the source of funds to employment documents or wage earnings, and that the Plaintiff has not provided any authority that requires the Defendant to provide such documents.

The Judge granted the Defendant's claim of exemption, concluding that the Defendant's entire monthly take-home pay of $4,665 is exempt from garnishment. The Judge ordered the Sheriff's Office to release any funds they may be holding to the Defendant forthwith.
