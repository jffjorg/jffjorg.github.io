And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court declines to consider Millennium's reply evidence because the Plaintiff has not had an opportunity to respond. The Court also notes that certain portions of the Gelis deposition transcript were not included with the Plaintiff's evidence. Despite this, the Court finds that the evidence presented does support the claim that Gelis took vitals of Millennium patients. The Court also finds that there is no disputed issue of material fact suggesting that Gelis worked for or acted on behalf of Millennium when the medical records were altered, or that Dr. Prokupek or Prokupek, Inc. are alter egos of Millennium. Therefore, the Court does not reach Millennium's reliance arguments with respect to the third cause of action for intentional misrepresentation.
