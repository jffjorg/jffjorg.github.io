And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motions filed by Counsel, Cynthia A. de Petris, Esq., seeking to be relieved from representing defendants Briggita Lauren and Eric K. Yohan. Counsel claims that an impasse has been reached and that she cannot continue to represent the defendants without violating the attorney-client privilege. The judge finds that the motions are substantively proper, but procedurally improper because the clients were not served with the motions and supporting documents. Therefore, the judge denies the motions without prejudice, requiring Counsel to file a proof of service regarding the clients and provide notice of the court's ruling.
