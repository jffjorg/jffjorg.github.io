[1] The
Court declines to consider Millennium’s reply evidence as Plaintiff has not had
an opportunity to respond.  (San Diego
Watercrafts, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 308, 316
[“Where a remedy as drastic as summary judgment is involved, due process
requires a party be fully advised of the issues to be addressed and be given
adequate notice of what facts it must rebut in order to prevail”]; see also Wall
Street Network Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th
1171.)  
 


[2] Plaintiff’s Separate Statement states “Gelis further
testified that when he did take vitals for MMA patients, he would put the
information on MMA records.  See, McCoy
Decl., Ex. ___,  (sic) Gelis Deposition
Transcript at 65:11-55:2.”  Those
portions of the Gelis Deposition are not included in Plaintiff’s evidence, but
Plaintiff’s evidence does support the portion of the statement indicating that
Gelis took vitals of Millennium patients.
 


[3] Plaintiff’s Separate Statement also indicates Gelis
testified Dr. Prokupek is the only doctor he worked with at Millennium, citing to
69:3-6 of the Gelis Deposition Transcript, 
But that  portion of the Gelis
deposition transcript was not included with Plaintiff’s evidence.


[4] Because the Court finds no disputed issue of material
fact suggesting that Gelis worked for or acted on behalf of Millennium when
Plaintiff’s medical records were altered or that Dr. Prokupek or Prokupek, Inc.
are alter egos of Millennium, the Court does not reach Millennium’s reliance
arguments with respect to the third cause of action for intentional
misrepresentation.
