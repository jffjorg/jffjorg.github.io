BACKGROUND
 
On February 2, 2024, Plaintiff Nancy
Jordan filed a complaint against the Honorable Mark Howard Epstein, Judge of
the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles (“Judge Epstein”). The
complaint is for ‘entitlement’ and alleges a myriad of things, including the
allegation that an action she previously brought was wrongly dismissed with
prejudice and violated her constitutional rights. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendant Mark Howard Epstein’s Demurrer
to Plainntiff’s Complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. 
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICe
 
Judge Epstein requests judicial notice
of the following: (1) Complaint filed by Plaintiff Nancy Jordan on April 19,
2023, in the matter of Nancy Jordan v. Glenikia Young, Superior Court of
California, County of Los Angeles, Case No. 23SMCV01679; and (2) Judge
Epstein’s November 3, 2023, Order Dismissing Complaint filed by Plaintiff Nancy
Jordan on April 19, 2023, in the matter of Nancy Jordan v. Glenikia Young,
Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Case No. 23SMCV01679. 
 
The
court GRANTS Judge Epstein’s request for judicial notice. (Evid. Code §452(d).)

 
discussion
 
Judge Epstein demurs to Plaintiff Jordan’s complaint on the
grounds the complaint and causes of action are barred against the Superior
Court as a matter of law by absolute judicial immunity, the complaint fails to
set forth a statutory basis for a cause of action against Judge Epstein, the
complaint and causes of action fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action against Judge Epstein, and the complaint and causes of action
against Judge Epstein are vague, ambiguous, unintelligible, and uncertain. 
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect by way
of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A demurrer
for sufficiency tests whether the complaint alleges facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. (CCP § 430.10; Young v. Gannon (2002) 97
Cal.App.4th 209, 220.)  
 
When considering a demurrer, a court reads the allegations stated
in the challenged pleading liberally and in context, and “treat[s] the demurrer
as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5
Cal.3d 584, 591.) Put differently: for purposes of demurrer, the court treats
all facts alleged – but only the facts alleged – in the complaint as
true. (Picton v. Anderson Union High School District (1996) 50
Cal.App.4th 726, 732.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is
whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.” (Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  
 
Judicial Immunity
 
The concept of judicial immunity is “longstanding and
absolute.”  (Howard v. Drapkin (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 843,
851.)  Judicial immunity “bars civil actions against judges for acts
performed in the exercise of their judicial functions and it applies to all
judicial determinations, including those rendered in excess of the judge’s jurisdiction,
no matter how erroneous or even malicious or corrupt they may be.”  (Id.) 
“It is a judge’s duty to decide all cases within in jurisdiction that are
brought before him, including controversial cases that arouse the most intense
feelings in the litigants.  His errors may be corrected on appeal, but he
should not have to fear that unsatisfied litigants may hound him with
litigation charging malice or corruption.  Imposing such a burden on
judges would contribute not to principled and fearless decision-making but to
intimidation.” (Pierson v. Ray (1967) 386 U.S. 547, 554.)  The
effect of judicial immunity is that the action against the judicial officer
must be dismissed.  (Hardy v. Vial (1957) 48 Cal.2d 577,
584.)  
 
Here, absolute judicial immunity bars Plaintiff’s complaint
against Judge Epstein. Although the instant complaint is devoid of actual
allegations against Judge Epstein, the complaint makes clear that Plaintiff is
suing Judge Epstein for dismissal of a previous action she brought for
$24,000.00. Moreover, a review of Plaintiff’s prior complaint as well as the order
dismissing that complaint, of which this court has taken judicial notice, establishes
that Judge Epstein presided over that prior claim as the judicial officer.
(RJN, Exh. 1, 2.) Accordingly, Judge Epstein is being sued for actions taken in
his judicial capacity while presiding over Plaintiff’s previous complaint. 
 
Plaintiff has failed to oppose this demurrer. It is unclear to the
court how Plaintiff can cure this fatal defect. Accordingly, Judge Epstein’s
demurrer to the complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. 
 
Government Claims Act and Uncertainty
 
The court briefly notes Judge Epstein’s other two arguments and
why they also are grounds for sustaining the complaint without leave to amend. 
 
The Government Claims Act governs tort actions against public
entities and public employees.  A lawsuit that seeks monetary damages from
a public employee or entity must be preceded by the presentation of a claim to
the public entity and action on the claim by the Claims Board.  (Govt.
Code §§ 905, 911.2, 945.4; Briggs v. Lawrence (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 605,
612.) A claim must be served upon the public entity within six months of the
accrual of the alleged cause of action. 
(Govt. Code § 911.2.) Here, the complaint against Judge Epstein, a
judicial officer, seeks $35,001.00 in damages. However, Plaintiff fails to
allege or demonstrate Plaintiff submitted a written claim for damages prior to
the filing of the lawsuit. Based upon review of the judicially noticed facts,
the prior action for breach of contract was dismissed November 17, 2023 – over
six months ago. Therefore, any claim for damages by Plaintiff is barred.
Moreover, the complaint is utterly devoid of actual allegations against Judge
Epstein. Again, Plaintiff has failed to oppose this demurrer or provide any
indication how the complaint can be amended to cure these numerous defects.
