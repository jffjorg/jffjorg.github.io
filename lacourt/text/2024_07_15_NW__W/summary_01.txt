And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Epstein's demurrer to Plaintiff Jordan's complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The complaint is defective and barred, and Judge Epstein has absolute judicial immunity. The court grants Judge Epstein's request for judicial notice of the prior action and order dismissing it. The complaint fails to state a cause of action against Judge Epstein, and Plaintiff has failed to oppose the demurrer or provide any indication of how the complaint can be amended to cure the defects. The court notes that the Government Claims Act governs tort actions against public entities and public employees, and Plaintiff has failed to allege or demonstrate submission of a written claim for damages prior to the filing of the lawsuit.
