And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Panda Express Inc.'s demurrer to the third cause of action is sustained without leave to amend. The third cause of action alleges violations of Business and Professions Code Sections 17200 and 17500, but the judge finds that the allegations are both uncertain and factually insufficient. The judge notes that the plaintiff has not alleged the existence of any advertisement by the defendant, much less one that was allegedly misleading to members of the public. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has failed to oppose the demurrer and has failed to carry his burden of showing facts requisite to leave to amend. As a result, the judge has denied leave to amend on two grounds: the demurrer is unopposed, and the plaintiff bears the burden to identify facts which could cure the defects raised in demurrer.
