And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for sanctions brought by GT Live LLC against Anat Group, Inc. The motion was filed in response to Anat Group's lawsuit alleging that GT Live improperly sold cannabis using Anat Group's license. GT Live argues that the lawsuit is frivolous and that Anat Group is estopped from bringing the action due to inconsistencies with previous allegations.

The judge finds that GT Live has failed to demonstrate the key elements required to justify the application of judicial estoppel, and therefore denies the motion for sanctions. The judge also declines Anat Group's request to grant sanctions against GT Live.

The judge notes that while the motion was not entirely without merit, it was not egregious enough to warrant sanctions. The judge admonishes GT Live and cautions them to proceed appropriately in the future.

The ruling is tentative and will become final unless the parties submit written objections or request a hearing.
