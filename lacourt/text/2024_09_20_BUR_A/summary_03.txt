Summary:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to quash subpoenas issued by the City of La Cañada Flintridge (Flintridge) to Emma Amosh Mirzaian's medical providers. Mirzaian argues that the subpoenas are impermissibly violative of her right to privacy and that she has not put her medical history at issue in this litigation. Flintridge opposes the motion, arguing that the subpoenas are necessary to prove Mirzaian's proportional fault in the car accident that killed Mirzaian's wife.

The court finds that Mirzaian has a clear privacy interest in her medical records, but that Flintridge has shown good cause to enforce the subpoenas. The court notes that Flintridge's expert witness, Dr. Alan Shabo, has analyzed Mirzaian's medical records and found that her vision was compromised on the date of the incident. The court grants the motion to quash in part and denies it in part, ordering Flintridge to reissue its subpoena to Pacific Eye Care subject to the condition that the records requested are from 2014 to the date of the incident.
