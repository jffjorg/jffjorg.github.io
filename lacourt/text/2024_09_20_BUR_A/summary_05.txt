And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants two motions to compel further responses to special interrogatories filed by the plaintiffs. The motions were filed due to the defendants' failure to respond to the special interrogatories, which were served on April 3, 2024. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have demonstrated good cause for compelling further production and that the defendants have failed to justify their objections to the special interrogatories. As a result, the judge awards sanctions in the amount of $1,124.22 against each defendant (each defendant to pay $562.11) for their failure to file an opposition to the motions. The judge also grants the motions to compel further responses, ordering the defendants to provide further responses to the special interrogatories within 30 days.
