And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of William Carr v. Radnet Management, Inc. The case involves a demurrer filed by the Defendant to the Plaintiff's causes of action for General Negligence and Premises Liability. The Plaintiff alleges that he was injured due to the Defendant's failure to maintain an imaging table at a facility located at 10101 Riverside Drive, Toluca Lake, California 91602.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action for General Negligence with 20 days' leave to amend. The Judge has also sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action for Premises Liability without leave to amend. The Judge has ruled that the Plaintiff's allegations do not state sufficient facts to support these causes of action, and that the Plaintiff cannot maintain both a claim for General Negligence and a claim for Professional Negligence based on the same facts.

The Judge's ruling is based on the holding in Bellamy v. Appellate Department (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 797, 804, which states that a plaintiff cannot state causes of action for ordinary negligence as well as professional negligence based on the same facts. The Judge also relied on the holding in Flores v. Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital (2016) 63 Cal.4th 75, 88-89, which states that a hospital's negligent failure to maintain equipment that is necessary or otherwise integrally related to the medical treatment and diagnosis of a patient implicates a duty that the hospital owes to the patient by virtue of being a healthcare provider.
