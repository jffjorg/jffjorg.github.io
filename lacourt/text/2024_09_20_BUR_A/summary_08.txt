Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents in a lawsuit brought by Octavia Mary Carmen Whyte against Nissan North America, Inc. (Nissan) alleging that Nissan's 2020 Nissan Kick was manufactured as defective.

The judge finds that neither side has made a good faith effort to meet and confer regarding discovery matters in the case. The plaintiff's meet and confer letter did not address specific production deficiencies and is not evidence of a good faith effort to reach an informal resolution without involvement of the court. Nissan, on the other hand, failed to respond to the meet and confer letter and has instead presented the court with irrelevant exhibits.

The judge denies the motion to compel further responses without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff may refile the motion if the parties cannot agree on a resolution through meet and confer. The parties are ordered to meet and confer to address the discovery concerns in the case.
