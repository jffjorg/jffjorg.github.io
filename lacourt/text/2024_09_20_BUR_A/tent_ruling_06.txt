ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Allen Hagobian
(Plaintiff) brings this action against Panda Express Inc. (Defendant).
Plaintiff alleges he contracted a stomach flu after eating at one of
Defendant’s restaurants on March 24, 2023. Plaintiff claims to have lost work
from said stomach flu. 
 
Plaintiff’s First
Amended Complaint (FAC) states causes of action for (1) Negligence, (2)
Products Liability, (3) Violations of Business and Professions Code Sections
17200 and 17500, and (4) Negligent Misrepresentation. 
 
Defendant now demurs
to the third cause of action on grounds that it is uncertain and lacks
sufficient facts to state a claim. Plaintiff has not opposed the demurrer. 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
The
grounds for a demurrer must appear on the face of the pleading or from
judicially noticeable matters. (C.C.P. § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal. 3d 311, 318.) A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Id.)
 
A
demurrer assumes the truth of all factual, material allegations properly pled
in the challenged pleading. (Blank v. Kirwan, supra, 39 Cal. 3d at p.
318.) No matter how unlikely or improbable, the plaintiff’s allegations must be
accepted as true for the purpose of ruling on the demurrer. (Del E. Webb
Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.  App. 3d 593, 604.)
But this does not include contentions; deductions; conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the complaint; facts impossible in law; or allegations contrary to
facts of which a court may take judicial notice.  (Blank, supra,
39 Cal. 3d at 318.)
 
Pursuant
to C.C.P. §§ 430.10(e) and (f), the party against whom a complaint has been
filed may demur to the pleading on the grounds that the pleading does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, or that the pleading is
uncertain, ambiguous and/or unintelligible. It is an abuse of discretion to
sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is a reasonable probability
that the defect can be cured by amendment. (Schifando v. City of Los Angeles
(2003) 31 Cal. 4th 1074, 1082.)
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
First the Court notes there
is no opposition to this motion.  Failure
to file an opposition to the motion indicates the other parties' acquiescence
that the motion is meritorious. CRC Rule 8.54(c).  Nonetheless the Court will provide some
analysis.
 
Meet and Confer 
 
C.C.P.
§ 430.41(a) requires that the moving party meet and confer with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to the demurrer. Upon review the Court finds
the meet and confer requirements were met. (Thoma Decl. ¶¶ 2-6.) 
 
Third COA - Violations
of Business and Professions Code §§ 17200 & 17500 – Sustained Without Leave
to Amend 
 
Plaintiff
first demurs to the third cause of action on grounds that the pleadings are
uncertain. Plaintiff argues that despite the caption of the action stating a
violation of § 17200, the substance of the cause of action only alleges a
violation of § 17500. 
 
Uncertainty
is defined as that which is ambiguous and unintelligible. (C.C.P.
§ 430.10.) A demurrer for uncertainty should be granted “if the pleading
is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond.” (A.J.
Fistes Corp. v. GDL Best Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695.)
Further, a complaint must “set forth the essential facts of his case with
reasonable precision and with particularity sufficient to acquaint a defendant
with the nature, source and extent of his cause of action.” (Ludgate Ins.
Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 592, 608.) 
 
Upon
review, the Court finds that the FAC is indeed uncertain to this cause of
action. No mention of § 17200 is made whatsoever in the substance of
Plaintiff’s FAC. It is unclear what, if any, violation of § 17200 Plaintiff
alleges to have occurred in this case. 
 
Plaintiff
also demurs to this cause of action for failure to allege sufficient facts.
Plaintiff argues that the FAC is entirely devoid of facts pertaining to a
violation of the false advertising provisions of § 17500. 
 
Business
and Professions Code § 17500 provides that it is unlawful for a person or
corporation to disseminate false or misleading advertisements for sale of
property or services. To state a claim for false advertising under § 17500, the
advertisement must be either false or, while true, "actually
misleading" or having "a capacity, likelihood, or tendency to deceive
or confuse the public." (Kasky v. Nike, Inc. (2002) 27 Cal.4th 939,
951.) The "reasonable consumer" test applies to false advertising
claims. (Salazar v. Target Corporation (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 571, 578.)
"Whether a reasonable consumer is deceived by that advertising is not
properly resolved at the pleading stage." (Salazar, supra 83
Cal.App.5th at 584.) 
 
Here
Plaintiff’s only allegation as to § 17500 is that “Defendants failed to abide
by this section as they served food that was unfit for consumption.” (FAC ¶
16.)
The Court finds these allegations are insufficient. Plaintiff has not alleged
the existence of any advertisement by Defendant, much less one that was allegedly
misleading to members of the public. 
 
In
short, the Court finds the allegations in the FAC regarding the third cause of
action are both uncertain and factually insufficient. Accordingly, the demurrer
to the third cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. Leave to
amend is denied on two grounds. First, the demurrer is unopposed which may be
construed as Plaintiff’s abandonment of this claim. (See Herzberg v. County
of Plumas (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1, 20.) Second, Plaintiff bears the burden
to identify facts which could cure the defects raised in demurrer. (Ko v.
Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc. (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 1144, 1150.) As
Plaintiff has failed to oppose this demurrer, so to has he failed to carry his
burden of showing facts requisite to leave to amend.
