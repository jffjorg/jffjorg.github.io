And here is the English-text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay the Action. The Plaintiff, Parviz Mokhtari, filed a Complaint against the Defendant, Shahrokh Mokhtarzadeh, and the Defendant's firm, Law Offices of Shahrokh Mokhtarzadeh. The Complaint alleges various causes of action, including legal malpractice, breach of contract, and financial elder abuse. The Defendant filed a Motion to Compel Arbitration, citing the Retainer Agreement between the parties, which contains an arbitration clause. The Plaintiff filed a non-opposition to the Motion, stating that he is amenable to arbitration. The Court found that the Defendant has satisfied its burden of showing prima facie evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate, and that the Plaintiff has failed to show why the agreement should not be enforced. The Court granted the motion to compel arbitration and stayed the action, pending arbitration of the Plaintiff's claims.
