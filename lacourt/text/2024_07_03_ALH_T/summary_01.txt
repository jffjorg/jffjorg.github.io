English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant LA Family Housing Corporation's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's claims against Defendant LA Family Housing Corporation are barred by the Privette doctrine, which states that an employer is not liable for the actions of an independent contractor. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's claims are not supported by the allegations in the Complaint, which do not sufficiently plead a duty of care owed by Defendant LA Family Housing Corporation to the Plaintiff. The Judge grants the motion with 20 days leave to amend, allowing the Plaintiff to re-file the Complaint in a way that could state a viable cause of action against Defendant LA Family Housing Corporation and the other defendants.
