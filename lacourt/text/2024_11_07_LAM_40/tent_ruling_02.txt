 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Petitioner J.G.
  Wentworth Originations, LLC’s Verified Petition for Approval for Transfer of
  Payment Rights.



 
I. Background
Petitioner J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC (J.G. Wentworth) has filed a
petition for approval of the transfer of certain structured settlement rights
belonging to Real Party-in-Interest Carl Todd Jr. Specifically, J.G. Wentworth
seeks the transfer of $27,186.36 in future annuity payment rights belonging to
Carl Todd Jr., which span payments to be paid between November 2024 and
November 2031, the present discounted value of which is $22,526.86,
to be transferred in exchange for a purchase price of $13,500.00. 
The Petition was filed on August 21,
2024.
On August 22, 2024, Petitioner J.G. Wentworth filed a notice of hearing for September
26, 2024.
That same day, Petitioner filed a proof of service. The
filing shows serving of the notice of hearing, verified Petition, notice of
case assignment, and proof of service on Carl Todd Jr., the annuity issuer, and
the annuity obligor.
On September 23, 2024, Petitioner
filed a Declaration from Carl Todd Jr., a Notice of Errata to the Verified
Petition, and an Amended Exhibit ‘A’ to the Petition. 
On September 26, 2024, the Court
continued the hearing on this motion in order to allow the low-numbered court
in case number 24STCP01404 to rule on a Notice of Related Case that was filed
in this Court and the other court on August 26, 2024. However, to date no
ruling has been made on that notice of related case. Nonetheless, the Court
takes notice of the file in that case, as it appears to involve a petition
identical to the one filed here, which was rejected by the Court on August 16,
2024.
The Petition is now before the
Court.
 
II. Petition to Transfer Structured
Settlement Payment Rights
A.   
Legal Standard
A transfer of structured settlement payment
rights is void unless a court reviews and approves the transfer and finds that
(a) the transfer of the structured settlement payment rights is fair and
reasonable and in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the
welfare and support of his or her dependents, and (b) the transfer complies
with the requirements of Insurance Code Sections 10134 to 10139.5, will not
contravene other applicable law, and that the court has reviewed and approved
the transfer as provided in Section 10139.5. (See Ins. Code, § 10137, subds.
(a)-(b).)
B.   
Analysis 
1.     Section
10136 Requirements
a.      Relevant
Law 
No direct or indirect transfer
of structured settlement payment rights by a payee to which Section 10136
applies shall be effective, and no structured settlement obligor or annuity
issuer shall be required to make any payment directly or indirectly to a transferee,
unless all of the provisions of Section 10136 of the Insurance Code are
satisfied. (Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (a).)
b.     Determination
The petition satisfies the
requirements of Section 10136 as follows (Ins. Code, § 10136, subds. (b)-I.)
First, the transfer agreement
satisfies the disclosure form requirements set out in Insurance Code section 10136, subdivision (b) because the transfer
agreement is accompanied by a disclosure addressed to Carl Todd Jr. and the
disclosure contains all the statutorily required language of section 10136,
subdivision (b). (See Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (b); see also 9/23/24 Amended Exhibit
A, California Purchase Contract, § 10.)
Second, the transfer agreement satisfies the transfer-agreement
requirements set out in Insurance Code section 10136, subdivisiI(c) because the
transfer agreement contains all the necessary language required from this
statutory subdivision. (See Ins. Code, § 10136, Id. (c); 9/23/24 Amended
Exhibit A, California Purchase Contract, §§ 2 [amount and due dates of payments
rights to be sold], 10 [remaining requirements].)
Third, the transfer agreement does not violate Section 10138 as none of
the contents prohibited by this statutory section are contained in the transfer
agreement. (See Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (d); see also 9/23/24 Amended Exhibit
A, California Purchase Contract.)
Fourth, Carl Todd Jr. has not sought cancellation of the transfer
agreement as of the date of this hearing. (See Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (e);
see also 9/20/24 Todd Decl., ¶ 13.)
Accordingly, the Court finds that J.G. Wentworth’s proposed transfer of Carl
Todd Jr.’s settlement rights satisfies the requirements of Insurance Code
section 10136, subdivisions (a)Irough (e).
2.     Section 10139.5 Requirements
a.      Relevant Law
A direct or
indirect transfer of structured settlement payment rights is not effective and
a structured settlement obligor or annuity issuer is not required to make any
payment directly or indirectly to any transferee of structured settlement
payment rights unless the transfer has been approved in advance in a final
court order based on express written findings by the court subject to Section
10139.5. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (a).)
b.     Determination
                                                             
i.     Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)
The petition must satisfy the findings requirements set out in Insurance
Code section 10139.5, subdivisions (a)(1) to (a)(6). These findings, which the
Court expressly makes by the following language, are that: 
(1)   The transfer does not satisfy subdivision
(a)(1) because it  is not fair and 
reasonable in the
best interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare and
support of the payee’s dependents. When determining whether the transfer is fair, reasonable, and in the
payee’s best interests, the Court must consider the totality of the circumstances. Carl Todd Jr. is
collecting $13,500.00 for future payments of $27,186.36, the discounted present
value of which is $22,526.86. Carl Todd Jr. is an unemployed twenty-two-year-old
with one three-month-old child, is experiencing financial hardship, and states
he would use the transfer funds to fix the engine on his vehicle and pay a few
months rent upfront.  (See Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (a)(1) [framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (b)(1)-(15)]; see
also 9/23/24 Amended Exhibit A, California Purchase Contract, p. 12; 9/20/24 Todd
Decl., ¶¶ 8, 11.) 
            The Court notes that between May 30,
2023 and April 4, 2024, Mr. Todd has received approximately $154,000 from four
separate transactions, however despite this, he states that he is still experiencing
financial hardship. (Todd Decl. ¶¶ 9, 11.) To determine
whether the transfer is in Mr. Todd’s best interest, more information is needed
to fully understand his financial situation. Specifically, the Court requests further
explanation of how the $154,000 was spent, why Mr. Todd requires additional
funds to fix the engine on this vehicle and pay a few months’ rent upfront, and
how much of the annuity this proposed transfer will leave him with.       As has also been requested by Department
78 in rejecting this same transfer request, the Court request the Petitioner,
JG Wentworth, to provide further explanation as to why five separate petitions
have been filed in five separate courtrooms in an approximately one-year
period, and for JG Wentworth to provide an explanation of the calculation of
the various percentages paid out or to be paid out in each transaction.

            The petition otherwise satisfies the
remaining findings requirement set out in Insurance Code section 10139.5,
subdivisions (a)(2) through (a)(6). These findings, which the Court expressly
makes by the following language, are that: 
(2)   The payee has been advised in writing by the
transferee to seek independent
professional
advice regarding the transfer and has either received that advice or knowingly
waived, in writing, the opportunity to receive the advice.  (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(2); see
also 9/23/24 Amended Exhibit A, California Purchase Contract [Carl Todd Jr. was
advised to obtain independent legal advice and professional tax advice about
the sale of the Purchased Payments]; 9/20/24 Todd Decl., ¶ 12 [“I did not
receive independent legal or financial advice regarding the proposed
transaction. A copy of the waiver is attached to Exhibit ‘D’ of the
petition.”].)
(3)  
The
transferee, i.e., J.G. Wentworth, has complied with the notification
requirements
pursuant to paragraph
(2) of subdivision (f), has provided the payee with a disclosure form that
complies with Section 10136, and the transfer agreement complies with Sections
10136 and 10138. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(3); see also Ins. Code, §
10136,Ibds. (b)-(e) discussion supra & Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)
discussion infra at “Second, …” & 9/23/24 Amended Exhibit A, California
Purchase Contract.)
(4) The transfer does not contravene any applicable statute or the order
of any court or other government authority. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd.
(a)(4).)
(5) The payee, Carl Todd Jr., understands the terms of the transfer
agreement, including the terms set forth in the disclosure statement required
by Section 10136. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(5); see also 9/20/24 Todd
Decl., ¶ 13 [“I understand the terms of the transfer agreement, including the
terms set forth in the disclosure statement …”].)
(6) Carl Todd Jr. understands and does not wish to exercise the right to
cancel the transfer agreement. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(6); see also
9/20/24 Todd Decl., ¶ 13 [“I … do not wish to exercise my right to cancel the
agreement”].)
                                                           
ii.     Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)
The amended petition satisfies all
the payee information required from Section 10139.5, subdivision (c) as follows
(see Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)):
(1) Included the payee’s name and
age. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd.
(c)(1); see also 9/20/24 Todd Decl., p. 1:19-20 [Carl Todd Jr.] & [22
years old].)
(2) Included the payee’s marital
status, and, if married or separated, the name of the payee’s spouse. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(2); see
also 9/20/24 Todd Decl., ¶ 8 [“not married”].)
(3) Included the names, ages, and
place or places of residence of the payee’s minor children or other dependents,
if any. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (c)(3); see also 9/20/24 Todd Decl., ¶ 8 [“one minor child”; “C.W.”; “3 months
old”].)
(4) Included the amounts and
sources of the payee’s monthly income and financial resources and, if presently
married, the amounts and sources of the monthly income and financial resources
of the payee’s spouse. (See Ins. Code,
§ 10139.5, subd. (c)(4); see 9/20/24 Todd Decl., ¶¶ 8 [“I am currently unemployed”].)
(5) Included information permitting
the determination of whether the payee is currently obligated under any child
support or spousal support order, and, if so, the names, addresses, and
telephone numbers of any individual, entity, or agency that is receiving child
or spousal support from the payee under that order or that has jurisdiction
over the order or the payments in question. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(5); see also 9/20/24 Todd Decl., ¶ 8
[“I am not married”; “I do not have any court-ordered child support obligations”].)
However, the Court notes that
there is nothing in the declaration specifying that Mr. Todd was never married,
or more to the point, that he has no obligation for spousal support. The Court
would accept sworn testimony to that effect at the time of the hearing. 
(6) Included information
regarding previous transfers or attempted transfers, as described in paragraph
(11), (12), or (13) of subdivision (b). (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(6) [framed by Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subds. (b)(11)-(13), requiring information only for petitions in last
five years]; see
also 9/20/24 Todd Decl., ¶
9 [five prior petitions since 2023, four approved, with case numbers and
transfer information provided].)

                                                         
iii.     Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)
The amended petition satisfies the
requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (f) as follows (see Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)):
First, the transfer agreement satisfies the requirements of Section
10139.5, subdivision (f)(1), because Petitioner J.G. Wentworth made the instant
petition and the petition was brought in the county in which the payee, Carl
Todd Jr., resides. (See Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (f)(1); see 8/21/24 Petition, p. 1 [showing Petitioner J.G.
Wentworth brings this Petition]; 9/20/24
Todd Decl., ¶ 1 [“I reside in Los Angeles County, California”].)
Second, the petition satisfies the
requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (f)(2).
Formal notice of this transfer and
a copy of the petition itself was filed by J.G. Wentworth with the Court and
served on all interested parties no later than September 6, 2024—i.e., original
petition, notice, first amended petition, payee declaration, notice of case
assignment, and proof of service were served on Carl Todd Jr., the annuity
issuer, and the annuity obligor,. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)
[notice of the proposed transfer and the petition for its authorization to be
filed with the court and served on all interested parties within 20 days of
hearing]; see also 8/22/24 Proof of Service.) While the Notice of Errata and Amended
Exhibit A and proof of service were not filed with the Court until September 23,
2024—i.e., three days prior to this hearing—The Amended Exhibit A makes a minor
correction to align with Carl Todd Jr.’s declaration regarding how he intends
to use the transfer funds. No opposition appears in the record. Based on these
circumstances, the Court proceeds with a determination on the merits.
Further, the notice and petition
have attached all the necessary documents required from this subdivision. (See
Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (f)(2)(A)-(L).) The notice and petition: 
(A) Include a copy of the instant
petition and need not attach prior petitions made outside of five years from
the date of this petition. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(A) [framed
by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(6), which in turn is framed by Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subds. (b)(11)-(13), requiring information about petitions in last
five years]; see also 9/20/24 Todd Decl., ¶ 9 [five prior petitions since 2023,
four approved, with case numbers and transfer information provided].)
(B) Include a copy of the proposed
transfer agreement and disclosure form required by paragraph (3) of subdivision
(a). (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd.
(f)(2)(B); see also 9/23/24 Amended Exhibit A, California Purchase Contract &
8/21/24 Petition, Ex. B, California DisclosuIStatement.)
(C) Include information regarding Carl
Todd Jr.’s dependents and their ages. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(C); see also 9/10/24 Todd Decl., ¶
8 [not married; one minor child, age three months].)
(D) Include a copy of the
disclosure required in subdivision (b) of Section 10136. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(D); see
also 8/21/24 Petition, Ex. B, California DisclIre Statement.)
(E) Include copies of the annuity
contract, any qualified assignment agreement, and underlying structured
settlement agreement, if available, and if not available, a showing of
reasonable efforts to locate and secure a copy of the document have been made,
including making inquiry with the payee. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (f)(2)(E)-(H); see also 8/21/24 Petition,
Ex. C.
(F) Include copies of the proofs of
service made for notice of this petition. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(I); see also 8/22/24 and 9/23/24 Proofs of
Service.)
(G) Include a notification that any
interested party is entitled to support, oppose, or otherwise respond to the
transferee’s petition, either in person or by counsel, by submitting written
comments to the court or by participating in the hearing. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(J); see
also 8/21/24 Petition, p. 5; 8/22/24
Proof of Service.)
(H) Include a notification of the
time and place of the hearing and notification of the manner in which and the
time by which written responses to the petition must be filed, which may not be
less than 15 days after service of the transferee’s notice, in order to be
considered by the court. (See Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(K); see also 8/21/24 Petition, p. 5; 8/22/24 Proof of Service.)
(I) If the payee entered into the
structured settlement at issue within five years prior to the date of the
transfer agreement, then the transferee shall provide the following notice to
the payee’s attorney of record at the time the structured settlement was
created, if the attorney is licensed to practice in California, at the
attorney’s address on file with the State Bar of California. 
Here, Carl Todd Jr. entered into
the Settlement Agreement on August 21, 2019, and the Transfer Agreement on
August 21, 2024. However, proofs of service on file with the Court do not
indicate that notice has been provided to Carl Todd Jr.’s attorney of record at
the time the structured settlement agreement was created, nor has Carl Todd Jr.
indicated that he cannot otherwise recall or identify his former attorney. (See
Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(L);
see also 8/21/24 Petition, Ex. C, Settlement Agreement [effective date
8/21/19].)
                                                         
iv.     Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (g)
The petition satisfies the
requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (g) requiring that transferees
bear the costs of transfer petitions of structured settlement rights. (See Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subd. (g); see also 9/23/24
Amended Exhibit A, California Purchase Contract [“We have charged [Carl Todd
Jr.] for the following expenses: [¶] … $0.00 [¶] for a total of $0.00 in
expenses”] & 8/21/24 Petition, Ex.
B, California Disclosure Statement, p. 1 [same].)
                                                           
v.     Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (h)
The amended petition satisfies
the requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (h) because, when the petition
was filed, Petitioner advised Carl Todd Jr. of his right to seek independent
counsel and financial advice in connection with this transfer petition and
advised Carl Todd Jr. of his right to a reimbursement of $1,500 for incurring
such costs. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (h); see also 9/23/24 Amended Exhibit A, California Purchase Contract [Carl
Todd Jr. was advised to receive independent representation and elected not to
seek out such independent professional representation]; 9/20/24 Todd Decl., ¶
12 [“I did not receive independent legal or financial advice regarding the
proposed transaction. A copy of the waiver is attached to Exhibit ‘D’ of the petition.”].)
C.   
Requirements Conclusion
The Court (1) seeks
confirmation that there are no spousal support obligations and (2) requires explanation
as to why notice to counsel pursuant to section 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(L) was not provided or is not required. 
The Court further requests explanation of how the $154,000 already
transferred was spent, why Mr. Todd requires additional funds to fix the engine
on his vehicle and pay a few months’ rent upfront, and how much of the annuity
this proposed transfer will leave him with. This Court’s concern echoes that of
the Court in 24STCP01404 as to whether Payee transferred away his original
annuity without sufficient annuity and whether this transfer is in Payee’s best
interest. The Court also requests that the Petitioner, JG Wentworth, provide
further explanation as to why, according to the court’s 8/16/24 ruling in case
number 24STCP01404, five separate petitions have been filed in five separate
courtrooms in an approximately one-year period, and to provide an explanation
of the calculation of the various percentages paid out or to be paid out in
each transaction.
III. Conclusion
Petitioner J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC’s Verified Petition for Transfer
of Payment Rights is DENIED without prejudice.
