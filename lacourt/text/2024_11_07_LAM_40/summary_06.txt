The summary in English text is:

The Judge's tentative ruling concerns a motion by Plaintiff Gabriel Rueda for additional time to complete the deposition of Leslie Moonves. The motion was filed on October 4, 2024, and the hearing is set for November 7, 2024. The Plaintiff alleges that he has not had a fair opportunity to fully and completely depose Moonves and seeks an additional 2.5 hours to do so. The Defendant Moonves opposes the motion, arguing that the discovery and motion cutoff date has passed and that the Plaintiff has already had sufficient opportunity to examine Moonves on the topics he seeks to explore.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has not shown that an additional deposition is justified under these circumstances. The Plaintiff had the opportunity to question Moonves about the relevant issues during previous depositions in 2018 and 2024, and any new information that Rueda seeks to explore could have been obtained during those depositions. The motion is therefore denied.
