And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to consolidate the cases 24STCV05654 and 23STCV06122, which are both pending in Department 40 of the Los Angeles Superior Court. The cases involve the same parties, Southern California Edison Company, and arise from the same incident, a fire that occurred at a property in Hacienda Heights, California on March 18, 2021. The plaintiff, Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club (as subrogee of David Gastelo), is seeking to recover subrogated damages from SoCal Edison. The court finds that the cases share common questions of law and fact, and that consolidation will promote judicial economy, avoid splitting a cause of action, and lessen the burden on judicial resources. As SoCal Edison does not oppose the motion, the court grants the motion to consolidate the cases.
