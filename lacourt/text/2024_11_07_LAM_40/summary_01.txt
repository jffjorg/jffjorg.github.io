And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The motion was filed by the defendant Alpha Beta Company dba Ralphs, seeking to strike the plaintiff's claims for punitive damages. The plaintiff, Mecca Morgan, alleges that she was discriminated against and attacked by store employees and management at a Ralphs store, and is seeking punitive damages.

The judge has concluded that the plaintiff's complaint does not sufficiently allege oppression, fraud, or malice required to hold a corporate employer liable for punitive damages. The judge has granted the motion to strike, as to Ralphs only, with leave to amend. The plaintiff has 14 days to amend her complaint to address this issue.
