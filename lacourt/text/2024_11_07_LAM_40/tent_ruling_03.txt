 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff’s Motion
  to Consolidate Cases 



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange
of the Automobile Club (AAA), as subrogee of David Gastelo (Gastelo), sues
Defendant Southern California Edison Company (SoCal Edison) pursuant to a March
6, 2024, Complaint for Inverse Condemnation. 
The Complaint arises from the
following. AAA provided insurance coverage for Gastelo’s property located at
15260 Binney Street in Hacienda Heights, California (the Subject Property). On
March 18, 2021, one or more mylar balloons came into contact with and damaged a
transmission line owned and operated by SoCal Edison. The damaged transmission
line fell and came into contact with a data line for cable service which was
energized by the transmission line and caused secondary electrical events in
the Subject Property resulting in a fire. AAA has made payments in the amount
of $376,899.16 as part of the ongoing adjustment of the claim and is now
subrogated to the rights of the insured, Gastelo, to this extent against SoCal
Edison.
B. Motion Before the Court
On March 15, 2024, AAA filed a
notice of related cases in relation to David Gastelo v. Interinsurance
Exchange of the Automobile, et al. (LASC Case No. 23STCV05645) and David
Gastelo v. Southern California Edison Company, et al. (LASC Case No. 23STCV06122).

On July 9, 2024, the Court deemed
all three matters related. All actions are pending before Department 40. 
AAA brings the instant motion to
consolidate this action—Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club, as
subrogee of David Gastelo v. Southern California Edison Company (LASC Case
No. 24STCV05654)—with
David Gastelo v. Southern California Edison Company, et al. (LASC
Case No. 23STCV06122)
In LASC
Case No. 23STCV06122, Plaintiff Gastelo sues Defendants SoCal Edison, Edison
International (the Edison Defendants), and Does 1 through 100 pursuant to a December
19, 2023, First Amended Complaint alleging causes of action for (1) Negligence,
(2) Inverse Condemnation, (3) Trespass, (4) Private Nuisance, (5) Public
Nuisance, (6) Violation of Public Utilities Code § 2106, (7) Violation of
Health and Safety Code § 12007, (8) Strict Liability, (9) Breach of Contract, and
(10) Civil Remedies per Penal Code Section 496. The claims arise from
allegations that on March 18, 2021, as a result of the Edison Defendants improper
maintenance of its electrical infrastructure, a fire occurred at the Subject
Property resulting in significant damage to the Property. 
No Opposition to the motion has
been filed. AAA’s motion to consolidate is now before the Court. 
 
II. Motion
A. Legal Standard
When cases involving a common question of law or fact are
pending in the same superior court, i.e., in the same county, the cases can be
consolidated on a party’s motion or on the court’s own motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1048, subdivision (a). 
Cases can be consolidated for (1) all purposes (Hamilton
v. Asbestos Corp. (200) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147; see Code Civ. Proc., § 1048,
subd. (a)), (2) for trial (Stubblefield Constr. Co. v. City of San
Bernardino (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 687, 701; see Code Civ. Proc., § 1048,
subd. (a)), or (3) for limited purposes, e.g., discovery or pretrial matters
(see Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a); see, e.g., State v. Altus Fin.,
S.A. (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1284, 1293 [cases consolidated for discovery and
pretrial matters]; Austin B. v. Escondido Un. Sch. Dist. (2007) 149
Cal.App.4th 860, 870 [cases consolidated for discovery and trial]; Frieman
v. San Rafael Rock Quarry, Inc. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 29, 33 [cases
consolidated for discovery and pretrial determinations]). 
To prevail on a motion to consolidate, a movant must
establish that (1) the cases are pending before the same court, (2) the cases
share a common question of law or fact, and (3) the benefits of consolidation
outweigh the burdens. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).)
B. Analysis
1. Cases
Pending Before Same Court 
A party moving for consolidation must establish that the
cases being consolidated are pending in the same superior court, i.e., in the
same county. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).) In the Los Angeles Superior
Court, “[c]ases may not be consolidated unless they are in the same
department.” (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.3(g)(1).)  
Here, the Lead Case and LASC Case No. 23STCV06122 are both pending
before Department 40. 
            2.
Common Questions of Law or Fact
The movant for consolidation must establish that the cases
sought to be consolidated involve a common question of fact or law. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).) Common questions of law or fact can arise in
cases that share common parties and involve a common transaction (e.g.,
contract) or incident (e.g., automobile accident). (See, e.g., Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 377.62, subd. (b) [wrongful death action and survivor action can be
consolidated under section 1048 when actions arise from same wrongful act or
neglect]; Martin-Bragg v. Moore (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 367, 385 [trial
court has power to consolidate unlawful-detainer proceeding with quiet title
action involving same property because successful claim of title by tenant
would defeat landlord’s right to possession]; Sanchez v. Superior Court
(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1391, 1395 [cases arising from same car accident were
ordered consolidated for trial].) The more predominant and significant the
common questions are to the litigation, the more likely the motion will be
granted. (Cf. Code Civ. Proc., § 404.1 [factors considered for coordination].)
Here, both the Lead Action and LASC Case No. 23STCV06122
are filed against SoCal Edison and arise from the fire that occurred at the
Subject Property on March 18, 2021. In the Lead Action, AAA alleges a cause of
action for inverse condemnation to recover subrogated damages. In LASC Case No.
23STCV06122, Gastelo alleges a cause of action for inverse condemnation as well
as additional causes of action. 
Thus, the cases involve common questions of fact and law
because they share common parties and involve a common incident. 
            3.
Benefits Outweigh Burdens 
The movant for consolidation should establish that the
benefits of consolidation outweigh the burdens. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1048,
subd. (a).) To establish this, the movant should argue that consolidation will,
e.g.: (1) save time (i.e., length of time to conclude one suit versus
multiple suits) or money (see Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a) [“costs” and
“delay]); or (2) help prevent the inconsistent adjudication of common and
factual legal issues, lessen the burden on judicial resources, or promote the
convenience of the parties, witnesses, and attorneys (see Sunrise Fin., LLC
v. Superior Court (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 114, 121; cf. Code Civ. Proc., §
404.1 [factors considered for coordination]). 
Here, AAA argues that the cases
should be consolidated because the subrogated damages and the uninsured damages
are “merely two separate categories arising from the same event. The common
cause of action would make separate trials redundant and both cases seek
recovery from the same defendant.” (Mot. p. 7:5-6.) Further, AAA asserts that
consolidating the cases would not prejudice any party because the “interests in
establishing liability against the common defendant are identical for both
Gastelo and AAA, [SoCal Edison] would avoid having to present the same defense
twice, and because the right to recover the subrogated portion of damages has
been transferred to AAA, there is no overlap of the claims.” ((Mot. p. 7:7-10.)
The benefits of consolidation
outweigh the burdens in this circumstance. Consolidation will promote judicial
economy by having the same issues litigated and decided in the same action
rather than in duplicative proceedings, will avoid splitting a cause of action,
and will less the burden on judicial resources. Additionally, SoCal Edison does not
oppose the motion and thus there is no evidence that consolidation would be
prejudicial to them.
Thus, the motion to consolidate is
GRANTED. 
III. Conclusion
Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange
of the Automobile Club as Subrogee of David Gastelo’s Motion to Consolidate is
GRANTED.
