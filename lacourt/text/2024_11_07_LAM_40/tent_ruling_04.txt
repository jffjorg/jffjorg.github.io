Demurrer and Motion

I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiffs Sonya Dove, Inc. and
Sonya Dove (collectively, Dove) sue Defendants Juno and Taylor APC, James E. Junio, Kurtus Altergott, and Does 1 through
10 (collectively, Defendants) pursuant to an April 16, 2024, Complaint alleging
causes of action for: (1) Professional Negligence; (2) Fraud; (3) Breach of
Contract; and (4) Breach of Fiduciary Duty. 
The claims arise out of a dispute
between the parties regarding Defendants’ preparation and submission of Dove’s
tax returns.  Dove hired the Defendants
to prepare personal and business tax returns for 2019 through 2022. In late
2023, Dove discovered a $22,000 penalty associated with Dove’s business tax
return caused by Defendants alleged failure to file proper tax filings. In December
2021, Dove sold real property belonging to her in her individual capacity.
Between December 2021 and January 2022, Dove inquired with Defendants about the
capital gains taxes that the sale triggered and requested that such capital
gains taxes be timely paid by the January 15, 2022, deadline. Dove alleges that
the capital gains taxes were not paid by the deadline and as a result she was
subject to $17,238.00 in federal penalties and $10,718.00 in state penalties. 
B. Motion Before the Court
On June 24, 2024, Defendants
demurred to the Complaint. That same day, Defendants also filed a motion to
strike portions of the Complaint.
On October 22, 2024, Dove filed
oppositions to both the demurrer and motion to strike. 
On October 31, 2024, Defendants
filed replies to both oppositions.
The Defendants’ demurrer and motion
to strike are now before the Court.  
 
II. Demurrer
A. Meet and Confer
The Defendants have satisfied the
meet and confer requirement pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41
subdivision (a)(3)(A). (Pearse Decl. ¶ 2.) 

B. Legal Standard 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) 
To sufficiently allege a cause of action, a complaint must
allege all the ultimate facts—that is, the facts needed to establish each
element of the cause of action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s Television,
Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212, superseded by
statute as stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006)
39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) “[E]ach evidentiary fact that might eventually form part
of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart
Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) 
In testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the
demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v.
Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) Courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other
grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th
1158, 1162.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.)  
A demurrer for uncertainty lies
where the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 430.10, subd. (f).)
“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even
where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be
clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616, disapproved on other
grounds in Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th
26, 46 [holding claims for unfair business practices need not be pled
specifically, impliedly disapproving Khoury].) As a result, a special
demurrer for uncertainty is not intended to reach failure to incorporate
sufficient facts in the pleading but is directed only at uncertainty existing
in the allegations already made. (People v. Taliaferro (1957) 149
Cal.App.2d 822, 825, disapproved on other grounds in Jefferson v. J.E.
French Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 717, 719-720 [statute of limitations
question].) 
Where a complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action
and to apprise a defendant of issues he is to meet, it is not properly subject
to a special demurrer for uncertainty. (See ibid.; see also Gressley
v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643 [“A special demurrer [for
uncertainty] should be overruled where the allegations of the complaint are
sufficiently clear to apprise the defendant of the issues which he is to
meet”].) 
C. Analysis 
The Defendants demur to all four
causes of action in the Complaint, although only the fourth cause of action for
breach of fiduciary duty and the second cause of action for fraud are discussed
in any detail. Defendants also demur on the ground that the individually named
employees should be dismissed as they are not proper parties to the contract or
tort claims.
As an initial matter, upon review
of the Complaint, the first, third and fourth causes of action are brought
pursuant to Corporations Code sections 5231 and 5237 which govern non-profit
public benefit corporations and their directors and managers, not for-profit
corporations. (See Corp. Code §§ 5231, 5237.) Yet the Complaint states that
Defendant Junio & Taylor, APC is a certified public accounting firm and
Defendants James E. Junio and Kurtus Altergott are both employees of the
accounting firm. (Compl., ¶¶ 6-8.) Thus, Corporations Code sections 5231 and
5237 are inapplicable to the causes of action and parties in this action. As fiduciary
duties only arise in certain technical, legal relationships, there is no other fiduciary
relationship or statute as alleged here that gives rise to a fiduciary duty by
these Accountant defendants. (Oakland Raiders v. National Football League
(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 621, 632-634.) Accordingly, the demurrer is sustained as
to the first, third, and fourth causes of action.
As to the second cause of action
for fraud, Defendants contend that it is not plead with specificity and there
is no additional damage alleged other than the same damage that was suffered for
the professional negligence claim. (Mot., pp. 9-11.) They contend that the
complaint is “an overpled and exaggerated attempt to improperly expand an alleged
negligence claim.” (Reply at p. 1.)
While a party may seek alternate
forms of relief, the Court agrees that the second cause of action for fraud
does not sufficiently “show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representations were tendered.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12
Cal.4th 631, 645 [citations omitted].) 
For the foregoing reasons, the
Complaint does not sufficiently state a cause of action for the first, second, third
and fourth cause of action. 
Thus, the demurrer is SUSTAINED,
with leave to amend. 
 
III. Motion to Strike
A.    Legal Standard
The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its
discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (a) strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (b) strike out all or
any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of
California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436,
subds. (a), (b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter
in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative
facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].) 
For the purposes of a motion to strike pursuant to Sections
435 to 437 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the term “pleading” generally means
a demurrer, answer, complaint, or cross-complaint, (Code Civ. Proc., § 435,
subd. (a)), and an immaterial allegation or irrelevant matter in a pleading
entails (1) an allegation that is not essential to the statement of a claim or
defense, (2) an allegation that is neither pertinent to nor supported by an
otherwise sufficient claim or defense, or (3) a demand for judgment requesting
relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint or cross-complaint
(Code Civ. Proc., § 431.10, subds. (b)(1)-(3), (c)). 
In analyzing a motion to strike, California courts “accept
as true the well-pleaded allegations” in the challenged pleadings, as well as
“well-pleaded allegations admitted in” the responsive “answer.” (Atwell
Island Water Dist. v. Atwell Island Water District (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th
624, 628 (Atwell); Clauson v. Superior Court (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255 [California courts “read allegations of a pleading
subject to a motion to strike as a whole, all parts in their context, and
assume their truth”].) 
B.   
Analysis
Here, because the demurrer has been
sustained in its entirety, the motion to strike is MOOT. 
 
IV. Conclusion
Defendant’s Demurrer is SUSTAINED, with leave to amend within 14 days.
 
Defendant’s Motion to Strike is denied as MOOT.
