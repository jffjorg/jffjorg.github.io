Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the Landlord's motion for summary judgment, finding that the Tenant has presented triable issues of fact regarding whether the breaches were material and whether the Landlord can establish the third element of an unlawful detainer action. The judge has also granted the Landlord's motion for summary adjudication as to the Tenant's first, second, and fourth affirmative defenses, finding that the Landlord has met its initial burden to show that there is no triable issue of material fact on those defenses.
