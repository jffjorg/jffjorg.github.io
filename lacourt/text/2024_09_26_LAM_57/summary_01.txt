And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a third amended complaint. The motion seeks to add allegations that the plaintiff, Jack Moy, was constructively terminated on the basis of his race. The judge notes that the declarations submitted by the plaintiffs' attorneys in support of the motion fail to address two required points: when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered and why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The judge finds this failure "glaring" given that the proposed amendments come nearly five years after the plaintiffs filed the action and just over a month before the scheduled start of the trial. The judge is denying the motion as a result.
