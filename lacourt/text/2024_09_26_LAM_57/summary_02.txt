And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to lift a discretionary stay of proceedings in a case involving Mark Hardin and others, who are defendants in a lawsuit. This decision was made after receiving a report from the plaintiffs' counsel on September 23, 2024. The automatic stay of proceedings against Hardin remains in place due to his federal bankruptcy protection. The judge has also denied the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction to stop a non-judicial foreclosure by The Evergreen Advantage LLC on three properties. The judge determined that the plaintiffs failed to show that they are likely to succeed in their claims against Evergreen and that they would suffer irreparable harm without an injunction.
