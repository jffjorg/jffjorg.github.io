  Case Number:  20STCV03322    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2024    Dept:  57 The Court is denying Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint to add allegations that Plaintiff Jack Moy was constructively terminated on the basis of his race.  California Rule of Court 3.1324(b) provides that a motion for leave to amend a complaint must be accompanied by a declaration that specifies, inter alia and as pertinent here, "[w[hen the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and . . . [t]he reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier."  The declaration of Plaintiffs' attorney Christopher Porter submitted along with the Plaintiffs' motion and supporting memorandum fails to address these two points.  The same is true of the declaration of Plaintiffs' attorney Nancy Abrolat that was submitted along with the Plaintiffs' reply memorandum.  The failure of the declarations in this regard is glaring given that the proposed amendments come nearly five years after the Plaintiffs filed the action, more than two years after the Plaintiffs filed their operative Second Amended Complaint, and just over a month before the scheduled start of the trial.
