And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer of the defendants, Crown Financial Partners LLC and Jonathan Beck, without allowing the plaintiffs to amend their complaint. This is the third time the Judge has sustained a demurrer of the defendants' negligence claim, as the plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege a legal duty on the defendants' part to ensure that the life insurance policy procured by the defendants for the minor plaintiffs' father, Erez Talmor, did not lapse. The Judge has determined that it is no longer reasonably possible for the plaintiffs to make this showing.
