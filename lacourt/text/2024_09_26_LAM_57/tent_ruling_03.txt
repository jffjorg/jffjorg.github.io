 Case Number:  23STCV22845    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2024    Dept:  57 The Court is sustaining without leave to amend the demurrer of Defendants Crown Financial Partners LLC and Jonathan Beck (collectively, "Beck") the fourth cause of action for negligence in the Second Amended Complaint ("the SAC") of the minor Plaintiffs by and through their guardian ad litem.  The SAC  contains insufficient allegations to establish for purposes of the negligence claim that Beck owed a legal duty to the minor Plaintiffs' father Erez Talmor to ensure that Erez's life insurance policy that Beck procured for him did not lapse.  This marks the third time that the Court has sustained a demurrer of Beck to the minor Plaintiffs' negligence claim on the ground that the minor Plaintiffs had failed to set forth sufficient allegations to establish the existence of a legal duty on Beck's part.  On the two previous occasions the Court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend demurrer because it appeared reasonably possible that the minor Plaintiffs' could  cure the defect the Court identified by making sufficient allegations to establish that Beck had a legal duty to ensure that Erez's life insurance policy did not lapse.  At this juncture, however, the Court has determined that it is no longer reasonably possible for the minor Plaintiffs to make that showing.
