 Case Number:  21STCV20483    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2024    Dept:  57 Following Defendant Mark Hardin's filing for federal bankruptcy protection, Plaintiffs' case against Hardin was automatically stayed.  This Court subsequently entered a discretionary stay of proceeding in the case as to all of the Defendants because it appeared to the Court that Hardin's role in the case is so intertwined with the actions of the other Defendants.  In light of the report filed by Plaintiffs' counsel on September 23, 2024 regarding the status of the Hardin bankruptcy, the Court is lifting the discretionary stay.   The automatic stay as to Hardin remains in place. But that stay presents no barrier to the planned non-judicial foreclosure by Defendant The Evergreen Advantage LLC's on three properties that are the subject of Plaintiffs' action against the Defendants ("the Subject Properties").  Separate and apart from the now-lifted discretionary stay, Plaintiffs have asked the Court to enter a preliminary injunction enjoining Evergreen's foreclosure on the Subject Properties.  Based on the evidence submitted by the Plaintiffs and Evergreen, the Court has determined that Plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden of showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims against Evergreen in this action and that they will suffer irreparable injury in the absence of interim injunctive relief .  Having failed to make that showing, Plaintiffs are not entitled to a preliminary injunction enjoining Evergreen's foreclosure on the Subject Properties.
