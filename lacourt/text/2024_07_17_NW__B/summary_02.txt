And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is to deny the defendant's request to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint with terminating sanctions, but to grant the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $900. The judge found that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's order is an abuse of the discovery process, but did not find terminating sanctions to be warranted at this time. The judge notes that further noncompliance may warrant higher sanctions. The defendant argued that the court should issue terminating sanctions to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's order and the discovery process. The judge considered the case law and held that a decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly, but where a violation is willful and preceded by a history of abuse, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.
