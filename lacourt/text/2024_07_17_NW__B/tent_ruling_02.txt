BACKGROUND
 
On March 12, 2021, Plaintiff Dwayne Flowers filed a
complaint against Jasmine Webb alleging motor vehicle negligence and general
negligence regarding a motor vehicle accident that occurred on or about March
12, 2019 on Crenshaw Blvd and Adams Blvd.
 
On April 23, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to
compel discovery responses from Plaintiff and imposed sanctions against
Plaintiff only. 
 
On June 3, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion for
terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions. To date, no opposition has been
filed. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
DENY in part. GRANT in part. $900 in monetary sanctions
imposed against Plaintiff.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 permits the court
in its discretion to impose the following types of terminating sanctions
against anyone engaging in conduct that is a “misuse of the discovery process”:
 
(1) An order striking out the pleadings
or parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process.
(2) An order staying further
proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is obeyed.
(3) An order dismissing the action, or
any part of the action, of that party.
(4) An order rendering a judgment by
default against that party.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(d).) Conduct that is a “misuse of the discovery process” includes failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery and disobeying a
court order to provide discovery. (Id., § 2023.010, subds. (d) &
(g).)
 
“Imposition of sanctions for misuse of discovery lies within
the trial court's discretion, and is reviewed only for abuse.” (Doppes v.
Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 991.) “The trial court
should consider both the conduct being sanctioned and its effect on the party
seeking discovery[.]” (Id., 992.) Sanctions should be tailored to the
harm created by the withheld discovery and should not be used as punishment. (Ibid.)
 
The court should also consider whether the discovery
misconduct was “willful” and whether the requesting party was prejudiced by the
other’s failure to comply. (Do It Urself Moving & Storage, Inc. v.
Brown, Leifer, Slatkin & Berns (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 27, 37.)
 
Lastly, courts have held that terminating sanctions are
warranted when a party repeatedly fails to propound adequate discovery
responses, even after the court imposed monetary sanctions. (Liberty Mutual
Fire Ins. Co. v. LcL Administrations, Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1093.)
For example, in Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, the Court of Appeal held that five motions to compel created a record
“replete with evidence of [appellant’s] failures to answer discovery requests.”
(Id., 279–280.)
 
Defendant argues that the Court should issue terminating
sanctions to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint due to Plaintiff’s failure to
comply with the Court’s order. Defendant contends that the Court is justified
in dismissing the action due to Plaintiff’s continued disregard for court
orders and the discovery process. Defendant argues that the plaintiff's
non-compliance not only ignores the court’s order but also shows a complete
disregard for the discovery process, which has necessitated Defendant’s filing
of prior motions to compel responses. Additionally, Defendant seeks an order
for the plaintiff to pay $900 as a reasonable sanction for having to bring this
motion.
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s failure to obey a Court
order is an abuse of the discovery process, subject to sanctions. However, the
Court does not find terminating sanctions to be warranted at this time. The
Court makes this decision following case law which states, “A decision to order
terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes v.
Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) However, the
Court notes that further noncompliance may warrant higher sanctions. Thus, the
Court denies Plaintiff’s motion for terminating sanctions, but grants her
request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $900 payable within 20 days.
