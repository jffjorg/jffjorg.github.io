And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the petition to confirm the minor's compromise for Plaintiff Anthony Ruiz is GRANTED. The proposed settlement of $100,000 appears to be fair and reasonable under the circumstances, and the requested attorney's fees are also fair and reasonable. The Court finds that the petition complies with the legal requirements and that the settlement is in the best interests of the minor. The Court sets an OSC re Deposit into Blocked Account for October 16, 2024 at 8:30am in Department B.
