Summary:
This is a tentative ruling on a motion for determination of good faith settlement between Plaintiff Reyes Valadez and Defendant Frontier Communications Corporation. The motion is granted, finding that the settlement satisfies the Tech-Bilt factors. The Court finds that the settlement is based on an approximation of Plaintiff's total recovery, is reasonable in light of Defendant Frontier's potential liability, and is not disproportionate to the amount paid in settlement. The Court also finds that Defendant Spectrum's opposition to the motion is without merit, as it fails to present admissible evidence demonstrating that the settlement is not made in good faith.
