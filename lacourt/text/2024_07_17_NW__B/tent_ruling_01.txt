BACKGROUND
 
On January 21, 2021, Plaintiffs Isaac Ruiz, a minor by and
through his guardian ad litem, Karla Ruiz, and Anthony Ruiz, a minor by and
through his guardian ad litem, Jesus Ruiz, (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), filed
this action against Defendant Ty Erik Martinez (“Defendant”) for damages
arising from a motor vehicle accident.
 
On April 3, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a notice of conditional
settlement of the entire case. 
 
Petitioner Jesus Ruiz now petitions the Court to confirm Anthony
Ruiz’s settlement as he is still a minor. 
 
Trial is set for July 23, 2024.
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Legal Standard
 
 “[T]he protective
role the court generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a role to
assure that whatever is done is in the minor’s best
interests…[I]ts primary concern is whether the compromise is sufficient to
provide for the minor’s injuries, care and treatment.” (Goldberg v. Sup. Ct. (1994)
23 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382.) 
 
Court approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.
(Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc. § 372.) A petition for
court approval of a compromise or covenant not to sue under Code of Civil
Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court,
rules 7.950, 7.951 and 7.952. The petition must be verified by the
petitioner and contain a full disclosure of all information that has “any
bearing upon the reasonableness” of the compromise or the covenant. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)

Discussion
 
Here, Petitioner Jesus Ruiz (“Petitioner”) has filed a
petition to confirm the minor’s compromise for Plaintiff Anthony Ruiz
(“Claimant”). Claimant, a minor, by and through his guardian ad litem, has
agreed to release his claims against Defendant in exchange for $100,000. If
approved, $13,777.28 will be used to pay medical expenses, $40,000 will be used
to pay attorney’s fees, and $2,092.83 will be used for nonmedical expenses,
leaving a balance of $44,129.89 for Claimant, to be deposited in an blocked
account with LBS Financial Credit Union, Bixby Knolls Branch, located at 4436
Atlantic Avenue, Long Beach, CA 90807, subject to withdrawal only on
authorization of the court until Claimant reaches 18 years of age.


Upon review the proposed settlement, it appears to be fair
and reasonable under the circumstances. Also, there are no procedural defects
with the instant petition. Further, the requested attorney’s fees stated in the
petition, which amount to 40% of the total settlements, is fair and reasonable
based on the experience, results achieved, and work performed in this action by
Plaintiffs’ counsel. Based on the Declaration of Minh T. Nguyen, the Court
finds that several of the factors set forth in California Rules of Court Rule
7.955(b) have been met. (See generally, Notice of Petition, Attachment 13a).
 
Accordingly, the petition is GRANTED. 
 
Per California Rules of Court, Rule 7.952, Petitioner and
Claimant must appear at the hearing, unless the Court finds good cause to
excuse their appearance.  The Court finds
that their appearances are not necessary.
 
An OSC re Deposit into Blocked Account is set for October 16,
2024 at 8:30am in Department B.
