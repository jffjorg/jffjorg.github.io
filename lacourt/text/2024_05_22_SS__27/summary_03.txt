And here is a summary of the English text in the tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion by Novik Law Group to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Edna Fuentes. The motion is unopposed and is based on a breakdown in the attorney-client communication. The judge has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and the Court finds that this is proper grounds for withdrawal. However, the Court will continue the motion to June 12, 2024, as the next hearing is too soon for the Plaintiff to retain new counsel.
