CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV14037 EDNA
FUENTES vs MELUSINE ENTERPRISES LLC
Moving Party: Plaintiff’s Counsel Novik
Law Group
Responding Party: Unopposed  
Notice: Sufficient  
  
Ruling: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS
COUNSEL IS CONTINUED 
 
Background
 
Novik Law Group represents
Plaintiff. Novik Law Group moves to be relieved as counsel, citing an
irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client communication. No opposition has
been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
The Court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.)
¿ 
A motion to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the
client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).)
¿ 
Analysis and Conclusion
 
Novik Law Group has filed Judicial
Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and
MC-053 (Proposed Order). Novik Law Group seeks to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client
communication. The Court finds this to be proper grounds for withdrawal. (See
Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship/communication is grounds for allowing the attorney
to withdraw).)
 
The Court
notes that the next hearing is two Orders to Show Cause set for 6/12/24, which would
not be sufficient time for Plaintiff to retain new counsel to attend the
hearing and accordingly withdrawal at this time would be prejudicial or disrupt
the orderly process of justice. The Court continues the present motion to
6/12/24 to trail the hearing on the Orders to Show Cause.
