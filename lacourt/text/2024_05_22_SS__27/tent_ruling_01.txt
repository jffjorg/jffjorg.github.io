RICHARD BIRNHOLZ, et al.
Moving Party: Defendants

Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT: COURT
WILL HEAR ARGUMENT.
 
Background
 
On
June 29, 2021, Plaintiff filed the present case alleging that on August 29,
2020, he fell off the roof of the second floor of the home of Defendants
Richard and Diane Birnholz while cleaning the gutters for Defendants.
Defendants now move the court for summary judgment or summary adjudication on
the basis that Plaintiff was an independent contractor for Defendants, and
therefore the Privette doctrine bars his claims against the Defendants.
Additionally, Defendants assert that they were not present at the property on
the date of the incident and therefore did not retain control over Plaintiff’s
conduct.
 
Issues for parties to address:(1) Waiver of notice; and(2) The
Court believes that Plaintiff is an independent contractor and that the
Privette doctrine applies.  The Court
would like to hear additional argument regarding (a)the exception for retained
control generally and, (b) specifically, the issue of the impact of Plaintiff’s
acceptance of the job after he was informed of the limitations under which he
was to perform the work.
