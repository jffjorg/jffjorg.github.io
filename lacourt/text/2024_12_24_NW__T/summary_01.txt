```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment, which means that the lawsuit filed by Samson Primm against State Farm General Insurance Company will be dismissed. The judge found that the one-year contractual limitations period, as stated in the Personal Articles Policy, bars the lawsuit because it was filed more than a year after the expiration of the limitations period. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to address the statute of limitations issue in his opposition, which is a required part of the process for opposing a motion for summary judgment. As a result, the motion for summary adjudication is rendered moot, and the lawsuit will be dismissed with prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff cannot refile the lawsuit.
