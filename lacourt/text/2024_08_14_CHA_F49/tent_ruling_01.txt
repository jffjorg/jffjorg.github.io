Disposition 


CONTINUE 


 



On August 14,
2023, the Court noted the following deficiencies: 
 
1.     
Petitioner’s medical
expense Totals do not reflect that all medical expenses will be satisfied after
judgment. (MC-350 ¶12a.) Specifically, the line item “total medical expenses paid
(including payments by private insurance, Medi-Cal, or Medicare)” lists $760.15
(Id, ¶12(2)),
which only accounts for the benefits received from Medi-Cal. Consequently, this
results in a discrepancy between the balance shown and the total medical
expense minus the total paid expense. 
 
Given these deficiencies, the Court
CONTINUES the hearing on the Petition for Minor’s Compromise of Disputed Claim. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Petitioner’s
Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim for Minor Nixon Liescheidt is CONTINUED.
