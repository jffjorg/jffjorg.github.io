And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to quash service of summons based on personal jurisdiction. The defendant argues that the plaintiff failed to serve the complaint on him using any of the five methods enumerated in the Code of Civil Procedure, and that he was not personally served and only became aware of the litigation by receiving certified mail from the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not file an opposition, but instead filed a proof of service that the court finds does not sufficiently establish the statutory requirements were satisfied. The court notes that the proof of service does not include a signed acknowledgment of receipt, as required by statute. Therefore, the court grants the defendant's motion and quashes service of summons.
