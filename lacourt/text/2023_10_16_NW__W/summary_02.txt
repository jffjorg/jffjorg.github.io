And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the defendants' motions. The defendants have moved to stay the civil proceeding due to the pending criminal case, and the judge has granted this motion in part. The judge has also granted the defendants' motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint, as the allegations in the complaint do not meet the requirements for punitive damages under California law. The judge finds that the allegations of reckless driving by defendant Petros Gharibyan do not amount to an evil motive or conscious disregard for the safety of others, and therefore do not warrant punitive damages. The judge notes that the plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages, and that the plaintiff's arguments in opposition are not supported by the allegations in the complaint.
