And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the cross-complaint filed by Payam Marouni MD, Inc. against Vedres Family Investment Partnership, LP. The cross-complaint alleged conspiracy, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and negligent interference with contractual relations. The judge found that the cross-complaint failed to adequately allege an independent wrongful act and did not plead facts showing that the defendants engaged in an independently wrongful act. The judge also found that the cross-complaint did not allege an economic relationship with a cognizable third party and that the allegations of interference with prospective economic advantage and contractual relations were insufficient. The judge gave the plaintiff leave to amend the cross-complaint.
