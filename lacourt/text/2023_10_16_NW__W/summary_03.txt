And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the motion to stay the civil proceeding as to Defendant Petros Gharibyan due to the pending criminal case against him. The Judge also grants the motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint with leave to amend. The Judge denies the motion to consolidate the three cases without prejudice.

The Judge orders that Defendant Petros Gharibyan may participate in depositions noticed by the plaintiff or Defendant Vazrik Gharibyan and may ask questions and receive copies of discovery between those parties, but may not issue discovery requests or respond to them at this time.

The Judge finds that the allegations in the complaint regarding Defendant Petros Gharibyan's erratic driving and Defendant Vazrik Gharibyan's negligent entrustment are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. However, the Judge believes that the proposed allegations of Defendant Petros driving more than twice the posted speed limit around a sharp corner, running a red light before the subject crash, a previous arrest for reckless driving, and Defendant Vazrik's knowledge of Petros' arrest for reckless driving would show that the risk of injury was probable and warrant a request for punitive damages.
