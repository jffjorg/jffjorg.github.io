And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge confirms the fair value of $5,033,000 for the 35% interest in PCH Treatment, Inc. as of 12/1/2022, as determined by the majority consensus of the appraisers. The judge finds that the reports of the appraisers, Mr. Ashbrook and Mr. Vickery, were thorough and detailed, and that the allegations of procedural and substantive improprieties and deficiencies in their reports are unfounded. The judge rejects the defendant's argument that the valuation of Mr. Johnstone should be accepted, and finds that the plaintiff's arguments that the valuation is biased and unreliable are unpersuasive. The judge orders that the motion to confirm the award be granted, and that the fair value of $5,033,000 be confirmed for the 35% PCH interest as of 12/1/2022.
