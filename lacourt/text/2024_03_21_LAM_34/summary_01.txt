And here is the English summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying ASMS's motion to strike the First Amended Cross-Complaint filed by Sea Port Care Center, L.P. The motion was filed on February 20, 2024, and the hearing is scheduled for March 21, 2024. The judge expresses surprise that ASMS's counsel chose to file the motion, given that it would not have changed the outcome of the litigation even if granted. The judge notes that the three attorneys listed on the caption page of the motion have over 55 years of combined experience and should have realized that the motion was a waste of time and money. The judge agrees with SPCC's arguments that the alleged therapy contract with Express Therapy, Inc. is relevant and does not affect the substantial rights of ASMS. Therefore, the motion is denied.
