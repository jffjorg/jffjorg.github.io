BACKGROUND:
 
On January 9,
2024, Petitioner National General Insurance Company (“Petitioner”) filed its
Petition to Open Superior Court File for Purposes of Obtaining Jurisdiction
Over Uninsured Motorist Matter (“Petition”) against Respondent Ariana Hill
(“Respondent”). The underlying issue in this matter involves an ongoing
arbitration regarding an uninsured motorist claim. 
 
On January
23, 2024, Petitioner filed its Proof of Service. 
 
On February
7, 2024, Petitioner filed: (1) Motion to Compel Verified Answers without
Objections to Special Interrogatories (No. 1) [and] Request for Sanctions
(“SROGs Motion”); and (2) Motion to Compel Verified Answers Without Objections
to Demand for Identification and Production of Document (No. 1) [and] Request
for Sanctions (“RPDs Motion”). Petitioner concurrently filed a Proposed Order
with each of the motions. 
 
No
oppositions or other responses have been filed regarding the discovery motions.

 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
California Code of Civil Procedure requires a
response from the party to whom form interrogatories, special interrogatories,
and demand requests are propounded within 30 days after service of the
requests, unless the time is extended by agreement of the parties. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.260, subd. (a), 2030.270, subd. (a), 2031.260, subd. (a),
2031.270, subd. (a).) If a party fails to serve timely responses, "the
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).) By failing to respond, the
offending party waives any objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)
 
For a motion to compel, all a propounding
party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the
time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were
directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Super. Ct.
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905, 906.) Indeed, "[o]nce [a party] 'fail[ed]
to serve a timely response,' the trial court had authority to grant [opposing
party's] motion to compel responses." (Sinaiko Healthcare Counseling,
Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 405.)
 
The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel motions for
interrogatories or requests for production, unless the Court finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails
to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
A.      The
Discovery Requests
 
“[T]he uninsured motorist law grants the superior court the exclusive
jurisdiction to hear discovery matters arising under uninsured motorist
arbitrations.” (Miranda v. 21st Century Ins. Co. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th
913, 926, italics in original, citing Ins. Code, § 11580.2, subd. (f).)
 
        Here, Petitioners moves the Court to
compel Respondent to serve responses to special interrogatories (“SROGs”) and
requests for production of documents (“RPDs”) that were served by Petitioner on
Respondent on October 30, 2023. (SROGs Motion, p. 12:11–15 and Exh. A, p. 8;
RPDs Motion, p. 12:13–17 and Exh. A, p. 5.)
 
        Respondent does not oppose or other
respond to the motions. 
 
        The Court does not have any evidence
that would indicate responses to the SROGs and RPDs have been served. Rather,
Petitioner’s Counsel declares that no such responses have been served. (SROGs
Motion, Decl. Calendo, ¶ 13; RPDs Motion, Decl. Calendo, ¶ 13.)
 
        The Court GRANTS the SROGs Motion.
 
        The Court GRANTS the RPDs Motion.  
 
        Respondent shall serve responses to the
SROGs and RPDs within thirty (30) days of the issuance of this Order. 
 
 
B.      Sanctions
 
Petitioner requests $661.65 in monetary sanctions for each of
the motions.
 
Petitioner’s Counsel declares: (1) that they charge $150.00 per hour;
(2) that they incurred four hours of work for each of the motions; and (3) that
they incurred $61.65 in costs for each of the motions. (SROGs Motion, Decl. Calendo, ¶ 14;
RPDs Motion, Decl. Calendo, ¶ 14.)
 
The hourly rate and costs incurred are reasonable, but the number of
hours worked is not reasonable. Specifically, because the motions are nearly
identical, the Court does not believe that counsel spent an identical $661.65
on each of the three motions.
 
“If . .
. the Court were required to award a reasonable fee when an outrageously
unreasonable one has been asked for, claimants would be encouraged to make
unreasonable demands, knowing that the only unfavorable consequence of such
misconduct would be reduction of their fee to what they should have asked in
the first place. To discourage such greed, a severer reaction is needful.”  (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d
621, 635 [cleaned up].)   “A fee request
that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to
reduce the award or deny one altogether.” (Chavez v. City of Los Angeles
(2010) 47 Cal.4th 970, 990; Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1137; Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635.)

 
 
Further, Defendant is now pro per; her previous counsel has been
suspended from the practice of law.
 
The Court DECLINES to award sanctions. 
 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The SROGs Motion
is GRANTED.
 
The RPDs Motion
is GRANTED. 
 
        Respondent shall serve responses to the
SROGs and RPDs within thirty (30) days of the issuance of this Order. 
 
The Requests for Monetary Sanctions are DENIED.
