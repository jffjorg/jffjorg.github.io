Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel and a request for sanctions. The motion is granted, and the respondent is ordered to serve responses to special interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30 days. The requests for monetary sanctions are denied. The Judge notes that the respondent failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests, and that the petitioner's counsel incurred reasonable costs and expenses, but reduced the award to deny the request for sanctions. The Judge also notes that the respondent is now pro per and that her previous counsel has been suspended from the practice of law.
