And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the petition for writ of mandamus filed by Pacific 1 LLC against the Santa Monica Rent Control Board (SMRCB). The petition challenges the decision of the SMRCB that Tenant Pamela Deliz maintains occupancy of the apartment as her usual residence of return, and thus is protected by rent control.

The judge holds that the SMRCB did not abuse its discretion in issuing the decision. The judge finds that Tenant presented substantial evidence to support the finding that she maintains occupancy at the apartment as her usual residence of return, including evidence of her continued presence at the apartment, her use of the apartment as her residence, and her lack of presence at other properties.

The judge notes that Pacific 1 LLC presented some evidence to the contrary, but finds that it is not sufficient to overcome the substantial evidence presented by Tenant. The judge also notes that the SMRCB's decision is supported by the totality of the circumstances, including the fact that Tenant maintains a connection to the apartment and uses it as her residence, despite her occasional absences.

Accordingly, the judge denies the petition for writ of mandamus and upholds the decision of the SMRCB.
