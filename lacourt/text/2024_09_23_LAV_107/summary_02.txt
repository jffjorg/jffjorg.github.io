And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Eric Harmon in a case where plaintiff Steven Higgins has filed an unlawful detainer complaint against defendants Kambiz Razaghi, Naznin Mojahed, and Tereza Teymourian. The defendants have filed a motion to quash service of summons, arguing that the complaint was taped to their front door and that no proof of service has been filed. The judge finds that the motion is premature because the plaintiff has not yet effected service of the summons and complaint on the defendants. Therefore, the motion to quash is denied as premature, and the defendants are ordered to give notice.
