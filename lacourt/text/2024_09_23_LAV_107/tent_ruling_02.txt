[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS
 
Dept. 107
9:00 a.m.
September 23,
  2024



 
I.               
BACKGROUND
On July 8,
2024, Plaintiff Steven Higgins filed this unlawful detainer complaint against
Defendants Kambiz Razaghi, Naznin Mojahed, and Tereza Teymourian.
On September 5, 2024, Defendants Razaghi and Mojahed
filed this motion to quash service of summons and complaint. No opposition has
been filed. (Defendant Tereza Teymourian filed a motion to quash on September 12,2024
which is set for October 9, 2024.)
II.            
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“A
defendant . . . may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the
following purposes: 
(1) To quash service of summons on the
ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10(a).)  “[C]ompliance with the
statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish personal
jurisdiction. [Citation.]”  (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co.
(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.)  “[T]he filing
of a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was
proper” but only if it “complies with the statutory requirements regarding such
proofs.”  (Id. at 1441-1442.)  When a defendant moves to quash
service of the summons and complaint, the plaintiff has “the burden of proving
the facts that did give the court jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to
an effective service.”  (Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245 Cal.App.2d
866, 868.)  “A court lacks jurisdiction over a party if there has not been
proper service of process.”  (Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 801, 808.) 
 
III.          
DISCUSSION
 
Defendants
move to quash service of summons, arguing that Plaintiff did not properly serve
them as the complaint was taped to their front door.
Here, no proof of service on the summons or
Complaint has been filed. Thus, there is no assertion by Plaintiff that service
has been properly effectuated. 
Therefore,
the motion challenging service of the summons and complaint is premature, as
Plaintiff has not yet effected service of the summons and complaint on
Defendant. 
 
IV.          
CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’
motion to quash is denied as premature.
Defendants are ordered to give notice.
