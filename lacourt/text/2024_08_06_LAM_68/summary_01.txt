And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition to confirm an arbitration award in the case of Sandra Cortez vs. TRT Holdings, Inc., et al. The arbitration award was issued on March 4, 2024, and the petition to confirm was filed on May 6, 2024. The plaintiff filed a conditional non-opposition to the petition, but the judge has granted the petition and confirmed the arbitration award. The judge has also taken judicial notice of the filing of the pleadings and the April 9, 2021, denied writ of mandate order. The court has declined to exclude or strike the petition on grounds of untimeliness and has also declined to consider the plaintiff's proactive request for relief. The judge has noted that the plaintiff's challenge to the propriety of the award itself is preserved for appeal.
