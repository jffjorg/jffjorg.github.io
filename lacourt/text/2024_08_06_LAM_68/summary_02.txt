And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the motion to compel the deposition of attorney Mainak D'Attaray, who is the general counsel for the defendant, Empire Container Freight Station, Inc. The plaintiff, Gavrielli Brands, LLC, sought to depose D'Attaray to determine potential insurance coverage and to gather information on assets for potential collection on sanctions awards. The court found that the motion lacked a sufficient showing of support compelling the deposition, and that the information sought may be considered privileged. The court also noted that other remedies exist for collecting on sanctions and non-responses to discovery, and that the privilege has not been waived by the defendant. The unopposed motion is therefore denied.
