RULING: Granted.
Defendant, Thrive Market Technologies, Inc. moves to compel further
responses to request for production of documents, numbers 26-29, 44, and
Special Interrogatories, number 3, from Plaintiff Miriel Paschel. Defendant
maintains the objections are too general, and the requests seek information
directly addressing the claims raised in the operative complaint and defenses.
Plaintiff in a three (3) court day, five calendar late opposition reiterates
the objections and contends the interrogatories are overbroad, harassing, seek
irrelevant information, invade personal privacy, and seeks privileged
information. The late filed opposition lacks a responsive separate statement. Defendant
in reply challenges the late filed opposition; the new arguments on now waived
objections; and, contends the opposition lacks substantive address of the
arguments compelling further responses. 
 
The court lists all identified items:
 
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 26: Any and all DOCUMENTS
evidencing moneys YOU have received from the government since YOUR separation,
including but not limited to unemployment or SDI benefits.
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 27: Any and all DOCUMENTS
REFLECTING any COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and the State of California
Employment Development Department (EDD) from August 2, 2019 to the present.
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 28: Any and all DOCUMENTS YOU
received from the State of California Employment Development Department (EDD)
from August 2, 2019 to the present.
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 29: Any and all DOCUMENTS YOU
sent to the State of California Employment Development Department (EDD) from
August 2, 2019 to the present.
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 44: Any AND all DOCUMENTS
RELATING TO PLAINTIFF’S contention in Paragraph 73 of the Complaint, "On
approximately July 18, 2022, faced with a lack of income due to the expiration
of his disability insurance benefits in January, compounded by the Defendants'
failure to reinstate him, the Plaintiff decided to apply for unemployment
benefits to attenuate his financial hardships.
 
Plaintiff objected to all disputed requests for production
as follows: 
Objection. Overbroad, burdensome and harassing. This request
and the underlying requests also seek documents that may be protected from
disclosure by the attorney client privilege and/or work product doctrine.
Plaintiff further objects to each and every request to the extent that the
information it seeks, or any information in addition to that provided in this
response, is equally available to the propounding party. This request also
seeks documents and other information that is protected from disclosure pursuant
to California Evidence Code §1040, California Unemployment Insurance Code
§2111, improper use of which or attempt to access is a misdemeanor, and is
expressly inadmissible for any purpose in this case, all pursuant to California
Unemployment Insurance Code §1094. See, also, Crest Catering Co. v. Superior
Court (1965) 62 Cal.2d 274, 277 [sections 1094 and 2111 of the Unemployment
Insurance Code “manifest a clear legislative purpose to preserve the
confidentiality of information submitted to the Department of Employment 
 
The court only considers the actual
objections presented in the responses. The new arguments in the late
opposition, including privacy and relevance are not properly raised as either a
lodged objection or within a timely opposition. (Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th
263, 274.) Even if the court considered the improperly raised new argument, the
conclusive nature of the argument precludes specific consideration of the
applicability. On the remaining objections, as addressed further below, the
court finds invalid objections and orders a privilege log as to the requests
for production.
 
The challenged equally available objection lacks support as
well in that the court cannot determine whether Plaintiff concedes to knowledge
required for a response or lacks the subject information, and therefore
declines to reply. (Bunnell v. Sup.Ct.
(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 720, 723–724.) Given certain
subparts to the responses admit to a lack of knowledge on corporate procedures,
it appears Plaintiff concedes to a lack of ability to completely answer. The
court therefore finds the objection lacks support. If Plaintiff asserts
a lack of knowledge Plaintiff may appropriately state
said inability instead of interjecting further obstreperous objections. (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220, subd. (c).) 
 
The attorney-client privilege attaches to a confidential
communication between the attorney and the client and bars discovery of the
communication irrespective of whether it includes unprivileged material.” (Costco Wholesale
Corp. v. Superior Court (2009) 47 Cal.4th 725, 734.) The transmission
of information between third parties and counsel also maintain attorney client
privilege protection, if the communication is in further interest of the
client. (Evid. Code, § 952.) “Once that party establishes facts necessary to
support a prima facie claim of privilege, the communication is presumed to have
been made in confidence and the opponent of the claim of privilege has the
burden of proof to establish the communication was not confidential or that the
privilege does not for other reasons apply.” (Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 733.) 
 
The work product privilege applies where the sought after
documents contains Defendant’s “impressions, conclusions, opinions or legal
research or theories,” the information is protected by the work product
doctrine. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2018.030(c).) “An
objecting party may be entitled to protection if it can make a preliminary or
foundational showing that answering the interrogatory would reveal the
attorney's tactics, impressions, or evaluation of the case, or would result in
opposing counsel taking undue advantage of the attorney's industry or
efforts”].) (Coito v.
Superior Court (2012) 54 Cal.4th
480, 502.) Notes, statements, and impressions of the case are protected
by the work product doctrine. A list of potential witnesses is not work
product. (Id. at p. 495; Nacht & Lewis Architects, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 214, 217–218.)
 
The court cannot determine the basis of the subject
privilege objections. It remains unclear whether any and all communications
with the various government agencies were in fact only conducted in
anticipation of litigation and/or under the guidance of counsel. To the extent
Plaintiff maintains the objection, Plaintiff is ordered to produce a privilege
log of each and every withheld item. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240, subd. (c).)
The claims of privilege under Evidence Code section 1040, et seq. shall also be
included in the privilege log.
 
 
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 3: IDENTIFY and DESCRIBE IN DETAIL
all COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and the California Employment Development
Department (EDD) from April 5, 2022 through the present.
 
Plaintiff objected to Special Interrogatory No. 3 as
follows: 
Objection. This interrogatory seeks information that is
overbroad, oppressive, and harassing. This interrogatory impermissibly seeks
premature disclosure of expert witness testimony and work product, in violation
and circumvention of Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.210, et seq. The
following responses are given without prejudice to Plaintiff’s right to produce
evidence of any subsequently discovered fact or facts that this responding
party may later recall. Plaintiff according reserves the right to change any
and all answers, herein, as additional facts are ascertained. This entire set
of interrogatories contains an improper and unauthorized preface or
instruction, which has not been approved under Chapter 17 (commencing with
Section 2033.710), in violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.060(d).
Further, this improper and unauthorized preface or instruction purports to
impose obligations upon the responding party beyond those required by the Code
of Civil Procedure or any other authority. This interrogatory is not full and
complete in and of itself, as a preface and/or instruction, which has not been
approved under Chapter 17 (commencing with Section 2033.710) is included. Vague
and ambiguous as to “IDENTIFY”, “DESCRIBE IN DETAIL”, and “YOU.” This request
also seeks documents and other information that is protected from disclosure
pursuant to California Evidence Code §1040, California Unemployment Insurance
Code §2111, improper use of which or attempt to access is a misdemeanor, and is
expressly inadmissible for any purpose in this case, all pursuant to California
Unemployment Insurance Code §1094. See, also, Crest Catering Co. v. Superior
Court (1965) 62 Cal.2d 274, 277 [sections 1094 and 2111 of the Unemployment
Insurance Code “manifest a clear legislative purpose to preserve the
confidentiality of information submitted to the Department of Employment
 
The court only considers the actual
objections presented in the responses. The new arguments including privacy and
relevance are not properly raised in opposition. (Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, supra, 59 Cal.App.4th
at p. 274.)
 
The form of question objections lack merit. Defendant may
not intentionally misconstrue a work for obstreperous purposes. “Indeed, where the question is somewhat
ambiguous, but the nature of the information sought is apparent, the proper
solution is to provide an appropriate response.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783 superseded by
statute on unrelated ground as stated in Guzman
v. General Motors Corp. (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 438, 444.) 
 
On the oppressive, and harassing objections, objecting
parties must file evidence detailing the amount of work involved, in order to
support objections based upon burden and oppression. (West Pico Furniture
Co. v. Sup. Ct. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) “[S]ome burden is
inherent in all demands for discovery. The objection of burden is valid only
when that burden is demonstrated to result in injustice.” (Id. at p. 418.) The opposition and
objections lack any support. 
 
The
overbroad objection lacks support. (Obregon v. Superior Court (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 424, 431; Calcor Space
Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 224–225.) The
interrogatory directly and categorically references claims within the complaint
and put at issue by Plaintiff.
 
The premature expert testimony
objection finds no support. Plaintiff may not completely disregard any
response on claims put at issue. Plaintiff must provide information as to the
foundation of the claim and distinguish information actually within the realm
of experts. (See Bloxham v. Saldinger (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 729, 751-752.) 
 
Any privilege objections to the subject
item may be addressed in the privilege log. The court finds insufficient
argument in the motion otherwise compelling a response if the material is
privileged.
 
The information sought is relevant. But
‘[f]or discovery purposes, information is relevant if it “might reasonably
assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating
settlement….” [Citation.] Admissibility is not
the test and information, unless privileged, is discoverable if it might
reasonably lead to admissible evidence. [Citation.] These rules are applied
liberally in favor of discovery [citation], and (contrary to popular belief),
fishing expeditions are permissible in some cases. [Citation.]’ (Citations.)” (Cruz
v. Superior Court (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 646, 653–654.) Plaintiff may
not selectively withhold information on issues presented in the complaint. 
 
“Privacy interests generally fall into one of two
categories: (1) an interest in making intimate personal decisions or conducting
personal activities without observation, intrusion, or interference (‘autonomy
privacy’); and (2) an interest in precluding the dissemination or misuse of
sensitive and confidential information (‘informational privacy’).” (Ortiz v. Los Angeles Police Relief Assn.
(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1288, 1301.) “[I]ndividuals have a legally recognized
privacy interest in their personal financial information.” (International Federation
of Professional & Technical Engineers, Local 21, AFL-CIO v. Sup. Ct.
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 319, 330.) The objecting party has the burden to file
evidence of the preliminary facts establishing a privilege exists. (Williams v.
Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531,
557; HLC
Properties, Limited v. Sup. Ct. (2005) 35
Cal.4th 54, 59.) Again, t even if considered, the court finds no basis of
support, given Plaintiff placed the subject matter at issue in bringing this
action, including a claim for damages caused by the impacts of Defendants’
alleged conduct.
 
The motion is granted in its
entirety. Plaintiff to serve additional responses without objection, including
a privilege log within 20 days of this order. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.220,
2030.300, subd. (a), 2031.240, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (a).)
 
Defendant makes no request sanctions. Normally, any motion
compelling further responses to document production warrants a minimum $1,000
recovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.050, subd. (a)(1).)
Because Defendant made no request for sanctions, the court need not consider
this. 
 
The court does not conduct
independent discovery conferences. The court invites the parties to consider a
discovery referee if further guidance remains required over concerns requiring
review of privacy protected information. Future motions to compel may lead to
significant sanctions and referral to a referee.
