PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
On

(“Trainotti”) filed this action against Defendants The Hertz Corporation
(“Hertz”), John Doe Renter, Darva Rycewicz (“Rycewicz”), and Does 1-100 for
motor vehicle tort.  On January 23, 2024,
Plaintiffs amended the complaint to include Defendant Harlea Moreno in place of
John Doe Renter. 
On
July 25, 2022, Hertz filed an answer and a cross-complaint against
Cross-Defendants Trainotti and Roes 1-25 for indemnification, apportionment of
fault, and declaratory relief. 
Also
on July 25, 2022, Hertz filed a Notice of Permanent Injunction Pursuant to
Bankruptcy Court Confirmation Order and Demand for Dismissal. The notice stated
that Hertz had filed bankruptcy under Chapter 11, Case No. 20-11218 (MFW), in
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District
of Delaware. According to the notice, “all entities that have held, hold or may
hold claims or interests against [Hertz] . . . are permanently enjoined from
and after the effective date of June 30, 2021, from commencing or continuing in
any manner any action or other proceeding of any kind on account or in
connection with or with respect to any such claims or interest.” 
On
August 7, 2023, the Court stayed the entire action. 
On
October 30, 2023, Hertz filed a motion (1) for an order directing the Center
for Integrated Care (“Center”) to comply with a
subpoena for production of records, (2) for an order compelling Trainotti
to execute an authorization allowing the Center to release Trainotti’s medical
records, and (3) for sanctions. The motion was set to be heard on February 8,
2024. On January 26, 2024, Trainotti filed an opposition and request for
sanctions. On February 1, 2024, Hertz filed a reply. The Court continued the
hearing to May 1, 2024. 
On
May 1, 2024, the Court modified its August 7, 2023 stay order and limited the
stay to the claims specified in Hertz’s July 25, 2022 notice.  The Court continued the hearing on Hertz’s
October 30, 2023 motion to June 25, 2024 and granted the parties leave to file
supplemental briefing. 
On
June 5, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a partial opposition to Hertz’s motion. 
No
trial is currently scheduled. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Hertz
asks the Court (1) to order the Center to comply with Hertz’s subpoena for
records, (2) to order Trainotti to provide a signed authorization for the
Center to produce the requested records, and (3) to impose sanctions on
Trainotti. 
Trainotti
does not oppose Hertz’s request for an order
permitting the Center to comply with Hertz’s deposition subpoena but opposes
Hertz’s request to compel Trainotti to sign an authorization.  Trainotti opposes Hertz’s request for
sanctions and asks the Court to impose sanctions on Hertz.

(Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1.)              
DISCUSSION 
          In his June 5, 2024 supplemental brief, Trainotti states
that he does not oppose Hertz’s request for an order permitting the Center to
comply with Hertz’s deposition subpoena for business records served on August
21, 2023.  Trainotti does not
contend that the subpoena violates his privacy rights. 
The Court grants Hertz’s motion and orders the Center to comply with Hertz’s
subpoena for production of records.  This
ruling renders moot Hertz’s alternative request for an order compelling
Trainotti to sign an authorization for the Center to produce the records. 
          The Court denies both parties’ requests for sanctions. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant The Hertz Corporation’s motion to compel the Center for
Integrated Care to comply with the subpoena for production of records served on
August 21, 2023.  The Court orders the
Center for Integrated Care to comply with the subpoena for production of
records within 30 days of the Court’s ruling. 
The
Court DENIES as moot Defendant The Hertz Corporation’s motion to compel
Plaintiff Brendan Trainotti to execute an
authorization allowing the Center for Integrated Care to release Plaintiff
Brendan Trainotti’s medical records. 
The
Court DENIES Defendant The Hertz Corporation’s request for sanctions. 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Brendan Trainotti’s request for sanctions. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
