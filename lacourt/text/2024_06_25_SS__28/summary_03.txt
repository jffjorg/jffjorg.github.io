And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. Larrabure Framing, Inc. moves to compel arbitration of the dispute between Larrabure Framing, Inc. and MWL Solutions, Inc. regarding their respective rights and duties. Larrabure Framing, Inc. asserts that a May 5, 2019 subcontract between Larrabure Framing, Inc. and MWL Solutions, Inc. obligated MWL Solutions, Inc. to provide labor, add Larrabure Framing, Inc. as an additional insured under its insurance policy, and indemnify Larrabure Framing, Inc. from claims arising out of or in connection with its operations. The subcontract's dispute resolution provision requires the parties to submit any disputes to arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Larrabure Framing, Inc. contends that MWL Solutions, Inc. has refused to submit the dispute to arbitration, instead filing a cross-complaint against Larrabure Framing, Inc. on August 3, 2023. The court grants the motion and orders Larrabure Framing, Inc. and MWL Solutions, Inc. to arbitrate their dispute. The court stays proceedings on the cross-complaints pending the outcome of arbitration.
