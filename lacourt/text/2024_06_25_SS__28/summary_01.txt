And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion filed by defendant Erika Lisbeth Lopez to compel plaintiff Esmeralda Gomez's examination by a hand/wrist specialist. Lopez argues that the examination is directly relevant to the plaintiffs' claims and that Gomez has already submitted to three physical examinations, including one with an orthopedic surgeon. However, the judge finds that Lopez has not established good cause for an additional physical examination. The judge notes that Lopez's counsel's supplemental declaration does not address whether the condition of Gomez's hands and wrists have materially changed since Gomez's examination by a defense orthopedic surgeon. Therefore, the judge denies the motion.
