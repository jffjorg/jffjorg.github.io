And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint filed by Defendant Alpha Beta Company dba Food 4 Less against Cross-Defendants Carmenita and Roes 1-10. The motion is granted, and Alpha Beta Company dba Food 4 Less is ordered to file its cross-complaint within 30 days of the hearing on this motion.

The complaint alleges that Plaintiff Juan Jimenez tripped and sustained injuries on a broken brick on the main brick paved sidewalk at the storefront of a Food 4 Less store. The complaint alleges that the defendants knew about or should have known about the broken brick and failed to warn about or correct the dangerous condition.

Alpha Beta Company dba Food 4 Less seeks to file a cross-complaint alleging that Carmenita breached the lease by failing to maintain the common areas of the shopping plaza, failing to maintain commercial general liability insurance on Alpha Beta's behalf, and failing to accept Alpha Beta's tender of defense and/or indemnity.

The court has found no evidence that Alpha Beta Company dba Food 4 Less has acted in bad faith in seeking to file the cross-complaint, and therefore grants the motion.
