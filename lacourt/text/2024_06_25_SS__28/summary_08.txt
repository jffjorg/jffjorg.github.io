And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a case filed by Plaintiff Jason Reedy against Defendants Kevin De Leon, City of Los Angeles, and Does 1-10 for negligence-premises liability and battery. The City's demurrer was sustained with 20 days leave to amend and was dismissed without prejudice. De Leon's demurrer was also sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint, but the Court has no evidence that it was filed. De Leon filed a demurrer to the first amended complaint, and the Plaintiff filed oppositions to the demurrer. However, the Plaintiff's counsel failed to serve the opposition on De Leon's counsel. The Judge orders the Plaintiff's counsel to submit a supplemental declaration stating whether the Plaintiff timely filed the first amended complaint and to attach a file-stamped copy to the declaration. De Leon may file a responsive supplemental declaration. The Judge will provide a continued hearing date and filing deadlines for the supplemental declarations at the June 25, 2024 hearing.
