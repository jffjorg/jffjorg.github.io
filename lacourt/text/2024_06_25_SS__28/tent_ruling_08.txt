 Case Number:  23STCV26754    Hearing Date:   June 25, 2024    Dept:  28 On November  1, 2023, Plaintiff Jason Reedy (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants  Kevin De Leon (“De Leon”), City of Los Angeles (“City”), and Does 1-10 for  negligence—premises liability and battery.  On February  28, 2024, the Court sustained the City’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint with  20 days leave to amend and dismissed the City without prejudice.  On April  23, 2024, the Court sustained De Leon’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint with 20  days leave to amend. The Court ordered: “If  the complaint is not amended within 20 days, the complaint against Kevin de  Leon is DISMISSED.”  On  April 24, 2024, Plaintiff electronically served a first amended complaint.  (See  Declaration of Lana Rayan in Support of Defendant Kevin De Leon’s Demurrer to  Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint and Motion to Dismiss Defendant Kevin De  Leon Pursuant to C.C.P §581(f)(1), dated May 29, 2024 (“Rayan dec.”) ¶ 6); Rayan Dec. exh. 2 [copy of Plaintiff’s first amended complaint served on De  Leon].)  However,  Plaintiff’s first amended complaint is not contained in the Court’s file.  The Court has no evidence that  Plaintiff filed the first amended complaint.  On  May 29, 2024, De Leon filed a demurrer to Plaintiff’s first amended complaint,  to be heard on June 25, 2024.  On June 17  and 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed oppositions to the demurrer.  On June 21, 2024, De Leon filed a notice  stating that Plaintiff had not served an opposition to the demurrer on De Leon.  The  Court continues the hearing on De Leon’s demurrer and orders Plaintiff’s  counsel to submit a supplemental declaration stating whether Plaintiff timely filed a first  amended complaint.  If Plaintiff timely filed  a first amended complaint, Plaintiff’s counsel is to attach a file-stamped copy  to his supplemental declaration.  De Leon may file a  responsive supplemental declaration. The Court also orders Plaintiff's counsel to state in his supplemental declaration if and when he served Plaintiff's opposition to De Leon's demurrer to the first amended complaint on De Leon's counsel.  If Plaintiff's counsel served Plaintiff's opposition on De Leon's counsel, Plaintiff's counsel is to attach a copy of the email or emails transmitting the opposition to De Leon's counsel to his supplemental declaration.  De Leon may file a responsive supplemental declaration. The  Court will provide a continued hearing date and filing deadlines for the  supplemental declarations at the June 25, 2024 hearing.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
