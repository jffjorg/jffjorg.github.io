 Case Number:  23STCV15116    Hearing Date:   June 25, 2024    Dept:  28 RULING DIFFERENT FROM ORIGINAL TENTATIVE; THIS IS RULING AFTER ARGUMENT:Having  considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On  June 28, 2023, Plaintiff Edwin Elias Lopez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action  against Defendants Isaac Rey Medina (“Medina”), Maribel Islas (“Islas”), and  Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort, general negligence, and negligent entrustment  of motor vehicle.  On  July 26, 2023, Medina filed an answer.  On  April 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against Medina, Islas,  and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort,  general negligence, and negligent entrustment of motor vehicle.  On  April 22, 2024, Islas filed an answer. On May 17, 2024, Medina filed an answer.  On  May 17, 2024, Medina filed a motion to stay the civil action pending the resolution  of criminal proceedings, to be heard on June 25, 2024.  On  May 24, 2024, Lopez filed a stipulation to stay discovery.  Trial  is currently set for December 26, 2024.   PARTY’S REQUEST  Medina  asks the Court to stay the action pending the outcome of Medina’s criminal  case.  LEGAL STANDARD  “ ‘The  Constitution does not ordinarily require a stay of civil proceedings pending  the outcome of criminal proceedings. [Citations.]  “In the absence of substantial prejudice to  the rights of the parties involved, [simultaneous] parallel [civil and  criminal] proceedings are unobjectionable under our jurisprudence.” [Citation.]  “Nevertheless, a court may decide in its discretion to stay civil proceedings  ... ‘when the interests of justice seem[ ] to require such action.’ ”  [Citation.]’ ”  (Alpha Media Resort Investment  Cases (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 1121, 1131-1132 (Alpha Media), quoting Keating v. Office of Thrift  Supervision (9th Cir.1995) 45 F.3d 322, 324 (Keating).)  “[T]he decision whether to stay civil  proceedings pending the outcome of a parallel criminal case should be made in  light of the particular circumstances and interests at hand . . . .”  (Alpha Media, supra, 39  Cal.App.5th at p. 1132.) “ ‘[T]he decisionmaker should  consider “the extent to which the defendant’s fifth amendment rights are implicated.”  [Citation.] In addition, the decisionmaker should generally consider the  following factors: (1) the interest of the plaintiffs in proceeding  expeditiously with this litigation or any particular aspect of it, and the  potential prejudice to plaintiffs of a delay; (2) the burden which any  particular aspect of the proceedings may impose on defendants; (3) the  convenience of the court in the management of its cases, and the efficient use  of judicial resources; (4) the interests of persons not parties to the civil  litigation; and (5) the interest of the public in the pending civil and  criminal litigation.’ ” (Ibid., quoting Keating, supra, 45  F.3d at pp. 324-325.)  DISCUSSION  Medina asserts that he is facing criminal charges based  on the same facts alleged in Plaintiff’s complaint.  These facts involve Medina’s alleged driving under  the influence, resulting in an accident that injured Plaintiff on February 19,  2023.  Medina asks the Court to protect  his Fifth Amendment rights by staying the  civil case until the limitations period for bringing criminal charges expires. Medina's motion did not include a declaration or other  evidence supporting his contentions about the existence and  nature of the pending criminal case.   (See L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure  Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 9:43, p. 9(l)-26 [aside from demurrers, motions to  strike, and motions for judgment on the pleadings, “[m]ost other motions . . .  are decided on the basis of declarations, discovery documents, or other  evidence presented to the court in support of the motion”].) At the June 24, 2024 hearing, Medina's counsel called the Court's attention to the parties' stipulation, filed after Medina's motion, to stay the civil case pending resolution of the criminal case and to set a hearing on August 8, 2024 to reevaluate the stay. The Court had previously declined to sign the proposed order attached to the stipulation because the order was inadequate.  The parties did not submit a revised order for the Court's approval. The Court finds that the stipulation supports the stay request.  Based on the parties' May 24, 2024 stipulation, the Court grants the stay request and stays this civil case pending either resolution of the criminal case against Medina (The People of the State of California vs. Isaac Rey Medina, Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 24CJCF00701-01) or this Court's further order.  The Court also sets a hearing on August 8, 2024 to reevaluate the stay. CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS Defendant  Isaac Rey Medina’s motion and stays this civil action pending either resolution of the criminal case against Medina (The People of the State of California vs. Isaac Rey Medina, Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 24CJCF00701-01) or this Court's further order. The Court sets a hearing on August 8, 2024 at 1:30 p.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse to reevaluate the stay.  The parties may file briefs no later than 10 days before the hearing addressing the status of the criminal case and whether the Court should terminate or continue the stay.            Moving party is ordered to give notice  of this ruling.  Moving party is ordered to file the proof of  service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
