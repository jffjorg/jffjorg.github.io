Request for Entry of
Default Judgment
The
court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Plaintiff’s request for entry of default
judgment.
 
            This is an action for defamation.  On July 11, 2023, Plaintiff Sehee Roh filed
his Complaint against Defendants Sunday Media, Inc. dba Sunday News USA, Sang
Tae Choi aka Steven Choi, James Yoo, Jae Kwon Kim, and Does 1 through 20,
inclusive.  The relief prayed for in
Complaint provides:
1. For general damages according to proof,
but no less than $26,000.00; 
2. For special damages according to proof;

3. For damages for emotional distress as
in a sum according to proof; 
4. For punitive and/or exemplary damages
in a sum to be determine by the trier of fact; 
5. For Plaintiff’s costs of suit incurred
herein including, without limitation, their reasonable attorney’s fees; 
6. For such other and further relief as
the Court may deem just and proper.
 
On
December 26, 2023, default was entered as to Defendants Sunday Media, Inc., Jae
Kwon Kim, and James Yoo.  On January 8,
2024, default was entered as to Defendant San Tae Choi.  On May 3, 2024, dismissal was entered as to
Does 1 through 20. 
Plaintiff
request for entry of default judgment against Defendants Sunday Media, Inc.,
Sang Tar Choi, James Yoo, and Jae Kwon Kim in the amount of $28,928.91
representing $26,000.00 as demanded in the Complaint, $2,065.75 in interest,
and $863.15 in costs. 
Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is denied for the following reason.  Plaintiff’s interest calculation is at 10%,
but if Plaintiff seeks to recover damages based on his defamation cause of
action, the interest calculation must be at a rate of 7%.  (Contract
claims have a default judgment prejudgment interest rate of 10%, and all other
actions have a default interest rate of 7%. See Civ. Code § 3287 et seq. and
Cal. Const. Art. 15 § 1.) 
The
court therefore DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default judgment.
            It is so ordered.
