The Court has considered the motion of Defendant Colenso Evelyn to quash service of summons and dismiss the action. The Defendant claims that the Court lacks jurisdiction over him due to improper service of summons. However, the Court finds that the Defendant has made a general appearance by filing an answer to the Complaint, which constitutes a general appearance by a party. Therefore, service has been properly effectuated. As a result, the motion is DENIED as MOOT.
