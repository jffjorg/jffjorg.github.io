And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses a motion related to service and filing requirements in a case involving Wendy as the plaintiff and the defendant. The judge notes that the defendant does not dispute the satisfaction of the service and filing requirements, as outlined in CCP section 405.22. The main focus of the motion is the third prong, which is the most contested aspect of the case. The judge emphasizes that the 4th and 5th causes of action (COAs) are moot, as they are not causes of action but rather remedies. The defendant's reply did not address the cases, and the judge notes that defense counsel inadvertently omitted an exhibit list. The ruling concludes that the service and filing requirements are met, and the 4th and 5th COAs are moot.
