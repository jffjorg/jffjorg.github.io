  Case Number:  22PSCV00580    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Defendant BO SUN’s Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens is GRANTED,
notably for the reason by way of striking the quiet title COA, none of the
remaining COAs would affect title or right to possession of the Joint Venture
Properties; attorney fees are not imposed on either party. 
 
Background
 
This is a real property case involving properties located at
16485 Monte Cristo Drive, Hacienda Heights, CA 91745 (the “Monte Cristo
Property”), 1621 Derringer Lane, Diamond Bar, CA (the “Derringer Lane
Property”), and 14211 Skyline Drive, Hacienda Heights, CA (the “Skyline
Property”). Plaintiff Wendy Lin (“Lin” or “Plaintiff”) alleges the following
against Defendant Bo Sun and ALL PERSONS UNKNOWN, Claiming Any Legal or
Equitable Right, Title, Estate, Lien, or Interest in the Property Described in
this Complaint Adverse to Plaintiff’s title, or any Cloud upon Plaintiff’s
Title Thereto: Plaintiff and Defendant, who were in a relationship and have two
children, entered into a Joint Venture Agreement to invest in real estate.
Despite the agreement that Plaintiff, in exchange for providing certain funds
to purchase the Derringer and Skyline Properties), would be entitled to rights
to title and equity, Defendant did not do so. As for the Monte Cristo Property,
pursuant to a judgment in Case No. BC330493, Plaintiff transferred full title
to Defendant, but Defendant has not reimbursed Plaintiff for mortgage, taxes,
and other costs.  
 
On June 14, 2022, Plaintiff filed suit asserting the
following COAs: 
 
1.    
Breach of Fiduciary 
2.    
Conversion 
3.    
Fraud
4.    
Quiet Title
5.    
Common County—Money Lent 
 
On July 12, 2022, Plaintiff filed two Notice of Pendency of
Action (Lis Pendens); one on the Monte Cristo property and the other on the
Derringer Lane Property. 
 
On August 24, 2022, Defendant filed a Demurrer, which on
October 4, 2022 the court sustained with leave to amend. 
 
On January 12, 2023 Defendant filed its demurrer to the FAC,
which on 2/28/23 the court sustained with leave to amend as to the fraud and
quiet title causes of action, and overruled as to the others. 
 
On March 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed a second amended
complaint (SAC). 
 
On June 14, 2023, the parties filed a stipulation for leave
for Plaintiff to file a proposed third amended complaint (TAC). That same day,
Plaintiff filed a TAC, alleging the following COAs: 1.    
Breach of Fiduciary Duty 2.    
Quiet Title 3.    
Fraud and Concealment [the third COA is
categorized into two counts]. 4.    
Declaratory Relief 5.    
Injunctive Relief 6.    
Unjust Enrichment/Constructive Trust
 
On August 3, 2023, Defendant filed a demurrer and motion to
strike (MTS) to the TAC, which the court (on 9/20/23) sustained in its
entirety without leave to amend, meaning that the 2nd COA
(for Quiet Title) and 3rd COA (for fraud) for were
stricken from the pleading. According to the minute order, Defendant
was given until October 20, 2023 to file a responsive pleading.
 
On October 11, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to expunge lis
pendens. 
 
On October 24, 2023, Defendant filed his answer along with a
cross-complaint against Plaintiff Wendy[1]
for: 
 
1.     Declaratory
relief
2.     Quiet
title and
3.     Partition
 
On November 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant demurrer
to Defendant’s cross-complaint, which on 1/09/24, the court sustained with
leave to amend.
 
On December 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed her opposition to the
motion to expunge lis pendens.
 
On January 12, 2024, Defendant filed his reply. 
 
Note: Though not found in the docket, on
11/2/2023, the court received a courtesy copy Petition for Writ of Mandate/Stay
Requested that was filed with the Second Appellate District (dated to
10/31/23). The petition argues that the trial court erred in sustaining the
demurrer without leave to amend as to the fraud and quiet title COAs. 
 
Legal Standard
 
A¿lis¿pendens¿is a¿recorded instrument¿(“Notice of Pending
Action”), recorded in the office of the county recorder where land is located,
that gives¿constructive notice¿of a pending lawsuit affecting title to
described real property.  (Gale v. Superior Court¿(2004) 122
Cal.App.4th 1388, 1395.)  
 
“A party to an action who asserts a¿real property claim¿may
record a notice of pendency of action in which that real property claim is
alleged.”  (CCP § 405.20.)  Anyone having an interest in the property
affected by a lis pendens, whether
or not a party to the pending lawsuit, may
move to expunge the lis pendens any time after it is recorded.  (CCP §
405.30.)  A lis pendens may be expunged on any of the following
grounds: 
 
(1) defects
in the statutory service and filing requirements;[2] 
(2) the
complaint does not contain a real property claim;[3] 
(3) the
claimant cannot prove the probable validity of the real property claim by a
preponderance of the evidence; or 
(4)
“adequate relief” can be “secured to the claimant by the giving of an
undertaking.”  (CCP §§ 405.23, 405.31, 405.32, 405.33; McKnight v.
Sup.Ct. (Faber)¿(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 291, 303 [recognizing defective
servicing and filing requirements as grounds for expungement].)  
 
“‘Probable validity,’ with respect to a real property
claim, means that it is more likely than not that the claimant will obtain a
judgment against the defendant on the claim.”  (CCP § 405.32.) The motion may be made even
while an appeal is pending. (Peery v. Superior Court (1981) 29 Cal.3d
837, 842.)  
 
Discussion
 
The
issue before the court is whether Plaintiff’s remaining COAs for declaratory
relief, injunctive relief, and unjust enrichment/constructive trust—COAs that unlike
a quiet title COA do not patently affect real property—are sufficient to
maintain a lis pendens? For reasons to be discussed below, as the
remaining COAs are predicated upon the quiet title COA which was
stricken, the motion is granted. 
 
A real property claim is defined as the “cause or causes of
action in a pleading which would, if meritorious, affect (a) title to,
or the right to possession of, specific real property....If the
pleading filed by the claimant does not properly plead a real property claim,
the lis pendens must be expunged upon motion under CCP 405.31.” (Kirkeby v.
Superior Court (2004) 33 Cal.4th 642, emphasis and underline added.) Quiet
title actions, by definition (CCP 760.020), are a type of COA that affect to
or right to possession of specific real property. 
 
The court in its 9/20/23 ruling struck the quiet title COA
because Plaintiff failed to state sufficient facts that she had rights to
possession of the properties or any title to the properties; by way, only
Defendant was deemed to hold title to the Joint Venture Properties. This ruling—that
there is no viable quiet title COA—inherently rendered the other COAs
moot because they are predicated upon a purported dispute in title,
but one that the court found does not exist. 
 
By way of illustration, turning to the TAC, the 4th
COA for declaratory relief seeks a judicial declaration concerning the Plaintiff’s
equity interest in the Derringer Lane Property (P75); The 5th
COA for injunctive relief seeks to enjoin Defendant from making any further
claims including, but not limited to, continuing to assert superior rights
to possession or initiating any sale of Joint Venture Property (p.
11); The 6th COA for constructive trust seeks imposition of a
constructive trust in favor of Plaintiff against Defendant’s property interest
in the Joint Venture Properties. But by way of the court’s ruling on the
demurrer, no dispute exists as to who holds title to the properties. Thus,
absent an “actual controversy” as to title affecting real property, the other
COAs are moot. (Reply p. 2, citing to RGC Gaslamp, LLC v. Ehmcke
Sheet Metal Co. (2020) 56 Cal.App5th 413, 433 [quiet title COA moot because
there was no longer an ‘active controversy’ for declaratory relief; and
injunctive relief was unnecessary].)[4] 
 
To the extent that Plaintiff predominantly relies upon Kirkeby
v. Superior Court (2004) 33 Cal.4th 642 and Shoker v. Superior Court of
Alameda County (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 271, the cases are not instructive.[5] Neither
involved cases wherein a court already ruled on a motion that disposed of a
cause of action nor did either involve a quiet title COA. 
 
In short, even though other COAs remain, those COAs
would at most merely allow for a money judgment.[6]
 
Attorney Fees
 
A prevailing party on a motion to expunge a lis pendens is entitled to
recover “reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of making or opposing the motion
unless the court finds that the other party acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of attorney's
fees and costs unjust.” (CCP § 405.38.) For purposes of attorneys’ fees and
costs, a court’s ruling on a motion made pursuant to CCP Sections 405.31 and
405.32 necessarily decides who is the “prevailing party” since such motions
place in issue whether the lis pendens was proper. The award of attorney’s fees is only
against the losing party, not the losing party’s counsel. (Doyle v. Sup.Ct.
(Jacinth Develop., Inc.) (1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1355, 1359.) 
 
Here, the court declines to impose monetary sanctions because
of insufficient meet and confer efforts and a determination that Plaintiff
acted with substantial justification. 
 
First, there is an inconsistent explanation of meet and
confer efforts. In its motion, Defendant states that “Plaintiff never responded
to Defendant’s meet and confer efforts.” (Motion p. 4:6-7.) However, Defense
Counsel’s then proceeds to state in his declaration that Plaintiff responded to
the 9/29/23 email on 10/6/23 by “planning on fil[ing] another lawsuit.” (Motion
p. 7.)[7] To
the contrary, Plaintiff’s counsel provides a 10/11 email response regarding the
lis pendens motion; an email that is largely identical to the instant
opposition. 
 
Second, Plaintiff’s opposition was detailed and thorough.
Thus, even if unmeritorious, Plaintiff attempted to craft a legal argument to
support her position. 
 
Therefore, as the parties did not engage in adequate meet
and confer efforts and as Plaintiff made a good faith attempt in opposition,
the court DENIES attorney fees under the statutory exceptions. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is GRANTED but attorney
fees are denied (as to both parties).
