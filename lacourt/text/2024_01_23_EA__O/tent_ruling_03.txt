 Case Number:  23PSCV02684    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s
Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice. 
 
Background
 
This case arises from a breach of a lease agreement. 
 
On August 31, 2023, Plaintiff Best Western Summit, Inc.
filed suit against Defendants CPI Security Corp. and Joseph Carmona.[1] 
 
On November 1, 2023, default was entered against both
Defendants. 
 
On November 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant
application.  
Legal Standard
California Code of Civil
Procedure section 585 (“CCP”) permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served. A party seeking judgment
on the default by the Court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought; (7) a dismissal
of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for
separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if
allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1800.)
 
 
Discussion
 
At the outset, it is unclear as to the judgment sought as
Plaintiff has filed two proposed orders (not on JUD-100 forms). (One
proposed order should be filed.) On both proposed orders, Plaintiff seeks to
recover from each Defendant the principal amount of $46,645.00, plus interest
in the sum of $4,413.24, court costs of $1,492.63, and attorney fees of
$9,595.50, for a total of $62,146.37.[2] 
 
1.     Individual
Defendant’s Liability 
 
First, it is unclear as to the individual Defendant’s
liability. Neither the complaint, summary of the case, nor lease provide that
Defendant Joseph Carmona is the guarantor of the lease. The only guarantor
referenced appears to be the landlord, not the tenant. (See Lease, Ex. A-6.) Therefore,
to the extent that Plaintiff seek to hold the individual defendant liable in
his capacity as an officer of the corporation, it has failed to plead alter
ego. (See Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th
523, 538-599 [background and framework for alter ego/piercing the corporate
veil].) 
 
2.    
Attorney Fees 
 
Second, though Plaintiff does not provide the provision in
the lease which allows for recovery of attorney fees, a review of the lease
provides that provision 40 allows for attorney fees. However, the prevailing
party is entitled to recovery of “reasonable” attorney fees. Absent an
explanation of attorney fees (i.e., Lodestar factors), the court finds attorney
fees of $9,595.50 unreasonable for a simple breach of contract case. 
 
3.    
Interest 
 
Third, Plaintiff has not provided a computation of interest.

 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing (four defects), the default judgment
application is denied without prejudice.
