And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The case arises from a breach of a lease agreement between the plaintiff, Best Western Summit, Inc., and the defendants, CPI Security Corp. and Joseph Carmona. The plaintiff filed suit on August 31, 2023, and default was entered against both defendants on November 1, 2023. The plaintiff then filed the instant application for default judgment on November 15, 2023.

The judge found several defects in the plaintiff's application, including unclear individual defendant liability, unreasonable attorney fees, and missing computation of interest. The judge also noted that the plaintiff failed to plead alter ego with respect to the individual defendant and did not provide a review of the lease provision allowing for recovery of attorney fees.

Based on these defects, the judge denied the application for default judgment without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to cure the defects and re-file the application.
