deemed a cross-defendant, for clarity purposes, the court will continue to
refer to Wendy as Plaintiff. 


[2] CCP section 405.22 provides three service and filing
requirements (mailing the notice, filing the lis pendens with the court, and
serving the lis pendens). Defendant does not dispute this prong was not

are met.

moot is further supported as both are not causes of actions, but remedies.
(See Reply p. 3.) 
 


[5] Defendant’s Reply does not address the cases. 
 


[6] See e.g., breach of fiduciary duty COA seeks $2
million in damages. 


[7] Defense Counsel seems to have inadvertently omitted
an exhibit list to provide any of the emails.
