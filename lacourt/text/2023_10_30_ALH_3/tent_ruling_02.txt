[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: DEFAULT PROVE-UP HEARING

On October 20, 2023, plaintiff Gisele
Rosen (“Plaintiff”) filed a request for court judgment on Form CIV-100
requesting a default judgment of $162,168.84 against defendants Paramount
Headquarters, Inc. and Paramount Headquarters, Inc. dba Paramount Pavers &
Construction, consisting of $100,000 in damages, $525 in costs, and $61,643.84
in prejudgment interest. A supplemental declaration from Plaintiff’s counsel
calculates prejudgment interest from July 1, 2017 to October 20, 2023, at a
rate of 10% per annum, to be $63,068.49, which is what is written on the
proposed judgment on Form JUD-100. Although the amount of prejudgment interest
listed on the two forms is not identical, the Court acknowledges that counsel’s
declaration includes an accurate calculation of prejudgment interest.
Accordingly, the application for default judgment is GRANTED. 
Dated
this 30th
day of October, 2023
