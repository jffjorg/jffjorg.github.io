And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Arroyo Pacific, Inc. and has granted the motion in its entirety. The court finds that the plaintiff, Jenny Zhang, has failed to state viable causes of action against Arroyo Pacific, Inc. Specifically, the court finds that the plaintiff's claims for breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, conspiracy, unfair competition, aiding and abetting, and accounting are all without merit.

The court notes that Arroyo Pacific, Inc. does not owe a fiduciary duty to the plaintiff, and therefore, the plaintiff lacks standing to assert causes of action against the company. The court also finds that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred and that the plaintiff has failed to plead a successful cause of action.

The court grants the plaintiff leave to only amend the 12th and 13th Causes of Action and orders any amended pleading to be filed within 10 days of the date of this order.
