TENTATIVE RULING
 
Motion
Plaintiff Denise Ramorino (“Plaintiff”) moves to for an order to
quash the deposition notices and stay the depositions of its non-retained experts
Simon Dardasht, and Angelica O’Boyle. Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions.
Defendants Manoug Tokatlian and Lena Tokatlian (“Defendants”) oppose and
Plaintiff replies. 
Background
The complaint was filed
on September 13, 2021. Trial was initially set for March 13, 2023.              
On February 27, 2023,
at the final status conference, after the case was not served, the trial date
was vacated.            
On October 16, 2023,
Defendants filed their answer.           

On November 2, 2023, at
the trial setting conference, trial was set for November 4, 2024. All
discovery/motion cut-offs attached to that trial date.            
On October 2, 2024, the
Court granted Defendants’ ex parte application and continued trial to
January 31, 2025. All discovery and pre-trial motion cut-offs remained attached
to the November 4, 2024, trial date. (Min. Order, 10/2/24.)
On November 5, 2024,
the Court granted in part Defendants’ motion to reopen discovery pertaining to
the four fact witnesses identified in Plaintiff’s September 17, 2024,
deposition and limited to the issue of Plaintiff’s damages claim. (Min. Order,
11/5/24.) 
Discussion
Based on the procedural history
above, apart from the limited order reopening discovery on November 5, 2024,
the expert discovery deadlines attach to the November 4, 2024 trial date. 
 
The instant motion seeks to quash
and stay the depositions of Plaintiff’s non-retained expert witnesses. Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.030, any party shall have the right to
complete discovery proceedings pertaining to expert witnesses on or before the
15th day before trial, and to have motions concerning said witnesses
heard on or before the 10th day before trial. Therefore, the deadline to file
this motion concerning the deposition of expert witnesses was October 25, 2024
(ten days before the November 4, 2024 trial date). 
 
“[A] party who notices a discovery motion to be
heard after the discovery motion cutoff date does not have a right to have the
motion heard. But the fact that a party does not have a right to have a
discovery motion heard after the discovery motion cutoff date does not mean the
court has no power to hear it, or that the court errs in hearing it. Indeed,
subdivision (a) of section 2024.050 specifically allows a discovery motion to
be heard after the discovery motion cutoff date by providing that ‘the court may
grant leave ... to have a motion concerning discovery heard, closer to the
initial trial date, or to reopen discovery after a new trial date has been
set.’ But that statute also specifies that such leave may be granted ‘[o]n
motion of any party.’ [Citation.] Moreover, such a motion must be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration, and in exercising its discretion to grant or
deny the motion the court must consider various factors. …” (Pelton-Shepherd
Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1568, 1586 (alterations in original).) In Pelton-Shepherd Industries,
the court held that the trial court’s discretion to hear a discovery motion was
limited by the court first hearing and granting a motion for leave to reopen
discovery. (Id. at 1588.)¿ 
 
Therefore, because this motion is being heard
after the expert discovery motion cut-off, and Plaintiff has not moved to
reopen discovery, nor has Plaintiff discussed section 2024.050 in this motion,
the motion is denied.
