Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to quash and stay the depositions of their non-retained expert witnesses, Simon Dardasht and Angelica O'Boyle. The plaintiff sought to quash the deposition notices and stay the depositions because the deadline to file the motion had passed. The judge found that the motion was filed after the expert discovery motion cut-off and that the plaintiff had not moved to reopen discovery or discussed section 2024.050 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which allows the court to grant leave to reopen discovery. The judge exercised their discretion to deny the motion, citing the case of Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. The judge noted that while the plaintiff does not have a right to have the motion heard, the court may still hear it, but only after considering various factors.
