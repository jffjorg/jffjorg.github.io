Introduction  Defendant Ednet Career Institute,  Inc. dba Hamilton Private Security (Defendant) moved to compel further  responses to Form Interrogatories, Set Three (FI) and requested $3,240.00 in  monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Sina Basiratmand (Plaintiff).  The FI Motion placed into issue FI no. 17.1,  related to RFA nos. 84, 86, 90, 94, 98, and 101 – 106.   Procedure  Plaintiff objected that  Defendant’s October 15, 2024 meet and confer effort was not made in good faith  because Defendant demanded a response within three days, October 18, 2024.  (See Delgado Decl. par. 15, Exh. K.)  However, Plaintiff’s reliance upon the  October 15, 2024 correspondence ignores Defendant’s efforts to meet and confer  on June 18, 2024 via correspondence (Delgado Decl. par. 9, Exh. E) and the  subsequent telephone call on August 21, 2024, which resulted in Plaintiff  serving supplemental responses to the FI on September 18, 2024 (Delgado Decl.  par. 14).  Reviewing the totality of  Defendant’s efforts in the meet and confer process, the Court finds Defendant’s  efforts to be in good faith.  Plaintiff’s  argument is unpersuasive. Discussion  As to FI 17.1 (b), (c) and  (d)/RFA 84, 86, 90, 94, 98, the parties are in dispute as to whether  Plaintiff’s responses are code compliant.   Defendant argued that the responses are not full and complete and merely  contentions.  Plaintiff argued that there  are no other facts, names/identifying information, or documents in Plaintiff’s  possession or personal knowledge.  “If  the responding party does not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond  fully to an interrogatory, that party shall so state, but shall make a  reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other  natural persons or organizations, except where the information is equally  available to the propounding party.”   (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 2030.220(c).)   Because Plaintiff argues that there is no further personal knowledge to  respond to FI 17.1, Plaintiff provide a statement in compliance with  Code of Civil Procedure, section  2030.220(c).  Despite Plaintiff’s  contention otherwise, the responses are not code compliant.   The motion to compel further  responses to FI 17.1/ RFA 84, 86, 90, 94, 98 is GRANTED.  As to FI 17.1(b)/RFA 101-106,  Plaintiff’s response shows that Plaintiff does not have personal knowledge to  respond to the question and yet provided facts that Plaintiff did possess.  Plaintiff further stated that a reasonable  inquiry was made.  The response is  sufficient to be a code compliant response.   Defendant failed to meet its burden on the motion as to these  interrogatories.  The motion to compel further  responses to FI 17.1(b)/RFA 101-106 is DENIED. As to FI 17.1 (c) and (d)/RFA  101-106, Plaintiff’s only response was “not applicable.”   “A party cannot state, ‘not applicable’  where the interrogatory is clearly applicable….” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84  Cal.App.3d 771, 783, superseded by statute on another ground as stated in  Guzman v. General Motors Corp. (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 438, 444.)  Plaintiff argued that the responses was  really an inability to admit or deny due to insufficient information.  However, Plaintiff’s argument is not  persuasive.  “Not applicable” does not  mean anything other than that which is stated and “not applicable” is not a  code compliant response.   The motion to compel further  responses to FI 17.1(c) and (d)/RFA 101-106 is GRANTED. As to Defendant’s requests for  monetary sanctions, the Court finds Defendant to be the prevailing party since  the motion is granted as to the majority of the issues presented.  Monetary sanctions are mandatory unless the  court finds substantial justification or circumstances making sanctions  unjust.  Defendant’s FI motion/arguments  are persuasive and Plaintiff’s justification for not serving code compliant  responses is not persuasive.  There is no  showing of substantial justification or circumstances making sanctions unjust  by Plaintiff.  Defendant is entitled to  monetary sanctions.  However, the amount  requested is excessive and unreasonable.   The Court reduces the sanctions amount requested against Plaintiff to  the reasonable amount of $2,200.00. Defendant’s request for sanctions  against Plaintiff is GRANTED at the reduced amount of $2,000.00. [TENTATIVE] ORDER: Defendant Ednet Career Institute,  Inc. dba Hamilton Private Security’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to  Request for Admissions, Set Three, is GRANTED.   Plaintiff Sina Basiratmand is ORDERED to serve supplemental responses  within 20 days.  Defendant Ednet Career  Institute, Inc. dba Hamilton Private Security’s request for monetary sanctions  against Plaintiff Sina Basiratmand is GRANTED but at the reduced amount of $2,000.00  pursuant to CCP section 2023.010, discovery abuse without substantial  justification.  Payment to the Client  Trust Account of ROPERS MAJESKI PC 801 South Figueroa St, Suite 2100 Los  Angeles, CA 90017 by 1/10/2025.Introduction Defendant Ednet Career Institute,  Inc. dba Hamilton Private Security (Defendant) moved to compel further  responses to Request for Admissions, Set Three (RFA) and requested $3,240.00 in  monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Sina Basiratmand (Plaintiff).  The RFA Motion placed into issue RFA nos. 101  – 106.Procedure Plaintiff objected that  Defendant’s meet and confer effort was not made in good faith.  The Court finds that Defendant’s meet and  confer efforts were made in good faith based upon Defendant’s showing that  correspondence was sent on June 19, 2024 asserting the deficiencies in the RFA  responses (Delgado Decl. par. 9, Exh. E) and thereafter a telephone discussion  occurred on August 21, 2024.  (Delgado  Decl. par. 14.)  These facts are  sufficient to show a good faith effort despite Plaintiff’s focus on Defendant’s  October 15, 2024 meet and confer effort.   The motion is also timely filed  per the 45-day rule because Plaintiff granted “an open extension” to file the  instant motion.  (Delgado Decl. par. 11,  Exh. G.)  Discussion At issue are Plaintiff’s  responses served on June 17, 2024. (Delgado Decl. par. 8, Exh. C.)  The responses relevant to the instant motion  as to RFA nos. 101-106 is the statement, “Responding Party answers as follows:  unable to admit or deny.”  The Discovery Act expressly provides that an  inability to admit or deny is a proper response and the response is partially  compliant.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec.  2033.220(c).)  However, the statute  further requires the responding party to state “that a reasonable concerning  the matter in the particular request has been made, and that the information  known or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable that party to admit the  matter.”  (Id.)  Plaintiff submitted on this argument and  asserted that the responses to RFAs 101-106 would be supplemented.  Plaintiff argued that  supplemental responses were not necessary because Defendant’s responses to  Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set Two, were similar to Plaintiff’s  responses at issue.  However,  deficiencies in Defendant’s responses are not at issue and irrelevant to  whether Plaintiff served proper responses to Defendant’s discovery  demands.  In that Plaintiff did not serve  supplemental responses with the instant Opposition and/or assert that  supplemental responses were already served, the motion is not yet moot.The motion to compel further  responses to RFAs is GRANTED.As to Defendant’s requests for  monetary sanctions, the Court finds Defendant to be the prevailing party.  Monetary sanctions are mandatory unless the  court finds substantial justification or circumstances making sanctions  unjust.  Defendant’s RFA motion/arguments  are persuasive and Plaintiff’s justification for not serving code compliant  responses is not persuasive.  There is no  showing of substantial justification or circumstances making sanctions unjust  by Plaintiff.  Defendant is entitled to  monetary sanctions.  However, the amount  requested is excessive and unreasonable.   The Court reduces the sanctions amount requested against Plaintiff to  the reasonable amount of $2,000.00.Defendant’s request for sanctions  against Plaintiff is GRANTED at the reduced amount of $2,000.00.IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE  NOTICE.
