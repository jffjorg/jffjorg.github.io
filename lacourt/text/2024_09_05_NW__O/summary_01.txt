* "California courts traditionally have maintained a strong preference for arbitration as a speedy and inexpensive method of dispute resolution."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration in the case between Drive LA (the plaintiff) and Samantha Frank (the defendant). The plaintiff alleged that the defendant damaged a Lamborghini Urus rented from the plaintiff and has not paid for the damages. The defendant sought to compel arbitration based on a contract between the parties that contains an arbitration agreement. The judge found that the defendant met its burden of showing the existence of a valid arbitration agreement and that the plaintiff's claims fall within the scope of the agreement. Since the plaintiff did not oppose the motion, the judge granted the motion and stayed the action pending arbitration.
