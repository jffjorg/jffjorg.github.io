     CASE NO.: 24VECV01749
 
ORDER GRANTING
  DEFENDANT SAMANTHA FRANK’S MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION



I.
       BACKGROUND 
Plaintiff Drive LA
(“Plaintiff”) alleges Defendant Samantha Frank (“Defendant”) rented a
Lamborghini Urus (“Vehicle”) from Plaintiff and agreed to pay for damages to
the Vehicle should such damages occur. (See Complaint, pg. 4, GN-1.)
Plaintiff further alleges Defendant damaged the Vehicle and has not paid for
the damages as agreed. (See id. at pg. 6, BC-2.) 
Defendant now seeks
to compel Plaintiff’s claims to arbitration. 
II.           
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On April 16, 2024,
Plaintiff filed its Complaint, alleging (1) General Negligence; (2) Motor Vehicle;
and (3) Breach of Contract. 
On August 6, 2024,
Defendant filed the instant Motion to Compel Arbitration (“Motion”).
On August 28, 2024,
Defendant filed a Notice of Non-Opposition. 
III.        
LEGAL STANDARD
“The party seeking
to compel arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration
agreement.” (Avila v. Southern Cal. Specialty Care, Inc. (2018) 20
Cal.App.5th 835, 844.) 
“California courts
traditionally have maintained a strong preference for arbitration as a speedy
and inexpensive method of dispute resolution… To this end, arbitration
agreements should be liberally construed, … with doubts concerning the scope of
arbitrable issues being resolved in favor of arbitration.” (Market Ins.
Corp. v. Integrity Ins. Co. (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1095, 1098 (cleaned up).)
“This strong policy has resulted in the general rule that arbitration should be
upheld unless it can be said with assurance that an arbitration clause is not
susceptible to an interpretation covering the asserted dispute.... It seems
clear that the burden must fall upon the party opposing arbitration to
demonstrate that an arbitration clause cannot be interpreted to require
arbitration of the dispute.” (Bono v. David (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 1055,
1062 (cleaned up).)
California law
incorporates many of the basic policy objectives contained in the Federal
Arbitration Act (“FAA”), including a presumption in favor of arbitrability. (See
Engalla v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 971-972.)
The Court is empowered by Code of Civil Procedure § 1281.2[1]
to compel parties to arbitrate disputes pursuant to an agreement to do so.¿¿¿ 
The party opposing
the petition to compel arbitration bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense. (See Giuliano
v. Inland Empire Personnel, Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1276, 1284.)
Accordingly, under both the Federal Arbitration Act and California law,
arbitration agreements are valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, except on such
grounds that exist at law or equity for voiding a contract. (See Winter v.
Window Fashions Professions, Inc. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 943, 947.)
Thus, in deciding a
motion to compel arbitration, trial courts must first decide whether an
enforceable arbitration agreement exists between the parties, and then
determine the second gateway issue of whether the claims are covered within the
scope of the agreement. (See Omar v. Ralphs Grocery Co. (2004) 118
Cal.App.4th 955, 961.)
IV.         
ANALYSIS 
A.            
Plaintiff’s Claims are Covered by a Valid
Arbitration Agreement. 
The arbitration
proponent must first recite verbatim, or provide a copy of, the alleged
agreement. (See Sprunk v. Prisma LLC (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 785, 793.) A
movant can meet this initial burden “‘by attaching a copy of the arbitration
agreement purportedly bearing the opposing party’s signature.’” (Id. (quoting
Rules of Court, rule 3.1330).) “[U]nless there is a dispute over authenticity,
it is sufficient for a party moving to compel arbitration to recite the terms
of the governing provision.” (Id. (citing Condee v. Longwood Mgmt.
Corp. (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 215, 219).) “A voluntary acceptance of the
benefit of a transaction is equivalent to a consent to all the obligations
arising from it, so far as the facts are known, or ought to be known, to the
person accepting.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1589.) 
Here, Defendant has
attached the contract whereby the parties agreed Defendant would rent the
Vehicle and which contains the agreement to arbitrate. (See Declaration
of Samantha Frank (“Frank Decl.”) filed August 6, 2024, ¶ 1, Ex. A.) The
contract references arbitration twice, once under the header “Dispute
Resolution Clause” (“Any disputes or claims arising from this Agreement will be
resolved by arbitration in Los Angeles, California”) and again under the header
“Arbitration Agreement” (“Should a dispute or claim arise out of this Agreement,
the Parties agree to resolve such disputes through arbitration, which will be
conducted in Los Angeles.”) (See Frank Decl., ¶ 1, Ex. A, pp. 3, 5.)
The contract is on
Plaintiff’s letterhead and appears to be a standard agreement Plaintiff uses
when renting its vehicles. (See Frank Decl., ¶ 1, Ex. A, pg. 1.) Defendant
digitally signed the contact on each page. (See Frank Decl., ¶ 1, Ex.
A.) Defendant has thus met her burden of showing the existence of a valid
arbitration agreement. 
Defendant has also
shown Plaintiff’s claims fall within the scope of the agreement. Plaintiff’s
claims all stem from Defendant’s failure to pay for the alleged damage to the
Vehicle. Such claims are explicitly within the scope of the contract between
the parties and the parties’ agreement to arbitrate “any disputes or claims
arising from this Agreement.” (See Frank Decl., ¶ 1, Ex. A, pg. 3.)
Plaintiff did not
oppose. 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion is GRANTED.
V.       CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion to Compel Arbitration and stays
the action pending arbitration. 
          IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:
­­­­September 5, 2024

  Michael R. Amerian
