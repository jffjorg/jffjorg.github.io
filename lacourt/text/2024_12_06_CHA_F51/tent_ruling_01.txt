  Case Number:  21STCV08390    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2024    Dept:  F51 MOTION FOR SUMMARY  JUDGMENT  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 21STCV08390    Motion Filed: 10/24/23                                                                             JURY TRIAL: 10/6/25   MOVING PARTY: Defendant Justin Spooler, M.D. (“Moving  Defendant”) RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Petros Jabakjuryan  (“Plaintiff”) NOTICE: OK    RELIEF REQUESTED: An  order granting summary judgment in favor of Moving Defendant and against  Plaintiff.   TENTATIVE RULING: The unopposed motion is granted.   BACKGROUND    This action  arises out of the medical care and treatment received by Plaintiff in and  around 2/20/21. Plaintiff alleges that after being involved in a car accident  which resulted in a fracture of his cervical spine and a fracture and  dislocation of his thoracic spine, he was transported by paramedics to  Providence St. Joseph Medical Center. Plaintiff alleges he was later  transferred to Providence Holy Cross Medical Center (“Holy Cross”). Plaintiff  alleges that he should have been sedated and other measures should have been  taken to stabilize his spine, but the named defendants failed to do so.  Plaintiff alleges that at some point, he moved and/or was moved by hospital  staff, and the movement allegedly pinched and permanently damaged his spinal  cord.   Plaintiff  also alleges that Defendants, collectively, willfully failed to provide  adequate care during his hospitalization at Holy Cross, resulting in his  development of urinary tract infections, sepsis, and pressure ulcers. Moving  Defendant was, at all relevant times, Plaintiff’s treating neurosurgeon. (4AC  ¶¶ 31–32.)   On  12/27/22, Plaintiff filed his operative fourth amended complaint, (“4AC”),  alleging against 11 named defendants causes of action for (1) Medical  Negligence; and (2) Dependent Adult Abuse/Neglect.¿On 12/30/22, Plaintiff  dismissed the second cause of action as against Moving Defendant. On 1/26/23,  Moving Defendant filed his answer to Plaintiff’s 4AC.   On 10/24/23,  Moving Defendant filed the instant motion for summary judgment. No opposition  has been filed to date. On 11/22/24, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Non-Opposition  to the instant motion.   ANALYSIS   The function of a motion for summary judgment or  adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot  show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of  summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield  Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,  subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the  evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’  and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no  triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to  judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7  Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary  judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits  or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact  within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento  (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 65, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima  (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381–382.)    As to each claim as framed by the complaint, the defendant  moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof by  presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a defense.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)  128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519–1520.)     Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts  to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts  exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. To establish a triable  issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial  responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 163.) Courts “liberally  construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and  resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v.  Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)    A.     Medical Negligence   Plaintiff’s sole remaining cause of action against Moving  Defendant alleges Medical Negligence. “The elements of a cause of action for  medical malpractice are: (1) a duty to use such skill, prudence, and diligence  as other members of the profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach  of the duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct  and the injury; and (4) resulting loss or damage.” (Chakalis v. Elevator  Solutions, Inc. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1557, 1571.)   Here,  Moving Defendant argues that he, “at all times, complied with the applicable  standard of care.” (MSJ 7:14.) In support of its contention, Moving Defendant proffers  the sworn declaration of his expert, a licensed neurosurgeon specializing in  brain and spinal surgery, stating that Moving Defendant “met the standard of  care with respect to preoperative instructions, that he did not engage in  transferring nor was he primarily responsible for transferring plaintiff during  the workup, that Dr. Hanpeter had plaintiff intubated while ensuring that staff  was aware of the importance of precautions, there is no evidence that staff was  not aware of the need for precautions, and that no further intervention with  respect to spinal precautions on the part of Dr. Spooler as the consulting  neurosurgeon was warranted or clinically indicated. … Dr. Alberstone opines  that it was appropriate and within the standard of care for Dr. Spooler to  order more detailed imaging studies of the spine prior to surgery.” (Id.  at 8:2–9, citing Decl. of Carey D. Alberstone, M.D., ¶¶ 17–20.) Furthermore,  Moving Defendant asserts that “it is Dr. Alberstone’s opinion, to a reasonable  degree of medical probability, that no negligent act or omission of Dr. Spooler  caused or contributed to any of the plaintiff’s alleged injuries.” (Id. at  9:15–17, citing Alberstone Decl. ¶ 21.)   Based  on the foregoing, the Court finds that Moving Defendant has met his initial  burden. As Plaintiff has chosen not to oppose the instant motion, he has therefore failed to offer any  responsive evidence to show a triable issue of material fact exists as to this  cause of action. Accordingly, the Court finds that Moving Defendant is entitled  to summary judgment.   CONCLUSION    The unopposed motion is granted. Defendant to file proposed  judgment within 10 days.
