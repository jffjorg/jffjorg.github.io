And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, which means that the case will be dismissed without the need for a trial. The defendant, Justin Spooler, M.D., is a neurosurgeon who treated the plaintiff, Petros Jabakjuryan, at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center and Providence Holy Cross Medical Center.

The plaintiff alleges that the defendant and other medical professionals failed to provide adequate care during his hospitalization, which led to the development of urinary tract infections, sepsis, and pressure ulcers. He also alleges that the defendant failed to sedate him and prevent movement of his spine, which caused permanent damage to his spinal cord.

The defendant argues that he complied with the standard of care and that no negligent act or omission caused or contributed to the plaintiff's injuries. The judge has found that the defendant has met his burden of proof and that the plaintiff has failed to produce any responsive evidence to show a triable issue of material fact.

Therefore, the judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, and the case will be dismissed.
