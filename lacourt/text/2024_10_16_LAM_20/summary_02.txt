As for the English text summary, here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling:

The court denies the defendant's motion for a protective order, which sought to prevent his deposition regarding the issue of personal jurisdiction. The court finds that the plaintiffs have shown good cause to depose the defendant to establish the court's personal jurisdiction over him. However, the court also finds that the plaintiffs have not shown good cause to depose the defendant regarding the issues in the case beyond personal jurisdiction. The court orders the defendant to attend deposition regarding the issue of personal jurisdiction and grants sanctions of $700.00 to the plaintiffs due to the defendant's failure to meet and confer prior to filing the motion.
