Little, Optima Escrow, Inc., Marty Rangel, Mumtaz Thakor (“Defendants”) and DOES 1 to 100, inclusive for (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Breach of Third Party Contract; (3) Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (4) Negligence; (5) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (6) Fraud and Deceit; (7) Intentional Misrepresentation; and (8) Conversion. The FAC alleges Defendants conspired to not pay Plaintiffs money owed under various oral and written contracts regarding obtaining judgment for and, the sale and remodeling of the real property located at 700 Cory Drive, Inglewood, CA 90302 (“Cory Property”). (FAC ¶¶1, 4-16, 18-22.)            On February 17, 2023, Defendants Optima Escrow, Inc., Marty Rangel, and Mumtaz Thakor filed a Demurrer to the FAC. The Court sustained Defendants Optima Escrow, Inc., Marty Rangel, and Mumtaz Thakor demurrer to the second through eighth causes of action without leave to amend on March 17, 2023.            On April 10, 2023, Defendant Katie L. Little filed her Answer.            On April 14, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal on the Order Sustaining the Demurrer to the FAC.            On October 19, 2023, Defendant Little filed a Motion for Stay of Proceedings Pending Appeal. The Court denied the motion for stay on November 14, 2023.              On August 8, 2024, Defendant Little filed the instant Motion for Judgement on the Pleadings. On September 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an Opposition. On October 4, 2024, Defendant Little filed a Reply. DISCUSSIONApplicable Law            The standard for ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.¿(Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322, citing Schabarum v. California Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216.)¿Matters which are subject to mandatory judicial notice may be treated as part of the complaint and may be considered without notice to the parties. Matters which are subject to permissive judicial notice must be specified in the notice of motion, the supporting points and authorities, or as the court otherwise permits. (Id.)¿The motion may not be supported by extrinsic evidence. (Barker v. Hull (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 221, 236.)¿¿ When the moving party is a defendant, he or she must demonstrate that “The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the complaint” or “The complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 438(c)(1)(B)(i)-(ii).)¿¿¿ ¿¿ Application to Facts            Defendant Katie L. Little (hereinafter “Defendant Little”) moves for an order granting judgment on the pleadings as to the second through eighth causes of action. The motion is made on the grounds that the FAC fails to state facts sufficient to constitute the subject causes of action against Defendant Little because they are based upon conspiracy to interfere with or deprive Plaintiffs of a claimed property right acquired via an alleged lien, which never existed.As a preliminary matter, the Court notes that there is a current pending appeal on the March 17, 2023 Order Sustaining the Demurrer to the FAC as to the second through eighth causes of action. However, the March 17, 2023 Order was sustained without leave to amend as to Defendants As such, Defendant Little was not affected by the order or current appeal.Charging Lien“When an attorney wishes to secure payment of hourly legal fees and costs of litigation by obtaining a charging lien against a client’s future recovery, under rule 3–300 the attorney must ‘explain the transaction fully, to offer fair and reasonable terms, to provide a copy of the agreement, to give the client an opportunity to seek independent legal advice, and to secure the client’s written consent.’ ” (Shopoff & Cavallo LLP v. Hyon (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1489, 1522; see also Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct, rule 1.8.1 (formerly cited as rule 3–300).) “If the attorney fails to comply with the rule, the “lien may not be enforced ” in a proceeding to enforce a charging lien.” (Id.)            In Paragraph 3 of the FAC, Plaintiffs allege: “At all times herein mentioned, Plaintiffs, including but not limited to, May 4, 2015, November 2, 2016, February 5, 2019, had a written and oral retainer agreements with LITTLE, for the work being done on LITTLE's behalf, that ranged from $250.00 per hour to $350.00 per hour, to $450.00 per hour. Each and every retainer agreement granted LAW CORPORATION a lien on any recovery as security for payment of Attorney’s fee and disbursement. A balance of $274,277.90 is overdue.” (FAC ¶3, Exs. 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2.)            In Paragraph 23 of the FAC, Plaintiffs alleges: “At all times herein mentioned, PLAINTIFFS have performed all the terms of each agreement with LITTLE, LITTLE has breached each agreement including the oral agreement for the remodeling loan even though LITTLE and other DOES 1-100 have received PLAINTIFFS proceeds money of$27 4,456.60 from Optima Escrow No. 20502MR for the sale of the CORY PROPERTY without payment to PLAINTIFFS.” (FAC ¶23, Exs. 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1.)            In Paragraph 186 of the FAC, Plaintiffs allege: “On May 4, 2015, November 2, 2016 and February 5, 2017, PLAINTIFFS and LITTLE  entered into contractual agreements to pursue various actions against Elmer Clarke, Case No. BC84795, the just mentioned agreements, all the contracts granted PLAINTIFFS a lien on any recovery to secure payments of any indebtedness.” (FAC ¶186.)            Although Plaintiffs attempt to differentiate the lien alleged in the FAC from a “charging lien,” by definition “a charging lien grants the attorney considerable authority to detain all or part of the client's recovery whenever a dispute arises over the lien’s existence or its scope.” (Fletcher v. Davis (2004) 33 Cal.4th 61, 69.) As set forth in the FAC, Plaintiffs allege the retainer agreements they entered into with Defendant Little are subject to a lien on any recovery as security for payment of attorney’s fees and disbursement. Thus, the lien alleged in the FAC constitutes a “charging lien.” The FAC is devoid of any facts alleging that Defendant Little was provided an explanation of the retainer agreements including the charging liens, provided a copy of the agreements, or given an opportunity to seek independent legal advice as to the charging liens. Plaintiffs also fails to contest that Defendant Little was not informed of the nature of the charging lien, potential consequences, and/or given an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to entering into the alleged agreements. As such, taking the allegations as true one could not reasonably infer the charging liens are valid and enforceable against Defendant Little. Likewise, the subject causes of action and Plaintiffs right to recovery are premised on the charging lien included in the retainer agreement. Additionally, the purported admission by Defendant Little in her initial Answer is irrelevant to the present motion as she has since filed a First Amended Answer upon being granted leave from the Court.            Therefore, the FAC fails to state sufficient facts to support the second through eighth causes of action against Defendant Little. CONCLUSION            The Motion for Judgement on the Pleadings is GRANTED without leave to amend. Plaintiffs’ request for sanctions in the amount of $6,500.00 is DENIED.            Defendant Katie L. Little to give notice.            If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear in person.
