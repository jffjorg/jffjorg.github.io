And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to the defendant's discovery requests. The plaintiff argued that the defendant's responses were insufficient and untimely, but the judge found that the defendant had verified its responses and therefore did not waive its right to object to the discovery requests. The judge also declined to impose sanctions on the plaintiff for failing to meet and confer with the defendant before filing the motion. The judge encourages counsel to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
