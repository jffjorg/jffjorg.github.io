And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the Defendant Katie L. Little's motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted without leave to amend. The motion was filed in response to the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC), which alleges that the Defendant breached various oral and written contracts and failed to pay the Plaintiff's attorney's fees and disbursements.

The judge found that the FAC fails to state sufficient facts to support the second through eighth causes of action against the Defendant Little, as the FAC fails to allege that the Defendant was provided with a written charging lien agreement, was informed of the nature of the charging lien, or was given an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to entering into the alleged agreements.

The judge also found that the purported admission by the Defendant Little in her initial answer is irrelevant to the present motion, as she has since filed a First Amended Answer.

The judge denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $6,500.00 and ordered the Defendant to give notice of the ruling.
