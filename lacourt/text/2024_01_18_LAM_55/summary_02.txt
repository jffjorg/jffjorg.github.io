And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling regarding a dispute over costs in the case of Cherie Brown v. Adi Perez. The court previously entered a judgment awarding costs to both parties, but left the amount of those costs blank. Both parties filed memoranda of costs, but neither party filed a motion to tax the costs sought by the other party. The court has determined that the clerk should process the memoranda of costs and enter the amounts on the judgment, rather than requiring a motion to tax costs. The court is requesting that the clerk take this action, and is taking both matters off calendar.
