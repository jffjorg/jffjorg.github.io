  Case Number:  23STCV02301    Hearing Date:   January 18, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Motion of Plaintiff to
Deem Admissions Admitted by Alexandra Imelda Rodriguez aka Imelda Alexandra
Lopez and Request for Sanctions; Motion of Plaintiff to Deem Admissions
Admitted by Irbusiness, Inc. and Request for Sanctions.
 
Both motions are granted.
 
Background
IMMIGRANT RIGHTS DEFENSE COUNCIL, LLC (“Plaintiff”)
filed a Complaint for Violation of the Immigration Consultant Act (“ICA”), alleging
that Defendants are engaged in the business of an immigration consultant, but
are not practicing in conformity with the ICA.       
Issues 
Plaintiff has filed two motions requesting that requests
for admissions be deemed admitted as to Defendant IRBusiness, Inc. and Alexandra
Imelda Rodriguez (“Defendants”), and that each Defendant be ordered to pay $2,560.00
as sanctions. Defendants oppose the motions. 
 
Legal Standard
A responding party’s service of substantially
compliant responses to requests for admission prior to the hearing on a motion to
have matters deemed admitted defeats such a motion. CCP §
2033.280(c). If a party responds to requests for admission but the responses
are unverified, such responses are treated as no
response.  Steele v.  Totah (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 545,
549;  Appleton v.  Sup. 
Ct.  (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d
632, 636-37.  
CCP § 2015.5 provides that a verification must be signed
under penalty of perjury and state the date and place of execution. “[C]ourts
do not find compliance with section 2015.5 to be both substantial and
sufficient unless all statutory conditions appear on the face of the
declaration in some form.”  Kulshrestha
v. First Union Commercial Corp. (2004) 33 Cal.4th 601, 612.  
A court must impose sanctions against a party or
attorney who fails to timely serve responses to requests for admission,
regardless of whether the party later serves responses that are substantially
compliant. CCP § 2033.280(c). 
Analysis 
Here, Defendants served responses on 11/20/2023 without
verifications. Defendants contend that after Plaintiff filed the motions,
Defendants served verifications on 1/3/2024 and such verifications moot the
motions. Defendants also argue sanctions are not appropriate. The verifications
provided by Defendants are legally invalid under CCP § 2015.5.
They are not dated and do not state the place of execution. Nor are they signed
under penalty of perjury. And the verification for Defendant IRBusiness does
not state that the signatory is an officer of the entity, or some other
authorized agent authorized and/or competent to verify the responses. CCP §
2033.240(b) (providing that a corporate entity’s verification must be signed by
“one of its officers or agents”). Defendants’ failure to serve proper
verifications before the hearing is tantamount to not serving responses at all.
The Court therefore grants both motions and deems
admitted the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests for admissions. On or before 1/29/24, Defendant ALEXANDRA
IMELDA RODRIGUEZ shall pay discovery sanctions in the sum of $2560.00 to Plaintiff,
and Defendant IRBUSINESS, INC. shall pay discovery sanctions in the sum of
$2560.00 to Plaintiff. CCP §2033.280(c).
