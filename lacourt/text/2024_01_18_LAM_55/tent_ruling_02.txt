 Case Number:  BC475181    Hearing Date:   January 18, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Plaintiff Cherie Brown's Notice of Failure to
Move to Tax Costs and Request the Court to Enter Costs Pursuant to Memorandum of
Costs; Defendant Adi Perez’s Motion for Costs
 
The Court takes both matters off calendar.  
The Court entered a judgment in this case on 6/14/2023,
which awarded costs to both Plaintiff and Defendant Perez but left the amount of
such costs blank. Plaintiff and Defendant Perez then both timely filed a
memorandum of costs. Neither party filed a motion to tax the costs sought by
the other party. “After the time has passed for a motion to strike or tax costs
or for determination of that motion, the clerk must immediately enter the costs
on the judgment.”  CRC Rule
3.1700(b)(4).  Neither party needed to
file a motion for the clerk to process the costs because the clerk should
process the costs in the absence of a motion to tax costs. The Court therefore requests
that the clerk process the Memorandum of Costs and enter the amounts on the
judgment nunc pro tunc. Grant v. List & Lathrop (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th
993, 996-97.
