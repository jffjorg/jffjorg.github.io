And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants both motions filed by the plaintiff, IMMIGRANT RIGHTS DEFENSE COUNCIL, LLC, to deem admissions admitted by Alexandra Imelda Rodriguez aka Imelda Alexandra Lopez and Irbusiness, Inc. and to impose sanctions on both defendants. The defendants failed to serve verifications to their responses to requests for admission, which are legally invalid under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 2015.5. The judge determines that the defendants' failure to serve proper verifications is tantamount to not serving responses at all, and therefore grants the motions. The defendants are ordered to pay discovery sanctions in the sum of $2,560.00 to the plaintiff.
