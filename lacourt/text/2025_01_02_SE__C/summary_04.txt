And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Lourdes Beltran v. Carlos Ochoa. Defendant Ochoa's motion to strike certain portions of the complaint is granted. The plaintiff, Lourdes Beltran, filed a personal injury action against Ochoa and others, alleging that Ochoa's dog bit and injured her while she was on his property to deliver food. The complaint also alleged strict liability and negligence. Ochoa moved to strike the portions of the complaint seeking punitive damages, arguing that the allegations were insufficient to support a punitive damages award. The judge agreed, finding that the complaint contained conclusory allegations of malice and oppression, which are insufficient to support a punitive damages award. The judge also struck certain paragraphs and the prayer for relief paragraph 5 of the complaint, which sought punitive damages based on Civil Code section 3340, as that section is inapplicable to the case.
