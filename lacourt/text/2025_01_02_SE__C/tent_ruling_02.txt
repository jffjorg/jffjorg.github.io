 Case Number:  23NWCV00990    Hearing Date:   January 2, 2025    Dept:  C Cardoza et al. v. City of Compton et al. (23NWCV00990)
This wrongful death action was filed on March 30, 2023. Trial is
set for March 20, 2025. Plaintiffs now move ex parte for an order continuing
the hearing Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the alternative,
Summary Adjudication, which is currently set for January 22, 2024. Plaintiffs
argue that, despite the Court granting Plaintiffs' Motions to Compel the
Depositions of David Blake Jr. and Isaac Jacob Galvan on December 17, 2024,
Plaintiffs have been unable to take their depositions. Plaintiffs noticed and
personally served Mr. Galvan on December 23, 2024, but he failed to appear at
his deposition. Plaintiffs have been unable to serve Mr. Blake but anticipates
serving him on January 8, 2025, at his next criminal hearing. Plaintiffs argue
these depositions are necessary for Plaintiffs' opposition to Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Judgment.
Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Application for an Order Continuing
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the alternative, Summary
Adjudication, is GRANTED.  The Court finds good cause to continue the
Motion for Summary Judgment. The hearing is ADVANCED to this date and
CONTINUED to Tuesday, February 18, 2025, at 10:30 a.m. in Department SE-C.
This date is 30 days before trial, in accordance with CCP § 437c(3). Opposition
and Reply briefs to be filed and served in compliance with the new hearing
dates. Moving party to give notice.
