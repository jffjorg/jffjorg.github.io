And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jose Menjivar Menjivar vs. Menashe Perezt and Neo Builder, Inc. The case involves a breach of contract action, where the plaintiff alleges that he was not paid for work performed on a home expansion project. The defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff lacks standing and that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to support any of the causes of action. The judge has overruled the demurrer and found that the plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to state a claim for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violation of California's Unfair Competition Law. The judge has also found that the defendants engaged in unfair or fraudulent business practices and that the plaintiff has stated a claim under Business and Professions Code section 17200. The defendants are ordered to give notice and provide an answer within 10 days of the order.
