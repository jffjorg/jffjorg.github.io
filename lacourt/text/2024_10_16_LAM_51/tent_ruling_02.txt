STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On March 11, 2022, Plaintiff Cindy Najarro (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Defendants US Health Fairs – Org. and Joshua Baerwald
(“Defendants.”) The complaint alleged nine causes of action based on labor code
violations and wrongful termination. Plaintiff alleges that they were hired by
Defendants as a full-time Clinic Manager. However, during Plaintiff’s
employment, Plaintiff alleges that they were not paid the correct wage or for
overtime hours. Plaintiff also allege that Defendant caused them to miss meal
and rest breaks, and did not pay Plaintiff for milage and other incurred
expenses. Further, after Plaintiff witnessed another individual incorrectly
administering vaccines and complaint to the Human Resources manager, Plaintiff
was terminated.  
 
On May 4, 2022, Defendant US Health Fairs – Org. filed an
Answer.  
 
On May 26, 2022, Defendant Joshua Baerwald filed an
Answer.  
 
On March 6, 2024, the parties filed a Stipulation and Order
for Settlement and Dismissal pursuant to CCP § 664.6.
 
On June 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to
enforce settlement. As of October 11, 2024, Defendants have not filed an
opposition.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure, section 664.6:¿ 
¿ 
(a)¿If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the
parties outside¿of¿the presence of the court or orally before the court, for
settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties,
the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement
until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.¿ 
¿ 
(b) For purposes of this section, a
writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the following:¿ 
¿ 
(1) The party.¿ 
(2) An attorney who represents the
party.¿ 
(3) If the party is an insurer, an
agent who is authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's
behalf.”¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Compel Compliance
 
Plaintiff moves the court to enforce the settlement reached
between the parties because Defendants have failed to make the requisite
payments. Plaintiff seeks judgment against Defendants in the amount of
$75,000.00 plus $4,185.00 in attorneys’ fees.
 
The court agrees with Plaintiff that it retained
jurisdiction over this matter to enforce the Settlement Agreement. Notably, the
parties Stipulated on March 6, 2024 under CCP § 664.6 for the court to retain
jurisdiction. (Milon Decl., Exhibit 3.) The Settlement Agreement also provides that the court
retains jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6. (Milon Decl., Exhibit 1, item
19.) Accordingly, the court may enforce the
terms of the Settlement Agreement. 
 
Per
the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Defendants were to pay the first
installment of $15,000.00 within thirty days following receipt of Plaintiff’s
signature on the Settlement Agreement. (Milon Decl., Exhibit 1, item 1A.) Plaintiff
performed. (Milon Decl. ¶ 4.) Defendants have not made any payments. (Milon
Decl. ¶¶ 6, 7.) 
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff’s motion to enforce settlement is GRANTED.
 
Attorneys’ Fees
 
With
respect to attorney fees and costs, unless they are specifically provided for
by statute (e.g., Cal. Code Civ. Proc. (CCP) §§ 1032, et seq.), the measure and
mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the
agreement, express or implied, of the parties.¿(CCP § 1021.) 
 
Here, attorneys’ fees are warranted. First, the Settlement
Agreement provides for them in the context of bringing or defending against a
motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement. (Exhibit 1, Item 14.) Second,
Defendants did not file an opposition, so, for the purposes of the attorneys’
fee clause, Plaintiff is the prevailing party. However, Plaintiff’s request for
$4,185.00 is unreasonable. This is a straightforward motion that did not
require 3.5 hours, let alone 3.5 hours performed by a seasoned attorney with 18
years of experience. (Milon Decl. ¶ 8.) With no opposition, there was no need
to prepare a reply. The court therefore reduces the request to 1.5 hours at
counsel’s hourly rate of $750 per hour plus $60 filing fee.
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for
attorneys’ fees.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
to Enforce Settlement Agreement is GRANTED;
2.      The
court awards attorneys’ fees in the amount of $1,185.00.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
