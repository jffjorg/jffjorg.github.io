STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On September 5, 2019, Plaintiff Clarissa Vigil, on behalf of
herself, all others similarly situated, and the general public (Plaintiff)
filed a complaint against Defendant United Healthcare Services, Inc.
(Defendant). The complaint alleged one cause of action: Civil Penalties – Labor
Code §§ 2698, et. Seq. The Plaintiff’s complaint alleges that the Defendant
failed to pay all hours worked, failed to pay overtime wages at a correct rate,
failed to provide accurate written wage statements, and failed to timely pay
final wages following separation of employment.
 
On October 7, 2019, Defendant filed an Answer.
 
On January 27, 2022, Defendant filed a Motion to Compel
Arbitration which the court GRANTED.
 
On August 26, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Petition to
Confirm Arbitration Award.
 
On September 11, 2024, the court issued Notice of Hearing on
the Petition.
 
On September 16, 2024, Defendant filed proof of service of
the Notice of Hearing on the Petition.
 
As of October 11, 2024, the court has not received an
opposition to the Petition.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made
may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.¿ The petition
shall name as respondent all parties to the arbitration and may name as
respondents any other persons bound by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ.
Proc., (CCP) § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly
served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered
in this state or another state, unless in accordance with this chapter it
corrects the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses
the proceeding.” (CCP § 1286.)¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Filing Requirements of a Petition to Confirm
Arbitration Award (CCP § 1285.4)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 1285.4 states: “A petition under this chapter shall:¿¿ 
 
a.       
Set forth the
substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the
petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement.¿¿ 
 
c.       
Set forth the names of
the arbitrators.¿¿ 
 
c.       
Set forth or have
attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if
any.”¿¿ 
¿¿ 
(CCP § 1285.4 (emphasis added).)¿¿ 
 
Here, Defendant attached the arbitration agreement to the
Petition and identified the pertinent clause in the Petition. (Petition at item
4; Attachment 4b.)  The arbitrator was
the Honorable Amy S. Hogue (Ret.) (Petition at item 6.) Finally, Defendant
attached a copy of the arbitration award. (Petition, Attachment 8c.) 
 
Accordingly, this requirement is met.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4 states in pertinent
part:¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
(a) A copy
of the petition and a written notice of the time and place of the hearing
thereof and any other papers upon which the petition is based shall be served
in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the service of such
petition and notice.¿¿ 
¿¿ 
(b) If the
arbitration agreement does not provide the manner in which such service shall
be made and the person upon whom service is to be made has not previously
appeared in the proceeding and has not previously been served in accordance
with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service within this State shall be made in the
manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.¿¿ 
¿¿ 
(CCP § 1290.4.)¿¿ 
 
Here, Defendant’s proof of service indicates that served
notice of hearing and a copy of the Petition to Plaintiff via e-mail. The arbitration agreement does not explicitly indicate electronic
service is appropriate. Service of a summons cannot be via e-mail. (CCP §
415.10 [personal service]; CCP § 415.20 [substituted service by U.S. Mail]; CCP
§ 415.30 [service by mail].) However, the court is inclined to believe that the
parties agreed to electronic service because both parties do electronically
serve other documents in the instant matter. (See, e.g., proof of service
attached to Plaintiff’s October 2, 2024 CMC Statement.)  
 
Accordingly, this requirement is
met. 
 
Service of the Arbitration Award (CCP § 1283.6)¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1283.6 provides that: “The neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration
personally or by registered or certified mail or as provided in the
agreement.”¿This requirement may be satisfied by service by the arbitrator or
upon proper service of the Award with the Petition. (See Murry v. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d
796, 799-800.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
The Court finds Code of Civil
Procedure section 1283.6 is satisfied.¿¿¿ 
 
Timing of Service of Petition (CCP §§ 1288, 1288.4)¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
A party may seek a court judgment
confirming an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition no more than
four years, but not less than 10 days, after the award is served. (CCP §§ 1288, 1288.4.)¿¿ 
¿ 
Defendant filed the instant
petition approximately 106 days after service of the Award, making it timely
under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1288 and 1288.4.¿¿¿ 
 
Merits of the
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
The court must confirm the award as made, unless it
corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses the proceeding.¿ (CCP § 1286; Valsan Partners Limited Partnership v.
Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.)¿¿ 
 
Defendant has demonstrated that on June 27, 2024, the
arbitrator issued an Award in their favor. Specifically, Judge Hogue found that
Plaintiff did not suffer a violation of California law based on Defendant’s
calculation of the regular rate of pay and denied all other claims not
expressly granted.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Petition
to Confirm Arbitration Award is GRANTED.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
