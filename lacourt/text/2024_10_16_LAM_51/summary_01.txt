The judge has granted the petition to confirm the arbitration award in favor of United Healthcare Services, Inc. (Defendant). The petition was filed by the Defendant and seeks to confirm the arbitration award issued on June 27, 2024. The arbitrator, Honorable Amy S. Hogue (Ret.), found that the Plaintiff did not suffer a violation of California law based on the Defendant's calculation of the regular rate of pay and denied all other claims not expressly granted.

The judge found that the petition meets the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1285.4, 1290.4, and 1283.6, including the filing of a petition to confirm the arbitration award, service of the petition, and service of the arbitration award. The judge also found that the petition was timely filed under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1288 and 1288.4.

The judge concluded that the petition to confirm the arbitration award is granted, and the Defendant is to give notice.
