```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Manasyan, alleges that the defendant, American Honda Motor Co., breached an express warranty on a used 2020 Honda Civic that Manasyan purchased. The defendant argues that the vehicle does not qualify as a new motor vehicle under the Song-Beverly Act, which would exempt it from the warranty. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has pled sufficient allegations to establish the elements of an SBA breach of express warranty cause of action. Specifically, the judge notes that the vehicle was sold with a warranty, that the vehicle was delivered to an authorized repair facility, and that the facility was unable to repair the defects. The judge overrules the defendant's demurrer and orders the defendant to answer the complaint within 15 court days.
