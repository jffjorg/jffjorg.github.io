The judge has made a tentative ruling on the pending motion to compel arbitration and application for writ of attachment. The plaintiff, Slalom, is seeking a writ of attachment against the defendant, Aspiration Partners, for breach of contract and account stated, claiming that Aspiration Partners failed to pay 15 invoices and owes $2,617,224.85 plus interest. Aspiration Partners has moved to compel arbitration based on the parties' master services agreement (MSA). The judge has granted the plaintiff's application for writ of attachment, contingent upon the plaintiff posting an undertaking of $10,000 within 30 days. The judge has also granted Aspiration Partners' motion to compel arbitration, finding that the parties have agreed to mandatory arbitration of disputes under the MSA. The matter will proceed to arbitration once the writ of attachment has been issued.
