And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Account Management Services v. Gallardo, in which the plaintiff seeks to collect $79,435 in unpaid medical expenses. The defendant, Gallardo, has moved to set aside the default judgment entered against her. The court has granted the motion, finding that despite the proper service of the complaint on Gallardo's son, Gallardo did not receive notice of the lawsuit and was therefore excused from the default. The court has ordered Gallardo to file a responsive pleading within 10 days. The court has also awarded the plaintiff $600 in attorney's fees for the time expended in preparing the default paperwork.
