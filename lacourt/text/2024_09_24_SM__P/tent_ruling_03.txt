Manasyan v. American Honda Motor Co.,
Case no. 24 SMCV02577
Hearing date September 24, 2024
Defendant American Honda Motor’s Demurrer
to Plaintiff’s Complaint
 
Plaintiff
Manasyan sues defendant American Honda Motor (AHM) alleging a Song-Beverly claim.
AHM demurs. 
Plaintiff
purchased a used 2020 Honda Civic and alleges the vehicle, when initially sold,
came with a 36 month/36,000 mile warranty from AHM. When plaintiff purchased
the vehicle, it was less than 36 months from the initial sale, and the vehicle
had 32,747 miles. Plaintiff alleges coverage under the balance of the warranty.
Plaintiff further alleges they delivered the vehicle to an authorized AHM
repair facility, which was unable to make the vehicle conform with the warranty.
“The
function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of the complaint as a matter
of law.” Holiday Matinee, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th
1413, 1420. A complaint “is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than
evidentiary facts” Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531,
550, but plaintiff must set forth the essential facts of the case “with
reasonable precision and with particularity sufficient to acquaint [the]
defendant with the nature, source and extent” of the plaintiff’s claim. Doheny
Park Terrace Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exchange (2005) 132
Cal.App.4th 1076, 1099. In reviewing the legal sufficiency of a complaint
against a demurrer, a court will treat the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded. Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; C
& H Foods Co. v. Hartford Ins. Co. (1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 1055, 1062. 
Defendant
AHM argues the vehicle does not qualify as a new motor vehicle under the SBA. “‘New
motor vehicle’ includes the chassis, chassis cab, and that portion of a motor
home devoted to its propulsion, but does not include any portion designed,
used, or maintained primarily for human habitation, a dealer-owned vehicle and
a “demonstrator” or other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer’s new car
warranty…”. Civ. Code §1793.22(e)(2). 
Defendant
cites Rodriguez, et al. v. FCA US LLC (2022) No. E073766, WL 1042907 at
*1, arguing that “previously owned vehicles with some balance remaining on the
manufacturer’s express warranty” do not qualify as a new motor vehicle under
the Song-Beverly Act. Id. Rodriguez is not binding, as the
Supreme Court granted review; although it may be cited for its persuasive
value, it also establishes the existence of a conflict in authority, and
pursuant to Auto Equity Sales, Inc., v. Superior Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d
450, 456 trial courts have discretion to choose between sides of any such
conflict. 
Plaintiff
argues, and the court agrees that, for purposes of pleading on demurrer, the
vehicle falls under the definition of a “new vehicle” per Jensen v. BMW
North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112 (holding that “cars sold with
a balance remaining on the manufacturer’s new motor vehicle warranty” are
included within the Song-Beverly Act’s definition of new motor vehicle).
The
elements of the cause of action are (1) an express warranty to repair defects
given in connection with the sale of goods; (2) existence of a defect covered
by the warranty; (3) buyer’s notice to the seller of such a defect within a
reasonable time after its discovery; (4) seller’s failure to repair the defect
in compliance with the warranty; and (5) resulting damages. Orichian v. BMW
of North America, LLC (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1322, 1333-1334.
Plaintiff
alleges the vehicle was originally sold with a warranty. Compl. para. 8. Plaintiff
alleges they entered into a warranty contract with defendant when plaintiff
purchased the vehicle. Compl. para. 16. Plaintiff alleges defects and
nonconformities appeared within the warranty period. Compl. para. 17. Plaintiff
alleges delivery of the vehicle to a defendant-authorized repair shop that was
unable to repair the defects. Compl. para. 18-19. Plaintiff alleges defendant failed
to make restitution under the warranty, resulting in damages. Compl. paras. 20,
23. 
On
demurrer, the court must accept all factual allegations as true. Plaintiff has
pled allegations sufficient to establish the elements of an SBA breach of
express warranty cause of action. OVERRULED. Defendant to answer within 15
court days.
