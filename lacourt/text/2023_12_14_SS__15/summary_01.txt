And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion for trial preference filed by plaintiffs Mehran Mottahedeh and Martha Saucedo on November 16, 2023. The plaintiffs are seeking to have their case set for trial due to Mottahedeh's serious medical condition, malignant pleural mesothelioma, which has been diagnosed and is expected to worsen shortly. The judge has reviewed the evidence presented, including medical records and a declaration from Dr. Kamrava, Mottahedeh's treating physician. Based on this evidence, the judge has found that there is sufficient medical documentation to meet the clear and convincing standard for granting the motion. As a result, the judge has granted the motion for trial preference and set the case for trial on April 8, 2024.
