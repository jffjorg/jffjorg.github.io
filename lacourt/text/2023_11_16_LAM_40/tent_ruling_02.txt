 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant Interinsurance
  Exchange of the Automobile Club’s Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint.



 
Background
Plaintiff Mahrou Hanassab sues the
Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club (AAA) and Does 1 through 25
pursuant to an October 12, 2022 First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleging claims
of (1) Breach of Written Contract, (2) Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing, (3) Fraudulent Concealment, (4) Negligent Hiring,
Retention and Supervision, and (5) Breach of Fiduciary Duty.
The claims arise from allegations
that, among other things, AAA mismanaged Hanassab’s defense in consolidated
auto collision lawsuits filed against Hanassab in 2017 and 2018: LASC actions
BC669326, instituted by the other driver, Connor Lumpkin; and 18STCV03330,
instituted by the three passengers in Hanassab’s vehicle. A jury trial
was held and resulted in a verdict against Hanassab and in favor of Connor
Lumpkin in the amount of $860,042.39, only $100,000 of which was covered by AAA
under Hanassab’s Policy with AAA, leaving an unsatisfied judgment of $760,042.39.
The FAC was filed after the Court
sustained an unopposed demurer by AAA to the original February 7, 2022
Complaint.
On August 8, 2023, AAA filed a
demurrer to the FAC’s five causes of action.
That same day, AAA served the
motion on Plaintiff’s counsel via email.
Plaintiff has failed to oppose the
demurrer, which is now before the Court.
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
Documents are judicially noticeable
to show their existence, what orders were made, and the documents’ legal
effect, but the truth of the facts and findings within the documents are not
judicially noticeable. (Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich,
Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 885; Julian Volunteer Fire
Co. Assn. v. Julian-Cuyamaca Fire Protection Dist. (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th
583, 600 [affirming trial court’s taking of judicial notice of “the dates and
the legal effect of the statements contained in the documents”].)
The Court does not take judicial
notice of the auto liability policy, BC669326 filings, and the 21STCV04534
filings submitted by AAA as to not convert this hearing into an evidentiary
hearing. (Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123
Cal.App.3d 593, 604-605.)
 
Demurrer
Demurrer
Sufficiency Standard
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).) This device can be used only to challenge defects that
appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) To sufficiently allege a cause of action,
a complaint must allege all the ultimate
facts—that is, the facts needed to establish each element of the cause of
action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods
Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick
v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.)
Thus, “[t]o survive a [general] demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) In
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab
Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other
grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th
1158, 1162.) The face of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the
complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts
appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits
take precedence. (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86
Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in White
v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
Order
on Demurrer: SUSTAINED, without leave.
AAA,
unopposed, moves for an order that sustains its sufficiency challenges to the
FAC’s five causes of action. California Rules of Court, rule 3.1342 provides
that “[t]he failure of the opposing party to serve and file a written
opposition may be construed by the court as an admission that the motion is
meritorious, and the court may grant the motion without a hearing on the merits.”
(See also Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
I.
FAC,
First Cause of Action, Breach of Written Contract: SUSTAINED, without
leave.
“A
contract is a voluntary and lawful agreement, by competent parties, for a good
consideration, to do or not to do a specified thing.” (Robinson v. Magee
(1858) 9 Cal. 81, 83.) “To prevail on a cause of action for breach of contract,
the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance of
the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s breach, and (4)
the resulting damage to the plaintiff.” (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.) Implicit in the element of damage is that the
defendant’s breach caused the plaintiff’s damage.” (Troyk v. Farmers Group,
Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1352, italics omitted.)
A
contract must be pled verbatim in the body of the complaint, be attached to the
complaint and incorporated by reference, or be pled according to its legal
effect. (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co.
(2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-99 [“In an action based on a written contract, a
plaintiff may plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its precise
language.”]; Bowden v. Robinson (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 705, 718.) “In
order to plead a contract by its legal effect, plaintiff must ‘allege the
substance of its relevant terms.’” (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v.
Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 993.)
The
FAC alleges that Plaintiff was insured with AAA pursuant to an auto policy
insuring Plaintiff from any and all damages resulting from a covered loss in an
automobile collision and that if a cover loss arose, Defendants would indemnify
Plaintiff and hold him without liability. The FAC also alleges that “about
October 31, 2017 and continuing thereafter Defendants and each of them breached
the contract of insurance by [1] failing to retain competent counsel, [2] failing
to attempt settlement of the claim(s) within the policy limits, [3] failing to
communicate with Plaintiff all developments in the case and consolidated
action, [4] failing to retain necessary experts to assist in the defense of the
action(s), [5] failing to initiate settlement conversations with the
Plaintiff(s) in the underlying action, [6] failing to undertake all necessary
steps to defend, indemnify and [7] hold harmless Plaintiff from the claims in
the action(s).” (FAC, ¶¶ 47-48, 54.)
In
its demurrer, AAA argues that this claim cannot be sufficiently stated because
the FAC alleges at paragraphs 15 and 43 that AAA fully defended Hanassab in the
Underlying Action as to a jury award in favor of Connor Lumpkin and properly
paid the $100,000 policy limit for bodily injuries, satisfying AAA’s
contractual obligations consistent with various California authorities. The
demurrer also argues that the FAC’s allegations of failure to indemnify the
unsatisfied judgment of $760,042.39 in the Underlying Action does not arise
from any contractual provision, and that some of the grounds for breach of
contract—e.g., failure to initiate settlement conversations with the plaintiffs
in the Underlying Action—do not impose a duty on an insurer to the insured.
(Demurrer, pp. 10-11.)
There
is no opposition before the Court.
The
Court SUSTAINS AAA’s demurrer.
The
Court begins by noting that “[an insurance] carrier may rely upon trial counsel
to conduct the litigation, [such that] the carrier does not become liable for
trial counsel’s legal malpractice” “[i]f trial counsel negligently conducts the
litigation, [where] the remedy for this negligence is found in an action
against counsel for malpractice and not in a suit against counsel’s employer to
impose vicarious liability.” (Merritt v. Reserve Ins. Co. (1973) 34
Cal.App.3d 858, 881-882.) This authority undercuts the first, third, fourth,
and sixth grounds for breach of contract alleged in the FAC. (FAC, ¶ 54.)
Moreover,
“[n]othing in California law supports the proposition that [a breach of
contract claim based on] bad faith liability for failure to settle may attach
if an insurer fails to initiate settlement discussions, or offer its policy
limits, as soon as an insured’s liability in excess of policy limits has become
clear.” (Reid v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 262, 277.) This
authority undercuts the second and fifth grounds for breach of contract in the
FAC. (FAC, ¶ 54.)
This
leaves only the allegations that AAA failed to fully indemnify Plaintiff as the
ground for breach of contract. (FAC, ¶ 54.) However, the FAC simultaneously and
uncertainly alleges policy limits of $100,000 for bodily injury claims, like
the one paid to Connor Lumpkin (FAC, ¶¶ 11, 35), and a duty to fully and
completely indemnify any deficiency in judgment (FAC, ¶¶ 47-48). These
contradictory terms undercut the basis for liability on the breach of contract
claim.
All
the alleged grounds for breach of contract are thus undercut as a matter of law
or based on uncertainty (and thus, lack of sufficiency) in pleading.
AAA’s
demurrer to the FAC’s first cause of action is thus SUSTAINED.
Based
on Plaintiff’s failure to oppose this demurrer, no leave to amend is granted.
II.
FAC,
Second Cause of Action, Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing: SUSTAINED, without leave.
To
prevail on a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing, the plaintiff must prove: (1) the existence of a contract
between plaintiff and defendant; (2) plaintiff performed his contractual
obligations or was excused from performing them; (3) the conditions requiring
defendant’s performance had occurred; (4) the defendant unfairly interfered
with the plaintiff’s right to receive the benefits of the contract; and (5) the
plaintiff was harmed by the defendant’s conduct. (Merced Irr. Dist. v.
County of Mariposa (E.D. Cal. 2013) 941 F.Supp.2d 1237, 1280 [discussing
California law].)
Allegations
must demonstrate defendant’s conduct for failure or refusal to discharge
contractual responsibilities was a conscious and deliberate act, not an honest
mistake, bad judgment or negligence. (Ibid.)
“‘[T]he implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is limited to assuring
compliance with the express terms of the contract and cannot be extended to
create obligations not contemplated by the contract.’” (Ragland v. U.S. Bank
Nat. Assn. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 182, 206, quoting Pasadena Live v. City
of Pasadena (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1089, 1094.)
The
Court adopts its discussion in Section I to find that AAA has not, as alleged
in the FAC, unfairly interfered with Plaintiff Hanassab’s right to receive
benefits under the auto policy with AAA.
AAA’s
demurrer to the FAC’s second cause of action is thus SUSTAINED.
Based
on Plaintiff’s failure to oppose this demurrer, no leave to amend is granted.
III.
FAC,
Third Cause of Action, Fraudulent Concealment: SUSTAINED, without leave.
“[T]he
elements of an action for fraud and deceit based on a concealment are: (1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.” (Boschma v. Home Loan
Center, Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 230, 248; see also Roddenberry v.
Roddenberry (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 634, 665-666.)
The
FAC pleads various grounds for concealment of material information,
intentionally suppressed by AAA. (FAC, ¶¶ 78 [duty], 79-86 [concealments].)
In
its demurrer, AAA argues that the third cause of action is not sufficiently
stated because much of the liability on this claim arises from the conduct of
defense counsel in the Underlying Action, for whose conduct AAA cannot be
liable. AAA also argues that the “concealments” alleged against AAA are not
concealments at all, specifically addressing the concealment alleged in the
FAC’s 86th paragraph. Last, AAA argues that because there is no fiduciary duty
between insurer and insured, there can be no duty to disclose based on a
fiduciary relationship. (Demurrer, pp. 17-18.)
The
Court finds that the concealment claim is not sufficiently alleged.
The
Court adopts its discussion in Section I to note that this claim cannot hold
AAA liable for malpractice by defense counsel in the Underlying Action,
including concealments.
To
the degree that this claim alleges concealment against AAA alone (FAC, ¶¶
79-80, 84), the Court notes that such liability is alleged in relation to
information whose materiality the Court cannot readily understand from the
pleadings (workload of defense counsel in Underlying Action) or is alleged
conclusorily (conflict of interest).
The
allegations supporting a duty to disclose are also undercut by the Court’s
determination that no fiduciary duty arises from the insurer-insured
relationship. (See Section V discussion infra.)
AAA’s
demurrer to the FAC’s third cause of action is thus SUSTAINED.
Based
on Plaintiff’s failure to oppose this demurrer, no leave to amend is granted.
IV.
FAC,
Fourth Cause of Action, Negligent Hiring, Retention and Supervision: SUSTAINED,
without leave.
“California
case law recognizes the theory that an employer can be liable to a third person
for negligently hiring, supervising, or retaining an unfit employee.” (Doe
v. Capital Cities (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1054.) “Negligence liability
will be imposed on an employer if it ‘knew or should have known that hiring the
employee created a particular risk or hazard and that particular harm
materializes.’” (Phillips v. TLC Plumbing, Inc. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th
1133, 1139; Margaret W. v. Kelley R. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 141, 156-157
[To establish negligent supervision, a plaintiff must show that a person in a
supervisorial position over the actor had prior knowledge of the actor’s
propensity to do the bad act].)
The
FAC’s fourth cause of action arises from allegations that (1) Defendants knew
or should have known that defense counsel and all support staff and associates
involved in the defense of this action were unfit and incompetent to perform
the services for which they were employed, (2) Defendants knew or should have
known that defense counsel and all support staff and associates involved in the
defense of this action posed a serious risk of harm to Plaintiff in that their
conflicts and incompetence would jeopardize the defense of the Underlying Action
and expose Plaintiff to an excess verdict and financial decimation, and (3)
defense counsel and all support staff and associates involved in the defense of
the Underlying Action failed to competently perform the services they were
hired and employed for and did subject Plaintiff to an excess verdict that
resulted in Plaintiff being financially exposed to over $750,000 in monetary
damages. (FAC, ¶¶ 91-93.)
In
its demurrer, AAA argues that the FAC’s fourth cause of action is not
sufficiently alleged because AAA cannot be vicariously liable for the
malpractice of defense counsel in the Underlying Action and because negligence
is an improper standard for claims against an insurer, where bad faith should
be the proper standard. (Demurrer, pp. 11-13.)
The
Court adopts its discussion in Section I above to find that the three stated
grounds for negligence against AAA involve liability based on the conduct of
defense counsel in the Underlying Action, such that liability may only lie with
counsel, and not with AAA based on vicarious liability.
AAA’s
demurrer to the FAC’s fourth cause of action is thus SUSTAINED.
Based
on Plaintiff’s failure to oppose this demurrer, no leave to amend is granted.
V.
FAC,
Fifth Cause of Action, Breach of Fiduciary Duty: SUSTAINED, without
leave.
The
elements of a claim for breach of fiduciary duty are (1) the existence of a
fiduciary duty, (2) breach, and (3) damages proximately caused by the breach. (Stanley
v. Richmond (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1086.)
The
FAC alleges that Defendants “breached their duty of due care as a fiduciary to
Plaintiff by retaining incompetent counsel to defend her, failing to disclose
settlement demands, failing to retain or appoint independent counsel for
Plaintiff, failing to expend monies for experts in the defense of the action,
failing to authorize defense counsel to engage a defense that was in the best
interests of Plaintiff rather than the financial betterment of Defendants and
each of them, failing to disclose material facts that would impact Plaintiff’s
choice of action for her best interests and failing to report important events
to keep Plaintiff informed of all matters in her defense.” (FAC, ¶ 99.)
In
its demurrer, AAA argues that the fifth cause of action fails because insurers
are not fiduciaries to their insureds as a matter of law. (Demurrer, p. 13.)
The
Court agrees.
“The
insurer-insured relationship … is not a true ‘fiduciary relationship’ in the
same sense as the relationship between trustee and beneficiary, or attorney and
client. [Citation.] It is, rather, a relationship often characterized by
unequal bargaining power [citations] in which the insured must depend on the
good faith and performance of the insurer [citations]. This characteristic has
led the courts to impose “special and heightened” duties, but ‘[w]hile these
“special” duties are akin to, and often resemble, duties which are also owed by
fiduciaries, the fiduciary-like duties arise because of the unique nature of
the insurance contract, not because the insurer is a fiduciary.” (Vu v.
Prudential Property & Casualty Ins. Co. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1142,
1150-1151.) Therefore, while “[c]ases have referred to the relationship between
insurer and insured as a limited fiduciary relationship [citation],” “‘akin to
a fiduciary relationship’ [citation],” “or as one involving the ‘qualities of
decency and humanity inherent in the responsibility of a fiduciary’
[citation],” California case law is clear: an insurer-insured relationship does
not connote a fiduciary relationship. (Ibid.)
AAA’s
demurrer to the FAC’s fifth cause of action is thus SUSTAINED.
Based
on Plaintiff’s failure to oppose this demurrer, as well as the fact that the demurrer
to the original complaint was also sustained, no leave to amend is granted as
to any of the claims. 

Conclusion
Defendant Interinsurance Exchange
of the Automobile Club’s Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED,
without leave to amend.
