  - "A contract must be pled verbatim in the body of the complaint, be attached to the complaint and incorporated by reference, or be pled according to its legal effect."
  - "The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is limited to assuring compliance with the express terms of the contract and cannot be extended to create obligations not contemplated by the contract."
  - "California case law recognizes the theory that an employer can be liable to a third person for negligently hiring, supervising, or retaining an unfit employee."
  - "The insurer-insured relationship … is not a true 'fiduciary relationship' in the same sense as the relationship between trustee and beneficiary, or attorney and client."
