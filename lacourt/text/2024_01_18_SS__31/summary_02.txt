And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Starlah Ashlyn Lara, a minor, versus Ross Stores, Inc., et al. The case involves a petition to approve a compromise of pending action, with a proposed settlement amount of $5,000. The court finds the settlement and attorney's fees fair and reasonable, but denies approval due to defects in the petition. Specifically, the court notes that the attorney's fees are 25% of the settlement amount, which is reasonable. However, the court also finds that the expenses listed on Item 17(d) are inconsistent with the amount of $797.68 listed on other forms. The court presumes this error to be an inadvertent mistake and orders the petitioner to cure the defects by filing a new petition at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.
