And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition to approve a compromise of a pending action of a minor, Jayden Vargas. The petition was filed on December 14, 2023, and the hearing is scheduled for January 18, 2024. The judge excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, and allows counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call. The settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and defendants is for a total amount of $13,000, with $2,500 going to Jayden Vargas. The judge finds the settlement and attorney's fees fair and reasonable. However, the petition is denied due to the petitioner's failure to mark Item 10, which is necessary to affirm that if the compromise is approved, the claimant will not be able to recover any more compensation from the settling defendants. The petitioner must file a new petition curing the defects and give notice at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.
