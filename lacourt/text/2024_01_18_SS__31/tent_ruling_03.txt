 Case Number:  21STCV33822    Hearing Date:   January 18, 2024    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  01/18/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  21STCV33822 ERNEST HILL vs LITCO ENTERTAINMENT INC., et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  LITCO ENTERTAINMENT INC. RECOMMENDATION:  DENY for reasons stated below.  TENTATIVE  This is Plaintiff’s third request for default judgment. The request for default judgment submitted on December 11, 2023 is DENIED for the following reasons:  After the last denial on September 18, 2023, Plaintiff has since dismissed Defendant Tishbee’s LLC. However, Plaintiff still has not dismissed Doe Defendants 1-50. (CRC 3.1800(a)(7).)   A proposed judgment on form JUD-100 is required per CRC 3.1800(a)(6). No proposed judgment was filed in connection with this request for default judgment. Plaintiff must use JUD-100 [Rev. January 1, 2024].  Plaintiff uses an outdated CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2020]. On the next request for default judgment, the Court requests Plaintiff use the current form CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2023].  Plaintiff failed to file a declaration under penalty of perjury with admissible evidence in support of amount of damages sought, as required per CRC 3.1800(a)(2). A defaulting defendant admits only the well pled facts concerning liability, not damages. Plaintiff must still introduce admissible prima facie evidence of damages. (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361.) The supporting evidence must be authenticated.  Lastly, the Court notes that a default package must be complete in itself to include the request for default judgment, proposed judgment, and declaration with supporting evidence. The Court will not consider piecemeal filings of a prior declaration or a prior proposed judgment that were filed in connection with requests previously denied.   Further, this is the third time that the Court has identified the same defect of the requirement to dismiss all parties against whom judgment is not sought, which Plaintiff, through counsel, has failed to correct. Plaintiff’s counsel has failed to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed for failure to comply with the Court’s prior orders and for failure to prosecute. Accordingly, the Court hereby imposes against Plaintiff’s counsel monetary sanctions of $250 payable within 30 days.  No later than ____________, Plaintiff is to submit a new complete default judgment package correcting these defects. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to ______________.
