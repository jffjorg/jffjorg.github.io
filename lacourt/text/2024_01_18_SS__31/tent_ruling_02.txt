If the settlement is approved, $1,250 for attorneys’ fees and $797.68 will be used for costs. The net balance of $2,952.32 will be deposited into a blocked account.  The Court reviews the settlement and finds it fair and reasonable.¿The Court also finds the attorney’s fees fair and reasonable, in that it amounts to 25% of Claimant’s settlement.   However, Petitioner’s counsel did not sign page 7 of MC-350EX.   Further, the expenses listed on Item 17(d) in the amount of $767.68 is inconsistent with the amount of $797.68 provided in Items 14(b) and 15(b)(2). Because the net balance of Claimant’s proceed is $2,952.32, the Court presumes this as an inadvertent error and Petitioner intended to input $797.68 on Item 17(d).   Petitioner must reserve a new date and file a new petition curing the above-noted defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
