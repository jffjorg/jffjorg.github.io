And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petitions to approve the compromise of pending actions of minors and finds them fair and reasonable. The parties have agreed to settle their claims against the defendants, with $35,000 being apportioned to each of Iris Thompson, James Thompson, and Amanda Duarte, and $15,000 to Rodolfo Duarte Jr. The court finds that the settlement amounts and attorney's fees are reasonable. The court grants the petitions and sets an OSC Re Proof of Deposit hearing. The court also excuses the personal appearance of the claimants and the guardian ad litem, and allows counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call.
