And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's third request for default judgment against Litco Entertainment Inc. and others. The plaintiff failed to dismiss Doe Defendants 1-50, as required by California law. Additionally, the plaintiff used an outdated form (CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2020]) instead of the current form (CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2023]). The plaintiff also failed to file a declaration with admissible evidence in support of the amount of damages sought. The judge notes that a default package must be complete and include the request for default judgment, proposed judgment, and declaration with supporting evidence. The judge imposes monetary sanctions of $250 on the plaintiff's counsel for failure to comply with the court's prior orders and for failure to prosecute the case. The plaintiff is required to submit a new complete default judgment package correcting these defects, and failure to do so may result in further sanctions or dismissal.
