And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by Defendant Tanaka, arguing that the Plaintiff's Complaint fails to state facts sufficient to support any cause of action. The Judge sustains the demurrer, giving the Plaintiff 30 days to amend the Complaint. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has not properly pled a contract, failing to specify whether the contract was written, oral, or implied by conduct. Additionally, the Plaintiff has not alleged all the terms of the contract, making it unclear what Defendant Tanaka was to receive in return for running the company, how the transition was to occur, or what was to happen afterwards.
