```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's motion for terminating, issue, evidentiary, or monetary sanctions against the plaintiffs. The defendant had sought sanctions due to the plaintiffs' failure to permit an inspection of their property as ordered by the court. The judge finds that the plaintiffs' failure to comply with the court's discovery orders is not a sufficient reason to impose sanctions, but instead suggests that the defendant's proper remedy is to file a motion in limine to exclude certain evidence or request certain jury instructions. The judge acknowledges that divorce proceedings can be difficult, but notes that they have no legal precedence over the court's proceedings. The judge also notes that the plaintiffs' failure to comply with the court's orders is not an excuse, but rather a circumstance that will be addressed at trial.
