Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied both motions to seal records submitted by the tenant. The court does not see how the identified portions of the Memorandum and Declaration submitted in support of the motions contain any proprietary or commercially sensitive information. While the exhibits to the Declaration may contain information of marginal commercial use, it is not sufficiently sensitive or proprietary to override the public's right of access to court records. The court cannot grant a sealing order without specific identification of what is to be sealed.
