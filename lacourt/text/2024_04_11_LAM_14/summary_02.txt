Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to seal certain documents and exhibits submitted by the Tenant. The judge does not believe that the identified portions of the Memorandum contain any proprietary or commercially sensitive information that would justify sealing them. Additionally, the judge notes that the motion does not specifically identify what portions of the deposition transcripts are to be sealed, which is necessary for the court to grant a sealing order.
