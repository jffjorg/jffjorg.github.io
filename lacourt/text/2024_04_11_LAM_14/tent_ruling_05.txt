 Case Number:  23STCV28694    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  14 Hozumi v. TanakaCase Background   Plaintiff alleges that he agreed to  invest money in a camping business which Defendants were to run, but only until  Plaintiff received a work visa in the United States. Plaintiff claims that  Defendants refused to provide financial records when he arrived to take over  the business.   On November 27, 2023, Plaintiff  filed his Complaint for (1) Breach of Contract and (2) Accounting against  Defendants Tanaka’s Camp, LLC (“Camp”), Ayu Tanaka (“Tanaka”), and DOES 1-10.               No trial  date has yet been set.   Instant Pleading               Defendant Tanaka  now demurs to the Complaint on the grounds that it fails to state facts  sufficient to support any cause of action.   Decision               The demurrer  is SUSTAINED, with 30 days leave to amend.    Discussion               Plaintiff has not properly pled a contract. Plaintiff does  not clearly allege whether the contract was written, oral, or implied by  conduct. See Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. (1985)  166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458-459 (implicitly overruled on other grounds as  recognized by Miles v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th  394, 401-402). More importantly, Plaintiff does not allege all the terms of the  contract. The complaint does not say what Defendant Tanaka was to get in return  for running this company, or how the transition was to occur, or what was to  happen afterwards.                Because  Plaintiff has not properly pled the contractual relationship, Plaintiff has  failed to properly plead the basis for an accounting.
