Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a complaint filed by Jennifer Monzell Pryer against Hyundai Motor America and South Bay Hyundai, LLC. The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to provide a warranty on a 2023 Hyundai Sonata, which was purchased in California. The defendants have filed a motion to compel arbitration, which the judge has granted.

The judge found that the arbitration provision in the warranty and Connected Services Agreement exists and is enforceable. The provision requires that any disputes arising from the purchase or use of the vehicle be resolved through binding arbitration. The judge also found that the scope of the arbitration provision covers the plaintiff's claims, including those related to the vehicle's warranty and repair issues.

The judge rejected the plaintiff's arguments that the arbitration provision is unconscionable because it was an adhesion contract and that it deprived her of a right to a jury trial. The judge found that the provision is not unfair or oppressive and that the plaintiff had the ability to opt out of the arbitration clause.

The judge ordered that the motion to compel arbitration be granted and that the defendant give notice of the ruling.
