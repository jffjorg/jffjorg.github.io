 RULING
The motion is DENIED.  There is no proof of service of the motion.
BACKGROUND
On February 27, 2024, plaintiff
Andy Martin filed a complaint against defendants Sylvia McArthur and Douglas
McArthur as trustees of the Sylvia McArthur Trust of 1989 for (1) violation of
Civil Code §51 and (2) violation of Civil Code §§54 and 54.1.  The complaint alleges that plaintiff is a
paraplegic, cannot walk, and uses a wheelchair. 
Defendants are the owners and lessors of the property at 405 W. Arbor
Vitae Street, Inglewood, which is a sports cards and memorabilia shop.  On December 12, 2023, plaintiff went to the
sports card and memorabilia shop. While patronizing the public accommodation,
plaintiff encountered an architectural barrier within the facility in the form
of a front step, which precluded him from entering the business.  
On May 1, 2024, defendants
(self-represented) filed an answer.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
If a party to whom interrogatories
are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction.  CCP §2030.290(b).  The statute contains no time limit for a
motion to compel where no responses have been served.  All that need be shown in the moving papers
is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party,
that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been
served.  Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905-906. 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
Andy Martin requests that the Court compel defendants to respond to Form
Interrogatories, Set One and Special Interrogatories, Set One.
            Plaintiff explains that on June 7,
20234, plaintiff’s counsel served written discovery requests.  Responses were due by July 11, 2024.  On August 12, 2024, plaintiff’s counsel sent
a meet and confer response but did not receive a response.  To date, plaintiff’s counsel has not received
responses.
            There is no opposition. 
            There is also no proof of service of
the motion.
            Accordingly, the motion is DENIED. 
 
ORDER
The motion is DENIED. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
