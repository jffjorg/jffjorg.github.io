And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motions for terminating sanctions, issue sanctions, or monetary sanctions against the plaintiff. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff had failed to comply with the court's orders to serve further responses and produce responsive documents, and that the plaintiff had not paid monetary sanctions. The plaintiff had argued that the defendant's claims were meritless, that the plaintiff's responses had been remedied, and that the plaintiff's current counsel was unaware of the outstanding court order and monetary sanctions due to staff changes at the law firm. The judge found that the plaintiff had not engaged in conduct that was a misuse of the discovery process, and therefore denied the motions.
