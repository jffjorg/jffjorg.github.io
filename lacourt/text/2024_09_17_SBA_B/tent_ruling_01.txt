LEGAL AUTHORITY
If a party fails to comply with a
court order compelling discovery responses or attendance at a deposition, the
court may impose monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions.  CCP § 2025.450(h) (depositions); §
2030.290(c) (interrogatories); § 2031.300(c) (demands for production of
documents).  CCP § 2023.030 provides
that, “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method . . . , the court, after notice to any affected party, person,
or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose . . .  [monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating]
sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery
process . . . .”  CCP § 2023.010 provides
that “[m]isuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the
following: . . . (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery. . . . (g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery. . . .”
“The trial court may order a
terminating sanction for discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the
circumstances:  [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding
party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’”  Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390 (citation
omitted).  “Generally, ‘[a] decision to
order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.  But where a violation is willful, preceded by
a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.’”  Los Defensores, 223 Cal. App. 4th at 390
(citation omitted).
“The discovery statutes evince an
incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.  ‘Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to
the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.’ . . . [C]ontinuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.”  Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009)
174 Cal. App. 4th 967, 992 (citation omitted). 
“’A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.  But where a violation is willful, preceded by
a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.’”  Id.
(citation omitted).  “A trial court has
broad discretion to impose discovery sanctions, but two facts are generally a
prerequisite to the imposition of nonmonetary sanctions . . . :  (1) . . . there must be a failure to comply
with a court order, and (2) the failure must be willful.”  Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124
Cal. App. 4th 1315, 1327 (citation omitted).  
A trial court’s order to impose
terminating sanctions will be reversed only if it “was arbitrary, capricious,
or whimsical.”  Creed-21 v. City of
Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal. App. 5th 690, 702 (citation omitted). 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Driftwood Healthcare
Center, LLC dba Driftwood Healthcare Center requests an order for terminating
sanctions or, in the alternative, for issue sanctions or, in the alternative,
for monetary sanctions against plaintiff.
As stated above, on July 3, 2024,
the Court granted defendant’s motion to compel further responses to form
interrogatories, set one, nos. 2.2, 2.12, 2.13, 4.1, 6.3-6.7, 8.4, 12.1, 14.1,
14.2, and 17.1, regarding requests for admissions, nos. 1-11 and 13.34. and to
respond to no. 6.2 and to pay sanctions. 
On July 10, 2024, the Court granted defendant’s motion to compel further
responses to special interrogatories, set one, nos. 1-8, 10, and 12-30 and
demand for production of documents, set one, nos. 1-5, 7-8, 10-18, 21-22, 24,
27-29, and 31-47 and to pay sanctions.
Defendant asserts that on July 30,
2024, plaintiff served her second supplemental responses and second
supplemental document production, consisting of 5614 pages.  On August 6, 2024, defense counsel sent meet
and confer correspondence to plaintiff’s counsel seeking code-compliant
responses by August 13, 2024.  On August
13, 2024, defense counsel granted plaintiff a one-week extension to provide
supplemental responses to discovery with an extension to file motions to
compel.  On August 30, 2024, plaintiff served
her third supplemental responses and third supplemental document production.
Defendant argues that plaintiff has
failed to comply with the Court’s orders by failing to respond “with
particularity, providing incomplete and incomprehensible responses” as to
special interrogatories, set one, nos. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, and 18-23 and
demand for production of documents, nos. 1-3, 7, 8, 10-18, and 24 and
production of documents, which, defendant asserts, only partially complies with
CCP §2031.280.  Defendant also contends that
plaintiff has not paid the monetary sanctions.
The Court notes that a court may
not issue a terminating sanction for failure to pay a monetary discovery
sanction.  Newland v. Superior Court
(1995) 40 Cal. App. 4th 608, 610, 615.
In opposition, plaintiff argues
that sanctions are not warranted because defendant’s arguments have no merit,
plaintiff’s alleged discovery “failures” have been remedied, were inadvertent,
and were not prejudicial.  Plaintiff
asserts that in a further effort to comply with the Court’s order, on September
4, 2024, plaintiff served her fourth supplemental responses to correct any
alleged deficiency.  Plaintiff explains
that the associate assigned to the case left the firm on August 23, 2024 and
that the paralegal assigned to the associate “unexpectedly took leave.”  As a result, plaintiff contends, plaintiff’s
current counsel and the firm was unaware of the outstanding court order and
monetary sanctions. 
In reply, defendant argues that
plaintiff’s fourth supplemental responses are not code-compliant.
The Court rules as follows:  The Court finds that plaintiff has not engaged
in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process because plaintiff did not
willfully fail to comply with the Court’s July 3 and July 10 orders to serve
further responses and to produce responsive documents.
The motions are DENIED.
