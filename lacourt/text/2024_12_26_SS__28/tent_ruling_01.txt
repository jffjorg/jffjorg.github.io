Defendant
asks the Court for leave to conduct Plaintiff’s neuropsychological examination
with clinical psychologist J. Vincent Filoteo, Ph.D., on January 13, 2025
starting at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time and lasting approximately 6-7 hours (not including

certified Spanish interpreter being used for the clinical interview portion
that will last from approximately 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. and with Dr. Filoteo’s

LEGAL STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310 provides: 
“(a) If any party desires to obtain discovery by a
physical examination other than that described in Article 2 (commencing with
Section 2032.210), or by a mental examination, the party shall obtain leave of
court. 
“(b) A motion for an examination under subdivision (a)
shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the
examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any, of the person
or persons who will perform the examination. The motion shall be accompanied by
a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(c) Notice of the motion shall be served on the
person to be examined and on all parties who have appeared in the action.” 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2032.310.) 
          Code of
Civil Procedure section 2032.320 provides in part: 
“(a) The
court shall grant a motion for a physical or mental examination under Section
2032.310 only for good cause shown. 
* * *
 “(d) An order
granting a physical or mental examination shall specify the person or persons
who may perform the examination, as well as the time, place, manner, diagnostic tests and procedures, conditions,
scope, and nature of the examination.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320, subds. (a), (d).) 

DISCUSSION 
In
his complaint, Plaintiff alleges that on or about June 20, 2021, on the 405
freeway, Defendants negligently entrusted, managed, maintained, drove, and
operated their vehicle, causing it to collide with Plaintiff’s vehicle, injuring Plaintiff. 
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff has put his mental condition at issue by asserting that, as
a result of the accident, he experienced depression, anxiety, traumatic brain
injury, post-concussion syndrome, cognitive issues, and/or memory issues, for
which he received treatment and seeks compensation.  In addition, Defendant has complied with the statutory
requirements for a motion for leave to conduct a mental examination. 
In his
late opposition, Plaintiff argues that (1) Defendant failed to meet and confer
before filing the motion and (2) Defendant was required to attend an Informal
Discovery Conference before the hearing on the motion.  Neither assertion is correct.  (See Defendant’s counsel’s declarations
supporting Defendant’s motion and notice of non-opposition; Eighth Amended
Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts ¶ 9.E.) The Court finds good cause and grants Defendant's motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Christian Barragan’s motion for leave to conduct
Plaintiff Carlos Navarro’s neuropsychological examination with clinical
