PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to compel Defendant’s responses to demand for production of
documents, set one, and to impose sanctions on Defendant. 
Defendant
asks the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
        “If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response to it, the following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
DISCUSSION 
On July 29, 2024, Plaintiff served demand for production
of documents, set one, on Defendant.   Defendant did not serve timely responses and
had not served responses by the time Plaintiff filed this motion on October 31,
2024. 
Defendant opposes the motion, stating (1) Defendant’s
counsel could not locate Defendant, (2) after making diligent efforts to locate
Defendant, Defendant’s counsel contacted Defendant on December 9, 2024, and (3)
on December 10, 2024, Defendant served verified responses to the demand for
production of documents.  However,
Defendant has not included copies of the responses in her opposition. 
Plaintiff argues that, even though Defendant waived
any objections to the demand for production of documents by failing to serve
timely responses, Defendant’s late responses contain objections.  Plaintiff asks the Court to compel Defendant
to provide responses to the demand for production of documents without
objections. 
If a party fails to serve a timely response to a
demand for production of documents, then under Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.300, subdivision (a), the party waives all objections and the burden
shifts to that party to demonstrate that it is entitled to relief from the
waiver.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a); cf. Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 407 (Sinaiko)
[discussing interrogatories].) 
The Court concludes that, under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.300, once a party has failed to serve timely responses
to a demand for production of documents, the Court has the authority to
hear a propounding party’s motion to compel responses under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.300, subdivision (b), even if the other party serves an untimely
response.  (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); cf. Sinaiko, supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at p. 408.)  If a party
fails to serve a timely response to a demand for production, then, by operation
of law, all objections that it could assert to the demand for production are
waived.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a); cf. Sinaiko, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p.
408.)  Unless that party obtains relief
from the waiver, the propounding party is entitled to move under subdivision
(b) for an order compelling the response to which the propounding party is
entitled – that is, a response without objection, and that substantially
complies with the provisions governing the form and completeness of responses
to demands for production of documents. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subds. (a), (b); cf. Sinaiko, supra,
148 Cal.App.4th at p. 408.) 
 Based on the reasoning of Sinaiko, the Court
grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant's objection-free responses to demand for production of
documents, set one.  The Court orders
Defendant to serve code-compliant verified responses without
objections by January 28, 2025 and to produce the documents, electronically
stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by January
28, 2025. 
Plaintiff requests sanctions based on the motion to
compel Defendant’s responses to the demand for production of documents.  Defendant asks the Court to refrain from imposing
sanctions because Defendant’s counsel acted diligently to locate her. 
The Court finds that Defendant did not act with
substantial justification and no other circumstances make the imposition of
sanctions unjust. Defendant was aware of the litigation and chose to avoid
contact with her counsel.  In addition,
Defendant's counsel should have known that Defendant had waived any objections
to the demand for production of documents.  Defendant's counsel nonetheless included
objections in Defendant’s late discovery responses. 
Plaintiff requests $1,050.00 in sanctions based on
three hours of attorney time at a rate of $350.00 per hour. Counsel spent one
hour preparing the moving papers and anticipated spending one hour to review
the opposition papers and prepare a reply and one hour to prepare for and
attend the hearing. The Court grants Plaintiff $375.00 in sanctions based on 1.5
hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff Syed Sobhan’s motion to compel Defendant
Mabel Ma’s responses to demand for production of documents, set one.  The Court orders Defendant Mabel Ma to serve
code-compliant verified responses without objections by January 28, 2025 and to
produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things
requested without objections by January 28, 2025. 
The Court
GRANTS in part Plaintiff Syed Sobhan’s request for sanctions and orders
Defendant Mabel Ma and her counsel to pay Plaintiff Syed Sobhan $375.00 by
January 28, 2025.  In all other respects,
the Court DENIES the sanctions request. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
