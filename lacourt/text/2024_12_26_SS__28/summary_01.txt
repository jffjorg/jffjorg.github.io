And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the defendant, Christian Barragan, to conduct a neuropsychological examination of the plaintiff, Carlos Navarro. The examination is sought to evaluate the plaintiff's mental condition, which he has alleged was affected by an accident on June 20, 2021. The defendant has argued that the plaintiff has put his mental condition at issue and that the examination is necessary to determine the extent of the plaintiff's injuries. The plaintiff has opposed the motion, arguing that the defendant failed to meet and confer before filing the motion and that the defendant was required to attend an Informal Discovery Conference before the hearing on the motion. However, the judge has found that the defendant has complied with the statutory requirements for the motion and has granted the motion. The judge has ordered that the examination take place on January 13, 2025, and has specified the tests that will be administered.
