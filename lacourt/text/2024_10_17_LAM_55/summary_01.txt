Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to strike the request for punitive damages from the complaint. The defendants, The Claremont Colleges, Inc., Claremont McKenna College, and Claremont McKenna College Holdings, LLC, argued that the complaint does not properly plead punitive damages against them. The plaintiff, Carmen Gonzalez, alleged that the defendants authorized or ratified the actions of Dakota Chimeng Yang, who allegedly drove a vehicle under the influence of drugs and alcohol, knowing that oncoming traffic had the right of way, made a left turn against a solid green or red light, and failed to yield to the plaintiff.

The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to support an award of punitive damages against the defendants. The judge noted that the complaint alleges that the defendants' corporate officer, director, or managing agent authorized or ratified Yang's decision to operate a vehicle under the influence, and that this is sufficient to plead punitive damages against the corporate defendants. The judge denied the defendants' motion to strike, allowing the plaintiff to proceed with her claim for punitive damages.
