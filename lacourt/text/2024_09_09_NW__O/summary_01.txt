And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motions to compel defendant David Guest's responses to requests for production, form interrogatories, and special interrogatories. The plaintiff had previously filed these motions on June 10, 2024, June 14, 2024, and July 26, 2024, and Guest had failed to respond to them. The judge finds that Guest has failed to provide any responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests and that he has not provided a valid excuse for his failure to do so. The judge orders Guest to serve code-compliant responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests on or before September 30, 2024.

The judge also grants the plaintiff's motion for an order deeming the truth of matters specified in the plaintiff's requests for admissions as admitted. This means that the plaintiff will be entitled to assume the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admissions, unless Guest provides a response that contradicts them.

Finally, the judge awards the plaintiff discovery sanctions in the amount of $1,560.00. The judge finds that Guest's failure to respond to the plaintiff's discovery requests was due to his client's failure to provide a valid excuse for his failure to respond. The judge orders Guest to pay the plaintiff's counsel the amount of $1,560.00 on or before October 31, 2024.
