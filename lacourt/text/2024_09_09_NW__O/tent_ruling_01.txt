I.              
BACKGROUND 
This case
arises out of a commercial lease agreement dispute between Plaintiff Tomo JD,
LLC (“Plaintiff”) and Defendants David Guest (“Guest”) and John Halloran
(“Halloran”)(collectively, “Defendants”). Plaintiff alleges Defendants entered
into a three-year lease agreement, commencing on September 1, 2018, for the
property located at 300 Westminster Ave., Venice CA 90291 (“Premises”). (See
Complaint, ¶¶ 4, 7.) Plaintiff further alleges Defendants stopped paying
their rent on April 1, 2020, and abandoned the Premises on July 10, 2021. (See
id. at ¶¶ 17-18.)
Halloran
defaulted on October 24, 2023. 
Plaintiff now
seeks to compel Guest’s discovery responses. 
II.

Defendant, David Guest (“Motion RFAs”).
On August 26, 2024, Guest filed his
Opposition. 
On August 27, 2024, Plaintiff filed its
Reply. 
III.        
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.            
Request for Production
 A party upon whom a demand for the production
of documents has been made has 30 days after service of the demand to respond.
(See Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.260(a).)[1] The
propounding and responding parties may agree to extend the time for response. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.270(a).) When a party fails to serve a timely
response, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a motion to compel
response. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(b).) A responding party that
does not provide responses waives the right to object to the demand, including
objections based on privilege or work product. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.300(a).) 
B.            
Interrogatories 
If a party to whom interrogatories are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (See Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to
compel where no responses have been served. All that need be shown in the
moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the
opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of
any kind has been served. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111
Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)    
C.            
Requests for Admission
“Any party may obtain discovery . . .
by a written request that any other party to the action admit the genuineness
of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact, opinion
relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for admission may
relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2033.010.) “Within 30 days after service of requests for admission, the
party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original of the
response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on all
other parties who have appeared…” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.250(a).)
If a party to whom request for
admissions are served fails to provide a timely response, the party to whom the
request was directed waives any objections, including based on privilege or the
work product doctrine. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(a).) The
requesting party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as
well as for monetary sanctions. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(b).) The
court shall issue this order unless the party to whom the request was made serves
a response in substantial compliance prior to the hearing on the motion. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).)    
IV.         
ANALYSIS
Four motions
are presently before the Court. The ruling will first address Plaintiff’s Motion
RFPs. The Court will next address Plaintiff’s Motion Form Interrogatories and
Motion Special Interrogatories. The Court will address Plaintiff’s Motion RFAs
last. 
A.            
Plaintiff’s Motion RFPs is Granted.
On February 29,
2024, Plaintiff served its Requests for Production, Set One (“RFPs”), on Guest.
(See Motion RFPs, pg. 1.) Despite multiple extensions and promises to serve
responses without objections, Plaintiff’s counsel declares he has not received
any responses to Plaintiff’s RFPs [the Court notes Plaintiff refers to “Special
Interrogatories” in its declaration it attached to its Motion RFPs. The Court
believes this to be in error based on the substance of the Motion RFPs and
Exhibits]. (See RFPs Declaration of Philip Landsman filed July 26, 2024,
¶¶ 10-21.)
In opposition,
Guest filed his “Partial Opposition” in which he stated “Defendant will be
providing actual responses to the Requests for Admission before the Hearing
Date of September 9, 2024 and will be providing Responses to the Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production by
October 1, 2024. Defendant and his Wife have recently given birth to their
first child and Defendant's ability to fully participate in the discovery
responses has been compromised.” (See Opposition, pp. 1-2.)
In reply,
Plaintiff argues Guest has been using the “recent birth” excuse since at least
May 2024 and requests Guest be ordered to respond by September 12, 2024. (See
Reply, pp. 2-3.) Plaintiff also says he has attached the email proof of
Guest’s excuses but didn’t actually attach anything to his motion or separately
filed declaration.
The Court
finds Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling Guest’s responses to its
RFPs.  
Accordingly, the
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion RFPs and orders Guest to serve code compliant
responses without objection to Plaintiff’s RFPs on or before September 30, 2024.
B.            
Plaintiff’s Motion Form Interrogatories
and Motion Special Interrogatories are Granted. 
On February 29,
2024, Plaintiff served its Form and Special Interrogatories on Guest. (See Motion
Form Interrogatories, pg. 3; see also Motion Special Interrogatories,
pg. 3.) As discussed above, Plaintiff’s counsel declares he has not received
any responses to Plaintiff’s Form or Special Interrogatories. (See Declaration
of Philip Landsman filed June 10, 2024, ¶¶ 10-21; see Declaration of
Philip Landsman filed June 14, 2024, ¶¶ 10-21.)
Guest’s Opposition
and Plaintiff’s Reply, also discussed above, are applicable to each of
Plaintiff’s discovery motions. 
For the same
reasons the Court relied upon in granting Plaintiff’s Motion RFPs, the Court also
finds Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling Guest’s responses to its
Form and Special Interrogatories.  
Accordingly, the
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion Form Interrogatories and Motion Special Interrogatories
and orders Guest to serve code compliant responses without objection to
Plaintiff’s Form and Special Interrogatories on or before September 30, 2024.
C.            
Plaintiff’s Motion RFAs is Granted. 
On February
29, 2024, Plaintiff served its Requests for Admission, Set One (“RFAs), on
Guest. (See Motion RFAs, pg. 3.) As discussed above, Plaintiff’s counsel
declares he has not received any responses to Plaintiff’s RFAs. (See RFAs
Declaration of Philip Landsman filed July 26, 2024, ¶¶ 10-21.)
Guest’s
Opposition and Plaintiff’s Reply, also discussed above, are applicable to each
of Plaintiff’s discovery motions. 
For the same reasons expressed above, the Court finds Plaintiff is
entitled to an order deeming the truth of matters admitted in Plaintiff’s RFAs.

Accordingly, the
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion RFAs and deems the RFAs admitted.
V.            
SANCTIONS 
“The court
shall impose a monetary sanction¿. . .¿against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel¿. . .” responses to
interrogatories or production demands, absent substantial justification or
other circumstances that make imposing the sanctions unjust.¿(Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(c).) The court shall also impose a “monetary
sanction…on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely
response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).) Similarly,¿“[t]he court
may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery
process includes “[f]ailing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery,” and “[d]isobeying¿a court order to provide discovery.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2023.010(d),
(g).) 
Plaintiff
seeks $980.00 in discovery sanctions for each of its four motions, accounting
for 1.0 hour of collective meet and confer efforts, 1.2 hours to prepare and
file each motion, 0.9 hour to prepare for and attend the hearing on the motions
(2.3 total hours per motion), and the $60.00 filing fee. Plaintiff’s counsel
bills at $400.00 an hour. In total, Plaintiff seeks $3,920.00 in discovery
sanctions. 
The Court
finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate of $400 reasonable given the prevailing
rates in the Greater Los Angeles Area for attorneys with his level of
experience. However, given the similarity of each motion and the efficiency
with which this Court expects an attorney of Plaintiff’s counsel’s experience
should work, the Court finds it appropriate to reduce the discovery sanctions
award to $1,560.00, accounting for 1.0 hour of meet and confer efforts, 1.4
hours to prepare all four motions, 0.9 hour to prepare for and attend the
hearing (3.3 hours x $400.00/hr = $1,320.00), and the $60.00 per motion filing
fee ($60.00 x 4 = $240.00, $240.00 + $1,320.00 = $1,560.00). 
Since Guest’s
failure to timely respond is more likely client driven than counsel driven, the
Court orders Guest to pay Plaintiff’s counsel discovery sanctions in the amount
of $1,560.00 on or before October 31, 2024. 
VI.         
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion
to Compel Defendant David Guest’s Responses to Requests for Production,
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Responses to Special Interrogatories, and
its Motion for Order That Genuineness of Documents and Truth of Matters
Specified in Plaintiff's Request for Admissions Be Deemed Admitted.
As a result,
the Court orders Guest to serve Plaintiff code compliant responses without
objection to Plaintiff’s RFPs, Form Interrogatories, and Special Interrogatories
on or before September 30, 2024.
The Court
also GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for discovery sanctions in the amount of $1,560.00.
Guest shall pay Plaintiff’s counsel discovery sanctions in the amount of $1,560.00
on or before October 31, 2024. 
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
DATED:      September 6, 2024
