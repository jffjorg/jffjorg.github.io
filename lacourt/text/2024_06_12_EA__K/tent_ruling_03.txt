written agreement, wherein CRB agreed to loan money to Defendant in exchange
for Defendant’s repayment. After the loan funds were disbursed to Defendant,
Defendant’s account was transferred to Upgrade, Inc. (“Upgrade”), who in turn
transferred Defendant’s loan to Plaintiff. Defendant subsequently failed to
repay the loan.
