And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, Santander Bank, N.A., had sought to obtain a default judgment against the defendant, Clifford Glassman, for breach of contract and money lent, paid, or expended. However, the judge has noted several defects in the plaintiff's application, including a lack of documentation regarding the assignment of the loan from CRB to Upgrade, Inc. and from Upgrade, Inc. to the plaintiff. The judge has requested that the plaintiff provide the court with a copy of the loan agreements in question.
