(“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for:

2.

A Case Management Conference is set
for June 12, 2024.
Discussion
Windsor Troy (“Firm”) seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff (“Client”).
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See
Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.)
California
Rules of Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion
directed to the client (made on the Notice
of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under section
284(1) (made on the Declaration in
Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and
the proposed order on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in
the case; and (4) a proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). The court may delay the effective
date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the
signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
Attorney Roberto Dominguez (“Dominguez”) represents that “[t]here has
been a breakdown of the Attorney-Client Relationship,” that “[i]rreconcilable
differences have arisen” between them “that make it impossible for
representation to continue,” and that he is “unable to communicate with the
Plaintiff in a manner consistent with an attorney-client relationship.”
Dominguez states that he has served the Client by mail at the Client’s
last known address with copies of the motion papers served with this
declaration. Dominguez, however, has failed to complete Paragraph 3.b. of
Judicial Council Form MC-052 (i.e., advising whether or not he has confirmed
within the past 30 days that the Client’s address is current and, if so, by
what means and, if not, why he was unable to make such confirmation).
Accordingly, the court will continue the hearing on the motion, to July
12, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. Dominguez (or another attorney at Firm) is instructed to
file and serve a supplemental declaration on the Client and on counsel for
Winco providing the information requested in Paragraph 3.b. of Judicial Council
Form MC-052 forthwith.
Firm is to provide notice.
