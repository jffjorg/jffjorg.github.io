  Case Number:  20STCV42908    Hearing Date:   March 7, 2024    Dept:  30 MITCHELL JAYSON vs RAE DRAZINTENTATIVEDefendant’s motions to compel responses to supplemental interrogatories (set two), and supplemental request for production of documents (set two) are GRANTED.Plaintiff Mitchell Jayson is ordered to serve verified responses, without objections, to the discovery at issue within 20 days of this order.Defendant’s request for sanctions is DENIED.Moving party is ordered to give notice.DiscussionOn November 3, 2023, Defendant served Supplemental Interrogatories, Set Two, and Supplemental Request for Production of Documents, Set Two, on Plaintiff. (Christensen Decl., Exh. A.) To date, Plaintiff has failed to provide responses. (Id., ¶ 7.)As Defendant properly served requests for supplemental interrogatories and supplemental request for production and Plaintiff failed to serve responses, the Court finds Defendant is entitled to a court order directing Plaintiff to provide verified responses without objections to the supplemental discovery served on Plaintiff. Therefore, the motions are granted.Defendant also requests sanctions. Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290(c) and 2031.310 mandate the imposition of sanctions when the motion is unsuccessfully opposed. Here, as the motions were not opposed, the request for sanctions is denied.
