And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication as to its cause of action for breach of contract. The plaintiff had filed a motion for summary judgment or alternatively for summary adjudication of its claims against the defendant, Jose Mendoza. The plaintiff argued that there were no triable issues of material fact and that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The defendant opposed the motion, disputing the plaintiff's evidence and claiming that there were triable issues of fact.

The judge found that the plaintiff had met its evidentiary burden for its cause of action for breach of contract, but that the defendant had provided evidence showing that there were triable issues of fact. Therefore, the court denied the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication.
