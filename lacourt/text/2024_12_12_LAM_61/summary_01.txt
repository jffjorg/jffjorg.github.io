And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has denied a motion by the plaintiffs to add Kruse Mennillo LLC as a defendant and to add a new cause of action against Blair Stover. The plaintiffs had originally alleged that Blair Stover's wrongdoing was committed in concert with Kruse Mennillo LLC, but only discovered that Kruse Mennillo LLC concealed tax and accounting documents after Kruse provided responses to a subpoena in February 2024. The judge found that the delay in seeking leave to amend the complaint was unreasonable and that prejudice was likely to result from allowing the introduction of a new defendant. The judge also noted that the trial is set for March 25, 2025, and that allowing the introduction of a new defendant would likely require additional discovery, challenges to the pleadings, and dispositive motions, which would delay the trial. The judge concluded that the motion was denied based on the delay and the likelihood of prejudice, rather than any merit or substance of the proposed amendment.
