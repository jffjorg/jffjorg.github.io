“Plaintiffs”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
            The Court has considered the moving papers.  The motion is unopposed.  
 
BACKGROUND
             This case arises from an alleged breach of an oral
agreement between Plaintiffs and Defendants Jorge Vargas (“Vargas”) and JMG
Logistics, Inc. (“JMG”) (collectively, “Defendants”), whereby Plaintiffs
purportedly provided monies to Defendants for use in the business of JMG, and
in return, Defendants were to repay Plaintiffs their initial investment along
with profits.  On December 10, 2021,
Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended Complaint (the “FAC”) asserting ten
causes of action, including breach of oral agreement.  Defendants filed an answer to the FAC on January
25, 2022.
 
            On October 3, 2023, Moemen served Form Interrogatories, Set Two, on
Vargas, and Requests for Production on Vargas and JMG.  (Declaration of Andrew Ritholz (“Ritholz
Decl.”), ¶ 2, Exhs. A and B.)  Defendants
have not responded to both discovery requests. 
(Id.)  
 
            On January 5, 2024,
Moemen filed a Motion to Compel Discovery Responses (“Motion to Compel”) against
Defendants.  Defendants did not
oppose.  On May 7, 2024, the Court
granted the Motion to Compel ordering Defendants to provide responses within 30
days, and to jointly and severally pay $1,667.50 in sanctions to Moemen within 20
days. 
 
            Moemen states that
Defendants have not provided the required responses.  (Ritholz Decl., ¶ 3.)  Plaintiffs now seek to strike the answer of
Defendants and enter their default by filing the instant Motion to Strike
Answers of Defendants and to Enter Defaults (the “Motion”) on June 10, 2024.
 
DISCUSSION
            Code of Civil Procedure §
2023.030(d) authorizes the Court to impose terminating sanctions due to a
party’s misuse of the discovery process.  “A trial court must be cautious when imposing
a terminating sanction because the sanction eliminates a party’s fundamental
right to trial, thus implicating due process rights.”  (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible and Tract
Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal. App. 4th 566, 604, review denied
(July 27, 2016).)  “A decision to order
terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.  But where a violation is willful, preceded by
a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.”  (Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal. App. 4th 262, 279–80, as modified on
denial of reh’g (May 4, 2005).) “Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to
the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.”  (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.)
 
It
is well established that the primary purpose of discovery sanctions is
curative, not punitive.  (Welgoss v.
End (1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 982, 992; Caryl Richards, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1961) 188 Cal.App.2d 300, 303-304.) 
Generally, the discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to
sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate
sanction of dismissal.  (Doppe, supra.)  “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure [citations], a
terminating sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has
attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the
record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.”  (Lopez, supra.)  A terminating sanction is a draconian remedy,
and it is appropriate only when less severe alternatives will not vindicate the
court’s authority and the purpose of the subject discovery.  (Rail Services of America v. State Com.
Ins. Fund (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 323, 332; New Albertsons, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1423.)
 
The
Court notes that Plaintiffs’ Motion is based on a single incident of
non-compliance with a court order entered on June 10, 2024. At this point,
Defendants have not as much exhibited a history of non-compliance, nor is there
a showing of an attempt at less severe alternatives, which Plaintiffs do not
seek in this motion.  The Court finds
that at this time, Defendants do not present a history of willful violations,
nor an ineffective history of past ineffective and less severe sanctions, and
so the standard has not yet been met for ultimate terminating sanctions.
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike Answers of Defendants and Enter Defaults is DENIED,
without prejudice.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
