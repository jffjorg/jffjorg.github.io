MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff
Escrow of the West (“Plaintiff”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant
VST 2020-NPL1 REO, LLC (“VST”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
            On December 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a complaint in interpleader against VST; Awal Investment, LLC (“Awal”); and
Yona Investment Group, LLC (“Yona”) (collectively, “Defendants”).  This action is related to the escrow
transaction opened for the sale of the property at 9635 Cedarbrook Dr., Beverly
Hills, CA 90212 (the “Property”). 
Plaintiff provided escrow services between VST and Awal, while Yona, a
third party, contributed funds deposited for the purchase of the Property.  Plaintiff holds a total of $63,000.00 as
deposited funds for the purchase of the Property.  The transaction was eventually canceled.  Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants all
claim the right to the funds on deposit with Plaintiff, exposing itself to
multiple claims.
 
            On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed
this Motion for Discharge, Dismissal and Deposit of Funds (the “Motion”), seeking
an order allowing it to deposit disputed funds, to be discharged from further
liability, and to recover attorneys’ fees and costs.  On June 25, 2024, VST opposed, and Plaintiff
replied on June 28, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
             Interpleader is a procedure whereby a person
holding money or personal property to which conflicting claims are being made
by others, can join the adverse claimants and force them to litigate their
claims among themselves.  (For example,
an escrow holder who receives conflicting demands from the parties to the
escrow regarding the funds or documents he or she holds.)  (Hancock Oil Co. v. Hopkins (1944) 24
Cal.2d 497, 508; City of Morgan Hill v. Brown (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th
1114, 1122.)
 
Once
the stakeholder’s right to interplead is established, and he or she deposits
the money or personal property in court, he or she may be discharged from
liability to any of the claimants. This enables the stakeholder to avoid
multiplicity of actions, and the risk of inconsistent results if each of the
claimants were to sue him or her separately. 
(Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corp. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 874; City
of Morgan Hill, supra, 71 Cal.App.4th at 1122.)
 
“An
interpleader action is traditionally viewed as two suits: one between the
stakeholder and the claimants to determine the stakeholder's right to
interplead, and the other among the claimants to determine who shall receive
the funds interpleaded ... As against the stakeholder, claimants may raise only
matters which go to whether the suit is properly one for interpleader; i.e.,
whether the elements of an interpleader action are present.”  (State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Pietak (2001)
90 Cal.App.4th 600, 612.)
 
If
the defendant stakeholder claims no interest in the funds or property held, he
or she need not file an interpleader cross complaint.  He or she may simply apply to the court for
permission to deposit the money or property with the court clerk, and for an
order discharging him or her from further liability to the adverse
claimants.  Such order will also
substitute the adverse claimants as parties to the action; or, if only money is
involved, simply dismiss the stakeholder. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 386(a), 386.5.) 
The motion must be supported by an affidavit by the stakeholder
establishing the ground for interpleader. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 386(a), 386.5.) Notice of the motion must be served
on each of the adverse claimants to the funds or property. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
386(a), 386.5.) (Those who are not parties to the action must be served
personally.) 
 
The
stakeholder may seek reimbursement for his or her costs and reasonable
attorneys’ fees incurred.  (UAP
Columbus JV 326132 v. Nesbitt (1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1028, 1036.)  The court may (discretionary) order payment
thereof out of the funds deposited by the stakeholder. (Ultimately, such
payment may be charged to one or more of the adverse claimants in the final
judgment.)  (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.6.)
 
The Opposition
            In its opposition to the Motion (the
“Opposition”), VST asserts that the Motion should be denied because the escrow
instructions “clearly, specifically, and mutually instructed to immediately
release AWAL’s earnest money deposit to VST…should AWAL fail to timely pay the
purchase price for the real estate transaction between AWAL and VST.”  (Opposition, p. 1, lines 11-14.)  In fact, VST’s position is based upon the
original escrow agreement, executed on April 12 and 14, 2023.  (Opposition, Declaration of Rosty G. Gore,
Exhibit 1, ¶ 6.)  This agreement was,
however, amended and supplemented by the Supplemental Commercial Sale Escrow
Instructions dated May 22, 2023, which provided at paragraph 26 that:
 
MUTUAL
CANCELLATION INSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS:  The
Parties acknowledge that they are on notice that Escrow Holder shall exercise
its discretion to require mutual or matching cancellation instructions
instructing Escrow Holder on how the deposit is to be released, signed by all
Parties and deposited with Escrow Holder prior to releasing any deposit held by
Escrow Holder relative to this escrow transaction. (Declaration of Lauri
Shahar, Exh. B.)
 
As
VSP has not established that AWAL has also instructed Plaintiff to release the
escrowed funds to VSP, the position asserted in the Opposition has no factual
support.


 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
Motion is GRANTED. Relief is proper pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”)
sections 386 and 386.5.  The subject
matter of this action is $63,000.00.  Plaintiff
has no interest in or claim to the funds. 
(Declaration of Lauri Shahar in Support of the Motion (“Shahar Decl.”),
¶ 3.)  Plaintiff asserts that it cannot
determine the validity of the conflicting claims against the funds.  (Compl., ¶¶ 11-15.) Plaintiff has the
discretion to require mutual cancellation instructions prior to the release of
the deposit held by Plaintiff.  (Shahar
Decl., Exh. B, ¶10.)  Since no mutual
instruction was provided to Plaintiff, it has properly sought to interplead the
funds to allow the Court to resolve the dispute.  
 
Upon
deposit of the funds with the Court, Plaintiff shall be discharged from further
liability pursuant to CCP section 386.5.  Plaintiff has provided proper notice to all
interested parties.  Therefore, Plaintiff
is discharged. 
 
Plaintiff
seeks attorney’s fees and costs in the total amount of $5,423.98, stating that Plaintiff
incurred these fees and costs in bringing this action to protect itself from
liability.  (Shahar Decl., ¶¶8-9; Exh.
A.).  These fees and costs are proper pursuant
to CCP section 386.6, and are also authorized by the escrow instructions
executed by the parties (Exh. B to the Shahar Decl.).  As such, Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s
fees is granted in the amount of $5,423.98.


RULING
            Plaintiff’s Motion is GRANTED. 
 
For
good cause shown, relief is proper per CCP sections 386 and 386.5. Plaintiff is
awarded fees and costs in the amount of $5,423.98. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.6)  Plaintiff is to be discharged from liability
and dismissed from the action for interpleader upon deposit of $63,000. The
funds are to be deposited within 10 days. 
 
A
Hearing on Disbursement of Funds is set for August 28, 2024 at 8:30 am.  Each claimant must file a written claim within
30 days of this order; the written claim should include a declaration setting
forth the basis for the claim of ownership or interest.  All claimants must also appear at the disbursement
hearing.  If no appearances are made, the
matter will be set for an OSC re: Escheating Funds. (Code Civ. Proc. § 128;
Govt. Code, § 68084.1.)
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 9th day of July 2024
