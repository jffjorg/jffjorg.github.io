And here is a brief summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion to strike the answer of the defendants and enter their default due to their failure to respond to discovery requests. The Court notes that the defendants have not exhibited a history of non-compliance and that the motion is based on a single incident of non-compliance. The Court finds that the standard has not been met for ultimate terminating sanctions and therefore denies the motion without prejudice. The Court orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling, and parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court as directed by the instructions provided on the court website.
