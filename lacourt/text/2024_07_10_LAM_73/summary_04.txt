Summary:

The Judge, Hon. Rolf Treu, has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to compel arbitration filed by Defendants Darden Restaurants, Inc. and GMRI, Inc. The motion was filed on June 14, 2024, and the case arose out of an employment dispute. The Plaintiff, Tkeyah Campbell, alleged that she experienced racial discrimination and harassment during her employment with Defendants and that her complaints were ignored and she was retaliated against. The dispute revolves around the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement, known as the Dispute Resolution Process (DRP), which was presented to Plaintiff during her on-boarding process. Plaintiff claims that she did not see or review the DRP and did not sign it, while Defendants argue that she acknowledged and agreed to be bound by the DRP. The Court finds that Plaintiff has met her burden of producing evidence challenging the authenticity of the DRP and that Defendants have not met their burden of proving the validity of the DRP.
