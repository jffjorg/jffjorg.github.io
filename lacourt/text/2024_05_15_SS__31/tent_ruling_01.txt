BACKGROUND & PROCEDURAL HISTORY Plaintiff Stephanie De La Rosa (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants Hamza Krofess and Does 1 to 50 for damages arising from a motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff filed amendments to complaint naming Raiser LLC as Doe 1, Raiser-CA LLC as Doe 2, and Raiser – DC LLC as Doe 3. On March 4, 2024, Raiser LLC and Raiser-CA LLC (collectively, “Raiser”) filed a motion to have its request for admissions (“RFAs”), set two, be deemed admitted against Plaintiff. On March 5, 2024, Raiser filed a motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff for failing to serve verified discovery responses in compliance with the Court’s February 21, 2024 Order compelling responses to Raiser’s Request for Admissions (“RFAs”), set one, and Requests for Production of Documents (“RPDs”), set one.  The motion for terminating sanctions was initially set for and heard on April 11, 2024. At that time, the Court deferred imposing terminating sanctions, and continued the motion to May 15, 2024. The Court instructed Plaintiff to complete all outstanding discovery obligations previously ordered within this timeframe, including attending her deposition. (Min. Order, May 15, 2024.) Each party was ordered to file a one-page declaration no later than 5 court days prior to the continued hearing date to detail the status of discovery. (Ibid.) Similarly, the motion to deem RFAs, set two, admitted against Plaintiff was initially set for and heard on May 3, 2024. The Court continued the motion to May 15, 2024 due to the possibility that the motion may be rendered moot based upon the Court’s instructions to Plaintiff at the April 11, 2024 hearing regarding the completion of all outstanding discovery obligations. (Min. Order, May 3, 2024.) On May 8, 2024, Rasier filed a declaration regarding the status of discovery. Raiser provides that Plaintiff has not responded to its RFAs, set two, nor has otherwise opposed the motion to deem RFAs, set two, admitted against her. (Walshok Decl. ¶ 8.) Plaintiff appeared for her deposition on April 29, 2024, and the motion was withdrawn.  To date, no declaration was filed on behalf of Plaintiff.   II. MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS Legal Standard Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030 gives the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a misuse of the discovery process.  A court may impose terminating sanctions by striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering default judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030(d).)  “[T]the trial court has broad discretion in selecting the appropriate sanction, and we must uphold the trial court's determination absent an abuse of discretion.”  (Dept. of Forestry & Fire Protection v. Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 154, 191, overturned on other grounds in Presbyterian Camp & Conference Centers, Inc. v. Superior Court (2021) 12 Cal.5th 493, 516 n. 17.)   A violation of a discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of terminating sanctions.  (Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.)  Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court's orders.  (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796.)    Discussion & Conclusion On February 21, 2024, the Court granted Raiser, LLC’s motion to compel RPDs, set two, and supplemental interrogatories and supplemental RPDs. (Min. Order, Feb. 21, 2024.) The Court also awarded Rasier LLC $480 in monetary sanctions. (Ibid.)  As previously noted, Rasier provides that Plaintiff served responses to the supplemental interrogatories and RPDs. As for the RPDs, set two, Rasier’s declaration regarding the current status of discovery is silent as to whether RPDs, set two, were served. Rasier only provides that no prior monetary sanctions have been paid to date. Thus, the Court surmises that Plaintiff has cured the defect and served responses to Rasier’s RPDs, set two. Because Plaintiff has complied with the February 21, 2024 Order, which serves as the basis for Rasier’s motion for terminating sanctions, the motion is now moot. Even though Plaintiff has not paid monetary sanctions, the failure to pay past monetary sanctions is not a basis for terminating sanctions. (See Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 615 [holding, “a terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary discovery sanction is never justified.”].) Rather, sanctions orders are enforceable as money judgments unless the court orders otherwise. Thus, the remedy to enforce payment of monetary sanctions is to obtain and levy a writ of execution on assets of the debtor. (Ibid.)    Accordingly, Rasier’s motion for terminating sanctions is denied.   III. MOTION TO DEEM REQUEST FOR ADMISSONS ADMITTED Legal Standard Where there has been no timely response to a request for admission under CCP § 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).) The court “shall” grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Discussion & Conclusion Here, Raiser LLC served Plaintiff was its RFAs, set two, on March 7, 2023. As provided in Rasier’s declaration regarding the status of discovery, Plaintiff has failed to provide responses to RFAs, set two, to date. (Walshok Decl. ¶ 8.) Plaintiff has not filed any opposition to the motion nor any declaration. As such, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that responses to the RFAs were served in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220 prior to the hearing. Accordingly, Rasier’s motion is GRANTED: Raiser LLC’s RFAs, set two, is deemed admitted against Plaintiff. (CCP §2033.280(b).)      Monetary Sanctions Where a party fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) Defendant requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,560 for the instant motion against Plaintiff and/or her attorney. The Court will grant monetary sanctions, but not to the extent requested. A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)   Rasier is awarded 1 hour for the motion, and 1 hour to appear at the hearing, at the requested rate of $250 per hour, for a total of $500 as attorney’s fees. Further, Rasier is awarded one motion filing fee of $60, as costs.        Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff and her counsel of record, jointly and severally. Plaintiff and/or Plaintiff’s counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to Rasier, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $560, within twenty (20) days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.   PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 14th day of May 2024      Hon.
