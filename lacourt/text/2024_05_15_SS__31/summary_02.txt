And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants two motions: one to compel Plaintiff Lam to respond to outstanding discovery requests, and one to deem requests for admissions admitted. Plaintiff Lam failed to serve timely responses to discovery requests, which waived any objections to the requests. The court grants the motions, ordering Plaintiff Lam to serve verified responses to discovery requests and deeming the requests for admissions admitted. The ruling also notes that the parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and that failure to submit to the tentative ruling may result in the court taking the motion off calendar or adopting the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
