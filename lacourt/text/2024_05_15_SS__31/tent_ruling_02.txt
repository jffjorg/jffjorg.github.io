MOTIONS TO COMPEL A. Background Defendant Manuel Hernandez (“Hernandez”) propounded set one of form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for production of documents (“RPDs”) on plaintiff Cheuk Ying Lam (“Plaintiff Lam”) on December 20, 2023. Responses were due on or before January 24, 2024. Hernandez’s counsel avers that no responses have been served to date. Hernandez therefore seeks an order compelling Plaintiff Lam to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery.  Plaintiff Lam is in pro per. As of May 2, 2024, the motions are unopposed.   B. Legal Standard For a motion to compel discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §2030.290, §2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); §2031.300, subd. (a).)     C. Discussion & Conclusion Therefore, because the evidence shows Plaintiff Lam was properly served with discovery and failed to timely respond, Hernandez’s motions are GRANTED.  Plaintiff Lam is ordered to serve verified responses to Hernandez’s (1) form interrogatories, set one, (2) special interrogatories, set one, and (2) RPDs, set one, without objections, within thirty (30) days. (CCP § 2030.290 (a),(b); §2031.300 (a),(b).)  II.  MOTION TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED Background Hernandez propounded requests for admissions (“RFAs”), set one, on Plaintiff Lam on December 20, 2023. Responses were due by January 24, 2024. Hernandez avers that Plaintiff Lam has not served responses to date. Hernandez therefore seek an order deeming the RFAs admitted.  The motion, served upon Plaintiff Lam in pro per, is unopposed.   Legal Standard Where there has been no timely response to a request for admission under CCP § 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court “shall” grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Discussion & Conclusion Plaintiff Lam has not filed any opposition to the motion, nor has Plaintiff Lam otherwise demonstrated that a response to the RFAs were served in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. Hernandez’s motion is therefore GRANTED.  Accordingly, Hernandez’s RFAs, set one, is deemed admitted against Plaintiff Lam. (CCP §2033.280(b).)     Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 14th day of May 2024      Hon.
