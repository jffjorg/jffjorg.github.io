MOTIONS TO COMPEL Background On December 27, 2023, Plaintiff Jade Carrasco, by and through her Guardian Ad Litem Jesse Ronald Carrasco, (“Plaintiff Carrasco”) propounded form interrogatories, set one, on defendant Mark Radgowski (“Defendant Mark”). (Mot. Form Rogs, Quiroga Decl. ¶ 7.) Responses were due on or before January 27, 2024. (Id. at ¶ 8.) To date, Defendant Mark has not served any responses. (Id. at ¶ 10.) Plaintiff Carrasco therefore seeks an order compelling Defendant Mark to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions.  On December 27, 2023, Plaintiff Carrasco also propounded a demand for production of documents, set one, on defendant Joseph Radgowski (“Defendant Joseph”). (Mot. Prod. of Docs., Quiroga Decl. ¶ 7.) Responses were due on or before January 27, 2024. (Id. at ¶ 8.) To date, Defendant Joseph has not served any responses. (Id. at ¶ 10.) Plaintiff Carrasco therefore seeks an order compelling Defendant Joseph to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions.  Defendants Mark and Joseph are in pro per. As of May 2, 2024, no opposition has been filed.  Legal Standard  For a motion to compel initial discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).)  Discussion & Conclusion  Therefore, because the evidence shows Defendant Mark was properly served with discovery and failed to timely respond, any objections have been waived. Plaintiff Carrasco’s motion as to Defendant Mark is GRANTED: Defendant Mark is ordered to serve verified responses to Plaintiff’s Carrasco’s form interrogatories, set one, without objections, within thirty (30) days. (CCP §2030.290(a),(b).) However, the Court is unable to grant the motion as it relates to Defendant Joseph due to the defective proof of service. The motion pertaining to Defendant Joseph is related to a demand for production of documents set one. The proof of service attached to that motion, however, states that a motion to compel special interrogatories was served. Thus, the motion compelling Defendant Joseph to serve verified responses to Plaintiff Carrasco’s demand for production of documents, set one, is DENIED without prejudice on procedural grounds.   II. SANCTIONS Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response, unless a court makes certain findings. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c); 2031.300(c).)¿Defendants Mark did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition was filed, pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). Plaintiff Carrasco seeks $1,710 in monetary sanctions for the motion.  A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)        Plaintiff Carrasco is awarded $200 for each motion as attorney’s fees. Further, Plaintiff Carrasco is awarded her motion filing fee of $60 as costs for each motion. Sanctions are imposed against Defendant Mark. Defendant Mark is ordered to pay sanctions to Plaintiff Carrasco, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $260, within thirty (30) days. Because the motion was denied as to Defendant Joseph, the requested sanctions against him are also denied.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 14th day of May 2024      Hon.
