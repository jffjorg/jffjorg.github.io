And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling addresses two motions to compel filed by Plaintiff Jade Carrasco against Defendants Mark Radgowski and Joseph Radgowski. The motions seek to compel Defendants to respond to outstanding discovery requests and to pay sanctions. The court finds that Defendant Mark failed to serve any responses to Plaintiff Carrasco's form interrogatories and grants the motion to compel. The court also awards $260 in sanctions against Defendant Mark and awards $200 in attorney's fees to Plaintiff Carrasco. The court denies the motion to compel as it relates to Defendant Joseph due to a defective proof of service. The court also awards $60 in motion filing fees to Plaintiff Carrasco.
