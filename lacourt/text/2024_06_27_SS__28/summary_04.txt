And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the motions, oppositions, and replies filed in this case and has issued a tentative ruling. The case involves a vehicle collision in which the plaintiffs, Alexandra Pepin and Ryan Christopher Noel, were injured. The defendant, Patrick Harrington Thompson, fled the scene and is seeking to strike the punitive damage claim in the plaintiffs' first amended complaint. The court has denied the motion to strike, finding that the amended complaint alleges facts that state a claim for punitive damages. The court has ruled that the defendant's conduct, including fleeing the scene, constitutes malice, oppression, and fraud, and therefore justifies the imposition of punitive damages. The case will proceed to trial on June 6, 2025.
