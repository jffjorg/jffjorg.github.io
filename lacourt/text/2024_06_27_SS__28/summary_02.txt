And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition to confirm an arbitration award in the case of Parviz Mohammady (Plaintiff) v. Joey Lynn King (Defendant). The Plaintiff seeks to confirm an arbitration award of $500,000.00 made on June 30, 2020. The Defendant argues that the arbitration was between the Plaintiff's and Defendant's insurance companies, and that the Plaintiff and Defendant were not parties to the arbitration.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence that the Defendant agreed to arbitration, and that the arbitration award does not show that the Defendant or her insurance company was ordered to pay the Plaintiff $500,000.00 in damages.

The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's counsel has engaged in conduct that appears to violate Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, subdivision (b), by making claims and allegations that lack evidentiary support and are not warranted by existing law. The Judge directs the Plaintiff's counsel to show cause why they have not violated this statute, unless they withdraw or correct their petition and reply within 21 days.

The Judge has set a date for an order to show cause hearing on June 27, 2024, and has continued the hearing on the petition to confirm arbitration award to the same date and time.
