LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part: 
“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party
to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party,
or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under
Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it,
or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the
notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and
testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set
forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance. 
* * *
“(g) (1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. 
“(2) On motion of any other party who, in person or by
attorney, attended at the time and place specified in the deposition notice in
the expectation that the deponent’s testimony would be taken, the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
in favor of that party and against the deponent or the party with whom the
deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (a), (b), (g).) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   The first amended complaint 
The
first amended complaint alleges that on
October 24, 2020, Plaintiff fell on uneven/unsafe sidewalk at or about 1016
Dayton Avenue in Pomona, California, suffering injuries. 
B.  
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel the deposition of the City’s person most knowledgeable 
On January 9, 2023 Plaintiff served Request for
Production of Documents, Set 1, numbers 1-60, on the City.  On May 2, 2023, the City served responses to
the requests.  On August 22, 2023, the
City served further responses to Plaintiff’s request for production of
documents, set 1, numbers 27 to 29. 
On January 23, 2024, Plaintiff noticed the deposition
of the City’s person most knowledgeable. 
On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff served an amended deposition notice
scheduling the deposition for March 18, 2024.  On March 15, 2024, the City served objections
to request for production of documents numbers 1-35 contained in the amended
deposition notice.  Because of the
objections, Plaintiff canceled the deposition.  
On April 10, 2024, Plaintiff served a second amended
deposition notice setting the deposition on April 23, 2024.  The notice asked the City to produce
documents responsive to the request for production of documents by April 16,
2024. 
On April 19, 2024, the City served objections to request
for production of document numbers 1-35 contained in Plaintiff’s second
amended deposition notice.  As a result,
Plaintiff canceled the deposition. 
On May 1, 2024, Plaintiff served a third amended deposition
notice setting the deposition on May 16, 2024. The notice
asked the City to produce documents responsive to the request for production of
documents by May 9, 2024.  The City did
not serve responsive documents and Plaintiff canceled the deposition. 
Plaintiff now moves to compel the City to produce documents
responsive to request for production of documents numbers 1-35 contained in the deposition
notices, arguing the City served improper objections to the requests.  The City
argues that it previously responded to identical requests for production of
documents on May 2, 2023 and August 22, 2023. 
Plaintiff disagrees, saying the document production requests in the
deposition notices are “are unique from that which [Plaintiff] requested
in 2023.”  (Reply p. 5.) The City has identified several requests for production of documents in Plaintiff's deposition notice that duplicate or overlap Plaintiff’s previous request
for production of documents.  However, the City did not address whether requests for production numbers 5, 6, 8, 13, 16, 19, 25, 26, 31, 32, and 35 in the deposition notice duplicated the previous request for production of documents, instead stating that Plaintiff did not have responsive documents in its possession, custody, and control.  The Court continues the hearing and orders the City to submit a supplemental brief or declaration stating whether requests for production numbers 5, 6, 8, 13, 16, 19, 25, 26, 31, 32, and 35 in the deposition notice duplicate Plaintiff's previous request for production of documents.  Plaintiff may file a responsive supplemental brief or declaration.
CONCLUSION
 The Court CONTINUES the hearing on the motion
to compel the deposition of Defendant City of Pomona’s person most
knowledgeable filed by Plaintiff Khloe Lopez, by and through her guardian ad
litem Jesus Lopez to a date to be provided at the June 27, 2024 hearing.  The Court orders Defendant
City of Pomona to file, at least 10 days before the continued hearing, a supplemental brief or declaration stating whether requests for production numbers 5, 6, 8, 13, 16, 19, 25, 26, 31, 32, and 35 in the deposition notice duplicate Plaintiff's previous request for production of documents.  Plaintiff may file a responsive supplemental brief or declaration no later than 5 days before the continued hearing.Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
