Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiffs Mary Simmons and Raymond Schaafe’s
Motion to Compel Further Response to Form Interrogatories (Set One) is deemed
MOOT.  Sanctions are awarded in the total
amount of $1,186.65 against defendants and counsel, jointly and severally,
payable in 60 days.  
 
This case arises from a motor vehicle accident. On August
2, 2023, Plaintiffs Mary Simmons and Raymond Schaafe (“Plaintiffs”) filed suit
against Defendants Jieun Park and Jooheon Park ("Defendants”) alleging
general negligence. 
Plaintiffs move to compel further response to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Number 15.1, as to each Defendant.  This interrogatory reads as follows: 
·       
Identify each denial of a material allegation
and each special or affirmative defense in your pleadings and for each; 
o  
(a) state all facts upon which you base the
denial or affirmative defense 
o  
(b) state the names, ADDRESSES, and telephone
numbers of all PERSONS who have knowledge of those facts; and 
o  
(c) identify all DOCUMENTS and other tangible
things that support your denial or special affirmative defense, and state the
name, ADDRESS and telephone number of the PERSON who has each DOCUMENT
In a jointly filed opposition, Defendants state they served
supplemental responses on October 9, 2024. (Morales Decl., Ex. A.) 
Because further responses have been served, the Court deems
the instant motions MOOT. 
Sanctions 
The court shall impose a
monetary sanction against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further responses to interrogatories or demand for production
of documents unless the party subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code of Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.300, subd. (d), 2031.310, subd. (h), 2033.290, subd. (d).) 
Plaintiffs request sanctions in the amount of $1,436.65 (1
hour preparing the meet and confer correspondence, 1.5 hour spent preparing the
motion, .5 hours reviewing the opposition, .5 hours preparing the reply, and
two hours spent appearing at the Court, at a rate of $250.00 per hour, in
addition to the $61.65 filing fee) as to each Defendant.
Defendants did not serve supplemental responses until well
after the agreed upon deadline of January 30, 2024 (the same date these motions
were filed).  Thus, sanctions are
warranted.  
However, the finds that amount requested by Plaintiffs is
excessive, in part because the two motions are nearly identical to each other.  Thus, sanctions are
awarded in the total amount of $1,186.65 against both defendants and counsel,
jointly and severally, payable in 60 days.
