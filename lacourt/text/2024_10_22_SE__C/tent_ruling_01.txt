Cash & Carry, et al.

Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff Jehan Zeb Mir, M.D.’s Motion to Correct
Clerical Error is DENIED. 
Clerk to give notice.
 
In the First Amended Complaint filed on January 24, 2022,
Plaintiff Jehan Zeb Mir, M.D. (“Plaintiff”) alleges that on May 27, 2018, as he
was leaving a grocery store operated by Defendant Surati Cash & Carry
Grocery (“Defendant”), he tripped and fell, suffering injuries to his left
wrist which required medical care.  
The procedural history of this case is set forth in detail in
Judge Michelle Court’s June 1, 2023 order denying Plaintiff’s “Notice &
Motion for Reconsideration of Order Denying Reassignment of the Case” filed in
February 2023. (6/1/23 Minute Order.) 
In this motion, Plaintiff seeks to correct a notation in
the Court’s online register of actions which indicates that the disposition of Plaintiff’s
first amended complaint is “Court Ordered Dismissal – Other (Other) –
9/13/22”.  This is in reference to Judge
Elaine Lu’s September 13, 2022 order dismissing without prejudice Plaintiff’s
First Amended Complaint. (9/13/22 Minute Order.) 
No opposition filed as of October 18, 2024.  
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, “[t]he
court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its own motion, correct
clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, so as to conform to the
judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of either party after notice to
the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.”  (CCP
§473(d).)  Ministerial acts that were performed inadvertently by a court
clerk are clerical errors in nature and within the Court’s power to correct at
any time.  (People v. Mitchell (2001) 26 Cal.4th 181, 185.) 
Here, Plaintiff argues that the register of actions “makes
no mention of the motion for reconsideration of the 9/13/2022 order dismissing
complaint without prejudice, the peremptory challenge to Judge Lu. and her
December 7, 2022, Order accepting peremptory challenge voiding dismissal and
ordering reassignment to another judge under CCP: § 170.6(a)(4).” (Motion, p.
11:1-4 (punctuation in original).) 
It appears Plaintiff is referring to an order made by Judge
Lu on January 18, 2023.  In that order, Judge
Lu found that Plaintiff’s December 7, 2022 peremptory challenge against her was
timely as to Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration of Judge Cowan’s August 22,
2022 order. (1/18/23 Minute Order.) That motion was reassigned to Judge
Michelle Court.  However, Judge Lu’s
January 18, 2023 order DENIED Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration of her own
September 13, 2022 Order in civil cases 21STCV27787, 21NWCV00424, 21STCV03643,
and 20STCV17339. (Ibid.)  As such,
Judge Lu’s September 13, 2022 order dismissing the First Amended Complaint without
prejudice remains in effect, and there is no error in the Court's online
register of actions indicating the disposition of this matter.  
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Correct Clerical Error
is DENIED.
