And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying plaintiff Jehan Zeb Mir, M.D.'s motion to correct a clerical error in the Court's online register of actions. The plaintiff claims that the register incorrectly indicates that the disposition of his First Amended Complaint is "Court Ordered Dismissal - Other (Other) - 9/13/22", which refers to Judge Elaine Lu's order dismissing the complaint without prejudice on September 13, 2022. The plaintiff argues that the register does not mention his motion for reconsideration of that order, his peremptory challenge to Judge Lu, and her subsequent order accepting the challenge and voiding the dismissal. The judge finds that Judge Lu's order dismissing the complaint without prejudice remains in effect, and therefore there is no error in the Court's online register of actions. The motion is denied.
