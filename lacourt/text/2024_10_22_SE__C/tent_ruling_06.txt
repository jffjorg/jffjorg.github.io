Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiffs PIP 4221 BANDINI, LLC and CLINE B
INDUSTRIAL HOLDINGS, LLC’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. 
Plaintiffs to give notice. 
 
Background 
This unlawful detainer action involves commercial real
property located at 4221 Bandini Blvd., Vernon, CA 90058.  The Complaint was filed on May 22, 2024 by Plaintiffs
PIP 4221 BANDINI, LLC; and CLINE B INDUSTRIAL HOLDINGS, LLC (“Plaintiffs”)
against Defendants SCREAMLINE INVESTMENT CORPORATION (“Screamline”); ADW, INC.;
AUL PIPE & TUBING, INC.; and DOES 1 through 10 (“Defendants”).
Plaintiffs move for summary judgment or, in the
alternative, summary adjudication based upon past due rent in the amount of
$129,087.97 and damages in the amount of $301,438.75, for a total of
$430,526.72. 
On September 13, 2024, the parties jointly stipulated to a continuance
of the hearing (from October 3, 2024 to today’s date) so that additional
depositions could be taken before Defendants file their opposition.  
As of October 15, 2024, no opposition has been filed. 
Legal Standard 
The
purpose of a motion for summary judgment “is to provide courts with a mechanism
to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite
their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute”¿(Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843 (Aguilar); Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c (c).)¿ A plaintiff reaches its burden on summary judgment by
showing prima facie evidence for each element of its cause of action.¿
Code Civ. Proc, § 437c (p); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519 (Scalf).¿ 
 
The
burden will then shift to the defendant to show the existence of a triable
issue of material fact for at least one element of the cause of action at
issue.¿(Ibid.) 
 
Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment or summary adjudication and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in
favor of that party.”¿(Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th
384, 389.)¿However, if all inferences reasonably deducible from the submitted
evidence are uncontradicted by other inferences and there is no triable issue
as to any material fact, the moving party is entitled to summary adjudication as
a matter of law.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c (c); Adler v. Manor Healthcare
Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) 
 
Discussion 
“[T]he basic elements of unlawful detainer for nonpayment
of rent contained in CCP §1161(2) are: (1) the tenant is in possession of the
premises; (2) that possession is without permission; (3) the tenant is in
default for nonpayment of rent; (4) the tenant has been properly served with a
written three-day notice; and (5) the default continues after the three-day
notice period has elapsed.” (Kruger v. Reyes (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th
Supp. 10, 16.)
Plaintiffs argue that there are no triable issue of
material fact as to whether Defendants have failed to pay rent on a monthly
basis and remain in possession of the premises. 
In support of the Motion for Summary Judgment, Plaintiffs
present evidence of the following:
·       
Plaintiffs are the owners and Lessors of the
property located at 4221 Bandini Blvd., Vernon, CA 90058, which consists of a
single lot with three buildings, which are separately known as 2701, 2713 and
2715 So. Bonnie Beach Pl., Vernon, CA 90058 (the “Premises”). (McWhertor Decl.,
¶ 1; Ex. A.) 
·       
On November 24, 2021 (prior to Plaintiff’s
obtaining their ownership), Plaintiff’s predecessor-in-interest (a related
entity), as Landlord, and Defendant, as Tenant, entered into a written Standard
Industrial/Commercial Single-Tenant Lease – Net (the “Original Lease”). The
Original Lease was then assigned to Plaintiffs on March 4, 2022 by way of an
Assignment of Lease. The Original Lease was subsequently amended on March 21,
2022 by way of a First Amendment. These documents are collectively referred to as
the “Lease.” (McWhertor Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. B) 
·       
The Lease, at Section 52 in the Addendum,
provides a table of Base Rent owing under the Lease. The years of the Lease
started effective March 1, 2022, meaning that, for the period of March 1, 2024
to the present, the Base Rent under the Lease is $58,350.00 per month. In
addition, Defendant owes Plaintiffs the real property taxes (as set forth in
Article 10 of the Lease) and the costs of Plaintiff’s insurance (as set forth
in Article 8 of the Lease). (McWheror Decl., ¶ 6 Ex. B.) 
·       
Defendant failed and refused to make the
payment of Rent on time or in full for several months leading up to this case.
Defendants were habitually late with payments, triggering late fees under
Section 13.4 of the Lease. The last time there was a zero balance on the
account was January 2024. (McWhertor Decl., ¶ 7.; Ex. D.) 
·       
On May 15, 2024, TK McWhertor drafted and
personally served a Notice to Pay Rent or Quit – Commercial Premises (the
“Notice”) on Defendants in accordance with the provisions of the Lease and
California law. (McWhertor Decl., ¶ 8; Ex. E.)
·       
The Notice required Defendant to pay the sum of
$129,087.97, the amount of Rent outstanding under the Lease for the past one
year period, or quit the Premises within three (3) business days after service
of the Notice. The Notice further set forth Plaintiffs’ election to declare a
forfeiture of the Lease. (McWhertor Decl., ¶ 8; Ex. E.)
·       
More than three (3) days elapsed since the
service of the Notice and there was no lawful tender of the amount set forth in
the Notice or any amount at all – during that time period. On July 9, 2024,
Defendant tried to make a partial payment (well after the Notice expired) in
the amounts of $73,500.00. Plaintiffs rejected that payment. Defendant, along
with ADW and AUL, are still in possession of the Premises. (McWhertor Decl., ¶
9.) 
·       
Plaintiff contends that the daily value of the
Premises is $2,411.51. (McWhertor Decl., ¶ 10.) 
Based on the above, the Court determines that Plaintiffs have
made a prima facie showing that no triable issue of material fact exists
regarding whether Defendants have failed to pay rent on a monthly basis and
remain in possession of the premises. The burden now shifts to Defendants to
raise a triable issue of material fact.
Because Defendants have not opposed the motion, they have
failed to raise a triable issue of material fact. 
Accordingly, the Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.
