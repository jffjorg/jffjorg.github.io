And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mary Simmons and Raymond Schaafe (Plaintiffs) vs. Jieun Park and Jooheon Park (Defendants). The Plaintiffs had moved to compel further response to form interrogatories, but the judge has deemed this motion moot since the Defendants have already served supplemental responses. The judge has also awarded sanctions against the Defendants and their counsel in the amount of $1,186.65, payable in 60 days, due to the Defendants' failure to serve supplemental responses by the agreed-upon deadline. The judge finds that the amount requested by the Plaintiffs is excessive, and therefore reduces the sanctions.
