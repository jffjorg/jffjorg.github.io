BACKGROUND
This is an unlawful detainer action. Plaintiff MJ Global
Enterprise, Inc. (“MJ Global”) filed suit against Defendant Everytable, PBC (“Everytable”)
alleging failure to pay rent in the amount of $239,287.00.   
There are three other actions pending in the Los Angeles
Superior Court involving the same parties:
In LASC Case No. 24NWCV01115, Sonterra Capital, the fee
owner of the real property located at 3305 East Vernon A venue, Vernon, CA
90058 ("Subject Property"), filed an unlawful detainer action against
its lessee and sublandlord, MJ Global, and its sublessees Everytable and Pitman
Enterprises USA Inc. ("Pitman") for possession of the Subject
Property. 
In LASC Case No. 24STCP02038, Apex Funding Source, LLP
applies for Entry of Judgment on Sister-State (New York) Judgment against MJ
Global and Hyung Do Min.  
In LASC Case No. 24STCV02343, Everytable filed an interpleader
action after MJ Global and Apex Funding presented Everytable with competing
demands for the rent at issue in this unlawful detainer case.  The interpleader action names MJ Global and
Apex Funding as claimants.  On January
31, 2024, Everytable deposited with the Court the exact amount of rent MJ
Global claims is outstanding in this unlawful detainer action (i.e.,
$239,286.79).  
On March 26, 2024, Everytable demurred to MJ Global’s
Complaint on the grounds that Everytable had deposited all outstanding rent
with the Court in the interpleader action, as described above.  A hearing on the demurrer was scheduled for August
27, 2024.  At the hearing, Counsel for Everytable informed the
Court that MJ Global submitted a Request for Voluntary Dismissal Without
Prejudice on August 26.  The Request was
electronically received at 4:34 p.m. on August 26 and a dismissal was entered
in Dept. F (the master calendar court) on the same day.  Counsel for Everytable requested that the
Court vacate the voluntary dismissal and rule on the demurrer in accordance
with the tentative ruling.  Everytable
argued that the Court has discretion to vacate a voluntary dismissal in
circumstances such as this where the Court issued a tentative ruling sustaining
a demurrer without leave to amend, and Plaintiff submitted a voluntary
dismissal without prejudice between the time the tentative ruling was issued
and the ruling became final. (Groth Bros. Oldsmobile v. Gallagher (2002)
97 Cal.App.4th 60.)  MJ Global
argued that the Court lacks jurisdiction to rule on the demurrer because
Everytable has been dismissed from the action. (See 8-27-24 Minute Order.) The
Court took the matter under submission.
On August 28, 2024,
the Court issued an order continuing the matter to today’s date and ordering MJ
Global to show cause why the Court should not vacate its voluntary dismissal and
sustain Everytable’s demurrer without leave to amend.  The Court ordered further briefing from the
parties which the Court has reviewed and considered.  
DISCUSSION
MJ
Global’s Request for Voluntary Dismissal
In Groth Bros.
Oldsmobile v. Gallagher, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th 60, the plaintiff
failed to file opposition to the defendant's demurrer, and instead attempted to
file an amended complaint that was rejected by the clerk.  The day before the hearing, the court issued
a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend. The plaintiff
then filed a voluntary dismissal without prejudice.  The trial court concluded that it lacked
jurisdiction to rule on the demurrer because defendant had been dismissed from
the lawsuit.  The appellate court reversed.  In doing so, it instructed the trial court to
vacate the voluntary dismissal and enter judgment sustaining the demurrer
without leave to amend.  The appellate court
concluded that allowing a plaintiff to file a voluntary dismissal without
prejudice in the face of a tentative ruling which sustains a demurrer without
leave to amend would “waste the time and resources of the court and
other parties”, “promote annoying and continuous litigation”, and undermine
the tentative ruling system. (Id. at p. 70.) 
MJ Global argues
that Groth is distinguishable because in that case Plaintiff did not
file an opposition, corporate indemnification was an issue, and the trial court
used a different tentative ruling system. 
Despite these differences, the Court determines that Groth is
analogous in all material respects and its reasoning applies with equal force
to the facts of this case.
Accordingly, MJ
Global’s Request for Dismissal Without Prejudice entered on August 26, 2024 is
VACATED.  
Everytable’s
Demurrer
 
Requests
For Judicial Notice
 
The Court GRANTS Everytable’s requests
for judicial notice, including the request to take judicial notice of the Minute Order entered on August 13, 2024 in Everytable,
PBC v. MJ Global Enterprise, Inc., et al., LASC Case No. 24STCV02343
relating to Everytable’s Motion for Order Discharging Stakeholder Everytable
and for Award of Attorney’s Fees and Costs. (Evid.
Code, § 452, subd. (d).) The Court takes
judicial notice only as to the existence, content, and authenticity of such
documents; it does not take judicial notice of the truth of the factual matters
asserted therein. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.) 
 
On its own motion, the Court takes
judicial notice of the Minute Order entered on August 13, 2024 in Everytable, PBC v. MJ Global Enterprise, Inc., et al., LASC
Case No. 24STCV02343 relating to MJ Global’s demurrer to the Everytable’s
Complaint in Interpleader.  
 
Legal Standard 
A demurrer for sufficiency
tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  When considering
demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  In a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or via proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone
and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.  Therefore, it lies only
where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially
noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.)  At the pleading
stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the
defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him.  (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.)  A “demurrer does
not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the pleading, or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts
impossible in law.”  (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226
Cal.App.2d 725, 732 (internal citations omitted).) 
Discussion 
Any person, firm, corporation, association or other entity
against whom double or multiple claims are made, or may be made, by two or more
persons which are such that they may give rise to double or multiple liability,
may bring an action against the claimants to compel them to interplead and
litigate their several claims. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386(b).)
The Court has taken judicial notice of the Minute Order
dated August 13, 2024 in the interpleader action.  The Minute Order states that ““Plaintiff
Everytable, PBC is discharged from liability and dismissed pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 386.5 regarding the funds deposited with the Clerk of
the Court in the amount of $387,285 in connection with this action.” (See LASC
Case No. 24STCV02343, 8-13-24 Minute Order.) These funds consist of $239,286.79
deposited with the Court on or about January 30, 2024 and $147,988.21 deposited
with the Court on or about March 1, 2024. 

In the interpleader action, the court found “that the
Complaint alleges sufficient facts showing a reasonable probability of double
vexation, or a valid threat of double vexation. The Court finds the Complaint
sufficiently alleges that Defendants make conflicting, adverse claims to the
same thing, that is, Plaintiff’s rent payments, and that Plaintiff cannot
safely determine which claim is right and lawful. (LASC Case No. 24STCV02343,
8-13-24 Minute Order.) The court further found that “Plaintiff does not have an
interest in the Interplead Funds that were deposited, and therefore is
sufficiently disinterested and neutral under Code of Civil Procedure sections
386 and 386.5.” (Ibid.)
“When the ground of demurrer is based on a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice pursuant to Section 452 or 453 of the
Evidence Code, such matter shall be specified in the demurrer, or in the
supporting points and authorities for the purpose of invoking such notice,
except as the court may otherwise permit.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.70.)
Based upon judicial notice of the August 13, 2024 minute
order in Case No. 24STCV02343, Everytable has demonstrated that it has deposited
with the Court the full amount of rent due, and that it should be discharged
from liability in the instant unlawful detainer action.  
“[T]he basic elements of unlawful detainer for nonpayment
of rent contained in CCP §1161(2) are: (1) the tenant is in possession of the
premises; (2) that possession is without permission; (3) the tenant is in
default for nonpayment of rent; (4) the tenant has been properly served with a
written three-day notice; and (5) the default continues after the three-day
notice period has elapsed.”  (Kruger
v. Reyes (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th Supp. 10, 16.) 
Under the circumstances here, the Court finds there is no
defaulted payment. 
In its Supplemental Opposition filed on August 23, 2024, MJ
Global argues that the interpleader court, in its August 13, 2024 ruling on
Everytable’s Motion to be Discharged, did not litigate the breach of lease or
any other matter between the parties. 
While that is correct, the court’s ruling should not be interpreted to
mean that the court will not determine the respective rights of the
remaining parties to the deposited funds. 
To provide context, this Court notes the following portion of the August
13, 2024 ruling regarding MJ Global’s demurrer: “Here, the Court agrees with
Plaintiff that it not [sic] required to litigate, at this stage of the
action and for purposes of a demurrer, the legal dispute between Defendant
MJ Global and Defendant Apex with respect to whether the rent payments must be
paid to Defendant Apex pursuant to either the letter or the Judgment, or to
Defendant MJ Global pursuant to the lease agreements.” (Minute Order, 8/13/24,
Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 24STCV02343, italics added.) Now that
Everytable has demonstrated its right to interplead the funds, Defendants are
now compelled to litigate their respective claims to those funds. (CCP §
386(b).) That is done in the interpleader court, not in this court. 
Accordingly, Everytable’s Demurrer is SUSTAINED. 
For the Court to grant leave
to amend, “Plaintiff must show in what manner he can amend his complaint and
how that amendment will change the legal effect of his pleading.” (Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal. 3d 335, 349, quotations omitted.) Because
Everytable has deposited the full amount of rent due with the Court and
Everytable has been discharged from the interpleader action, the Court does not
find that leave to amend would allow MJ Global to sufficiently allege an
unlawful detainer action.  Accordingly,
leave to amend is DENIED.  
 
MJ Global’s Motions to Compel Further Responses
Because the Court has sustained the Demurrer without leave
to amend, MJ Global’s motions to compel further discovery responses are MOOT.
