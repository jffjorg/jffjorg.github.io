MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff
Valerie Adams
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant
City of Los Angeles by and through the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power (“LADWP”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition, and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
             On August 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint
for Money Damages, alleging what appears to be causes of action for Breach of
Contract, Common Counts for Money had and received, Fraud, Identity Theft,
Fraud and Negligence.  On March 5, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the instant motion (the “Motion”). On May 17, 2024, Defendant
filed its opposition to the Motion and on May 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed her
reply.  
             
DISCUSSION
            If a party to whom interrogatories
are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction.¿(CCP §
2030.290(b).)¿The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where
no responses or no verified responses have been served.¿¿All that need be shown
in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on
the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response
of any kind has been served.¿(Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111
Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)
 
Special Interrogatories, Set One 
            As a preliminary matter, it is disputed whether Plaintiff received
LADWP’s response to the Special Interrogatories, Set One. Plaintiff argues that
she never received a response to her discovery request and the opposition is
untimely. Defendant argues that it did respond to the discovery request. 
 
            On December 26, 2023, Plaintiff
propounded Special Interrogatories, Set No. 1, to LADWP (the “SIs”). (Granado
Decl. ¶3.) LADWP received the SIs on December 29, 2023, by mail. (Id.) On
February 05, 2024, LADWP emailed and mailed LADWP's Response to the SIs. (Id.
at ¶4.) Defense counsel’s legal secretary declares that the response served by
regular mail was never returned to LADWP as undeliverable by the Post Office. (Id.
at ¶ 8.) She further states that the email services of the response on February
5, 2024, and February 15, 2024, went through without any issues as she never
got any email notices that the emails were undeliverable. (Id. at ¶ 9.) Defendant’s
new counsel, A.Voltaire Lazaro declares that there were no phone calls, emails
or letters from Plaintiff confirming receipt of the emails sent by Anna Granado,
and that there was no confirmation from Plaintiff that the response sent by
mail was received at the mailing address of Plaintiff stated in her Special
Interrogatories. (Lazaro Decl. ¶11; Exhibit 8 – Page 1 of Plaintiff’s Request
for SIs. showing her email address and mailing address.) Defense counsel states
that the next thing that came to the mail from Plaintiff was service of the
Notice and Motion to Compel Response which she filed on March 5, 2024, and
received by A. Voltaire Lazaro by mail on March 11, 2024. (Lazaro Decl. ¶ 12; Exhibit
3 – Mailed Meet and Confer Letter.)
 
            The Court notes that LADWP’s
evidence was sufficient to show that LADWP sent the response to Special
Interrogatories, Set One. For instance, Defendant submitted the Proof of
Service which shows that LADWP sent the document via email at
rho.miles@yahoo.com and to 6073 Fragans Way Woodland Hills, CA 91367 on
February 5, 2024. Moreover, LADWP also included two emails which show the response
to the SIs was sent to Plaintiff. (Lazaro Decl. ¶ 4; Exhibit 2- Email to
Plaintiff with Responses.)
 
            Therefore, the Court denies
Plaintiff’s request to Compel Initial Responses to the SIs as MOOT because
LADWP has responded before the filing of the Motion. 
 
            The Court therefore DENIES
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Initial Responses to Special Interrogatories and
Request for Sanctions. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
