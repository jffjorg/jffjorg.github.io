And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the parties' submissions and renders its tentative ruling. The plaintiff, Valerie Adams, moved to compel initial responses to special interrogatories and requested sanctions against the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP). The Court denies the motion as moot because LADWP responded to the special interrogatories before the filing of the motion. The Court finds that LADWP provided sufficient evidence to show that it sent the response to the special interrogatories. Therefore, the Court denies the plaintiff's motion to compel initial responses to special interrogatories and request for sanctions. The parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
