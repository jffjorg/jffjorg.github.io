BACKGROUND
            This
action arises from the alleged breach of a written agreement to develop real
estate. On April 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendants S3D
Partners, LLC, Jayesh Kumar, Vimal Patel, Govind Kumaar, Madhuben Kumar and
Ketan Kumar (collectively “Defendants”), as well as Doe Defendants 1 through
25, inclusive, alleging the following causes of action: (1) Promissory Fraud;
(2) Fraud in the Inducement; (3) Intentional Misrepresentation; (4) Negligent
Misrepresentation; (5) Fraudulent Concealment; (6) Breach of Written Contract;
(7) Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (8) Indemnification;
and (9) Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200. 
 
            On September
1, 2023, default was entered against Defendants Ketan Kumar, S3D Partners, LLC,
and Madhuben Kumar. 
 
            On
December 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed an Application for Publication as to
Defendants Jayesh Kumar, Govind Kumaar and Vimal Patel, in order to serve such
defendants via publication. 
 
            On
March 25, 2024, after hearing, the Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion to Extend
Time to Seek Default Judgment [03/25/24 Minute Order], as the Court found “that
good cause exist[ed] for an extension of time for Plaintiff to seek default
judgment against all six defendants in this case.” (03/25/24 Minute Order at p.
3.) The Court set an OSC re filing of a request for default judgment against defendants
for October 18, 2024. (3/25/24 Minute Order at p. 3.) 
 
            On
April 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served the instant unopposed Motion for
Leave to File a First Amended Complaint (the “Motion”).   
 
            On
May 24, 2024, after hearing oral argument, the Court continued the hearing on
the Motion to June 7, 2024 pursuant to the request of Plaintiff. (05/24/24
Minute Order.) Also, on May 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served notice of
ruling as to the Court’s May 24, 2024 order. 
 
            Additionally,
on May 24, 2024, the Supplemental Declaration of Jesse Steinbach (“Steinbach”) was
filed and served in support of the Motion. 
 
DISCUSSION 
The trial court has discretion to allow amendments to pleadings in the
furtherance of justice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).) Any judge, at
any time before or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice,
and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any pleading. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 576.) There is a policy of great liberality in permitting
amendments to the pleadings at any stage of the proceeding. (Berman v.
Bromberg (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 936, 945.) An application to amend a
pleading is addressed to the trial judge’s sound discretion. (Ibid.)  
 
California Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1324(b) requires that a motion to amend a pleading before trial must
include a separate declaration specifying: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2)
why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to
the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request
for amendment was not made earlier. 
 
 
 
Issue No. 1: Appropriateness of Granting Leave to
Amend 
             Attorney Steinbach declares that the effect of
the amendment is to add specific information concerning the damages, attorneys’
fees, and prejudgment interest that Plaintiff seeks to recover in this case.
(Steinbach Supp. Decl., ¶ 3.) The amendment is necessary and proper to allow
Plaintiff to comply with requirements for seeking default judgments. (Id.)
The request for amendment was not made sooner because it is now apparent that
Defendants may not be participating in this case and default judgments may be
necessary. (Id.) Counsel also sets forth when the facts giving rise to
the need for amendment were discovered. (Id.)  
 
Plaintiff has attached the proposed
First Amended Complaint as Attachment 1 to the Motion. Plaintiff has complied
with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324. The Motion is also unopposed,
which leads to an inference that it is meritorious. (Sexton v. Superior
Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, the Motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to file and serve
the proposed First Amended Complaint within five court days so that it becomes the
operative pleading in this action.  
             
Moving Party is ordered to give
notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 7th day of June 2024
