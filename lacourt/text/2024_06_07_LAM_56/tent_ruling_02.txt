                        Plaintiff,
            vs.

  CASE NO.: 19STCV36904
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: DEFENDANT’S
  COUNSEL’S MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
8:30 a.m.
June 7, 2024
Dept. 56



 
            David A. Sergenian
moves to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Cuil Investments, LLC. The Motion
fully complies with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  David A. Sergenian states that there has been
a breakdown of the working relationship with Cuil Investments, LLC. (Sergenian
Decl. ¶ 2.) The Court notes that trial has not been set and there are no other
scheduled hearings; therefore, Cuil Investments, LLC would not be prejudiced.  The Motion is GRANTED as it fully complies
with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Nevertheless,
because Cuil Investments, LLC is a limited liability company and not an
individual, it cannot represent itself. 
The Court therefore sets an OSC re Representation for July 31, 2024 at 8:30
am, at which time Cuil Investments, LLC must appear by its new counsel, unless
it has already filed a notice of its new representation.
 
David
A. Sergenian is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
