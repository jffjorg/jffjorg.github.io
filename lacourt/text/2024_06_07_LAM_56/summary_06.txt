And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The proposed tentative ruling grants the motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The proposed amended complaint seeks to add specific information concerning damages, attorneys' fees, and prejudgment interest. The court finds that the amendment is necessary and proper to allow the plaintiff to comply with requirements for seeking default judgments. The court also finds that the request for amendment was not made sooner because it is now apparent that the defendants may not be participating in the case and default judgments may be necessary. The court orders the plaintiff to file and serve the proposed first amended complaint within five court days, making it the operative pleading in the action.
