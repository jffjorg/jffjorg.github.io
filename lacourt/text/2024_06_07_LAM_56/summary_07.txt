And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The Court finds that the parties agreed to arbitrate disputes through the arbitration agreement signed by the plaintiff. The Court finds that the agreement is not procedurally unconscionable because the plaintiff was given 48 hours to review the agreement and ask questions. The Court also finds that the agreement is not substantively unconscionable because it provides for adequate discovery and allows the plaintiff to present her claims. The Court orders the parties to arbitrate their disputes and stays the action pending the completion of the arbitration.
