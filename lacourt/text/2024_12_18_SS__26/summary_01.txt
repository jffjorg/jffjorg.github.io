And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the American Contractors Indemnity Company's motion to garnish the wages of Jon Jerald Benavente's spouse, Laura Benavente, without prejudice. The motion was filed in order to collect on a judgment debt owed by Benavente. The judge ruled that the company's evidence did not demonstrate that Benavente has either ownership or access to Laura Benavente's account, nor did it show that her earnings are commingled with Benavente's to a significant degree. The judge noted that California law prohibits the garnishment of a judgment debtor's spouse's wages without a court order, and that a portion of a married couple's community property is shielded from liability for premarital debts to the extent that the earnings and income are held in an account to which the debtor-spouse does not have access and are not commingled. The judge gave notice to the moving party to file a renewed motion with additional evidence.
