 Case Number:  24STLC04995    Hearing Date:   December 18, 2024    Dept:  26 Cohen v. Aglo Management LLC, et al., TENTATIVE RULING:Defendant Aglo Management, LLC’S Motion to Release Mechanic’s Lien is DENIED.ANALYSIS:Plaintiff Shmuel Cohen (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant Complaint for Foreclosure of Mechanic’s Lien against Defendant Aglo Management, LLC (“Defendant”) on July 12, 2024. On September 17, 2024, Defendant filed an answer to the Complaint and a cross-complainant for violation of the Business & Professions Code, breach of contract, negligence, and declaratory relief. On the same date, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Release Mechanic’s Lien.The Motion initially came for hearing on November 25, 2024 and was continued for further briefing at Defendant’s request. (Minute Order, 11/25/24.) Defendant filed a supplemental brief on the same date and Plaintiff responded on December 13, 2024. Defendant then filed a reply on December 16, 2024.DiscussionDefendant moves for an order to release the mechanic’s lien filed by Plaintiff pursuant to Civil Code section 8480, which states “[t]he owner of property or the owner of any interest in property subject to a claim of lien may petition the court for an order to release the property from the claim of lien if the claimant has not commenced an action to enforce the lien within the time provided in Section 8460.” (Civ. Code, § 8480, subd. (a) [emphasis added].) The time for a claimant to commence an action to enforce the lien under section 8460 is “within 90 days after recordation of the claim of lien.” (Civ. Code, § 8460, subd. (a).) Here, the lien that is the subject of this action was recorded on April 15, 2024. (Compl., ¶9 and Exh. A.) The instant action was commenced on July 12, 2024--within the time set forth in Civil Code Sections 8480 and 8460. Establishing Plaintiff's failure to commence an action to enforce the lien within the required timeframe is a necessary precondition to Defendant's petition for an order to release the property from the claim of lien. Defendant does not address this or even cite the language of the moving statute in its papers.Defendant also cites Civil Code section 8461 for the proposition that Plaintiff’s failure to file or serve a notice of lis pendens renders the mechanic’s lien unenforceable. Section 8461 states:After commencement of an action to enforce a lien, the plaintiff shall record in the office of the county recorder of the county, or of the several counties in which the property is situated, a notice of the pendency of the action, as provided in Title 4.5 (commencing with Section 405) of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, on or before 20 days after the commencement of the action. Only from the time of recording that notice shall a purchaser or encumbrancer of the property affected thereby be deemed to have constructive notice of the pendency of the action, and in that event only of its pendency against parties designated by their real names.(Civ. Code, § 8461.) This language, which pertains to an action to enforce a lien, does not indicate that failure to file and serve a notice of lis pendens is grounds to release the mechanic’s lien. In fact, the case on which Defendant relies—R. M. Hacker Co. v. Hollymount Bowl (1956) 146 Cal.App.2d Supp. 875, 877—was overruled on this ground by the Court of Appeals in Patten-Blinn Lumber Co. v. Francis (1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 196, 203.) In that case, the Court of Appeals pointed out that the purpose of filing and serving a notice of lis pendens is to give notice to persons other than the owner of the property in question, as the owner already has notice of the action to foreclose on the lien by being named in the suit. (Ibid.) Defendant’s reply does not address the holding of Patten-Blinn to demonstrate why a different rule should apply here. Nor is the Court persuaded that Defendant is prejudiced by the supplemental briefing schedule ordered on November 25, 2024. Defendant was granted leave to file a supplemental brief on legal authorities argued to the court, but which were not cited in Defendant's moving papers, by December 9, 2024. (See Notice of Ruling Re: Motion to Release Mechanics Lien, 11/25/2024). Plaintiff was granted leave to file a response by December 16, 2024. Plaintiff filed its response on December 13, 2024, three days ahead of the December 16, 2024, deadline. The court did not grant Defendant leave to file a to file a reply to Plaintiff's response. For these reasons, Defendant was not prejudiced by the supplemental briefing schedule.ConclusionTherefore, Defendant Aglo Management, LLC’S Motion to Release Mechanic’s Lien is DENIED.
