Following Judgment Debtor’s failure  to appear, the Court entered default judgment in Judgment Creditor’s favor on  January 4, 2021. Judgment Creditor filed a Motion to Compel Third Parties to  Produce Documents (“first Motion”) to on September 25, 2023. Third-party Bank  of Hope filed an opposition on November 13, 2023 and third-party Sammy Hakim  (“Hakim”) filed a “Response to Subpoena for Production”, which partially  opposed the first Motion, on December 11, 2023. The first Motion initially came for hearing on December 14,  2023, at which time the Court granted the Motion in part and continued it in  part. Specifically, the Court granted Judgment Creditor’s request for  production of Judgment Debtor and Hakim’s confidential marriage license and  continued the request for production of documents from third-party financial  entities to March 14, 2024. (Minute Order, 12/14/23, pp. 1-2.) The request for  production of documents by third-party financial entities was continued to  allow for clarity on the question of the marriage of Judgment Debtor and Hakim.  (Id. at p. 3.) On February 9, 2024, the Court granted Judgment  Creditor’s Motion for In Camera Examination with respect to the confidential  marriage license of Judgment Debtor and Hakim. (Minute Order, 02/09/24.) Hakim  also filed an Objection to Third Party Subpoena on March 7, 2024.Following the in-camera hearing on March 25, 2024, the Court  found that “there is a Confidential Marriage License. Date of marriage is  3/5/22 which is after the judgment date of 1/4/21.” (Minute Order, 03/25/24.)  The first Motion was set to be heard on April 8, 2024, but on the day before,  Judgment Creditor continued the matter to May 16, 2024. (Registrar of Actions,  04/07/24.) On May 16, 2024, the Court denied the first Motion. (Minute Order,  05/16/24.) Also on that date, the Court struck Judgment Creditor’s “Amended  Motion to Compel Third Parties to Produce Documents,” filed on May 6, 2024,  which purported to supplant the original Motion to Compel Third Parties to  Produce Documents. (Ibid.)Judgment Creditor filed a renewed Motion to Compel Third  Parties to Produce Documents (“the Renewed Motion”) on May 20, 2024. Bank of  Hope filed an opposition on May 30, 2024. On June 12, 2024, the Court heard  oral argument from both parties and then denied the Renewed Motion to Compel  Third Parties to Produce Documents.On August 20, 2024, Judgment Creditor filed the instant  second, renewed Motion to Compel Third Parties to Produce Documents (“the  Second Renewed Motion”). Third party Bank of Hope filed an opposition on  September 11, 2024. At the hearing on October 23, 2024, the Court ordered  Judgment Creditor to do the following:(1) By  November 20, 2024, file proof of service of the Amended Supplemental  Declaration and its contents on Judgment Debtor, and third parties Sammy Hakim,  Bank of Hope, NA., Bank Of America, N.A.; (4) Capital One, N.A.; (5) JPMorgan  Chase Bank, N.A., Newrez, LLC; (6) Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.; (7) Chex Systems,  Inc.; and (8) Lexisnexis Risk Solutions, Inc.(2)  By  December 4, 2024, file and serve a supplemental brief addressing the bank  records attached to the Amended Supplemental Declaration. The supplemental  brief must include relevant legal authority to support the party’s position,  have proofs of service attached, and not exceed five pages. Judgment Debtor and  any third party identified above may file a supplemental brief that also  complies with these requirements. (Minute Order, 10/23/24.) Judgment Creditor filed proofs of  service of the Amended Supplemental Declaration on November 18, 2024. Also on  November 18, 2024, Judgment Creditor filed a supplemental brief titled  “Supplemental Memorandum Re Judgment Debtor’s Deposit Account Statements.”  Proofs of service of the Supplemental Memorandum were also filed on November  18, 2024. Although Judgment Debtor’s opposition contends that none of these  documents have been filed or served, the Court’s docket reflects Judgment Creditor’s  compliance with the order dated October 23, 2024.DiscussionThe instant Second Renewed Motion to Compel seeks the same  relief previously sought and denied in the first Motion to Compel Third Parties  to Produce Documents, the Amended Motion to Compel Third Parties to Produce  Documents, and the Renewed Motion. (Second Renewed Motion, pp. 5:10-6:13.)  Specifically, the Second Renewed Motion to Compel Production is brought with  respect to subpoenas issued to (1) Sammy Hakim; (2) Bank Of Hope; (3) Bank Of  America, N.A.; (4) Capital One, N.A.; (5) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Newrez, LLC;  (6) Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.; (7) Chex Systems, Inc.; and (8) Lexisnexis Risk  Solutions, Inc. Judgment Creditor moves to compel production of these documents  to demonstrate that Judgment Debtor’s spouse, Sammy Hakim, commingled funds  from alleged separate property.The Amended  Supplemental Declaration attaches copies of Judgment Debtor’s bank records from  Bank of America showing numerous deposits into Judgment Debtor’s account by  Hakim and Cotner Avenue, LLC. (Amended Supp. Decl., filed 01/18/24, Exh. A, pp.  3, 7, 13, 17; Exh. B, pp. 3, 12, 18, 19, 26, 33, 34, 40, 46, 52, 61, 67, 75,  87, 99, 109, 115, 119.) These transfers took place after Judgment Debtor and  Hakim were married on March 5, 2022. (Ibid.) This evidence supports  Judgment Creditor’s request to compel third party Bank of America’s production  of documents based on commingling of Hakim’s purported separate property  pertaining to the company Cotner Avenue, LLC with the community estate. Family  Code section 910, subdivision (a) states in relevant part: “Except as otherwise  expressly provided by statute, the community estate is liable for a debt  incurred by either spouse before or during marriage, regardless of which spouse  has the management and control of the property and regardless of whether one or  both spouses are parties to the debt or to a judgment for the debt.” Hakim’s  opposition filed on December 11, 2024 does not address this statute.  Furthermore, Bank of Hope previously admitted that it has records  relevant to the subpoena directed to the entity Cotner Avenue, LLC. (Bank of Hope Response, filed 11/13/23, Karasik Decl., ¶7  and Exh. 5.)Based on this evidence, Judgment Creditor has demonstrated a  basis to compel production of documents from Bank of America, NA and Bank of  Hope pursuant to the subpoenas issued by Judgment Creditor.ConclusionJudgment Creditor Andrew Krain’s Second Renewed Motion to  Compel Third Party Production of Documents is GRANTED WITH RESPECT TO BANK OF  AMERICA, NA AND BANK OF HOPE. THE MOTION IS DENIED AS TO THE OTHER ENTITIES.Court clerk to give notice. (2) MOTION TO DETERMINE AND APPLY COMMUNITY PROPERTY INTEREST  TENTATIVE RULING:Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain’s  Motion to Determine and Apply Community Property Interest is CONTINUED TO APRIL 16, 2025 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.

OPPOSITION AND REPLY PAPERS MAY BE FILED AND  SERVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.  ANALYSIS: Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain (“Judgment Creditor”), in pro  per, filed the instant action for fraud against Alina Grygoryshyna (“Judgment  Debtor”), also in pro per, on July 6, 2020.

(Ibid.) Judgment Creditor filed a renewed Motion to Compel Third  Parties to Produce Documents (“the Renewed Motion”) on May 20, 2024. Bank of  Hope filed an opposition on May 30, 2024. On June 12, 2024, the Court heard  oral argument from both parties and then denied the Renewed Motion to Compel  Third Parties to Produce Documents. On August 20, 2024, Judgment Creditor filed a second,  renewed Motion to Compel Third Parties to Produce Documents (“the Second  Renewed Motion”). The Second Renewed Motion is set to be heard concurrently  with the instant Motion to Determine and Apply Community Property Interest,  filed on November 18, 2024. No opposition to the instant Motion has been filed.  Discussion Judgment Creditor requests the Court (1) determine community  property interest in Hakim’s personal bank accounts at Bank of America, N.A.  and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and order said interest to be applied toward the  satisfaction of this money judgment; (2) determine community property interest  in Cotner Avenue, LLC’s business bank accounts at Bank of Hope and order said  interest to be applied toward the satisfaction of this money judgment; and (3) issue  an order authorizing a levy on Cotner Avenue, LLC’s business bank accounts. The  Motion is made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 708.180, which  states in relevant part: (a) Subject to subdivision (b), if a  third person examined pursuant to Section 708.120 claims an interest in the  property adverse to the judgment debtor or denies the debt, the court may, if  the judgment creditor so requests, determine the interests in the property or  the existence of the debt. The determination is conclusive as to the parties to  the proceeding and the third person, but an appeal may be taken from the  determination. The court may grant a continuance for a reasonable time for  discovery proceedings, the production of evidence, or other preparation for the  hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.180, subd. (a).) The Court having  just granted, in part, Judgment Creditor’s Second Renewed Motion to Compel  Third Parties to Produce Documents with respect to the personal consumer  records of Sammy Hakim and records of the entity Cotner Avenue, LLC, finds that  a continuance of this request is necessary for the production of these  documents. It is not possible to determine at this time the community property  interest in Hakim’s personal bank accounts at Bank of America, N.A. and Wells  Fargo Bank, N.A., or in Cotner Avenue, LLC’s business bank accounts at Bank of  Hope. The Court must review the documents produced pursuant to the third party  subpoenas prior to making these determinations. Conclusion Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain’s  Motion to Determine and Apply Community Property Interest is CONTINUED TO APRIL  16, 2025 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY MARCH  12, 2025, JUDGMENT CREDITOR IS TO FILE A SUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION WITH THE  SUBPOENAED DOCUMENTS ATTACHED.
