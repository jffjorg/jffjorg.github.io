And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Aglo Management, LLC's motion to release the mechanic's lien filed by Shmuel Cohen. The Judge found that Aglo Management, LLC did not address the fact that Shmuel Cohen failed to commence an action to enforce the lien within the required timeframe, as required by Civil Code section 8480. Additionally, the Judge found that Aglo Management, LLC's reliance on Civil Code section 8461, which pertains to an action to enforce a lien, was misplaced, as that section does not indicate that failure to file and serve a notice of lis pendens is grounds to release the mechanic's lien. The Judge also noted that Aglo Management, LLC was not prejudiced by the supplemental briefing schedule ordered on November 25, 2024.
