  Case Number:  23SMCV04777    Hearing Date:   May 14, 2024    Dept:  N TENTATIVE RULINGPlaintiff Tony Lewis’ Application for Default Judgment is CONTINUED to a date to be determined to allow Plaintiff to submit supplemental evidence as set forth below.First, there is an issue with the amount sought, as paragraph 19 of the complaint states that Plaintiff is seeking $55,000 in past-due rent, while the judgment seeks $64,000. Plaintiff sought $64,000 in the 3-day notice (see also Compl. ¶ 12), but Code of Civil Procedure section 580, subdivision (a), makes clear that the relief granted to the plaintiff in a default judgment cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint. Thus, Plaintiff needs to amend the judgment to seek only $55,000, or Plaintiff must amend paragraph 19 of the complaint to seek $64,000 in past-due rent.Second, it is not clear how Plaintiff Tony Lewis has the personal knowledge necessary to authenticate the subject exhibits given that they were between a different party, Bodie Property Holdings, LLC, and Plaintiff was not a party to the agreement.Third, Plaintiff represents that he was assigned the right to collect all past, present, and future rents due from Defendant Andre Sion Khalili, but Plaintiff has provided no proof of the assignment.Fourth, it is not clear how Plaintiff would be entitled to recover attorney fees from Defendant given that the lease only provides for recovery of fees for an action between the parties identified in the lease, and Plaintiff is not identified in the lease.
