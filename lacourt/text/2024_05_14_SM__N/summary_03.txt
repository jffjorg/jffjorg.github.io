```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Defendant Jean-Pierre Murray's motion to quash service of summons and complaint. The Defendant claimed that Plaintiffs Richard N. Husky and Kevan J. Husky did not serve him properly, citing that he was not personally served or served by substituted service. However, the court found that the Plaintiffs' counsel applied to the court for an order to serve the summons and complaint by posting, which was granted. The court relied on the declaration of diligence provided by a registered process server, which demonstrated sufficient attempts at personal service or substituted service. The court found that the process server's statement of posting was accurate, and therefore denied the Defendant's motion to quash service.
