REASONING
 
On April
30, 2024, Defendants/Cross-Complainants Yigal Hay and Lillian Hay filed their
Motion to Set Aside Default and for Leave to Defend Action. The motion caption
indicates that the motion will be heard on September 5, 2024. However, the
Court’s docket also shows a hearing date of May 14, 2024 for the same motion.
The motion was not timely filed to be heard on May 14, 2024, as it must have
been filed 16 days before the hearing (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b)), and
because the motion caption indicates the hearing will occur on September 5,
2024, Plaintiff Arman Solimani also lacks notice of the hearing date set for
May 14, 2024. Accordingly, Defendants/Cross-Complainants Yigal Hay and Lillian
Hay’s Motion to Set Aside Default and for Leave to Defend Action set for hearing
on this date is taken off calendar. The motion remains on calendar on September
5, 2024.
