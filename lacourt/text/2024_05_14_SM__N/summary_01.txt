And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by the Judge continues the Plaintiff's application for default judgment to a date to be determined. The Judge has several concerns regarding the Plaintiff's application, including:

* The amount of past-due rent sought in the judgment, which exceeds the amount stated in the complaint.
* The Plaintiff's lack of personal knowledge of the exhibits submitted, as they were between a different party and the Plaintiff was not a party to the agreement.
* The lack of proof of assignment of rights from the original party to the Plaintiff.
* The Plaintiff's claim for attorney fees, which is not supported by the lease agreement.

The Judge orders the Plaintiff to provide supplemental evidence to address these concerns.
