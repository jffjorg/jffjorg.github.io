the types of claims the company may bring against the employee is set forth at Page
2 “Interim Relief”:
 
Interim Relief

 
For claims
involving alleged breach of Employee’s non-competition, non-solicitation, fiduciary,
or confidentiality obligations, as well as claims involving trademarks, trade secrets,
business know-how or intellectual property, either the Employee or the Company may,
without inconsistency with this Policy, apply to any court of competent jurisdiction
and seek interim provisional, injunctive, or other equitable relief until the arbitration
award is rendered or the Covered Claim is otherwise resolved.
 
               To the extent that an employee breaches
a contractual obligation, or misuses information obtained as an employee, these
claims would be “regarding or arising from the employment relationship,” such that
the company would be obligated to arbitrate such claims. Notably, Civ. Proc. Code,
§ 1281.8 recognizes that provisional relief to preserve the effectiveness of an
arbitral award is permissible.
