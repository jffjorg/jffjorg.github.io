And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the renewed application for admission pro hac vice of Sangyoon Nathan Park to represent Plaintiffs Engineer.ai Corporation, Engineer.ai Global Ltd., and Engineer.ai India Private Ltd. in this action. Park had previously applied for admission pro hac vice but was denied due to his engagement in "substantial business, professional, or other activities in the State of California." In this renewed application, Park declares that three California matters all arise from a single dispute and has withdrawn his application in the fourth case due to unrelated internal staffing needs at the firm. The Court finds that Park's disclosures are consistent with local counsel's representations and will now approve his pro hac vice admission in this case.
