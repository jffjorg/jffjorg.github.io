And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying without prejudice a motion for appointment of an elisor to sign documents necessary for the sale of real property. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs, Nate Hasper and Bridget Wallace, in their action against Galin Petkov and Atanas Petrov for breach of contract and specific performance. The court held a non-jury trial and issued a Statement of Decision and judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. However, the court found that some of the documents submitted by the plaintiffs are incomplete and require additional information before the sale can be finalized. The court denied the motion without prejudice to the plaintiffs submitting complete documents for signature. The judge has given notice to the parties to submit on this tentative ruling and has indicated that appearances before the court are not required unless a companion hearing is also on calendar.
