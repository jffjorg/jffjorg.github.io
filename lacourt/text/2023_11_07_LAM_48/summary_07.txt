And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to produce her devices for inspection of relevant messages. The request for inspection asks the plaintiff to produce all devices in her possession, custody, or control for inspection of messages relating to the defendant and the alleged incidents. The judge finds that the request for all messages prior to the alleged incidents is overbroad and not relevant to the claims or damages. The judge orders the plaintiff to permit inspection of her devices for messages relating to the alleged incidents and any damages she claims to have suffered as a result of the defendant's conduct.
