And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Thomas D. Long in a case between Djamileh Mahjoubi (Plaintiff) and David E. Fermelia, MD (Defendant). The case involves a dispute over the scope of discovery in a medical malpractice lawsuit. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant's deposition subpoenas are overbroad and violate the court's protective order. The Defendant asserts that the subpoenas are necessary to discover relevant medical records related to the Plaintiff's claimed injuries.

The court has granted the Plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoenas in part, modifying the request to seek production of records related to the Plaintiff's claimed injuries and records from after September 2019. The court has ordered Eiriny T. Eskander, MD, Marshall Grossman, MD, and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to produce the requested records within 60 days.

The court has denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the Defendant had a legitimate discovery interest in the Plaintiff's medical records. The court has also denied the Plaintiff's request for attorney fees, as the Plaintiff is a self-represented litigant.
