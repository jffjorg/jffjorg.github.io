And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Hon. Thomas D. Long in a case between Charles Christian Hostetter and Ida Marie Brun Folmann (plaintiffs) and An Feng aka Andrew Feng, Capriwell Construction Inc., Capriwell Development and Construction, Michelle Jones, Graff Real Estate dba Ashby & Graff Real Estate, and Philippe Til aka Philippe Til Tomaszewski (defendants). The plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint against the defendants, and the cross-complainants (Michelle Jones and Graff Real Estate dba Ashby & Graff Real Estate) filed a cross-complaint against the cross-defendant (Philippe Til aka Philippe Til Tomaszewski) seeking equitable indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief. The cross-defendant filed a demurrer to the cross-complaint, arguing that the pleading is uncertain and fails to state a cause of action. The judge has ruled that the demurrer will be overruled, as the cross-complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a cause of action for equitable indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief. The judge has ordered the cross-defendant to file an answer within 10 days.
