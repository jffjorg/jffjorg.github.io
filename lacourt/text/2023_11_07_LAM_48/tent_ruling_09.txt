  CASE NO.: 23STCV04727
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RELATING CASES; GRANTING
  MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 7, 2023



 
On March 3, 2023, JPMorgan filed this interpleader action
against Keith W. Furlong, David J. Parsons, Golden Eagle Aviation Group Inc., and
Karena P. Chuang.
On March 23, 2023, JPMorgan filed a Notice
of Related Case, identifying Case No. 18STCP02593 (where judgment was previously
entered) as related.  The Court later related
the cases.
On October 2, 2023, Furlong
and Parsons moved to consolidate this action with Case No. 23STCV14344.  JPMorgan filed a Notice of Non-Opposition.
“When
actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court,
it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the
actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1048, subd. (a).)  The purpose of consolidation is to enhance trial
court efficiency by avoiding unnecessary duplication of evidence and the danger
of inconsistent adjudications.  (See Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon Shield Claimants
Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978-979.)
Under
Los Angeles Superior Court Rule 3.3, subdivision (g), “A motion to consolidate two
or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in different
departments, have been related into a single department, or if the cases were already
assigned to that department.”
Case
No. 18STCP02593 and Case No. 23STCV14344 are already related.  This case has been related with Case No. 18STCP02593,
but not with Case No. 23STCV14344 (nor has a Notice of Related Case been filed for
that case).
Accordingly,
on its own motion the Court finds that Case Nos. 18STCP02593, 23STCV04727, and 23STCV14344
are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).
With
respect to consolidation, this case and Case No. 23STCV14344 both have the same
$303,383.64 at issue.  Case No. 23STCV14344
alleges withholding and fraudulent conveyance of funds that belong to Furlong and
Parsons.  In this action, JPMorgan asks that
the Interpleader Defendants be ordered to interplead and litigate their respective
rights to those funds, which are being held by JPMorgan pursuant to a notice of
levy.
No
oppositions were filed, and JPMorgan specifically stated that it does not oppose
this motion.
Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED.  Case No. 23STCV04727
and Case No. 23STCV14344 are consolidated. 
Case No. 23STCV04727 is the lead case, and all future pleadings must be filed
under this case number.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
