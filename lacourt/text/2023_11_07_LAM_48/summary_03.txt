And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The Plaintiff, Basilia Puerto, filed the original complaint on February 28, 2022, and filed a first amended complaint on July 27, 2022. On October 6, 2023, the Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, which adds specific facts supporting the allegations of malice, fraud, and oppression, punitive damages, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Plaintiff discovered these facts through Defendant's discovery responses on June 15, 2023. The Defendant argued that the request for leave to amend is not timely and that they will be prejudiced by the significant delay before their anticipated demurrer to the second amended complaint and anticipated motion to strike can be heard. However, the Judge found that there is no showing of prejudice and granted the motion. The Plaintiff is ordered to file and serve the second amended complaint within five days.
