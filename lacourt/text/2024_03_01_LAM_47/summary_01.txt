And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is related to a motion to quash a deposition subpoena for business records in an employment discrimination action. The plaintiff, Stewart Marroquin, was terminated from his job at CS Hotel LLC due to alleged harassment and lack of reasonable accommodations for his physical disability. The defendant, CS Hotel LLC, served a deposition subpoena on Santa Monica College Admissions & Records to obtain educational records related to Marroquin's employment. Marroquin objected to the production of these records, citing privacy concerns. The court found that the defendant had demonstrated the relevance of the request for Marroquin's class schedules and attendance records, but not for other educational records. The court granted the motion to quash as to the course syllabi and content, transcripts, requested accommodations, attendance-related communications relating to class attendance, or any other educational records, other than his class schedules and attendance records, based solely on Marroquin's relevance and overbreadth objections, and otherwise denied the motion.
