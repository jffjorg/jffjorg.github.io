And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling on this case is that the demurrer to the first cause of action (breach of contract) is overruled, while the demurrer to the second and third causes of action (negligence and fraud) is sustained with 10 days leave to amend.

The court has found that Plaintiff has properly pled a contract between herself and Defendant Framework, but the enforceability of the contract remains an open question.

The court has also found that Plaintiff has failed to properly plead the necessary facts to establish a negligence claim, specifically that the Defendants had knowledge of Amrusi's unfitness before he disappeared.

Additionally, the court has ruled that Plaintiff has removed the respondeat superior allegations from the SAC, which prevents an alter ego recovery against Defendants Cohen, Alcantara, and Ezrachi.

Overall, the court is giving Plaintiff an opportunity to amend the SAC to fix these issues before the case proceeds further.
