 Case Number:  24AVCP00260    Hearing Date:   December 3, 2024    Dept:  A14 Background
 
On October 8, 2024, Petitioner
Transamerica Life Insurance Company (“Transamerica”) filed a petition for a transfer of structured settlement payment
rights belonging to Fabiola Castro. Specifically, Transamerica seeks the
transfer of $175,000.00 in future annuity payment rights to be paid on August
7, 2028 and August 7, 2033, the present discounted value of which is $125,924.27,
to be transferred in exchange for a $97,972.00 lump sum payment to Castro. 
 
 
Analysis
 
Legal Standard - A transfer of structured settlement payment
rights is void unless a court reviews and approves the transfer and finds that
(a) the transfer of the structured settlement payment rights is fair and
reasonable and in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the
welfare and support of his or her dependents, and (b) the transfer complies
with the requirements of Insurance Code Sections 10134 to 10139.5, will not
contravene other applicable law, and that the court has reviewed and approved
the transfer as provided in Section 10139.5. (See Ins. Code, § 10137, subds.
(a)-(b).)
 
Section
10136 Requirements – No direct or indirect transfer of
structured settlement payment rights by a payee to which Section 10136 applies
shall be effective, and no structured settlement obligor or annuity issuer
shall be required to make any payment directly or indirectly to a transferee,
unless all of the provisions of Section 10136 of the Insurance Code are
satisfied. (Ins. Code, § 10136, subd.
(a).)
 
As a threshold matter, the Court
notes that the petition and accompanying documents redact certain information
that is necessary for the Court to determine whether the transfer complies with
all the requirements of Insurance Code
Sections 10134 to 10139.5. 
 
First, with the current
redactions, the Court cannot verify that the transfer agreement satisfies the
disclosure form requirements set out in Insurance Code section 10136,
subdivision (b). (See Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (b); see also Petition, Ex. G,
California Disclosure Statement.). 
 
Second, the
transfer agreement does satisfy the transfer-agreement requirements set out in
Insurance Code Section 10136, subdivision (c) because the transfer agreement
contains all the necessary language required from this statutory subdivision. (See Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (c); see also
Petition, Ex. F, Purchase and Sale Agreement, §§ 4 [requirements (1) through (12)],
p. 7 [requirement (13)].)
 
Third, the transfer agreement does not
violate Section 10138 as none of the contents prohibited by this statutory
section are contained in the transfer agreement. (See Ins. Code, § 10136, subd.
(d); see also Petition, Ex. F, Purchase and Sale Agreement.) 
 
Fourth, the Court requires
confirmation that Fabiola Castro has not sought cancellation of the transfer
agreement prior to the date of this hearing. (See Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (e).). 
 
Accordingly, the Court finds that the Transamerica’s proposed transfer of
Fabiola Castro’s settlement rights does not satisfy the
requirements of Insurance Code section 10136 (a), because the petition does
not satisfy the requirements of Insurance Code section 10136 subdivisions (b)
or (e). 
 
Section 10139.5 Requirements -
A direct or indirect transfer of structured settlement payment rights is not
effective and a structured settlement obligor or annuity issuer is not required
to make any payment directly or indirectly to any transferee of structured
settlement payment rights unless the transfer has been approved in advance in a
final court order based on express written findings by the court subject to
Section 10139.5. (See Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (a).)
 
Insurance Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)
 
The Court similarly does not find
that the petition satisfies the entirety of the findings requirement set out in
Insurance Code section 10139.5, subdivisions (a)(1) to (a)(6). Each findings
requirement is discussed in turn: 
 
(1) The Court does not have
sufficient information to find that the transfer is fair and reasonable in the
best interests of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support of the
payee’s dependents. Fabiola Castro is collecting $97,972.00 for future payments of $175,000.00, the discounted present
value of which is $125,924.27. Fabiola Castro is currently unemployed due to an arthritis disability. She is married
and her husband earns $40,000 per year. If the transfer is approved, Castro
intends to use the proceeds to pay credit card debt, pay back loans from family
members, purchase a used vehicle, start a nail salon business, save for a
future home purchase, and put the remaining funds in an emergency savings
account. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(1) [framed by Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subds. (b)(1)-(15)]; see also Petition,
Ex. F, Purchase and Sale Agreement, pp. 2-3; Ex. H, Decl., ¶¶ 12-13, 15.)
 
The petition is not clear as to Fabiola Castro’s dependent. (Compare Petition
¶ 10(B) [“Payee has one dependent”], with Ex. H, Decl. [“…we have no
dependents.”].) Additionally, in determining whether the proposed transfer
should be approved, the Court is required to consider the totality of the
circumstances (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (b)(1) [“…the court shall
consider the totality of the circumstances, including, but not limited to, all
of the following: [15 considerations]”.) The redactions throughout the petition prevent the Court from adequately doing
so.    
 
(2) The payee has been advised in
writing by the transferee to seek independent legal or financial advice
regarding the transfer and has either received that advice or knowingly waived,
in writing, the opportunity to receive the advice. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (a)(2); see also Petition, Ex. G, California
Disclosure Statement [Payee was advised to seek independent professional
advice]; Ex. H, Decl. ¶ 10 [“In the Disclosure Statement, Transamerica Life
advised me in writing to seek independent professional advice regarding the
legal, tax and financial consequences of the Agreement and the proposed
transfer and I have received that advice or knowingly waived, in writing the
opportunity to receive the advice.”]; Ex I, Independent Professional Advice
Acknowledgement.) 
 
(3) The transferee, i.e.
Transamerica, has not complied with the notification requirements pursuant to
paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), and as discussed above, the Court does not
find that Transamerica has complied with
the requirements of Insurance Code section 10136. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(3); see
also Ins. Code, § 10136, discussion supra & Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)
infra.) 
 
(4) The transfer does not
contravene any applicable statute or the order of any court or other government
authority. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (a)(4).)
 
(5) The payee, Fabiola Castro, understands the terms sets
forth in the disclosure statement required by Section 10136. However, the Court
does not make an express finding that Castro understands the terms of the
transfer agreement. (See Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (a)(5); see also Ex. H Decl., ¶ 7 [“I carefully reviewed
the Disclosure Statement and fully and completely understand all terms of the
Disclosure Statement.”].) 
 
(6) The Court does not make an
express finding that Fabiola Castro
understands and does not wish to exercise the right to cancel the transfer
agreement. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (a)(6).) 
 
Insurance Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)
 
The petition does not satisfy all the payee information required from
Section 10139.5, subdivision (c). Specifically, the Court notes that the payee
has not sufficiently provided the information required in Insurance Code section
10139.5, subdivisions (c)(2)-(5).
 
Insurance Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)
 
The petition does not satisfy the
requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (f). Specifically, the Court notes
that payee has not satisfied the requirements of Insurance Code section 10139.5, subdivision (f)(2)(J)-(K). 
 
Insurance Code, § 10139.5, subd. (g)
 
The petition satisfies the
requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (g) requiring that transferees
bear the costs of transfer petitions of structured settlement rights. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (g); see also
Petition, Ex. F, Purchase and Sale Contract, p. 2 [“An itemized listing
of all commissions, estimated fees, costs, expenses, and charges payable by you
or deductible from the gross amount otherwise payable to you is as follows:
NONE”] & Ex. G, California
Disclosure Statement, p. 2 [“To figure the net amount we are paying, we
have charged you for the following expenses: NONE for a total of $0 in expenses.”].)
 
Insurance Code, § 10139.5, subd. (h)
 
The petition satisfies the requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision
(h) because, when the petition was filed, Transamerica advised the payee of the
right to seek independent counsel and financial advice in connection with this
transfer petition and advised the payee of the right to a reimbursement of
$1,500 for incurring such costs. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (h); see also
Petition, Ex. G, California Disclosure Statement [Payee was advised to seek
independent professional advice]; Ex. H, Decl. ¶ 10 [“In the Disclosure
Statement, Transamerica Life advised me in writing to seek independent
professional advice regarding the legal, tax and financial consequences of the
Agreement and the proposed transfer and I have received that advice or
knowingly waived, in writing the opportunity to receive the advice.”]; Ex I.,
Independent Professional Advice Acknowledgement.)
 
Based on the foregoing, Transamerica
Life Insurance Company’s Petition for the Approval of a Transfer of Structured
Settlement Payment Rights is denied due to the deficiencies as described above.

 
Conclusion
 
Petitioner/Transferee Transamerica Life Insurance
Company’s Petition for the Approval of a Transfer of Structured Settlement
Payment Rights is DENIED.
