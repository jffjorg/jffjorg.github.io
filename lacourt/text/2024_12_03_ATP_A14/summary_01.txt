And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, for summary adjudication. The plaintiff brought a lawsuit against the defendant, alleging breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The defendant argued that there was no breach of contract because the plaintiff's loss was not covered by the insurance policy.

The court found that the defendant had established that there was no direct physical loss, which is a requirement for coverage under the policy. The court noted that the policy does not define "direct physical loss," but that it is generally understood to mean a physical alteration of the property that renders it unsatisfactory for future use.

The court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant on the first cause of action, finding that the plaintiff had not met its burden of proving that the claimed loss fell within the coverage provided by the policy's insuring clause. The court also granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant on the second cause of action, finding that an insured cannot maintain a claim for tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing absent a covered loss.

The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any further evidence or arguments presented at the hearing.
