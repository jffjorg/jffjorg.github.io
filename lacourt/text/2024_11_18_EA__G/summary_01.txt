Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of the Kiewit-Parsons Defendants to strike punitive damages from the Third Amended Complaint (TAC) filed by the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs had alleged that the Kiewit-Parsons Defendants were liable for punitive damages due to their alleged negligence and malice in designing and constructing the road. However, the judge found that the Plaintiffs' allegations were insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge noted that the Plaintiffs had failed to allege any facts demonstrating how the Kiewit-Parsons Defendants knew that their actions would cause harm to others. Additionally, the judge found that the Plaintiffs' allegations were too general and did not meet the requirements for punitive damages outlined in California Civil Code section 3294. The judge granted the motion with 20 days leave to amend, giving the Plaintiffs an opportunity to re-allege the claims with sufficient detail.
