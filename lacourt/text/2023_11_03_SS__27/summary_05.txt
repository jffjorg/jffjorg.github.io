And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Maria Margarita Carranza vs. El Super, et al. The case involves a premises liability action, where Carranza alleges that she suffered an injury when her foot became caught on a broken bar or pipe under a refrigerator at an El Super grocery store on June 15, 2020. The defendants, Chedraui USA, Inc. dba El Super and Gallagher Bassett Services, Inc., had filed a motion to dismiss, which Carranza responded to by filing a motion to dismiss the defendants' motion to dismiss. The judge has denied the motion to dismiss, citing two defects: lack of proof of service showing the motion was served on the defendants, and the fact that there is no such motion as a motion to dismiss another party's motion to dismiss. The judge encourages Carranza to utilize lawyer referral services and sets a hearing date for November 3, 2023.
