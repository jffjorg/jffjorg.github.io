On October 1, 2020, Plaintiff Isaac Cortez filed this action
against defendants Desiree Hindman (“Hindman”), Sevak Dersarkissian, (“Sevak”),
Selina Dersarkissian, and Lyft, Inc., for injuries arising from an October 4,
2018 motor vehicle accident.   
 
On August 4, 2022, Sevak filed a Cross-Complaint against
Hindman and Does 1 through 100 for equitable indemnity and declaratory relief.  Default
was entered against Hindman on May 1, 2023. 

 
On August 3, 2023, Sevak filed an application for default
judgment against Hindman.  
 
Upon review, Sevak’s application is deficient for the
following reasons:
 
·        
Doe defendants have not been
dismissed.
·        
A proposed judgment (JUD-100) has
not been submitted with the application.
 
Accordingly, Sevak Dersarkissian’s application for default
judgment is DENIED without prejudice.  The
Status Conference Re: Review of Default Judgment for December 8, 2023 at
08:30 AM in Department 27 at Spring Street Courthouse.  Plaintiff is to
resubmit their default judgment application no later than 5 court days before
the conference. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
