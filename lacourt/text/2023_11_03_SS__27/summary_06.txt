And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Sharri Shaw v. CVS Pharmacy, Inc. The case concerns a mis-filled medical prescription and the plaintiff's subsequent complaint for negligence. The defendant, Garfield Beach CVS, LLC, has filed an unopposed demurrer with a motion to strike, arguing that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations. The Judge agrees with the defendant and sustains the demurrer. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's complaint was filed more than two years after the alleged incident, which is beyond the statute of limitations for a negligence claim. The Judge also notes that the plaintiff had one year from the date of discovery to initiate the action, but failed to do so. The Judge denies the plaintiff's request to amend the complaint and orders the defendant to give notice.
