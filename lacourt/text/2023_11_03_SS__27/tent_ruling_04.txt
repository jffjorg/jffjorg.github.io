EXPEDITED
PETITIONS TO APPROVE MINOR’S COMPROMISE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Petitioner
Juana Martinez Rodriguez
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 
            Claimants
Robert Grijalva Jr. and Melis Grijalva, minors, by and through their parent and
guardian ad litem, Petitioner, Juana
Martinez Rodriguez, have agreed to
settle their claims against Defendants Angel Chavez and Uber Technologies, Inc.
 
            Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The petition must be verified and “must
contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing on the
reasonableness of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition.”¿ (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)¿¿
 
            The
Petitions cannot be approved.¿They are filed as expedited approvals of
compromises and indicate that they qualify under Item 3g(1).¿ However, the
amount of the settlement payable to Claimants and all other persons named in
Item 13 exceeds $50,000.¿ (See Items 12-13.)¿¿ The Court also notes that the
Petitions indicate at Item 19a that there is a guardianship of the estate of
each minor.  However, Petitioner provides
only the case number for this action.  If
there is no guardianship, Petitioner is to select Item 19b and one of the
sub-options therein.
 
            Based on the foregoing, the Petitions are DENIED without
prejudice.  Petitioner must reserve hearings for a Petition to Confirm a
Minor’s Compromise for each Claimant and use Form MC-350.  The Court will not require Petitioner’s and
Claimant’s attendance at the hearing.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952,
subd. (a).)  
¿ 
Moving party to give notice.
