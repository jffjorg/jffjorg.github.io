DEMURRER
WITH MOTION TO STRIKE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Garfield Beach CVS, LLC
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          FACTUAL AND
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
            This action arises from an allegedly mis-filled medical prescription.  Plaintiff alleges that on October 11, 2019, a
CVS Pharmacy filled her prescription for acetaminophen with amlodipine
besylate, which is a medication used for blood pressure.  
 
            On October
17, 2022, Plaintiff, Sharri Shaw, filed a Judicial Council form complaint against
Defendant, Garfield Beach CVS, LLC (erroneously sued as “CVS Pharmacy, Inc.”) for
Negligence.   
 
The demurrer is unopposed.[1]
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD FOR DEMURRER  
 
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and
will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on its face.  (City
of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)  “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact
or law.  We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and also consider
matters which may be judicially noticed.  [Citation.]”  (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604
[“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable
they may be”].)  Allegations are to be liberally construed.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 452.)  In construing the allegations, the court is to give
effect to specific factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent
general or conclusory allegations.  (Financial Corporation of America
v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd 764, 769.)   Judicial
Council forms are not immune to demurrer.  (People ex rel. Dept. of Transportation v.
Superior Court (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1480, 1486.) 
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10,
subd. (e).)  “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where
a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.”  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California,
Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)   


Where the complaint contains substantial factual
allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to
meet, a demurrer for uncertainty will be overruled or plaintiff will be given
leave to amend.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)  Leave to amend must be allowed where there
is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.  (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on the complainant
to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully.  (Ibid.)  
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
A.  Meet and Confer
 
Defense counsel has complied with the meet and confer
requirement.¿ (See Declaration of Arianna M. Peregretti.)
 
B.  Demurrer
 
Defendant argues
Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the statute of limitations.  The Court agrees.  The statute of limitations for an action for
injury to an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another is two
years.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 335.1.)  Here, Plaintiff alleges that
Defendant mis-filled her prescription on October 11, 2019.  Plaintiff filed her Complaint more than two
years later on October 17, 2022.  
Even if construed
as stating a claim for professional negligence, Plaintiff’s Complaint is
untimely.  In an action for injury or
death against a health care provider based upon such person’s alleged
professional negligence, the time for the commencement of action shall be three
years after the date of injury or one year after the plaintiff discovers, or through
the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the injury, whichever
occurs first.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 340.5.) 
Here, Plaintiff alleges that she learned of Defendant’s error with her
prescription on October 16, 2019.  As
such, Plaintiff had one year from the date of October 16, 2019, to initiate
this action.  Plaintiff does not offer
any argument to the contrary.
 
IV.        CONCLUSION
            
Accordingly, the unopposed demurrer is SUSTAINED.  Leave to amend is DENIED.
 
Demurring party to give notice.
