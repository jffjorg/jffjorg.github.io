And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is for Case Number 20STCV37756, Isaac Cortez vs. Desiree Hindman, et al. The case involves an October 4, 2018 motor vehicle accident and subsequent legal actions. Sevak Dersarkissian, the defendant/cross-complainant, filed an application for default judgment against Hindman on August 3, 2023. However, the application is deficient because the Doe defendants have not been dismissed and a proposed judgment (JUD-100) has not been submitted. Therefore, the application for default judgment is denied without prejudice. A status conference to review default judgment is scheduled for December 8, 2023.
