And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the unopposed motions to compel discovery responses, deem request for admissions admitted, and impose sanctions. The Defendant, Avis Rent a Car System, LLC, seeks to compel the Plaintiffs, Agusto Garcia and Adoracion Garcia, to provide responses to discovery requests. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs have failed to serve responses and therefore grants the motions. The Court also imposes sanctions against the Plaintiffs and their counsel in the amount of $1,160.

The Court orders the Plaintiffs to provide verified, objection-free responses to the Defendant's discovery requests and deems the request for admissions admitted against the Plaintiffs. The Court also grants the request for sanctions and orders the Plaintiffs and their counsel to pay sanctions in the amount of $580 each.

The parties are ordered to provide discovery responses and pay sanctions within 30 days of the date of this order.
