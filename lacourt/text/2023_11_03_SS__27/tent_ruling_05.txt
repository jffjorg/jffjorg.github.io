CASE:                                Maria Margarita Carranza v. El Super, et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 22STCV17802
 





















 
MOTION
TO DISMISS DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS



 
MOVING PARTY:                   Plaintiff
Maria Margarita Carranza
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
            Plaintiff Maria Margarita Carranza, brings this premises
liability action against Defendants, Chedraui USA, Inc. dba El Super (“El
Super”) (erroneously sued as “El Super”) and Gallagher Bassett Services, Inc.
(“GBS”) (erroneously sued as Gallagher Bassett, Svcs, Inc. D1-10).  Plaintiff alleges that on June 15, 2020, she
suffered an injury when her foot became caught on a broken bar or pipe under a
refrigerator in the meat department of an El Super grocery store.
 
On August 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed this Motion to Dismiss
Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss.  The
motion is defective for two reasons. 
First, there is no proof of service showing this motion was served on
Defendants.  (See Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 8.817, subd. (a)(1)-(2).)  Second,
there is no such motion as a motion to dismiss another party’s motion to
dismiss.  
 
            Accordingly,
the motion to dismiss is DENIED. 
Plaintiff is encouraged to utilize the lawyer referral services
available on the State Bar’s website (https://www.calbar.ca.gov) and the
Self-Help page on the Superior Court’s website
(https://www.lacourt.org).  
 
            Moving
party to give notice.
