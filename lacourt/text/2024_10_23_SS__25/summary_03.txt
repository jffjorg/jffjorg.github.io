The judge rules in favor of the defendant's motion to compel plaintiff's verified responses to discovery requests. The plaintiff failed to provide verified responses despite an extension, and the judge finds that the plaintiff's unverified responses are legally insufficient. The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel and orders the plaintiff to provide verified responses within 30 days.

The judge also grants the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $750, finding that the plaintiff's failure to provide verified responses constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. The sanctions are to be paid by the plaintiff and the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days of notice of this order.
