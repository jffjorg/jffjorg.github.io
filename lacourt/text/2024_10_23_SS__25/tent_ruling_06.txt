 
BACKGROUND
 
On July
28, 2023, Plaintiff Alternative Lending Holdings Trust II (“Plaintiff”) filed
this action against Defendant Ernest Miller (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 5,
inclusive, asserting one cause of action for breach of written contract. 
 
The Complaint alleges the following. “Defendant(s)
(hereinafter the ‘Defendant’) entered into a Borrower Agreement (hereinafter
the ‘Borrower Agreement’) and Loan Agreement and Promissory Note (hereinafter the
‘Promissory Note’) with WebBank, a Utah-Chartered FDIC-insured industrial Bank (hereinafter
‘WebBank’) for the Loan ID Number XXXXX0261 (hereinafter the ‘Loan’).” (Compl.,
¶ 1.) The Promissory Note and the Borrower Agreement were purchased by
Upgrade, Inc. and were subsequently sold and assigned to Plaintiff. (Compl., ¶ 10.) “On or about May 05, 2022 Plaintiff’s
predecessor issued and funded the loan request of the Defendants.” (Compl., ¶ 19.) Defendant defaulted by failing to
make the required payments. (Compl., ¶ 20.)
There is due and owing the principal sum of $7,039.21. (Compl., ¶ 22.)
 
On March
27, 2024, the parties filed a Stipulated Settlement Agreement in which they
allowed the Court to retain jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6.
 
On April
2, 2024, the Court entered an order dismissing the case without prejudice. 
 
On April
12, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to vacate the dismissal and enter
judgment pursuant to the Stipulated Settlement Agreement. 
 
As of
October 21, 2024, no opposition to the motion has been filed. 
 
MOVING PARTY’S
POSITION
            
Defendant defaulted
on his payments under the Stipulated Settlement Agreement. Defendant made one
payment of $215 on March 14, 2024, and then stopped making payments. According
to the agreement, if Defendant defaulted, a judgment in the full amount claimed
in the Complaint less any amounts already paid would be entered.  Therefore, pursuant to the agreement’s terms,
Plaintiff is requesting that the Court enter a judgment of $7,187.21,
consisting of a pre-judgment amount of $7,039.21 and costs of $363 minus $215. 
 
OPPOSITION

 
None.
 
REPLY
 
            None.
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          MOTION
TO ENFORCE STIPULATED JUDGMENT      
A.    Legal Standard
            Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 (“CCP section
664.6”) states: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the
parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a) [emphasis added].) 
 
“On a motion to enforce, the court must determine whether
the settlement agreement is valid and binding. [Citation.] The court assesses
whether the material terms of the settlement were reasonably well-defined and
certain, and whether the parties expressly acknowledged that they understood
and agreed to be bound by those terms. [In re Marriage of Assemi (1994)
7 Cal.4th 896, 911.]” (Estate of Jones (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 948, 952.)
 
The court may interpret the terms and conditions of a
settlement (Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566), but the
court may not create material terms of a settlement, as opposed to deciding
what terms the parties themselves have previously agreed upon (Weddington
Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 810).
 
B.    
Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s counsel attests to the
following facts in support of the motion. 
 
The Stipulated
Settlement Agreement between the parties required Defendant to make installed
payments on his loan and, in exchange, Plaintiff would dismiss this action
without prejudice. (Declaration of Laura M. D’Anna, filed August 12, 2024
(“D’Anna Decl.”), ¶ 4.)
Specifically, Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiff a total of $7,039.21, with the
initial payment of $215 being due on March 28, 2024, and thereafter recurring
payments of $215 beginning on April 28, 2024, for 22 months. (D’Anna
Decl., ¶ 7.) 
 
Defendant has defaulted on the terms of the agreement by
making only one initial payment of $215 and then failing to make all other
payments. (D’Anna Decl., ¶
9.) 
 
Therefore, Plaintiff asks the Court to set aside the
dismissal without prejudice, resume jurisdiction, and enter judgment pursuant
to Section 664.6. (D’Anna Decl., ¶ 11.)
 
The Stipulated Settlement Agreement states the
following in relevant part. 
 
“By the authorized signatures below,
the parties herein agree and acknowledge that the Judgment shall be entered in
favor of PLAINTIFF, ALTERNATIVE LENDING HOLDINGS TRUST II and against DEFENDANT,
Emest Miller in the following amounts: ¶ (1) Principal in the amount of
$7,039.21 plus (2) costs in the amount of $363.00; (3) less credits for any and
all amounts paid to PLAINTIFF by DEFENDANT. The total amount of Judgment shall
equal $7,402.21, less credits for any and all payments received.” (Stipulated
Settlement Agreement, ¶ 1.)
 
“The Parties herein agree and
acknowledge that the above entitled Court shall dismiss this action without
prejudice, as to DEFENDANT, and further agree that this Court, at the request
of PLAINTIFF, may reopen the case, resume jurisdiction under California Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6, to enter judgment as outlined in Paragraph 1 [see]
above, upon a showing of DEFENDANT’s failure to comply with the terms of
payment below.” (Stipulated Settlement Agreement, ¶ 4.)
 
“The Defendant agrees that $7,039.21
is currently due and owing to Plaintiff by Defendant due to Defendant's breach
of the subject credit agreement/loan agreement. In good faith and for valuable
consideration. Plaintiff and Defendant agree and stipulate to settle this
action for the sum of $7,039.21 as full resolution of this lawsuit ….”  (Stipulated Settlement Agreement, ¶ 5.)
 
“It is agreed that DEFENDANT shall pay
PLAINTIFF the $7,039.21, on the following terms: ¶ Initial Payment: $215.00 due
on 03/28/24. ¶  Recurring Payments: 22
Monthly payments of $215.00 beginning on 04/28/24. Your first recurring payment
is due on or before 04/28/24. Subsequent recurring payments are due on or
before the 28th of each month. ¶ Final Payment: $230.00 due on 02/28/26.”
(Stipulated Settlement Agreement, ¶
5.)
 
The Court finds
that the Stipulated Settlement Agreement was reasonably well-defined and certain regarding Defendant’s
payment obligations and the consequences for not making those payments. The
Court also finds that Defendant expressly acknowledged that he understood and
agreed to be bound by those terms by signing the agreement. (Stipulated
Settlement Agreement, p.
5 [showing that Defendant signed the agreement on March 7, 2024].) Through
its counsel’s declaration, Plaintiff has met its burden of showing that
Defendant has defaulted on his payments under the agreement. Defendant has not
filed any opposition indicating otherwise. 
 
            However,
Notice of Continuance was not provided by Plaintiff/Moving party as ordered by
the Court on September 11, 2024. Thus, the court CONTINUES the Motion to
December 11, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 25 of Spring Street Courthouse located
at 312 North Spring Street, Los Angeles, California 90012. Moving party is
ordered to give notice.  
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            The Motion to Set Aside 664.6 Dismissal and Enter Judgment
Against Defendant is CONTINUED to December 11, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department
25 of Spring Street Courthouse located at 312 North Spring Street, Los Angeles,
California 90012. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of the continued
hearing date and to file proof of service of said notice.
