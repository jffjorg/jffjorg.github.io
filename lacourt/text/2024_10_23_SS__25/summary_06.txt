And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion filed by Alternative Lending Holdings Trust II (Plaintiff) to vacate the dismissal of a case and enter judgment against Ernest Miller (Defendant). The case was initially dismissed without prejudice based on a stipulated settlement agreement between the parties. However, the Defendant failed to make the required payments, and the Plaintiff is seeking to enter judgment for the total amount due, including the principal sum of $7,039.21 and costs of $363.

The judge finds that the stipulated settlement agreement was reasonably well-defined and certain regarding the Defendant's payment obligations and the consequences for not making those payments. The Defendant has defaulted on his payments, and the Plaintiff has met its burden of showing that the Defendant has failed to comply with the terms of the agreement.

The judge grants the Plaintiff's motion and orders the matter to be continued to December 11, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. for further proceedings. The Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the continued hearing date and to file proof of service of said notice.
