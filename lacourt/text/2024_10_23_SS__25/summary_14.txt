And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling is about a motion to compel responses to demands for inspection and a request for sanctions. The case is A. Douglas Mastroianni v Ally Financial, Inc. (Case Number: 24STLC05608). The Plaintiff, A. Douglas Mastroianni, attempted a Zelle transfer of funds to a family member with the same last name from a checking account with the Defendant, Ally Financial, Inc. The Plaintiff filed a complaint against the Defendant alleging causes of action for conversion, money had and received, violation of California Penal Code § 632 et seq., negligence, and unfair business practices.

The Plaintiff served written discovery requests, including Demands for Inspection, on the Defendant, but the Defendant did not respond. The Plaintiff then filed a motion to compel responses to Demands for Inspection and a request for sanctions. The Defendant timely served its objections to the Plaintiff's Demands for Inspection.

The Judge ruled that the Plaintiff's motion to compel responses to Demands for Inspection is MOOT because the Defendant had already timely served its responses. The Judge also denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions because the Defendant had responded to the Demands for Inspection. Additionally, the Judge denied the Defendant's request for sanctions against the Plaintiff because the Defendant did not provide proper notice of the sanction request.

The Judge ordered that the moving party give notice of the ruling.
