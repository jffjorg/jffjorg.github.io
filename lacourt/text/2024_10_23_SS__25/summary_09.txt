And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a petition to vacate an arbitration award issued by an arbitrator in a dispute between Petitioner Water Damage Rescue, Inc. (WDR) and Respondents Dillon Construction, Inc. and the State of California Department of Consumer Affairs Contractors State License Board (CSLB). WDR contends that the arbitrator exceeded his powers and that WDR's rights were substantially prejudiced by the arbitrator's failure to continue the hearing to allow WDR to prepare and defend itself against Dillon Construction's claims.

The arbitrator issued an award awarding Dillon Construction $25,000 for its claims against WDR, despite WDR's claims that it was not given notice of Dillon Construction's claims and did not sign any arbitration agreement agreeing to arbitrate those claims.

The judge finds that the undisputed facts in the verified petition warrant vacating the award under Section 1286.2(a)(3) and (5) of the California Code of Civil Procedure. The judge grants the petition and orders the arbitrator to vacate the award.
