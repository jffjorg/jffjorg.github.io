ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
            On
March 28, 2024, Plaintiff Daniel Curl, by and through his guardian ad litem Kentasha
Holley, filed an action against Defendant Mariah Hall arising out of an alleged
motor vehicle accident that occurred on February 14, 2023.  On May 1, 2024, Kentasha Holley was appointed
guardian ad litem for Plaintiff Daniel Curl.
 
            On
October 18, 2024, Petitioner Kentasha Holley (Petitioner or Holley) filed the
instant Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim on behalf of minor
Claimant Daniel Curl (Petition).
 
            No
opposition was filed.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
            Court approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s
claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.;
CCP § 372.) “‘[W]ithout trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the
ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid. 
[Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on the minor] until it is
endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson
v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.)  A minor, like Claimant, “shall appear either
by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by a guardian ad litem appointed
by the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, or by a judge
thereof, in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372, subd. (a)(1).) Alternatively,
the petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating that he or she has a right
to compromise the minor’s claim under California Probate Code section 3500. 
 
            Regarding the substance of the
Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the
petitioner must file a complete and
“verified petition for approval of the settlement and must disclose ‘all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise.’
[Citations.]”  (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249,
256; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) (Italics added.) 
 
Under Probate Code § 3505, if a petition is unopposed,
the Court must issue a decision on the petition at the conclusion of the
hearing.
