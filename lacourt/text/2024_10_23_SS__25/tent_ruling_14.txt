ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
This case arises from Plaintiff A. Douglas Mastroianni (Plaintiff)
attempting a Zelle transfer of funds to a family member with the same last name
from a checking account Plaintiff had opened with Defendant Ally Bank (erroneously
sued as Ally Financial Inc.) (Defendant) (Complaint ¶ 7.) 
 
On August 5,
2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant alleging causes of action
for (1) Conversion, (2) Money Had and Received, (3) violation of California
Penal Code § 632 et seq., (4) Negligence, and (5) Unfair Business
Practices. Plaintiff is seeking special and general damages, punitive damages,
statutory damages, injunctive relief, and other legal or equitable relief that
the Court deems appropriate. 
 
Plaintiff’s
Demand for Inspection, Set One, was served onto Ally Financial, Inc. on August
19, 2024 by mail. 
 
Motion to Compal
Responses to Demands for Inspection and Request for Sanctions was served by
mail onto Ally Financial, Inc. on September 25, 2024.
 
On September 24, 2024, Defendant
filed a motion to stay the action or dismiss the complaint on forum non
conveniens grounds.
 
On October 10, 2024, Defendant
filed its opposition the instant motion to compel responses to demands for
inspection.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
Any party may obtain discovery by inspecting, copying,
testing, or sampling documents, tangible things, land or other property, and
electronically stored information in the possession, custody, of control of any
other party to the action.  (CCP § 2031.010, subd. (a).)  A party may
demand that any other party produce and permit the party making the demand, or
someone acting on the demanding party’s behalf, to inspect and to photograph,
test, or sample any tangible things that are in the possession, custody, or
control of the party on whom the demand is made.  (CCP § 2031.010, subd.
(c).)  A party may demand that any other party allow the party making the
demand, or someone acting on the demanding party’s behalf, to enter onto any
land or other property that is in the possession, custody, or control of the
party on whom the demand is made, and to inspect and to measure, survey,
photograph, test, or sample the land or other property, or any designated
object or operation on it.  (CCP § 2031.010, subd. (d).)  
 
Within 30 days of a demand for inspection, the party to
whom the demand is directed shall serve the original of the response to it on
the party making the demand and a copy on all other parties who have appeared
in the action.¿ (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a).)¿The party to whom
a demand for inspection has been directed shall respond separately to each item
or category of item with: (1) a statement that the party will comply with the
particular demand for inspection; (2) a representation that the party lacks the
ability to comply with the demand for inspection; or (3) an objection to the
particular demand for inspection.¿ (Id., § 2031.210, subd. (a).)¿ 
 
 
 
III.             
Discussion
 
On or about August 19, 2024, Plaintiff
served by mail written discovery requests for Special Interrogatories, Set One
and Demands for Inspection, Set One. (Esposito Decl., ¶ 4; Mastroianni Decl., ¶
2.) This meant that Defendant’s responses were due on September 19, 2024 with
an additional five days added for certified U.S. mail pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure Section 1013. Plaintiff declares that as of the date of the filing of
both motions, he had not received responses to the discovery and “heard nothing
from [Defendant] about it.” (Mastroianni Decl., ¶ 3.) 
 
However, on September 23, 2024, Defendant timely served
Plaintiff, via U.S. mail, its objections to Plaintiff’s Demands for Inspection.
(Esposito Decl., ¶ 6, Exhibit C.) 
 
Two days later, on September 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed
and served the Motion to Compel responses to Demands for Inspection, Request
for Sanctions. 
 
IV.             
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030(a) provides, in
pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction on a party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone because of that conduct.  Misuse of discovery includes “failing
to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(d)).
 
Sanctions are
mandatory in connection with motions to compel responses to inspection against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel unless the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§2030.300(d), 2031.320(b).)
 
Plaintiff requests $1,000.00 in sanctions
against Defendant for bringing the motion to compel responses to Demands for Inspection.
Because Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to Demands for Inspection is
moot and given that Defendant had timely served its responses, the Court denies
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions in relation to the instant motion.
 
In opposition papers, Defendant also
requests sanctions against Plaintiff for improperly bringing the motion to
compel responses to Demands for Inspection. 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.040 requires the sanction request to be
in the “notice of motion.” The Court finds that proper notice of the sanction
request is not provided to Plaintiff since the opposition papers do not contain
all the information required in the noticed motion.  
 
 
 
Therefore, the Court DENIES Defendant’s request for
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff. 
 
V.               
Conclusion & Order
 
For the foregoing reasons:
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant
Ally Bank’s Responses to Demands for Inspection is MOOT. 
 
Moreover, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Request for Monetary
Sanctions. 
 
The Court DENIES Defendant’s Request for Monetary anctions
against Plaintiff.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
