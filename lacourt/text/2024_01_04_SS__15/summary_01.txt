Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for summary adjudication filed by Amcord, Inc. regarding the punitive damages claim of the plaintiffs, who allege that Eugene Montano developed mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos in the defendant's products.

The court has found that the defendant's motion has shifted the burden to the plaintiffs to prove malice, fraud, or oppression. The plaintiffs have submitted evidence that the defendant was aware of the hazards of asbestos in the 1970s, but continued to sell its products without providing warnings.

The court has concluded that the evidence presented by the plaintiffs creates disputed issues of material fact regarding the defendant's knowledge of the hazards of asbestos, the need to minimize exposure, and the defendant's efforts to continue selling its products despite regulations limiting or prohibiting such sales.

As a result, the court has denied the motion for summary adjudication on the request for punitive damages, and the case will proceed to trial.
