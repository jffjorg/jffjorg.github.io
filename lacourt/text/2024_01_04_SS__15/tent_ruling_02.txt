 Case Number:  23STCV23517    Hearing Date:   January 4, 2024    Dept:  15 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE MOTION TO QUASH
Plaintiffs Jody Kay Meade
and Arthur Meade filed this action alleging Joy Meade developed mesothelioma as
a result of exposure to asbestos. 
Defendant The Stephan Co. filed a motion to quash service of summons for
lack of personal jurisdiction.  
A defendant may move to quash
service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over the
defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd.
(a)(1).)  The court may dismiss without prejudice
the complaint in whole, or as to that defendant, when dismissal is made pursuant
to Section 418.10.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 581,
subd. (h).)  “A court of this state may exercise
jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of this state or
of the United States.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 410.10.)  “The Due Process Clause protects
an individual’s liberty interest in not being subject to the binding judgments of
a forum with which he has established no meaningful ‘contacts, ties, or relations.’”  (Burger
King Corp. v. Rudzewicz (1985) 471 U.S. 462, 471-472.)  A state court may not exercise personal jurisdiction
over a party under circumstances that would offend “traditional notions of fair
play and substantial justice.”  (Asahi Metal Industry Co., Ltd., v. Superior Court
of California, Solano County (1987) 480 U.S. 102, 113.)  
When a defendant moves to
quash service of process on jurisdictional grounds, the plaintiff has the initial
burden of demonstrating facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction.  (Jayone
Foods, Inc. v. Aekyung Industrial Co. Ltd. (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 543, 553.)  Once facts showing minimum contacts with the forum
state are established, the defendant has the burden to demonstrate that the exercise
of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.  (Ibid.) 
“The plaintiff must provide specific evidentiary facts, through affidavits
and other authenticated documents, sufficient to allow the court to independently
conclude whether jurisdiction is appropriate. 
[Citation.]  The plaintiff cannot rely
on allegations in an unverified complaint or vague and conclusory assertions of
ultimate facts.  [Citation.]”  (Strasner
v. Touchstone Wireless Repair & Logistics, LP (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 215,
222.)
A defendant is subject to
a state’s general jurisdiction if its contacts “are so continuance and
systematic as to render [it] essentially at home in the forum State.”  (Daimler AG v. Bauman (2014) 571 U.S.
117, 127.)  A nonresident defendant may be
subject to the specific jurisdiction of the forum “if the defendant has purposefully
availed himself or herself of forum benefits [citation], and the ‘controversy is
related to or “arises out of” a defendant’s contacts with the forum.’  [Citations.]” 
(Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods,
Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 446.) 
This test does not require a “causal relationship between the
defendant’s in-state activity and the litigation.”  (Ford Motor Co. v. Montana Eighth Judicial
District Court (2021) 141 S.Ct. 1017, 1026.)  The “arise out” of standard “asks about
causation,” but “relate to” does not.  (Ibid.)  “[W]hen a corporation has ‘continuously and
deliberately exploited [a State’s] market, it must reasonably anticipate being
haled into [that State’s] court[s]’ to defend actions ‘based on’ products
causing injury there.”  (Id. at p.
1027.)  
Defendant provided
evidence that it is incorporated and headquartered in Florida.  (Jacobi Decl., ¶ 2.)  This evidence establishes California has no
general jurisdiction over Defendant.
            Regarding
specific jurisdiction, Defendant argues it has never conducted business in
California.  (Motion at pp. 5-6.)  It submitted evidence that in 1988, it
purchased Old 97 Company which it ran as a wholly owned subsidiary, neither
Defendant nor Old 97 Company did any work or business in California, and
neither Defendant nor Old 97 Company shipped or distributed any asbestos-containing
products to California.  (Jacobi Decl.,
¶¶ 5-11.) 
            In
opposition, Plaintiffs argue Old 97 Company made Gold Bond during the time Joy
Meade was using it in California during the July 1984 to 2021 or 2022 time
period, and Defendant assumed the liabilities of Old 97 Company when the two
companies merged.  (Opposition at pp. 2-3,
5, 7.)  Plaintiffs cite various exhibits
supporting this argument, such as Defendant’s 1996 10-K filed with the SEC
stating Defendant had purchased Old 97 Company, which made Gold Bond.  (Ex. 2 at p. 6.)  Plaintiffs request jurisdictional discovery
to show that Defendant or Old 97 Company knew the Gold Bond products would be
sold in California and advertised, marketed, sold, or distributed Gold Bond to
California.  (Opposition at pp. 8-9.)  
            Defendant
argues in reply that Plaintiffs’ evidence is inadmissible.  That does not mean that Plaintiffs cannot
obtain admissible evidence if they conduct discovery.  For example, in discovery Defendant should be
able to authenticate the 1996 10-K and state whether the statements in the 10-K
are accurate.  
The motion is CONTINUED
for Plaintiffs to take jurisdictional discovery concerning Defendant’s and Old
97 Company’s activities in and contacts with California concerning Gold Bond and
their advertising, marketing, sale or distribution of Gold Bond in California
during the time Joy Meade was using the product.  The hearing is continued to April 4, 2024 at
9 a.m.  The parties may file supplemental
opposition and reply briefs on regular notice.
            The
moving parties are to give notice.
