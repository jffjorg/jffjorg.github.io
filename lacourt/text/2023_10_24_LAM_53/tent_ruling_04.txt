Here, the arbitration agreement at issue states that “the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern
the interpretation, enforcement, and all proceedings pursuant to this
Agreement.”  (Cohen Decl., Ex. E,
Arbitration Agreement, p. 2, ¶ 2; Victrola 89, LLC v. Jaman Properties
8 LLC (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 337, 346 [“when an agreement provides that its
‘enforcement’ shall be governed by the FAA, the FAA governs a party’s motion to
compel arbitration”].)
