MOVING PARTIES:
            Plaintiffs Antonio Capulong
and Robert Capulong
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Porsche Cars North America, Inc.
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of
Documents
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs Antonio Capulong and Robert Capulong (“Plaintiffs”) move
the court for an order compelling defendant Porsche Cars North America, Inc. (“Defendant”)
to provide further responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests for Production of
Documents, Set Two, numbers 5-50.
The court grants Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 5-6 because the
objections to those responses are without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(a)(3).)
 
The court grants Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 7-11, 14, 16, 18-22,
25, 27, 29-33, 36, 38, 40-43, 46, and 48, limited to Defendant’s producing any
internal analysis or investigation regarding the defects alleged in Plaintiffs’
Complaint in vehicles for the same year, make, and model of the subject
vehicle.  This includes Recall Notices
and Technical Service Bulletins. 
Defendant is not required to do a search of or to produce emails.  
The court grants Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 12-13, 15, 23-24, 26,
34-35, 37, 44-45, and 47, limited to Defendant’s producing any customer
complaints relating to defects alleged in Plaintiffs’ Complaint in vehicles
purchased or leased in California for the same year, make, and model of the
subject vehicle.  Defendant is not
required to do a search of or to produce emails.
The court denies Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 17, 28, 39, and
49-50 because those requests are overbroad. 
ORDER
The court grants plaintiffs Antonio Capulong and Robert Capulong’s
motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents as
follows. 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, the court orders
defendant Porsche Cars North America, Inc. (1) to serve on plaintiffs Antonio
Capulong and Robert Capulong further written responses to plaintiffs Antonio
Capulong and Robert Capulong’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two,
(i) numbers 5-6, (ii) numbers 7-11, 14, 16, 18-22, 25, 27, 29-33, 36, 38,
40-43, 46, and 48, but limited to Defendant’s producing any internal analysis
or investigation regarding the defects alleged in Plaintiffs’ Complaint in
vehicles for the same year, make, and model of the subject vehicle, and (iii)
numbers 12-13, 15, 23-24, 26, 34-35, 37, 44-45, and 47 but limited to
Defendant’s producing any customer complaints relating to defects alleged in
Plaintiffs’ Complaint in vehicles purchased or leased in California for the
same year, make, and model of the subject vehicle, and (2) to produce to
plaintiffs Antonio Capulong and Robert Capulong all documents and things in
defendant Porsche Cars North America, Inc.’s possession, custody, or control
which are responsive to those requests (and limited as set forth above), within
20 days of the date of this order. 
The court orders plaintiffs Antonio Capulong and Robert Capulong to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
