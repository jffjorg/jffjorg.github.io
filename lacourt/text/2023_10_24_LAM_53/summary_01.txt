And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to the defendant's requests for production of documents. The court grants the motion in part, compelling the defendant to produce internal analysis and investigation documents regarding defects in vehicles for the same year, make, and model as the subject vehicle, as well as customer complaints related to defects in vehicles purchased or leased in California. The court limits the production of documents to those specific requests and denies the motion with respect to overbroad discovery requests. The defendant is ordered to serve further written responses and produce documents within 20 days of the date of the order.
