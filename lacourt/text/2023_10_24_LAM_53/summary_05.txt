And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court considered a motion by Plaintiff Emilio Reyes to set aside and vacate an order denying his motion for a protective order and granting sanctions against him and in favor of defendants Lorraine Escobar and Kizh Nation Resources Management (KNRM). The order was entered on February 15, 2019. The Plaintiff contends that the order is void due to extrinsic fraud or mistake, while the Defendant argues that the order is valid. The court finds that the Plaintiff has not met his burden to show that the order is void or resulted from extrinsic fraud or mistake. The court also finds that the Plaintiff has not met his burden to show that the court should set aside the order on grounds of lack of due process. Therefore, the court denies the Plaintiff's motion to set aside and vacate the order.
