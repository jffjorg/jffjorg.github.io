And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion by Sara Van Horn and Patrick Van Horn (Plaintiffs) to compel Rosemary Lord and The Woman's Club of Hollywood (Defendant) to provide responses to their Form Interrogatories - General (Set One). The Plaintiffs had served the Form Interrogatories on March 27, 2023, and responses were due on or before August 7, 2023. However, the Defendant provided responses on October 9, 2023, which were in substantial compliance with California Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.210. The judge ruled that the Defendant's failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and therefore, the Defendant is relieved from its waiver of any right to exercise the option to produce writings as well as any objection to the interrogatories. As a result, the judge denied the Plaintiffs' motion. Additionally, the judge denied the Plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,561.65.
