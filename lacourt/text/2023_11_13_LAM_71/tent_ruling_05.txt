complaint (“FAC”).  (Notice of Demurrer, pgs. 1-2.)  HRB Defendants also move to strike portions of
the FAC.  (Notice of MTS, pg. 2.)
 
Background
Plaintiff filed its initial Complaint on March 28, 2023.  On June 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
operative FAC against HRB Defendants, and non-moving Defendants JDM Builders
Inc. dba J D M Carpentry (“JDM Inc.”), David Rocha Salgado (“Salgado”), DS
Sheetmetal (“DS”); Edgard Windows & Doors Inc (“Edgard Inc.”); Luzon Yossef,
Inc. (“Luzon Inc.”), TJN Construction, Inc. (“TJN Inc.”), and HC Builders,
Inc., (“HC Inc.”), Jose De Jesus Rodriguez (“Rodriguez”), and Stone Designs
(“Stone”) (collectively, “Defendants”), alleging twenty-five causes of action:
(1) Violation of the Standards Set Forth in Civil Code §§896 and 897 [against
all Defendants]; (2) defective construction [against all Defendants];
(3) fraud- intentional misrepresentation [against HRB Defendants]; (4) fraud-
intentional concealment and nondisclosure [against HRB Defendants]; (5) Violation
of Civil Code §1102, et seq. [against 18 Valley Inc., HRB Inc., S. Shabtay,
Azami, and S. Sharvit]; (6) negligent misrepresentation [against 18
Valley Inc., HRB Inc., S. Shabtay, Azami, and S. Sharvit]; (7) breach of
contract [against 18 Valley Inc.]; (8) breach of third-party beneficiary
contract [against HRB Inc.]; (9) breach of third-party beneficiary
contract [against JDM Inc.]; (10) breach of third-party beneficiary

beneficiary contract [against TJN Inc.]; (14) breach of third-party
beneficiary contract [against HC Inc.]; (15) breach of third-party
beneficiary contract [against Rodriguez and Stone]; (16) breach of
third-party beneficiary contract; (17) breach of express warranty [against
HRB Inc.]; (18) breach of express warranty [against JDM Inc.]; (19)
breach of express warranty [against Salgado and DS]; (20) breach of
express warranty [against Edgard Inc.]; (21) breach of express warranty
[against Luzon Inc.]; (22) breach of express warranty [against TJN
Inc.]; (23) breach of express warranty [against HC Inc.]; (24)
breach of express warranty [against Rodriguez and Stone]; and (25)
breach of implied warranties [against all Defendants].
This action arises out of Plaintiff’s purchase of real property
located at 15907 Valley Vista Boulevard, Encino, CA 91436 (“Property”) from
Valley 18 LLC.  (FAC ¶3.)  Plaintiff and Valley 18 LLC entered into
the original California Residential Purchase Agreement (“RPA”) for the purchase
and sale of the Property for $8,995,000, which was amended as of November 8,
2021, by that certain Amendment by and among Plaintiff and Valley 18 LLC on or
about August 1, 2021.  (FAC ¶22.)  Plaintiff alleges it purchased the Property
on November 23, 2021.  (FAC ¶22; Exh. 9.)
On August 9, 2023, HRB Defendants filed the instant demurrer and
motion to strike.  On October 30, 2023,
Plaintiff filed its combined opposition. 
On November 6, 2023, HRB Defendants filed their consolidated reply.
 
A.  
Demurrer
Summary of Demurrer
HRB Defendants demur to Plaintiff’s 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 17th,
and 25th causes of action.  HRB
Defendants demur on the basis that Plaintiff’s 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 17th,
and 25th causes of action are improper because the Right to Repair Act
statutory scheme provides the sole remedy for these claims.  (Demurrer, pg. 3.)  HRB Defendants demur on the basis that Plaintiff’s
3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th causes of action are uncertain and inadequate pursuant
to C.C.P. §430.10(f) and fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action against HRB Defendants pursuant to C.C.P. §430.10(e).  (Demurrer, pg. 3.)
 
          Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.  (C.C.P.
§430.41(a), emphasis added.)  A
declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the results of the meet and
confer process.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(3).)
HRB Defendants’ counsel’s declaration states he sent Plaintiff’s
counsel a written meet and confer correspondence outlining the issues in the FAC,
dated July 13, 2023.  (Decl. of Windisch
¶2, Exh. A.)  HRB’s Defendants’ counsel
is insufficient because parties failed to meet and confer in person or by
telephone. (C.C.P. §430.41(a).)  However,
a determination by the court that the meet and confer process was insufficient is
not grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer. 
(C.C.P. §430.41(a)(4).) 
Accordingly, the Court will consider the instant demurrer.
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (See Donabedian v.
Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital District
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Right to Repair Act
As a preliminary matter, HRB Defendants fail to state the grounds
for which they demur to Plaintiff’s 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th,[1] 6th, 17th, and 25th causes of action based on the Right to Repair
Act (Civ. Code §895 et seq.).  (See
C.C.P. §§430.10(a)-(h).)
HRB Defendants argue in McMillin Albany, LLC v. Superior Court,
the California Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether a homeowner can
bring causes of action other than violations of the Right to Repair Act against
a builder for construction defects.  (McMillin
Albany, LLC v. Superior Court (2018) 4 Cal.5th 241, 252-253.)  
For purchase agreements signed after 2002, the Right to Repair Act
specifies various statutory procedures that must be followed before a homeowner
may sue a builder for defects in construction of a new residential unit.  The statutes provide builders with the
absolute right to attempt a repair prior to a homeowner filing a lawsuit. The
purpose is to promote prelitigation repairs and avoid litigation costs that
result in increased costs of construction.  (Anders v. Superior Court (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th
579, 590.)
The Right to Repair Act applies only to construction defect
claims, not claims for breach of contract, fraud, or personal injury.  (McMillin Albany LLC, 4 Cal.5th at pg.
249.)  However, the Right to Repair Act
and its pre-lawsuit filing requirements does apply to any claim
relating to damages for residential construction deficiencies, not just to
those claims brought under the Right to Repair Act.  (Id. at pgs. 250, 257, 259 [stating Right
to Repair Act supplants common law construction defect or breach of contract
claims and failure to provide notice is ground to stay litigation]; Elliott
Homes, Inc. v. Superior Court (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 333, 341.)
Here, Plaintiff’s 2nd cause of action for defective construction
is a negligence claim and cannot be alleged in the alternative, as Plaintiff
argues in its opposition.  (Opposition,
pg. 14.)  Plaintiff has already alleged
HRB Defendants are builders and are therefore subject to the Right to Repair
Act: “Defendants, and each of them, in developing, designing, constructing
and/or building the Property and improvements thereon did so negligently,
defectively, and not in conformity with the approved plans, specifications and
other instruments of service, and applicable building codes and requirements,
thereby causing resulting property damage. The conduct of Defendants, and each
of them, in developing, designing, constructing and/or building the Property
and improvements thereon, fell below the applicable standard(s) of care.”  (FAC ¶50.) 
Further, the negligence cause of action seeks monetary damages in excess
of $2,000,000, which is disallowed under the Act.  (McMillin Albany LLC, 4 Cal.5th at
pgs. 252-253.) 
HRB Defendants’ demurrer to the 17th and 25th causes of action on
the basis of the Right of Repair Act is also well taken.  It is true the Right of Repair Act leaves
undisturbed causes of action for breach of contract, of which breach of implied
and express warranties are a species.  (See
id. at pgs. 249, 253; Civ. Code §943(a).) 
However, these causes of action do not allege any permissible cause of
action outside the scope of the Right to Repair Act violations that the
Plaintiff alleges in the 1st cause of action, and seeks damages in excess of
$2,000,000, which is disallowed under the Act. 
(McMillin Albany LLC, 4 Cal.5th at pgs. 252-253.) 
Plaintiff’s 3rd and 4th causes of action for fraud, and 6th cause
of action for negligent misrepresentation, a species of fraud or deceit, also
similarly seeks damages derived from construction defects, which are disallowed
under the Act.  (Id.)
Accordingly, HRB Defendants’ demurrer to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th,
17th, and 25th causes of action is sustained with 20 days leave to
amend.
 
Uncertainty
          Fraud- Misrepresentation
(3rd COA)
A demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the
complaint is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., he or she
cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what
counts or claims are directed against him or her.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
If the complaint contains enough facts to apprise defendant of the
issues it is being asked to meet, failure to label each cause of action is not ground
for demurrer: “Although inconvenient, annoying and inconsiderate, the lack of
labels . . . does not substantially impair [defendant’s] ability to understand
the complaint.” (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d
135, 139 n.2.)
Plaintiff’s 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes of action for fraud and
violation of Civil Code §1102 are not so uncertain that HRB Defendants cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or
claims are directed against it.
Accordingly, HRB Defendants’ demurrer to the 3rd, 4th, and 5th
causes of action on the basis of uncertainty is overruled.        
 
Conclusion
HRB Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiffs’ FAC is sustained with
20 days leave to amend as to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 17th, and 25th causes of
action, and overruled as to the 5th cause of action.
Moving Party to give notice.
 
B.   
Motion to Strike
In light of the Court’s ruling on the demurrer, HRB Defendants’
motion to strike is denied as moot.
