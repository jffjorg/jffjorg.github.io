And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer of Home Run Builders Inc. and its related entities (HRB Defendants) to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 17th, and 25th causes of action with 20 days leave to amend. The demurrer was filed in response to the first amended complaint (FAC) of 15907 Valley Vista LLC (Plaintiff). The HRB Defendants argued that certain causes of action are improper because they are subject to the Right to Repair Act (Civ. Code §895 et seq.), which provides the sole remedy for certain construction defect claims. The court agreed, finding that the claims for defective construction, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation are subject to the Right to Repair Act and cannot be pursued outside of its provisions.

The court also overruled the demurrer to the 5th cause of action, finding that it is not subject to the Right to Repair Act.

The motion to strike was denied as moot in light of the court's ruling on the demurrer.

The property at issue is located at 15907 Valley Vista Boulevard in Encino, CA, and was purchased by Plaintiff from Valley 18 LLC for $8,995,000.
