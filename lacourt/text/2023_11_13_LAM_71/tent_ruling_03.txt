 Hearing Date:  November 13, 2023

Sara Van Horn’s and Patrick Van Horn’s motion to compel Defendant Rosemary Lord

General (Set One) is denied. 
 
Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions on
the motion to compel Form Interrogatories is denied.
 
          Plaintiffs
Sara Van Horn (“Sara”) and Patrick Van Horn (“Patrick”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
move for an order compelling Defendant Rosemary Lord (“Lord”) (“Defendant”) to provide responses to their Form Interrogatories – General
(Set One) (“FROG”), previously served on Defendant.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §2030.290.) 
Plaintiffs also request an award of sanctions against Defendant in the
amount of $3,561.65.  (Notice of Motion,
pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2023.010, 2030.290.) 

 
Motion
to Compel
Having reviewed Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Responses to FROGs, the
Court rules as follows.
          On March 27, 2023, Plaintiffs served FROG
(Set One) on Defendant by email.  (Decl.
of Yakobian ¶¶2-3, Exh. A.)  Responses
were due on or before August 7, 2023. 
(Decl. of Yakobian ¶6.) 
Plaintiffs’ counsel declares Defendant’s counsel requested two
extensions to provide answers, which were granted, with a new response date of
August 18, 2023.  (Decl. of Yakobian ¶¶7-8.)   
          Plaintiffs filed the instant motion on
October 6, 2023.  Defendant filed her
opposition on October 30, 2023.  As of
the date of this hearing, no reply has been filed.
          Defendant provided responses to
Plaintiffs’ FROG (Set One) on October 9, 2023. 
(Decl. of Rooney ¶10, Exh. 3.)  Defendant
argues in opposition that Plaintiffs’ original discovery contained 850
discovery requests, which had been cut down to 394 requests after parties met
and conferred.  (Decl. of Rooney ¶¶5-6,
Exh. 2.)  Defendant’s counsel argues it
overlooked Plaintiffs’ FROG (Set One) and believed the discovery request at
issue was withdrawn by Plaintiffs. 
(Decl. of Rooney ¶¶8-9.) 
Defendant’s counsel declares she advised Plaintiffs that Defendant’s
responses to FROG (Set One) were in process. 
(Decl. of Rooney ¶10, Exh. 3.)
          Defendant served a response to FROG
(Set One) that is in substantial compliance with C.C.P. §2030.210 and
Defendant’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
(C.C.P. §2030.290(a).)  Therefore,
Defendant is relieved from its waiver of any right to exercise the option to
produce writings a well as any objection to the interrogatories.
          Therefore, the Court denies Plaintiffs’
motion.
Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions is denied. 
          
          Conclusion
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Defendant to provide responses to its FROG
is denied.
Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions is denied.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling.
