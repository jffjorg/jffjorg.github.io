And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants in part and denies in part the Defendant's motion to compel further discovery responses to special interrogatories and requests for production. The judge finds that the Defendant's request for production No. 28 seeks documents related to the incident and is not a medical record, and therefore orders further response. However, the judge denies the Defendant's motion to compel further responses to requests for production Nos. 29-34, finding that they seek medical or psychotherapeutic records without demonstrating that Plaintiff is claiming anything beyond garden variety emotional distress. The judge also limits the scope of special interrogatories Nos. 36 and 37, seeking facts or witnesses supporting Plaintiff's claims of emotional distress, and denies the Defendant's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories Nos. 38-44, finding that they seek information regarding Plaintiff's mental health without demonstrating that Plaintiff is alleging anything beyond garden variety emotional distress. The judge sets the matter for a hearing on March 6, 2024, at 1:30 p.m.
