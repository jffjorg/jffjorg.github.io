Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for determination of good faith settlement. The settlement agreement was reached during mediation and resulted in a consent judgment for $228,000 in favor of the plaintiff. The defendants, Jason Sinner, M.D., and Beverly Radiology Medical Group, are seeking court confirmation that the settlement was made in good faith and that the non-settling defendants, Robin Solymanijam, M.D., and Consultants For Lung Diseases Medical Group, Inc., cannot pursue further contribution or indemnity claims against the settling defendants. The judge has found that the settlement was made in good faith and that the parties have made a sufficient showing. The motion is granted, and the court will not allow any further claims against the settling defendants.
