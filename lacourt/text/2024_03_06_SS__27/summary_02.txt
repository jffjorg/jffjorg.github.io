And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has reviewed the petition to approve a compromise of the pending action of Atarah Robinson, a 15-year-old minor. Despite the expedited petition, the total settlement exceeds $50,000.00, which requires a different process. The Judge is denying the petition and ordering the claimant to file a petition for minor compromise (MC-350) and other required documents at least 5 days prior to the new court date. Failure to comply may result in sanctions. The court has set an OSC (Order to Show Cause) for minor compromise on April 12, 2024, at 8:30 am in Department 27.
