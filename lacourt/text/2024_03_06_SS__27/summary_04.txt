And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial, which was filed on February 13, 2024, and scheduled for March 7, 2024. The plaintiff had previously filed a complaint on June 11, 2021, and the trial date had been continued three times from December 9, 2022, to May 31, 2023, then to December 8, 2023, and finally to March 7, 2024. The plaintiff argued that the new counsel required additional time to prepare for trial and that the ongoing damages had not been fully assessed, but the judge found these arguments unpersuasive. The judge noted that the plaintiff had had over two and a half years to conduct discovery and that the motion was filed just weeks before the trial date, which would prejudice the defendant. The judge granted the parties an additional 30 days to prepare for trial and rescheduled the trial date to April 8, 2024, and the final status conference to March 27, 2024.
