And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to enforce a settlement agreement. The settlement agreement was executed on June 9, 2023, between the defendants and plaintiff Daniel Munoz, but it was not signed by all parties. The plaintiff's counsel has not filed the required minors' compromise, which is stipulated in the agreement. The court finds that the settlement agreement is not enforceable under CCP ยง 664.6 because it is not signed by all parties. The court has examined the settlement agreement and concludes that the motion is denied.
