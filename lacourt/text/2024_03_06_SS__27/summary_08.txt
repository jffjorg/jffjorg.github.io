And here is the English-text summary:

The Honorable Judge Lee S. Arian issued a tentative ruling on the Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of Timothy John Rose, an adult with a disability. The petition was filed by Claimant Timothy John Rose and his guardian ad litem. The Court denies the petition due to incomplete information in the MC-350 form, which includes Section 5 describing the facts of the incident, Section 6 describing injuries, Section 8(c) describing permanent injuries, and attachments 11b(3) and 11b(6) describing other relevant information. Additionally, the Court requires a declaration regarding the Plaintiff's mental condition and ability to manage money, as the petition does not sufficiently demonstrate this information. The Claimant is ordered to correct the deficiencies and file the completed MC-350 form no less than 5 days prior to the new court date set for April 12, 2024. Failure to do so may result in sanctions.
