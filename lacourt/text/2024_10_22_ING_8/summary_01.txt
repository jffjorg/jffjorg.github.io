The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel initial responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, brought by Defendant Metro. The Plaintiff, Carolina Montelongo, failed to provide timely responses to the interrogatories, despite extensions granted by Defendant Metro. The Court finds that Plaintiff's counsel has had difficulty completing the discovery on time due to missing medical records, but notes that good faith discovery obligations do not stop when counsel is unable to obtain discovery. The Court grants Defendant Metro's motion to compel initial responses, ordering Plaintiff to serve verified, code-compliant responses without objection on or before November 4, 2024. Additionally, the Court grants Defendant Metro's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $560.
