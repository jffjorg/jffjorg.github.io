And here is a written summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting Petitioner Benjamin Gonzalez's petition for relief from the claims requirement under Government Code section 946.6. The petition stems from a slip-and-fall accident at Los Angeles Union Station on December 10, 2023, and alleges that Petitioner suffered severe injuries due to a slippery substance left on the handrail of an escalator. Petitioner filed a government claim on June 27, 2024, about two weeks after the six-month limitations period expired, and subsequently filed a late-claim application with Metro. Metro denied the claim as untimely, and Petitioner filed this petition seeking relief from the claims requirement.

The court finds that Petitioner has shown mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect in failing to file a timely government claim, and that Petitioner's counsel provided sufficient evidence to establish this showing. The court also finds that Metro has not filed an opposition and has not proven prejudice, and therefore grants the petition. The court orders that Petitioner's petition for relief from the claims requirement is granted, and that Petitioner's counsel may lodge a proposed judgment if necessary.
