[Tentative] Order Denying Petition for
Writ of Mandate
            
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
            The City of Sierra Madre (the
“City”) and its City Council approved Resolution 24-12, including Tentative
Tract Map 22-01 and Vesting Tentative Tract Map 83966, affecting the property
located at 700 North Sunnyside Avenue. 
(See Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (“Pet.”) Prayer ¶ 2.)  This tentative tract map would include a
42-unit single family housing development near the base of the San Gabriel
Mountains.  Now, Petitioner Protect
Sierra Madre (“Petitioner”) seeks a writ of administrative mandate directing
the City to set aside its approval. 
Petitioner contends that the City did not comply with the State Minimum
Fire Safe Regulations or with the City’s subdivision ordinance in its approval
of the tentative map.  The City, as well
as the real parties in interest—NUWI-Sierra Madre, LLC (“NUWI”) and the
Congregation of the Passion, Mater Dolorosa Community (the “Congregation”) (collectively
“Real Parties”)—collectively oppose the petition.
 
            The court has limited authority to
set aside the City’s decision.  The court
may only reverse the City’s decision if Petitioner demonstrates that, based on
the evidence in the record, “a reasonable person could
not reach the conclusion reached by the [City].”  (Sierra
Club v. California Coastal Commission (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 602, 610.)  Petitioner fails to demonstrate that the
tentative tract map fails to comply with any of the applicable fire regulations
or the City’s municipal code, notwithstanding that this project is located in a
Very
High Fire Hazard Severity Zone that was recently affected by the Eaton Canyon
fire.  Therefore, the petition for writ
of mandate is denied.  This order is
without prejudice to Petitioner filing a petition to challenge any approval of
the final tract map if the City fails to make any necessary changes to the
tentative tract map.  
 
BACKGROUND 
 
A.        The
Project and the City’s Environmental Review
 
The Congregation owns real property
located at 700
North Sunnyside Avenue, Sierra Madre, CA (the “Property”) and operates a
90-guest retreat center there known as the Mater Dolorosa Retreat Center.  (AR 1216.) 
The Congregation partnered with NUWI, a developer, to develop approximately
17.3 acres of the Property with up to 42 single-family detached residential
units (the “Project”).  (AR 722, 1168,
1193, 1216.)  A draft specific plan was
prepared for the proposed development, which is referred to as “The Meadows at
Bailey Canyon” (the “Specific Plan”). 
(AR 552-721.)  
 
In
June 2020, the City gave notice of its intent to prepare an environmental
impact report (the “EIR”) for the Project to comply with the California
Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”).  (AR
2791.)  In relevant part, the EIR
describes the Project as follows: 
 
NUWI
Sierra Madre LLC (applicant) is proposing to develop an approximately
17.30-acre site (Assessor’s Parcel Number 5761-002-008) located at 700 North
Sunnyside Avenue (project site)…. The northwestern portion of the project site
borders the City of Pasadena, while the base of the San Gabriel Mountains is
located approximately 460 feet north of the site (see Figure 3-1, Project
Location). Approximately 9.19 acres of the 17.30-acre project site would be
developed for single family residential uses; 3.68 acres would be developed as
roadways; and approximately 3.39 acres of the project site would be developed
as open space, which includes a 3.04-acre neighborhood public park. A 1.04-acre
grading and landscape buffer would be provided at the northern portion of the
site.
 
The
project site is surrounded by Bailey Canyon and Bailey Canyon Wilderness Park
to the east, and existing single-family residential development to the south
and west, and the Mater Dolorosa Retreat Center, which is primarily used to
host religious and silent retreats and other activities, to the north…. There
are currently two access roads that run north to south through the project site
to the Mater Dolorosa Retreat Center, including North Sunnyside North Sunnyside
Avenue, which crosses through the western portions of the site, and Carter
Avenue, which extends along the eastern portion of the site. North Sunnyside
Avenue would become a public road that would serve the project site and provide
access to the Mater Dolorosa Retreat Center, while Carter Avenue would be
improved to provide secondary egress and ingress access to the site, as well as
provide internal circulation throughout the project site.
 
(AR
2333.)
 
            As relevant to this writ petition,
the draft EIR included the Meadows at Bailey Canyon Fire Protection Plan (the “Fire
Protection Plan”).  (AR 5364-5441).  The Fire Protection Plan “evaluates and
identifies the potential fire risk associated with the project’s land uses and
identifies requirements for water supply, fuel modification and defensible
space, access, building ignition and fire resistance, and fire protection
systems, among other pertinent fire protection criteria.”  (AR 5368.) 
The final EIR also includes a section titled “Wildfire,” which “describes
the existing wildfire conditions within the vicinity of The Meadows at Bailey
Canyon Specific Plan (project or proposed project) site, identifies associated
regulatory requirements, evaluates potential impacts associated with wildfire
and contribution to regional wildfire conditions, and identifies mitigation
measures related to implementation of the proposed project.”  (AR 2697.)
 
            As Petitioner points out, the Fire
Protection Plan and the EIR “make[] clear that fire risk on the project site is
a serious concern.”  (Opening Brief
(“OB”) 7:17-18.)  The EIR states:
 
Wildland
fires are a common natural hazard in most of southern California with a long
and extensive history.  Southern
California landscapes include a diverse range of plant communities, including
vast tracts of grasslands and shrublands, like those found adjacent to the
center of the project site. As a result of the anticipated growing population
of Los Angeles County wildland–urban interface areas, and the region’s fire
history, it can be anticipated that periodic wildfires may start on, burn onto,
or spot into the project site. The most common type of fire anticipated in the
vicinity of the project area is a wind-driven fire from the northeast moving
through the native vegetation in the Angeles National Forest.
 
(AR
2532.)  The EIR further explains that the
project site “is located within a wildland–urban interface location that is
statutorily designated as a Local Responsibility Area Very High Fire Hazard
Severity Zone (VHFHSZ) by the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection (CAL FIRE) and the Sierra Madre Fire Department.”  (Ibid.)  
 
            The EIR incorporates the Fire
Protection Plan as a project design feature with which the Project must
comply.  (AR 2705.)  Structures on the site would “comply with
enhanced ignition-resistant construction standards,” and “the project would include
fire protection systems, including fire hydrants, automatic fire sprinkler
system, fire alarm systems, and residential hazard detectors.”  (AR 2707.) 
Landscaping must also comply with fire prevention requirements
throughout the Project site. (AR 2707-08.) 
The EIR also analyzes roadway access to the Project site, including “the
capacity of Carter Avenue … during emergencies and non-emergencies.”  (AR 1428-29, 2709-10.)  The EIR concludes that, with implementation
of the Fire Protection Plan, the Project’s environmental impacts associated
with wildfire would be less than significant and no mitigation measures would
be required.  (AR 2711.)
 
In September 2022, the City Council approved
a resolution adopting the Specific Plan, certifying the Final EIR which
included the Fire Protection Plan, and approving a Development Agreement
between the City, NUWI, and the Congregation. (AR 1216-17, 348-350, 549-551.) It
appears that neither Petitioner, nor any other individual or entity, challenged
the Specific Plan, Final EIR, Fire Protection Plan, or Development Agreement in
court.  (See Oppo. 3:16-17.)
 
B.        The
City Approves the Tentative Tract Map for the Project 
 
The Development Agreement required the Real
Parties to submit an application for a tentative tract map (“TTM”) for approval
by the City.  (AR 726, 727.)  As relevant to this writ petition, the
Development Agreement states that “[w]ithin 24 months after the Effective Date,
Developer shall make all commercially reasonable efforts to acquire the right
of way for the offsite improvement of Carter Avenue from the County of Los
Angeles … and obtain all required approvals from the County … for construction
of Carter Avenue offsite improvements.”  (AR
731.)  The Development Agreement states
that “[c]ompletion of the offsite improvements … will be made a condition of
any Tentative Tract Map approval.”  (AR
727.)
 
NUWI submitted its application for a TTM on
October 3, 2022.  (AR 1217; 1-48.)  The City prepared an analysis under CEQA comparing
the TTM against the Specific Plan and determined the TTM is consistent with the
Specific Plan, Final EIR, and Fire Protection Plan. (AR 273-347.)  The Planning Commission considered the TTM on
February 1, 2024.  Petitioner submitted a
comment letter prior to the hearing, objecting to the TTM on grounds it did not
comply with various provisions of the State Minimum Fire Safe Regulations,
California Code of Regulations (“CCR”) title 14, section 1270 et seq.
(AR 1054-1057.)[1]
 Among other things, Petitioner asserted
that “[t]here is no discussion in the staff report that the City has presented
the
proposed
tentative tract map to CAL FIRE,” as required by section1270.04 of the
regulations. (AR 1054.)  The Planning
Commission voted to recommend approval of the TTM to the City Council “pending
any commentary by Cal Fire such that this be remanded to the Planning
Commission in the event that there are substantive notes that need further
deliberation.”  (AR 1161-1162; 1207.)
 
On February 9 and 11, 2024, the City’s
Fire Marshal provided Cal Fire notice of the pending TTM.  (AR 1343-1345.) On February 16, 2024, Cal Fire
responded as follows: 
 
We
received the notification of your intent to potentially approve a Tentative
Tract Map within the LRA VHFHSZ of the City of Sierra Madre. The notification
completes the requirements of 14 CCR 1270.04 for the City of Sierra Madre. The
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection will not be reviewing or commenting
on the Tentative Tract Map. 
 
(AR
1343.)  The City Council considered the
TTM on February 27, 2024, and voted unanimously to approve it, subject to
several conditions of approval, which must be complied with before any Final
Map subdividing the property can recorded.  (AR 1369, 1399, 1257-1260.)  This writ petition followed.  
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
In its second
cause of action for administrative mandate, Petitioner challenges the City’s
approval of the TTM.  (Pet. ¶ 53.)[2]  “Approval of a tentative subdivision map is a
quasi-judicial act subject to judicial review for abuse of discretion
under Code of Civil Procedure section
1094.5.”  (Youngblood v. Bd. of Supers. (1978)
22 Cal.3d 644, 651, fn 2.)  An abuse of
discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in the manner
required by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings
are not supported by the evidence.  (Code
Civ. Proc. 
§ 1094.5(b).)  
 
“Where, as here, a land use
decision is challenged by administrative mandamus, courts are to apply the
substantial evidence standard of review.”  (Toigo v. Town of Ross (1998) 70
Cal.App.4th 309, 317.)  Substantial evidence is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might
accept as adequate to support a conclusion or evidence of ponderable legal
significance which is reasonable in nature, credible and of solid value. (California Youth Authority v. State
Personnel Board (2002) 104 Cal. App. 4th 575, 584-85; Mohilef v. Janovici (1996) 51 Cal. App. 4th 267, 305 n. 28.)  Under this standard of review, “[c]ourts may
reverse an [administrative] decision only if, based on the evidence …, a
reasonable person could not reach the conclusion reached by the [City].”  (Sierra
Club v. California Coastal Commission (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 602, 610.)   
 
Petitioner bears the burden of proof and must demonstrate, by
citation to the administrative record, that substantial evidence does not
support the administrative findings.  (Strumsky v. San Diego County Employees
Retirement Assn. (1974) 11 Cal.3d 28, 32; Shenouda v. Veterinary Medical Bd. (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 500, 513.)  An agency is presumed to have regularly
performed its official duties.  (Evid.
Code § 664.)  “[A] trial court must
afford a strong presumption of correctness concerning the administrative
findings.”  (Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal. 4th 805, 817.)  When an appellant challenges “the sufficiency of the
evidence, all material evidence on the point must be set forth and not merely
[her] own evidence.” (Toigo, supra, 70 Cal.App.4th at 317.)  A reviewing court “will not act as counsel
for either party to an appeal and will not assume the task of initiating and
prosecuting a search of the record for any purpose of discovering errors not
pointed out in the briefs.” (Fox v.
Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742.) 
 
The court
exercises its independent judgment concerning question of law arising in
mandate proceedings.  (Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15
Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.)  Interpretation
of a statute or regulation is a question of law subject to independent
review.  (Ibid.)    
 
EVIDENTIARY ISSUES 
 
            Petitioner
requests judicial notice of State Minimum Fire Safe Regulations, 2021, California
Code of Regulations, title 14, § 1270.00-1276.04 (see AR 1061-1106) and
Exhibits 1-7.  Respondents do not oppose
the request.  The request is granted.
 
            Petitioner’s also requests judicial
notice of a portion of a map prepared by Cal Fire of the Eaton Fire.  (See Palmer Decl. in support of Reply Brief ¶
2, Exh. A.)  The court denies the request
for several reasons.  This request should
have been made with the opening brief, and because it was made only in reply,
Respondents have not had sufficient notice and opportunity to object.  Moreover, the court need not rely on this map
in ruling on the merits of the petition. 
The administrative record makes clear that this property is located in a
Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone. 
Therefore, this request is denied. 

 
DISCUSSION  
 
A.        The City Did Not Make Any
Denial Findings 
 
Pursuant to
Government Code section 66474, a local government “shall deny approval of a tentative map” if it makes, inter
alia, any of the following findings:
 
(a) That the proposed map is not consistent with
applicable general and specific plans as specified in Section
65451.
 
(b) That the design or improvement of the proposed
subdivision is not consistent with applicable general and specific plans.
 
(c)
That the site is not physically suitable for the type of development.
 
(d)
That the site is not physically suitable for the proposed density of
development.
 
(e) That the design of the subdivision or the
proposed improvements are likely to cause substantial environmental damage or
substantially and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat.
 
(f) That the design of the subdivision or type of
improvements is likely to cause serious public health problems.
 
(g) That the design of the subdivision or the type of
improvements will conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large, for
access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision.  
 
(Gov. Code §
66474.)  The City considered each issue
and could not make any of these findings. 
(See AR 1359-1362.)  In its
petition and legal briefs, Petitioner does not argue that the City should have
made any specific denial finding under section 66474.  (See OB 23:7-13.)  Nor does Petitioner develop an argument that
the City’s decision not to make these findings is not supported by substantial
evidence in the record.  Instead, Petitioner
argues that, for several reasons, the City “did not comply with the State
Minimum Fire Safe Regulations or with the City’s subdivision ordinance in its
approval of Vesting Tentative Tract Map 83966.” 
(OB 23:15-17.)  Specifically,
Petitioner argues that the City violated two procedural provisions of the Fire
Safe Regulations: (1) A notice requirement of section 1270.04(a) and (b), and (2)
A consultation requirement of section 1276.03(a)(1).  Petitioner also argues that the TTM did not
comply with substantive requirements of the Fire Safe Regulations and the
City’s Municipal Code.  
 
            B.        Petitioner
Did Not Exhaust Administrative Remedies 
 
            As an initial matter, Petitioner did
not exhaust its administrative remedies with respect to the City’s alleged
non-compliance with section 1270.04(a) and (b). 
“The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies precludes
judicial review of issues, both legal and factual, that could have been raised
but were not raised, at the administrative level.”  (Tesoro Refining & Marketing Co. LLC
v. Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Bd. (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th
453, 469.)  “While less specificity is required
to preserve an issue for appeal in an administrative proceeding than in a
judicial proceeding … [t]he objections must be sufficiently specific so that
the agency has the opportunity to evaluate and respond to them.”  (Sierra Club v. City of Orange (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 523, 536.) 

 
On February
1, 2024, Petitioner submitted a letter to the Planning Commission asserting that “[t]here is
no discussion in the staff report that the City has presented the proposed
tentative tract map to CAL FIRE,” as required by section 1270.04 of the
regulations. (AR 1054.)  In response to
Petitioner’s comment, the City gave two notices to Cal Fire about the pending
TTM application:
 
1.         On February 9, 2024, the City’s Fire
Marshal sent a letter to Chief Littlefield of Cal Fire’s San Bernardino Unit stating
that the City “has a proposed Tentative Tract Map 83966 located within the Very
High Fire Hazard Severity Zone (VHFHSZ)” and that “the city wishes to inform
you of the Sierra Madre City Council’s intent to review and potentially approve
this tract at their February 27th, 2024 meeting.”  (AR 1345.) 

 
2.         On February 11, 2024, the City’s Fire
Marshal sent an email to Chief Littlefield, stating: “Please accept this notification of our intent to potentially
approve a Tentative Tract Map within the LRA VHFHSZ of the City of Sierra
Madre, as required by Title 14.”  (AR
1343.)  
 
On
February 16, 2024, Cal Fire responded as follows: 
 
We
received the notification of your intent to potentially approve a Tentative
Tract Map within the LRA VHFHSZ of the City of Sierra Madre.  The notification completes the requirements of
14 CCR 1270.04 for the City of Sierra Madre.  The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection
will not be reviewing or commenting on the Tentative Tract Map. 
 
(AR
1343.)  
 
In the staff report for the meeting of
February 27, 2024, before the City Council, the staff summarized these
communications and included a copy as Attachment M.  (AR 1220.) 
The Ralph M. Brown Act—Government Code sections 54950 et seq.—requires
the City post its City Council meeting agendas and staff report materials 72
hours prior to a meeting.  Petitioner
does not argue that the City failed to post the staff report at least 72 hours
prior to the February 7, 2024, meeting.  Petitioner
did not submit any written comments prior to the City Council meeting arguing
that the notices of February 9 and 11, 2024, failed to comply with section
1270.04.  (See AR 1346-1357, 5747.)[3]  The Fire Marshal also appeared at the City
Council meeting, summarized the correspondence with Cal Fire, and stated that
the City had made “notification” to comply with section 1270.4.  (AR 1389.) 
The City attorney asserted at the meeting that Cal Fire had been given
notice in compliance with section 1270.04 and “this isn’t the first time
CalFire has seen this project.”  (AR
1374-75.)  
 
Neither Petitioner nor anyone else raised
any concerns with the City’s compliance with section 1270.04.  During the oral public comment session at the
City Council hearing, no speaker raised the issue.  (AR 1393-1396.)  Nor did Petitioner argue previously that the
notices or Cal Fire’s response did not comply with section 1270.4.  Petitioner’s comment before the Planning
Commission, on February 1, 2024, did not fairly apprise the City of a
contention that the subsequent communications with Cal Fire were
deficient.  Accordingly, Petitioner
failed to exhaust administrative remedies on that issue.
 
C.        The City’s Notice to Cal
Fire Complied with Section 1270.04
 
In the alternative, Petitioner’s argument that the City failed to comply
with the notice requirements of section 1270.04(a) and (b) is not
persuasive.  Petitioner raises a legal
question about the proper interpretation of the regulation.  
 
The rules governing
statutory construction are well settled. We begin with the fundamental premise
that the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate
legislative intent.  To determine
legislative intent, we turn first to the words of the statute, giving them
their usual and ordinary meaning.  When
the language of a statute is clear, we need go no further. However, when the
language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation, we look to
a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved,
the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy,
contemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which
the statute is a part.
 
(Nolan v. City of Anaheim (2004)
33 Cal.4th 335, 340, internal citations omitted.)  These same rules apply to the interpretation
of a regulation.  (County of Sacramento v. State Water
Resources Control Board (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1579, 1586.)
 
Here, section 1270.04(a) and (b) provide in full:  
 
(a)   the Local Jurisdictions shall
provide the Director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection (CAL FIRE) or their designee with notice of applications
for Building permits, tentative parcel maps, tentative
maps, and installation or use permits for construction or Development
within the SRA, or if after July, 1 2021, the VHFHSZ.
 
(b)   the Director or their designee may
review and make fire protection recommendations on applicable construction or
development permits or maps provided by the Local Jurisdiction.
 
(emphasis
added.)  
 
            Contrary to Petitioner’s assertion,
section 1270.04(a) does not prescribe a specific time frame in which a local
agency must provide Cal Fire with notice of an application for a building
permit, use permit, or tentative map.  (See
OB 19:1-2.)  The regulation also does
not require the local agency to provide Cal Fire with any specific information
about the proposed tentative map, as Petitioner argues.  (OB 18:17-19.)  When interpretating a regulation, the court
cannot “insert language which has been omitted” or infer requirements that are
not supported by the regulation’s plain language.  (People
v. National Auto. and Cas. Ins. Co. (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 277, 282.)   And,
as Petitioner acknowledges, section 1270.04(b) “allows Cal Fire to exercise its
discretion whether or not to respond to a local agency notification.”  (Reply 7:24-8:1.)  
 
Here,
Cal Fire did not request additional time to review the TTM application or
assert that it was declining to provide comment because of insufficient
notice.  (AR 1343.)  Rather, Cal Fire exercised its discretion not
to review the tentative map.  Under
these circumstances, the court is not called upon to decide whether section
1270.04(a) should be interpreted to require some minimal amount of notice
before the local agency’s approval of a tentative map.  The regulation directs the City to provide “notice”
of an application for a tentative map, which is what the City did.  (AR
1343-1345, 5747.)  Cal Fire affirmatively
stated that it “will not be reviewing or commenting on the Tentative Tract Map.”
 (AR 1343)  Cal Fire did not request additional time to
review the matter or supplemental materials. 
(Ibid.)  Instead, Cal Fire certified
that the City had complied with the requirements of section 1270.04.  (Ibid.)  Therefore, the City fulfilled the notice
requirement of section 1270.04(a) and (b).   

 
Respondents
argue that “[t]he contemporaneous administrative construction of a regulation
by the agency charged with its enforcement and interpretation is entitled to
great weight.”  (Department of
Alcoholic Beverage v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board (2003) 109
Cal.App.4th 1687, 1695.)  Accordingly,
Respondents suggest that the court should defer to Cal Fire’s assessment that
“[t]he notification completes the requirements of 14 CCR 1270.04 for the City
of Sierra Madre.”  (AR 1343.)  The court need not defer to Cal Fire’s
assessment.  The court’s independent
review confirms that the City complied with section 1270.04(a) and (b).
Therefore, the petition for writ of mandate is denied on this ground.  
    
D.        The City Did Not Violate
the Consultation Requirement of Section 1276.03(a)(1)
 
Petitioner also
argues that the City violated section 1276.03 of the Fire Safe Regulations.  Section 1276.03 provides, in relevant part,
as follows: 
 
(a) When Building construction meets the following
criteria, the Local Jurisdiction shall determine the need and location for Fuel
Breaks in consultation with the Fire Authority:
 
(1)  
the permitting or approval of three (3)
or more new parcels …. [¶]
 
(b)  
Fuel Breaks required by the Local
Jurisdiction, in consultation with the Fire Authority, shall be located,
designed, and maintained in a condition that reduces the potential of damaging
radiant and convective heat or ember exposure to Access routes, Buildings, or
infrastructure within the Development.
 
[¶¶]
 
(e) Fuel Breaks shall be completed prior to the
commencement of any permitted construction.
 
(§ 1276.03(a)(1), (b), and (e), emphasis
added.)  
 
            Petitioner
has not shown that the City violated section 1276.03.  In fact, the City “determine[d] the need and
location for Fuel Breaks”—which by definition includes fuel modification zones—when
it approved the Specific Plan and certified the EIR.  The regulations define “Fuel Break” as “[a]
strategically located area where the volume and arrangement of vegetation has
been managed to limit fire intensity, fire severity, rate of spread, crown fire
potential, and/or ember production.”  (§
1270.01(n).)  The term “fuel modification”
is used in the Specific Plan, EIR, and Fire Protection Plan to convey a similar
principle as “Fuel Break.”  (See e.g. AR
2544, 2545, 2704-09, 5396-97.)  The
Project’s Fire Protection Plan analyzes the need for, and location of, fuel
breaks and fuel modification at the Project site.  (AR 5396-97.) This analysis included fire
behavior modeling, and described how that modeling considered the Project’s
“fire environment, the enhanced building features, fire protection systems, and
exterior site design layout.”  (AR 5397.)
 The Fire Protection Plan established the
design and maintenance requirements of the various fuel breaks and modification
areas incorporated into the Project’s design. (AR 5396-5399, 5436.)  The Fire Protection Plan incorporated and
relied upon Cal Fire data. (AR05376, 5383, 5416.)  The Fire Protection Plan was included in the
certified Final EIR at Appendix F2 (AR 5362-5441) and compliance with the Fire
Protection Plan was made a condition of the Project approval. (AR 2340, 2348.)
 
            Petitioner
focuses on the “consultation” requirement, but as a procedural matter, section
1276.03 does not establish any timing requirements for consultation with Cal
Fire, and it does not prevent approval of a tentative map if consultation has
not occurred.  The only timing
requirement established in section 1276.03 is the mandate that fuel breaks, if
they are required, “shall be completed prior to the commencement of any
permitted construction.”  (§ 1276.03(e).)  Petitioner does not show, with evidence, that
building permits have yet been issued. 
Accordingly, consultation with Cal Fire about the Fire Breaks required
by the Project plans and approvals could still occur consistent with the
regulation.  
 
            Finally, substantial evidence in the
record shows that “Cal Fire was among the
state agencies reviewing the Project” and
Cal Fire did not provide comments on the draft EIR by the deadline.  (AR 1220.) 
Further, as summarized above, the City gave notice to Cal Fire of its
intent to approve the TTM and Cal Fire did not request that the City alter its
fuel modification requirements in any way. (AR 1219-1220, 1343-1345,
5747.)  For all these reasons, Petitioner
has not shown that the City’s approval of the TTM violated the consultation
requirement of section 1276.03.  
            
            E.         The City Complied with the Fire Safe Regulations and the
Municipal Code
 
            1.         The
TTM complied with the section 1270.04(c)
 
The TTM’s
conditions of approval require compliance with the Fire Safe Regulations.  The Fire Safe Regulations state that “the
Local Jurisdiction shall ensure that the applicable sections of this Subchapter
become a condition of approval of any applicable construction or Development
permit or map.”  (§ 1270.04(c).)  Contrary to Petitioner’s assertion, the TTM
complies with this requirement. 
Specifically, General Condition of Approval #2 for the TTM states: “The
applicant shall comply with all applicable provisions of Federal, State and Los
Angeles County law and regulations, including but not limited to the California
Environmental Quality Act.”  (AR
1256.)  This condition necessarily requires
compliance with the Fire Safe Regulations, which are state regulations.  Petitioner cites no authority, and the court
has found none, in support of Petitioner’s position that section 1270.04(c)
requires each “applicable section” of the Fire Safe Regulations to be
referenced specifically in the conditions of approval.  (See Reply 12:1-16.)  Thus, the court concludes that the City
complied with section 1270.04(c)
 
2.         The TTM’s conditions require offsite improvements
to Carter Avenue 
 
The Fire Safe
Regulations provide that “[r]oads … whether public or private … shall provide
for safe access for emergency Wildfire equipment and civilian evacuation
concurrently, and shall provide unobstructed traffic circulation during a
Wildfire emergency….”  (§ 1273.00.)  With respect to road “width,” the regulations
further provide in relevant part:
 
All roads shall be constructed to provide a minimum of
two ten (10) foot traffic lanes, not including shoulder and striping. These
traffic lanes shall provide for two-way traffic flow to support emergency
vehicle and civilian egress, unless other standards are provided in this
article or additional requirements are mandated by Local Jurisdictions or local
subdivision requirements. 
 
(§ 1273.01.)  In addition, road surfaces “shall be designed
and maintained to support the imposed load of Fire Apparatus weighing at least
75,000 pounds.” (§ 1273.02(a).)
 
Petitioner argues that, in its current condition, Carter Avenue does not
meet minimum travel lane width requirements of the Fire Safe Regulations.  (OB 19-20.) 
However, the Specific Plan expressly includes improvements to Carter
Avenue, and these improvements will provide travel lanes of at least 10 feet.
(AR 579; see also AR 611, 679-681, 1257-59.)  
 
Petitioner also argues that “the manner in which the off-site
improvement of Carter was included in the Development Agreement and the
Tentative Tract Map does not ensure that that the ingress and egress
requirements of the Fire Safe Regulations will eventually be satisfied.”  (OB 20:19-21.)  Specifically, Petitioner contends that the
Development Agreement could be renegotiated and does not actually require
Real Parties to improve Carter, and that Government Code section 66462.5(a) creates
“the risk that a final map will be recorded without the improvements.”  (OB 21-22.) 

 
As a
preliminary matter, the final EIR contradicts Petitioner’s claims and states
clearly that “the existing Carter Avenue access [will be] improved to meet fire
apparatus access road requirements,” and that “[a]ll roads [will] comply with
access road standards of not less than 24 feet, unobstructed width and are
capable of supporting an imposed load of at least 75,000 pounds.” (AR 2706.)  The EIR also concludes that, with implementation
of the Fire Protection Plan, the Project’s environmental impacts associated
with wildfire would be less than significant and no mitigation measures would
be required.  (AR 2711.)  Petitioner did not challenge these material findings
in the EIR and cannot do so now.  
 
Regardless, Petitioner’s arguments are speculative and unpersuasive. 
As discussed above, the TTM was conditioned upon compliance with all
applicable sections of the Fire Safe Regulations.  (AR 1256.) 
Specific Condition of Approval #3 also requires the development be
constructed and maintained consistent with the Specific Plan, which includes
the offsite Carter Avenue improvements as part of the Project. (AR 1257, 579,
588, 680-681.)  The Development Agreement
also requires that construction of the improvements commence prior to the
issuance of the first building permit. 
(AR 731.)  Although the Real Parties theoretically could seek to renegotiate the
Development Agreement if they are unable to secure the rights from the County
to complete the offsite improvements to Carter (AR 1183), any future
renegotiation of the Development Agreement would be a discretionary action of
the City Council, subject to public notice and hearing, as well as the provisions
of CEQA.  Any renegotiated term could not
override an applicable Federal, State, or local statute or regulation,
including the Fire Safe Regulations. 
These issues are not ripe for resolution in this petition.    
 
Petitioner’s
reliance on Government Code section 66462.5 is misplaced.  This statute “places an obligation on the
local governing body to acquire an interest in land upon which the subdivider
is obligated to build improvements within 120 days of the filing of the final
subdivision map.  The failure to abide by
the statutory time limit results in a waiver of the obligation to construct the
improvements.”  (Hill v. City of
Clovis (2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 438, 445-446.) 
Furthermore, section 66462.5 “is relevant only in the situation in which
approval of the final map is being delayed or refused.”  (Id. at 449.)  Here, the Development Agreement requires the Real
Parties, not the City, to acquire rights to Carter and only requires
construction of the offsite improvements to be completed prior to issuance of
the 11th building permit.  (AR 731.)  Under these circumstances, there is no
evidence, or reason to believe, that the City will unjustly refuse or delay
issuance of a final map.  Accordingly,
section 66462.5 is not applicable and, furthermore, it is pure speculation for
Petitioner to argue that any waiver under the statute will occur.  Finally, as discussed, the TTM was
conditioned upon compliance with all applicable sections of the Fire Safe
Regulations.  (AR 1256.)  Thus, even if waiver under section 66462.5
somehow occurred, Petitioner fails to show that the result would be
non-compliant with the Fire Safe Regulations. 

 
Based on the foregoing, Petitioner has not
proven that the Project, as conditioned, violates the ingress and egress
requirements of the Fire Safe Regulations. 

 
3.         The TTM has no other deficiencies under
the Fire Safe Regulations 
 
Petitioner argues
that the TTM violated the Fire Safe Regulations because the conditions of
approval do not “address the provision of emergency water,” do not include
detailed requirements for fire hydrants, and do not provide “discussion” of
“which mechanisms are being imposed to reduce structure-to-structure ignition.”
(OB 22:8-15.)  As discussed, the TTM was conditioned upon compliance
with all applicable sections of the Fire Safe Regulations.  (AR 1256.) 
Thus, contrary to Petitioner’s assertion, the conditions of approval do
address the applicable requirements of the Fire Safe Regulations.  Furthermore, Petitioner ignores the detailed
analyses of wildfire risk and fire safety that were included in the Specific
Plan, final EIR, and Fire Protection Plan, including analyses related to water
supply, the location of fire hydrants, and mechanisms to reduce
structure-to-structure ignition.  (See
e.g. AR 2697-2711, 5368-69, 5393-5394.)  The
Fire Safe Regulations do not require these issues to be incorporated in the TTM
itself.
 
            4.         The
TTM complies with the Municipal Code 
 
Petitioner
contends that the TTM did not include the required information regarding the
width of Carter Avenue immediately “adjacent” to the site, as required by
section 16.12.040.A.5 and 7 of the City’s Municipal Code.  (OB 22-23; see RJN Exh. 1, 7.)  Based on the court’s review, the TTM appears
to include sufficient information about the width of Carter Avenue.  (AR 261-267.) 
Petitioner has not adequately explained, with discussion of the record,
how the TTM is deficient in this regard. 
(See OB 22-23.)  Moreover, subsection
16.12.040.C of the City’s Municipal Code states:
 
The director of planning and community preservation
may waive any of the foregoing requirements when, in the determination of the
director of planning and community preservation, any such requirement is not
necessary due to the nature of the proposed subdivision of land, or other
circumstances justify such waiver.
 
(RJN Exh. 1.)  As discussed, the Specific Plan, Final EIR,
and Development Agreement all addressed the current and future condition of
Carter Avenue in detail.  These documents
were included in the City Council Staff Report for the February 27, 2024, meeting
at which the City Council approved the TTM. (AR 1230-1231.)  Even if Carter Avenue ran “adjacent” to the
TTM, it would have been reasonable for staff to conclude the record justifies
not depicting the off-site Carter Avenue improvements on the TTM.  Moreover, the City had all relevant
information regarding the existing and proposed condition of Carter Avenue
before it approved the TTM application. 
Therefore, assuming without deciding that the TTM lacks sufficient information
about the width of Carter (see AR 261-67), Petitioner has not shown a
prejudicial abuse of discretion or other legal error that would justify
invalidating the TTM.  (Code Civ. Proc. §
1094.5(b).)
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER 
 
            Based upon the foregoing, the court
orders as follows:
 
            1.         The
petition for writ of mandate is denied.  This
order is without prejudice to Petitioner filing a petition to challenge any
approval of the final tract map if the City fails to make any necessary changes
to the tentative tract map.  
 
            2.         The
court declines to issue a declaratory judgment because Petitioner has an adequate remedy in the writ cause of action.  (See General of America Ins. Co. v. Lilly (1968)
258 Cal.App.2d 465, 470-471; Hood v. Sup.Ct. (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 319,
324.)  In the alternative, the court
denies the declaratory relief claim for the same reasons it denies the petition
for writ of mandate.
 


 
            3.         The parties shall meet-and-confer and
lodge a proposed judgment.
 
            4.         The court’s clerk shall provide
notice.   
 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED
