And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying a motion to augment the record in a case involving a petition for writ of mandate filed by Alan Gilmer, an officer with the Los Angeles Police Department. Gilmer is challenging his demotion from Detective III to Detective I and seeks to add certain documents to the administrative record, including LAPD Department Manual sections and declarations. The judge has denied the motion, finding that Gilmer did not demonstrate that he could not have introduced the documents earlier and that they were not improperly excluded from the record. The judge has also authorized remote appearances for all hearings and the trial in this matter, citing security concerns and a court order prohibiting law enforcement officers from bringing firearms or deadly weapons into courthouses without permission.
