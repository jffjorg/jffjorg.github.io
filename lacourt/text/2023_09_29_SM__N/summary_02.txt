The Judge has denied the defendants' motion to bifurcate and try first the issues of statute of limitation before all other issues. The defendants, The Regents of the University of California and V. Reggie Edgerton, Ph.D., argued that the Court should separate the statute of limitation issues from the other issues because they believed that the issue of tolling based on purported fraud was a matter for the trier of fact to determine. However, the Court found that the defendants failed to set forth how Dr. Edgerton qualifies under the statute, and that bifurcation would require presentation of the same evidence twice. The Court also noted that the defendants' statute of limitation defense focuses on invalidating the plaintiff's contention that the defendants defrauded him, which is an integral part of the plaintiff's claims for breach of contract and failure to obtain informed consent.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to bifurcate and try the statute of limitation issues before all other issues in the case. The defendants argued that they should be allowed to try the statute of limitation defense separately, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 597.5, which requires the issues raised by a statute of limitation defense to be tried separately and before other issues in the case. However, the judge found that this statute only applies to medical professionals, and Dr. Edgerton, one of the defendants, is not alleged to be a medical professional. The judge also noted that the statute of limitation defense is closely tied to the plaintiff's claims for breach of contract and failure to obtain informed consent, and that trying the statute of limitation issue separately would require the presentation of the same evidence twice. The judge also denied the defendants' request to notify the plaintiff of the statute of limitations applicable to the case, citing Insurance Code Section 11583, which requires written notice of the statute of limitations to be provided by the party making the advance payment. The judge found that the plaintiff filed his action within the 3-year statute of limitations for informed consent, and therefore did not need to be notified of the statute of limitations.
