And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has denied the defendants' motion to bifurcate and try first the issues of statute of limitation before all other issues. The defendants, The Regents of the University of California and V. Reggie Edgerton, Ph.D., argued that the Court should separate the statute of limitation issues from the other issues because they believed that the issue of tolling based on purported fraud was a matter for the trier of fact to determine. However, the Court found that the defendants failed to set forth how Dr. Edgerton qualifies under the statute, and that bifurcation would require presentation of the same evidence twice. The Court also noted that the defendants' statute of limitation defense focuses on invalidating the plaintiff's contention that the defendants defrauded him, which is an integral part of the plaintiff's claims for breach of contract and failure to obtain informed consent.
