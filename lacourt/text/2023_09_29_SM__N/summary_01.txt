The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for an order granting pro hac vice admission to David A. King and N. Adam Dietrich II. The motion is granted because the applicants meet the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 9.40(d) and there are no other facts or circumstances that would show that their appearance in this action would cause a significant disruption of orderly justice. The judge notes that counsel who are not active members of the California State Bar and have not been granted permission to appear pro hac vice are prohibited from representing a party in California courts, and that appearance pro hac vice is a privilege and not a right under the United States Constitution.
