English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration in the case of Deying Chen Sheng v. Cetera Investment Services, LLC, Leo Li-Yuan Chien, and Ka Anson Cheong. The defendants moved to compel arbitration based on the arbitration provision in the New Account Application executed by the plaintiff on May 10, 2017. The plaintiff alleges fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, negligence, conversion, unjust enrichment, and financial elder abuse, claiming that the defendants stole almost $1 million dollars from his investment account. The Judge finds that the defendants have met their burden to establish the existence of an agreement to arbitrate, and that the plaintiff has failed to establish any defenses to enforcement. The Judge also finds that the agreement to arbitrate is not unconscionable, as the plaintiff acknowledged the agreement and acknowledged that translation might be necessary to understand it. As a result, the action is stayed, and the defendants are notified to proceed with arbitration.
