The Court considers the moving papers. No opposition has been received.
 
Plaintiff moves for an order granting preliminary approval of the
proposed settlement of claims brought pursuant to the Private Attorneys general
Act of 2004 (“PAGA”), Cal. Lab Code § 2698, et seq. and for class
action certification. Pursuant to the proposed settlement, Defendant has agreed
to pay $265,000.00 total, $15,000.00 of which is allocated for the
representative PAGA claims. The settlement will be distributed as follows: (1)
$88,333.33 in attorney’s fees and $15,000.00 in costs; (2) $11,250.00 to be
paid to LWDA and $3,750.00 to be paid to the aggrieved employees; (3) $2,500.00
to the named Plaintiff; (4) $15,000.00 settlement administration fee; and (5)
the remaining paid to individual class members according to the number of weeks
worked during the class period.
Plaintiff also moves for conditional class certification. Plaintiff
asserts that (1) the class is ascertainable via Defendant’s employment records;
(2) the class is sufficiently numerous, consisting of approximately 97
individuals; (3) there are common questions of law and fact that apply to the
class, including correct wage payments, adequate rest and meal breaks and
indemnification of business costs; (4) Plaintiff is typical of the settlement
class; (5) Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel can adequately represent the class
because counsel has extensively researched and negotiated this action and
because counsel has significant experience in class actions; and (6) class
certification is more efficient than individual claims. (See Decl. Messrelian.)
 
Based on the moving papers, the Court finds that the settlement is
reasonable and meets the requirements of PAGA and class certification.
Defendant has not opposed.
 
The motion is GRANTED.
