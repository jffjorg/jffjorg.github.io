And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a hearing scheduled for September 16, 2024. The case involves a dispute between Daniel Fitzgerald dba ConTec Development (the plaintiff) and Deanna Edwards and Bijan Williams (the defendants) over the failure to respond to discovery requests. The plaintiff had served the discovery requests on July 11, 2024, and the responses were due on August 14, 2024. However, the defendants' counsel did not receive the discovery requests until the motions to compel responses were served.

The judge notes that if a party fails to provide a timely response to a request for admission, they waive any objection to the requests. The judge also notes that the requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.

In this case, the plaintiff moved to compel responses to the discovery requests and to deem the requests for admission admitted against the defendant Edwards. However, since responses have been served, the motions are denied as moot.
