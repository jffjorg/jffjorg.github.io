BACKGROUND
                
On July 17, 2024, Plaintiff Deying Chen
Sheng filed the operative first amended complaint against Defendants Cetera
Investment Services LLC, Leo Li-Yuan Chien and Ka Anson Cheong, asserting
causes of action for (1) fraud; (2) breach of fiduciary duty; (3) breach of
contract; (4) negligence; (5) conversion; (6) unjust enrichment; and (7)
financial elder abuse. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants, who managed an
investment account for Plaintiff, stole almost $1 million dollars from his
account. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
“On petition of a party to an
arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to
arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate a
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to
arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the
controversy exists….”  (CCP §
1281.2.)  The right to compel arbitration
exists unless the court finds that the right has been waived by a party’s
conduct, other grounds exist for revocation of the agreement, or where a
pending court action arising out of the same transaction creates the
possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.   (CCP § 1281.2(a)-(c).)  “The party seeking arbitration bears the
burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement, and the party
opposing arbitration bears the burden of proving any defense, such as
unconscionability.”  (Pinnacle Museum
Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC (2012) 55 Cal.4th 223,
236.) 
 
A. Existence of Arbitration Agreement
 
Defendants move to compel arbitration
based on the arbitration provision in the New Account Application executed by Plaintiff
on May 10, 2017. (Decl. Bell, Exh. 1.) The agreement provides, “I AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN ME AND YOU ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO ARBITRATION CONDUCTED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF
THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY, INC.’S CODE OF ARBITRATION
PROCEDURE ADMINISTERED BY FINRA DISPUTE RESOLUTION, INC. ARBITRATION MUST BE
COMMENCED WITHIN THE STATUTORY LIMITATION PERIODS APPLICABLE TO THE CLAIMS. I
FURTHER AGREE THAT IF THE FINRA ARBITRATION FORUM IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE
DISPUTE, THE DISPUTE WILL BE SUBMITTED TO ARBITRATION CONDUCTED BY THE AMERICAN
ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION” (Id.) 
 
Defendants assert Plaintiff simultaneously
executed a “Language Acknowledgement,” which stated Plaintiff understood that
he was responsible for understanding the English-language provisions of the New
Account Application. (Decl. Bell, Exh. 2.)
 
In opposition, Plaintiff represents
that he does not recall being provided with either of these forms but states
that he signed whatever forms were given to him by Defendant Chien. (Decl. Sheng
¶¶ 12-14.) Plaintiff does
not state that the signature on the documents is not his or that it is a
forgery.
 
Defendants have met their burden to
establish the existence of an agreement to arbitrate. Plaintiff admits to
signing forms provided to him by Defendants and does not dispute the validity
of his purported signature on the documents. The burden shifts to Plaintiff to
establish any defenses to enforcement.
 
B. Enforceability
 
Unconscionability generally includes
the absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together
with contract terms that unreasonably favor the other party. (Carboni v.
Arrospide (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 76, 82-83.) As the party asserting
unconscionability, Plaintiff has the burden of proving both procedural and
substantive unconscionability. (Crippen v. Central Valley RV Outlet. Inc.
(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1165). Courts analyze the unconscionability
standard in Civil Code section 1670.5 as invoking elements of procedural and
substantive unconscionability. (See id. at 1280-81.) 
 
Procedural unconscionability focuses on
whether there is ‘oppression’ arising from an inequality of bargaining power or
‘surprise’ arising from buried terms in a complex printed form. (Id.)
The substantive element addresses the existence of overly harsh or one-sided
terms. (Id.) An agreement to arbitrate is unenforceable only if both the
procedural and substantive elements are satisfied. (Stirlen v. Supercuts,
Inc. (1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1519, 1533.) However, Armendariz held,
‘[T]he more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of
procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the
term is unenforceable, and vice versa.’ (Armendariz, at 114).”  (McManus v. CIBC World Markets Corp.
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 76, 87 (citations omitted).)
 
Plaintiff asserts that the arbitration
agreement is unenforceable because it is unconscionable. Plaintiff argues that
it is procedurally unconscionable because it is a contract of adhesion, because
Plaintiff is a non-English speaker and because Defendants did not explain the
agreement to Plaintiff. Because the agreement is a “take it or leave it”
contract, there is a low degree of procedural unconscionability. However, the
underlying transaction of investment banking does not necessarily show a power
imbalance like the imbalance in employment agreements or healthcare agreements.
This transaction was completely voluntary on Plaintiff’s part, and the evidence
shows Plaintiff acknowledged the agreement and acknowledged that translation
might be necessary to understand the agreement. 
 
Plaintiff contends that the agreement
is substantively unconscionable because FINRA limits discovery. Though FINRA
has a narrower and more streamlined discovery process than the court system,
Plaintiff has not shown that he will be unable to obtain evidence to support
his claims under the FINRA rules. The rules allow for document exchange, and
provide the arbitrator subpoena power and the authority to order additional
discovery. 
 
Plaintiff has failed to establish the
agreement is unconscionable. Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration is
GRANTED.
