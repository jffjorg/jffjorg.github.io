Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Plaintiff's Motion for Terminating Sanctions against Defendant Miguel A. Melgoza. The judge finds that Defendant has failed to comply with Court orders and has failed to pay monetary sanctions. The judge also finds that Defendant's declaration, which attempts to explain his non-compliance, is not made under penalty of perjury and does not account for the complete lack of responses or appearance from Defendant between May and October 2023. The judge concludes that Defendant's failure to comply with his discovery obligations and with Court orders is willful and that no lighter measure will serve to remedy the prejudice to Plaintiff or deter future violations by Defendant. The judge grants Plaintiff's Motion for Terminating Sanctions and strikes Defendant's Answer to the First Amended Complaint. The judge also denies Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as moot since the motion for terminating sanctions has been granted.
