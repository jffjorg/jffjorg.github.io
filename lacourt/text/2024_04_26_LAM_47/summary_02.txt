And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Dal-Tile Distribution, Inc., moves to strike portions of the complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Arturo Montoya-Bautista and Magdalena Balderas-Molina. The court grants the motion, striking the allegations relating to other products to be identified during the course of discovery. The court also strikes paragraphs 274 and 275 of the complaint, which allege that the defendant was fined for illegally dumping hazardous waste and that an executive of the company was convicted of crimes related to the dumping. The court finds that these allegations are not relevant to the instant case. The court emphasizes that the plaintiffs may still identify additional injury-causing products during discovery and may amend their complaint accordingly.
