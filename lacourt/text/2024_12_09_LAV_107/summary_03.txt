And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying Cash 4 Less' motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent YAS and SBS Trust Deed Network from proceeding with a foreclosure sale. The judge finds that Cash 4 Less is likely to suffer greater harm if the preliminary injunction is denied, as it may lose its rights, title, and interest in the Subject Property. However, the judge also finds that Cash 4 Less has not shown a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of its claims.

Cash 4 Less' claims include allegations of voidable transfer, common law fraudulent transfer, declaratory relief, quiet title, conspiracy to commit fraud, and wrongful foreclosure. However, the judge finds that Cash 4 Less has not submitted sufficient evidence to support these claims, and that the allegations in the verified cross-complaint are insufficient to meet Cash 4 Less' burden.

The judge also finds that YAS submitted evidence showing that it agreed to give Shoval a loan and that the loan was secured by a deed of trust. The judge concludes that Cash 4 Less has not shown a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of its claims and denies the motion for a preliminary injunction.
