COURT’S
  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:       
Demurrer without Motion to Strike 
 



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: Granted.
 
Sustain without leave to amend.

I.               
BACKGROUND¿ 
 
On or about April 29, 2022, Plaintiff Margot Varela
(“Plaintiff”) was a passenger on a bus owned and operated by Defendant Los
Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“Defendant”). (Third
Amended Complaint [“TAC”] ¶
8.) As Plaintiff was exiting the bus, the driver closed the back doors on
Plaintiff and drove away. (TAC ¶ 10.) Plaintiff sustained injuries. (TAC ¶ 11.)

 
On April 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
complaint against Defendant and Does 1 to 50, alleging causes of action for
general negligence and motor vehicle. On November 13, 2023, this court
sustained Defendant’s demurrer and granted Plaintiff leave to amend her first
cause of action. (11/13/23 Minute Order p. 5.) This court also sustained the
demurrer to Plaintiff’s second cause of action without leave to amend. (11/13/23
Minute Order pp. 4-5.)
 
On December 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first
amended complaint. Plaintiff’s first amended complaint did not contain all the
complaint’s pages, so the parties stipulated to allow Plaintiff to file a
second amended complaint. (Stipulation and Proposed Order filed 03/06/24.)
 
On April 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
second amended complaint. 
 
On September 20, 2024, Defendant demurred
to Plaintiff’s second amended complaint. That same day, Plaintiff filed a third
amended complaint against Defendant and Does 1 through 50 alleging a cause of
action for negligence. 
 
On October 23, 2024, Defendant demurred
to Plaintiff’s third amended complaint. Plaintiff filed no opposition.
 
II.            
PROCEDURAL
MATTERS 
 
A.   
Timeliness 
 
“A person against whom a complaint or
cross-complaint has been filed may, within 30 days after service of the
complaint or cross-complaint, demur to the complaint or cross-complaint.” (Code
Civ. Proc., §¿430.40(a).)
 
Per California Code of Civil
Procedure §¿1005, subdivision (b), moving papers should be filed at
least 16 court days before they are set for hearing, oppositions thereto should
be filed at least nine court days before the set hearing, and replies to any
oppositions should be filed at least five court days before the set hearing.
 
Plaintiff attached no proof of service to the third amended
complaint, so this court cannot determine whether Defendant’s demurrer was
timely filed under section 430.40, subdivision (a).
 
Defendant timely filed the demurrer under section 1005, subdivision
(b).
 
B.   
Meet
and Confer 
 
California Code of Civil Procedure section¿430.41,
subdivision (a) requires parties to meet and confer before filing a demurrer to
attempt to informally resolve the objections raised in the demurrer.¿The
demurring party is required to file and serve with the demurrer a declaration
either confirming that parties were unable to resolve the issues raised by the
demurrer, despite having met and conferred, or that the opposing party failed
to meet and confer with the demurring party in good faith. (Code Civ. Proc.
§¿430.41(a)(3).)
 
Defendant’s counsel submits a declaration stating, “Counsel for
[Defendant] engaged in numerous meet and confer attempts regarding Plaintiff’s
pleadings, however, Plaintiff has failed to correct the deficiencies.”
(Yehoshua Declaration ¶
2.)
  
This court finds that Defendant satisfied
the meet and confer requirement. 
 
III.          
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the
pleading alone, and not the evidence or the facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc.
v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such,
the court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied
factual allegations. (Id.) 
 
The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the
complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 745.)¿A complaint is sufficient if it contains
“[a]¿statement¿of the¿facts¿constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and
concise language.” (Code Civ. Proc. §¿425.10(a)(1).) Under this standard, a
“complaint ordinarily is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than
evidentiary facts.” (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531,
550.) 
 
A party may demur to a complaint because the complaint “does
not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(e).) 
 
IV.          
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant
argues Plaintiff’s negligence cause of action fails because it does not allege
the statutory basis for liability. (Demurrer p. 5.)
 
Ordinarily,
to state a cause of action for general negligence, Plaintiff must allege: (1)
existence of a duty; (2) breach of that duty; (3) injury to Plaintiff caused by
the breach; and (4) actual damages. (Romero v. Los Angeles Rams (2023)
91 Cal.App.5th 562, 567.)  However, the
Government Claims Act limits the common law liability of public entities. (Miklosy
v. Regents of University of California (2008) 44 Cal.4th 876, 899.)  
 
“Except
as otherwise provided by statute . . . [a] public entity is not liable for an
injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public
entity or a public employee or any other person.” (Gov. Code § 815.)  A “[p]ublic entity” is defined as “the state,
the Regents of the University of California, the Trustees of the California
State University and the California State University, a county, city, district,
public authority, public agency, and any other political subdivision or public corporation
in the State.” (Gov. Code, § 811.2)
 
“[I]n
California all government tort liability is dependent on the existence of an
authorizing statute or ‘enactment’ . . . and to state a cause of action every
fact essential to the existence of statutory liability must be pleaded with
particularity, including the existence of a statutory duty.” (Searcy v.
Hemet Unified School Dist. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 792, 802.) “Since the duty
of a governmental agency can only be created by statute or ‘enactment,’ the
statute or ‘enactment’ claimed to establish the duty must at the very least be
identified.” (Id.)
 
Plaintiff
cites California Penal Code Section 240 as the authorizing stating, alleging
“that defendant’s agent was in violation of California Penal Code Section
240 for his assaultive behavior on the date of the incident when he chose to
slam the doors on plaintiff while she was exiting knowing the high probability
that she could be seriously injured in the process.” (TAC ¶ 14.) Plaintiff further alleges that “this
statutory violation prevents defendant from asserting the immunity defense to
this cause of action per Government Tort Claims Act.” (TAC ¶ 16.)  
 
Penal Code section 240 states “An assault is an unlawful attempt,
coupled with a present ability, to commit a violent injury on the person of
another.”  Penal Code section 240 is
silent as to any duty owed by Defendant to Plaintiff. 
 
 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff has not
identified a statute or enactment establishing a duty owed by Defendant, and Plaintiff’s
negligence cause of action is barred by the Government Claims Act.
 
V.             
LEAVE
TO AMEND 
 
“A
plaintiff against whom a demurrer is sustained is entitled to leave to amend
the defective complaint if she can ‘prove a reasonable possibility that the
defect can be cured by amendment.’” (Shaeffer v. Califia Farms, LLC (2020)
44 Cal.App.5th 1125, 1145.) “The onus is on the plaintiff to articulate
the ‘specific ways’ to cure the identified defect, and absent such an
articulation, a trial . . . court may grant leave to amend ‘only if a
potentially effective amendment is both apparent and consistent with the
plaintiff’s theory of the case.’” (Id.) When a Plaintiff fails to
describe “what additional facts she would plead . . . she has not satisfied her
burden of showing that she can amend the complaint to cure its defects.” (Mohler
v. County of Santa Clara (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 418, 428.)
Plaintiff has had four opportunities to assert a cognizable
claim but has failed to do so. Further, Plaintiff filed no opposition articulating
potential amendments that could cure the defect identified above.  In Stevenson v. San
Francisco Housing Authority (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 269, 284, the Court of
Appeal held that a trial court did not err by denying a request to amend after
the appellant had seven previous chances to state a cause of action. 
In
contrast, Plaintiff has had four opportunities to amend. However, in its
November 13, 2023, order sustaining Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s
complaint, this court stated “Defendant asserts that the first cause of action
fails to provide the required statutory authority to sue a public entity” and
“Defendant’s argument is well-taken. Defendant is a government entity as
defined in Government Code, Section 811.2 and Plaintiff does not allege facts
giving rise to any existence or basis for statutory liability against
Defendant.” (11/13/23 Minute Order pp. 3-4.) Accordingly, Plaintiff has had
over a year to cure this defect, but, despite amending the complaint three
times, failed to do so.
 
Accordingly, this court sustains the demurrer without leave to
amend.
  
VI.          
CONCLUSION 
 
For the foregoing reasons, this court sustains
the demurrer without leave to amend.
