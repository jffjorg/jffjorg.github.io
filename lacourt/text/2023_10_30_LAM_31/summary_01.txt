And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff seeks an award of attorney fees in the amount of $22,260 for work performed on appeal. The court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees based on the lease agreement, which provides for attorney fees between the landlord and tenant. However, the court requires more information to determine the reasonableness of the fees. The plaintiff's motion for attorney fees is continued to allow Richland to file a declaration attesting to the hours she spent on the appeal and her hourly rate. The declaration should also attest to the reasonableness of the Haney & Shah fees. The defendant may file a supplemental brief to address the reasonableness of the hours expended and Richland's hourly rate, and the plaintiff may file a supplemental reply.
