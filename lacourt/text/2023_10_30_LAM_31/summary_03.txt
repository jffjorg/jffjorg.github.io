And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to seal certain records. The motion was filed in response to the inadvertent inclusion of confidential peace officer personnel records in the plaintiff's Pitchess motions. The judge finds that there is an overriding interest in maintaining the confidentiality of these records, as required by California law and as supported by a protective order. The judge also finds that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and that no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest. As a result, the plaintiff's motion to seal is granted.
