And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to compel further responses to requests for production filed by the plaintiff. The motion is granted in part and denied in part. The court orders the defendant to comply with requests 5, 7, 9-10, and denies the motion as to all other requests. The court finds that certain requests are overbroad and not reasonably tailored to the subject matter of the case. The court also finds that the defendant has not justified its objections to certain requests. The court orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling.
