And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff had filed the original complaint on May 8, 2023, alleging that the defendant had requested the plaintiff to manufacture fog lamps for electric vehicles, but the defendant delayed production and ultimately reneged on its agreement. The plaintiff incurred expenses and demanded compensation. The judge finds that the plaintiff adequately complied with the rules of court and that the proposed amendment is necessary and proper. The judge orders the plaintiff to file and serve the First Amended Complaint within three days.
