And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

"The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Garcia Navarro v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC. The defendant's demurrer to the entire complaint has been overruled, meaning that the complaint will proceed to the next stage of litigation. The Judge found that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, despite the defendant's arguments that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Specifically, the Judge found that the plaintiff's allegations of defects in the vehicle and the defendant's failure to service or repair the vehicle despite reasonable attempts are sufficient to state a cause of action. The Judge also rejected the defendant's argument that the plaintiff failed to identify a specific warrant repair presentation, finding that the complaint adequately alleged the plaintiff's attempts to obtain repairs from the defendant. The case is set for a case management conference on September 12, 2024."
