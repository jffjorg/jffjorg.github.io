And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, sustaining their demurrer to the first cause of action for negligence. The court finds that the allegations in the First Amended Cross-Complaint do not adequately plead the essential elements of the cause of action. The court also sustains the demurrer as to the fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action for equitable/implied indemnity, apportionment and contribution, and declaratory relief, respectively, due to the inadequate briefing in opposition by Ingenious. The court allows leave to amend the First Amended Cross-Complaint in light of Ingenious's offer to amend as to the question of duty.
