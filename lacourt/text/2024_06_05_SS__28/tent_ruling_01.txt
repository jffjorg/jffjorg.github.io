  Case Number:  20STCV48628    Hearing Date:   June 5, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On December
21, 2020, Plaintiff Toahiti Chong, a minor, by and through his guardian ad
litem Darlene Chong, filed this action against Defendants City of Los Angeles,
Blueberry & Chicken, LLC, and Does 1-25 for general negligence and premises
liability. 
On
February 10, 2021, Defendant Blueberry & Chicken, LLC filed an answer. 
On
February 24, 2023, the Court dismissed Defendant Blueberry & Chicken LLC
without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On
December 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement. 
On
May 7, 2024, Petitioner Darlene Chong (“Petitioner”)
filed a petition to approve minor’s compromise to be heard on June 5, 2024. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Darlene Chong asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of
minor Plaintiff Toahiti Chong. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“‘[W]ithout
trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the
settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on
the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior
Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
To
obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner
must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and
must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
DISCUSSION      
The petition
contains the following information: 
Gross
settlement amount:                     $300,000.00
Total
medical expenses:                        $142,315.24
Reductions:                                           $0
Amount
to be paid/reimbursed from settlement proceeds:    $1,980.74
Medical
expenses paid:                         $140,334.50

The
Court cannot grant a petition to approve minor’s compromise unless it shows
that all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be paid or
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
Here, Section 12a of the petition states that none of the $142,315.24 in medical expenses were the subject
of negotiated, statutory, or contractual reductions.  Therefore, the petition should show that $142,315.24
will be paid or reimbursed out of the settlement proceeds.  Instead, the petition states that only
$1,980.74 will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  The petition’s assertion in Section 12a(2)
that $142,315.24 of the medical expenses were paid does not change this result,
because the persons or entities who paid this amount (which the petition does not identify) are entitled to
reimbursement from the settlement proceeds unless they agree to reduce or waive
this amount. 
Section
12b(5)(b)(ii) of the petition lists a negotiated reduction of $121,791.03 in the
medical expenses charged by Cedar Sinai Medical Center.  This amount should be included in Section 12a(3)
of the petition.  The same is true of the
$1,252.30 reduction listed in Section 12b(5)(b)(iii)
and the $246.38 reduction listed in Section
12b(5)(b)(v).  These reduction amounts
total $123,289.71.  Even using this total
reduction figure, $19,025.53 out of the $142,315.24 in total medical expenses
would remain that need to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement
proceeds.  Because the petition states
that only $1,980.74 will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds, $17,044.79
in medical expenses remain unaccounted for. 
Petitioner
has not checked any boxes in Section 12b stating whether Medi-Cal, Medicare,
private insurance, or a self-funded plan paid Plaintiff’s medical
expenses.  If one or more of these entities
paid some or all of the medical expenses, Petitioner should check the
appropriate box and provide the requested information.
The
petition requests $100,000.00 in attorney’s fees, which is 33.33% of the gross
settlement amount.  California Rules of
Court, rule 7.955, “requires a trial court, in determining reasonable attorney
fees, to balance an attorney's interest in fair compensation with the
protection of the interests of a minor client. Thus, a trial court ‘must give
consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made between the
attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a disability and
must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances existing at
the time the agreement was made.’ ” (Schulz v. Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc.
(2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 1167, 1176-1177 (Schultz), quoting Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.955(a)(2).) 
The
Court has considered the factors listed in rule 7.955, including counsel’s
declaration and the retainer agreement, and concludes that an attorney’s fee
award of 30 percent is reasonable in this case. 
(See Schultz, supra, 27 Cal.App.5th at p. 1175 [“Even if
there is no benchmark starting point for attorney fees in cases under
California Rules of Court, rule 7.955, a court may of course reasonably
determine that 25 percent is an appropriate percentage in a given case”].)  Therefore, the Court will not award
attorney’s fees that exceed $90,000.00. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of minor
Plaintiff Toahiti Chong’s claims filed by Petitioner Darlene Chong Mitch Reichman on May 7, 2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
