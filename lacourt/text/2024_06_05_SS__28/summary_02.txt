And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment against the defendant. The plaintiff had claimed damages for property damage and attorney's fees, but failed to provide sufficient evidence to support these claims. The judge also noted that the plaintiff did not provide a legal basis for recovering attorney fees. The judge ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling and set a hearing for August 6, 2024, to consider dismissing the case for failure to resubmit the default judgment packet.
