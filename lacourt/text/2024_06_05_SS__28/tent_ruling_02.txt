against Defendants Ralph Rodriguez (“Defendant”), Integon Preferred Insurance
Company (“Integon”), and Does 1-10 for motor vehicle tort, general negligence,
and “Res Ipse Loquitur Negligence.”  The
complaint sought compensation for damage to Plaintiff’s “property and business
property,” “related injuries” (Complaint ¶ 9), and “lost wages and decreased
earning capacity for [Plaintiff’s] business” (Complaint ¶ 23).  The complaint requested special damages,

On

request. 
On
September 22, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of personal service showing
personal service on Defendant of the summons, complaint, and other documents on
May 23, 2022. 
On
September 22, 2022, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
September 18, 2023, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
November 16, 2023, the Court vacated the default. 
On
March 28, April 9, and April 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed statements of damages listing $8,400.00 in
property damage. 
On
April 11, 2024, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
May 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default judgment against
Defendant. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter default judgment against Defendant and award Plaintiff
$11,927.00, consisting of $8,400.00 in special damages (property damages),
$3,000.00 in attorney’s fees, and $527.00 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff has submitted a declaration stating that, due
to Defendant’s negligence in driving his car through a perimeter fence
surrounding Plaintiff’s property, Plaintiff has incurred $2,000.00 in damages
to the fence and $6,400.00 to repair four buses that Plaintiff had parked
behind the perimeter fence.  Plaintiff
provides no repair receipts, damage estimates, or any other evidence to support
the damage figures contained in his declaration.  The Court finds that Plaintiff’s declaration
does not establish a prima facie case for damages. 
Plaintiff
also requests $3,000.00 in attorney fees. 
However, Plaintiff does not explain the legal basis for the recovery of
attorney fees.  (See Cal. Practice Guide,
supra, ¶ 3:91, p. 3-20 [“Each party must pay his or her own attorney
fees unless the parties otherwise agree or statute otherwise provides.
[Citation.]  Consequently, attorney fees
generally are not an element of tort damages” (emphasis omitted)]; see Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(9) [request for default judgment may include “[a]
request for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the
parties”].)  Plaintiff should explain the
legal basis for his request for attorney fees.  The Court denies the application for default judgment. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES the application for default judgment
filed by Plaintiff Manuel Del Rosario on May 2, 2024. 
The Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal
for Failure to Resubmit Default Judgment Packet for 08/06/2024 at 08:30 AM in
Department 28 in the Spring Street Courthouse. 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
