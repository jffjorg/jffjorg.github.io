And here is the English summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the application for default judgment filed by Plaintiff Manuel Del Rosario on May 2, 2024. The plaintiff is seeking a default judgment against Defendant Ralph Rodriguez in the amount of $11,927.00, consisting of $8,400.00 in property damages, $3,000.00 in attorney's fees, and $527.00 in costs. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's declaration does not establish a prima facie case for damages, and the plaintiff has not provided any evidence to support the damage figures contained in the declaration. Additionally, the plaintiff's request for attorney fees is denied because the legal basis for the recovery of attorney fees is not explained. The court sets an order to show cause at a later date to allow the plaintiff to resubmit the default judgment packet.
