 Case Number:  23STCV11209    Hearing Date:   September 21, 2023    Dept:  31 SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT  YEYMI ALEJANDRA PEREZ RAMIREZ, ET AL., Plaintiff(s),  vs.  1037 NORTH SYCAMORE (LOS ANGELES) OWNER, L.P., ET AL.,  Defendant(s). ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )       CASE NO: 23STCV11209  [TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING DEMURRER TO COMPLAINT WITH LEAVE TO AMEND  Dept. 31 1:30 p.m.  September 21, 2023  I. Background Plaintiffs Yeymi Alejandra Perez Ramirez, Gloria Leslie Reyes, and Saul Andres Reyes, by and through his guardian ad litem, Bertha Ramirez, (“Plaintiffs”), individually and as successors in interest to Lucas Obdulio Perez Vicente (“Decedent”), filed this action against Defendants 1037 North Sycamore (Los Angeles) Owner, L.P., CIM Group, L.P. and CIM Holdings, LLC (“Defendants”) for wrongful death arising from work Decedent performed on Defendants’ property, in which unsecured lumbar beams fell on Decedent. The complaint brings causes of action for wrongful death (negligence and premises liability) and a survival action.   Defendants now demur to the complaint arguing the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action against them because Plaintiffs’ are barred from pursuing their claims based upon the Exclusive Remedy Provisions of the Workers’ Compensation Act under Cal. Labor Code §3600, subdivision (a). (Code of Civ. Proc., § 430.10(e)).  In opposition, Plaintiffs contend their claims are not barred by the worker’s compensation exclusivity doctrine because Defendants denied Decedent’s workers’ compensation claim and Defendants were not Decedent’s employer because Defendants assert Decedent was not a statutory employee.  In reply, Defendants contend Plaintiff’s complaint alleges a specific factual pattern that Decedent was lawfully working as an employee at Defendants’ construction site, and therefore Plaintiff’s claims should be brought through the workers’ compensation system.    II.  Procedural Before filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required to meet and confer with the party who filed the pleading demurred to for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.  (CCP § 430.41(a).)   The court finds Defendants fulfilled this requirement prior to filing the demurrer.  (Mot. Samuels Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.)   III. Demurrer A demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings.  It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint).  (CCP §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true.  (Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.) A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.)  No other extrinsic evidence can be considered.  (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court record].) A demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete or discloses some defense that would bar recovery.  (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-72.)  The “face of the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are incorporated by reference into the complaint; or in a superseded complaint in the same action.  (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”]). A demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire cause of action.  (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)  A.  Workers’ Compensation Act  “ ‘The elements of a negligence cause of action are the existence of a legal duty of care, breach of that duty, and proximate cause resulting in injury.  [Citation.] The elements of a cause of action for premises liability are the same as those for negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages.’ [Citation.]”  (McIntyre v. The Colonies-Pacific, LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 664, 671.)  As in any negligence action, whether a duty was owed under the facts is a question of law for the court.  (Castaneda v. Olsher (2007) 41 Cal.4th 1205, 1213.)    The WCA provides the exclusive remedy for an injury sustained by an employee in the course and scope of employment. (Lab. Code, §§ 3600, subd. (a), 3602, subd. (a); Charles J. Vacanti, M.D., Inc. v. State Comp. Ins. Fund (2001) 24 Cal.4th 800, 813, 102 Cal.Rptr.2d 562, 14 P.3d 234 (Vacanti).) The workers’ compensation exclusivity rule is based on the “presumed ‘compensation bargain’ ” in which, in exchange for limitations on the amount of liability, the employer assumes liability regardless of fault for injury arising out of and in the course of employment. (Shoemaker v. Myers (1990) 52 Cal.3d 1, 16, 276 Cal.Rptr. 303, 801 P.2d 1054.) The compensation bargain encompasses both psychological and physical injury arising out of and in the course of the employment. (Lab. Code, §§ 3600, subd. (a), 3208.3.)  (Shirvanyan v. Los Angeles Community College Dist. (2020) 59 Cal.App.5th 82, 105.)   Consequently, an injured worker's remedies against his employer or a co-employee are (absent narrow exceptions) solely under the workers' compensation law—i.e., there is no “common law” action against the employer or a co-employee because, as a general rule, workers' comp is the exclusive remedy for injury or death of an employee occurring in the course and scope of employment.  (Lab. Code §§ 3600, 3601; see generally, Jones v. Kaiser Industries Corp. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 552, 556.)   Subject to exceptions, workers’ compensation is the¿only¿remedy¿available to injured employees¿and their dependents¿against the employer or against any fellow employee responsible for injuries “arising out of and in the course of employment.” (Lab. Code §§ 3600-3602, 5300; see¿Shoemaker v. Myers¿(1990) 52 Cal.3d 1, 18.)  There are some situations in which the injured employee may maintain a civil action against his or her employer.  These include statutory exceptions such as: 1) physical assault by the employer; 2) aggravation of injury by the employer’s fraudulent concealment; 3) products liability cases, 4) power press guards; and 5) the employer is uninsured.  (See Lab. Code §§ 3602, 3706, 4553.)  This exclusivity rule extends to co-employees, unless the co-employee proximately causes another employee's injury or death by a “willful and unprovoked physical act of aggression” or by intoxication.  (Lab. Code, § 3601(a); see Torres v. Parkhouse Tire Service, Inc. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 995, 1002.)      B.  Discussion  The critical element to the applicability of this doctrine is whether Decedent was injured within the course and scope of his employment with Defendants for Workers’ Compensation purposes.   Here, the Complaint alleges in pertinent part:  10. Plaintiffs are informed and believe that on or about July 13, 2021, Plaintiffs’ decedent, Lucas Obdulio Perez Vicente was employed by an unknown company within the State of California. In that capacity, decedent, Lucas Obdulio Perez Vicente, was lawfully working on the Subject Property at the construction site in Los Angeles, California. … 13. Plaintiffs are informed and believe that on July 13, 2021, Lucas Obdulio Perez Vicente, decedent, was directed by Defendants to perform work at the Subject Property consisting of construction activities. […] … 24. […] Defendant owners, OWNER, GROUP, and HOLDINGS, and each of them, directed decedent Lucas Obdulio Perez Vicente to perform work at the Subject Property… (Compl. ¶¶ 10, 13, 24.)  While the complaint alleges Decedent was performing work on the subject property and that Defendants directed Decedent, the complaint falls short of alleging that Decedent was Defendant’s employee or that Defendants hired Decedent. Instead, the complaint provides that Decedent was working on the construction site while “employed by an unknown company.” However, although there are no specific allegations of an employer-employee relationship between Defendants and Decedent, the allegation that Decedent performed work for Defendants at Defendants’ direction implicates Cal. Lab. Code § 3357, which provides that, “Any person rendering service for another, other than as an independent contractor, or unless expressly excluded herein, is presumed to be an employee.”  Because there are sufficient allegations to operate under the presumption that Decedent was Defendants’ employee, especially as Decedent’s position was not clearly defined, Defendants’ Demurrer on this ground is sustained with leave to amend.    Plaintiffs are granted twenty (20) days leave to amend.   Defendants are ordered to give notice.   PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 20th day of September 2023      Hon. Michelle C. Kim Judge of the Superior Court
