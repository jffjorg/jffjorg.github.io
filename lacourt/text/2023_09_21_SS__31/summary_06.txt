Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer to the complaint with leave to amend. The Plaintiffs filed a wrongful death action against the Defendants alleging that the decedent was injured while working on a construction site and that the Defendants failed to provide a safe working environment. The Defendants argued that the complaint fails to state a cause of action because the decedent's claims are barred by the workers' compensation exclusivity doctrine. The Judge found that the complaint falls short of alleging that the decedent was the Defendants' employee or that the Defendants hired the decedent, but instead alleges that the decedent was working on the construction site at the direction of the Defendants. The Judge granted the Plaintiffs 20 days to amend the complaint to cure the defects.

## English Summary

The judge issued a tentative ruling in a wrongful death case where the plaintiff's decedent died while working at a construction site owned by the defendant. The judge found that the complaint, while alleging the decedent was working at the defendants' direction, does not clearly establish whether the decedent was an employee of the defendants.  Because the Workers' Compensation Act may bar the plaintiffs' claims if the decedent was an employee, the judge sustained the defendant's demurrer (a procedural move to dismiss the case) but gave the plaintiffs 20 days to amend their complaint to clarify this crucial relationship.

English text:
This tentative ruling is for a hearing on September 21, 2023, in the case of Yeymi Alejandra Perez Ramirez, Et Al., Plaintiff(s), vs. 1037 North Sycamore (Los Angeles) Owner, L.P., Et Al., Defendant(s), in the Superior Court of the State of California, Central District.
The case concerns a wrongful death claim brought by the plaintiffs against the defendants for work performed on the defendants' property that resulted in the death of the decedent from falling unsecured lumbar beams.
The defendants have filed a demurrer on the grounds that the plaintiffs' claims are barred by the Exclusive Remedy Provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act under Cal. Labor Code §3600, subdivision (a).
The plaintiffs have opposed the demurrer, arguing that their claims are not barred because the defendants denied the decedent's workers' compensation claim and that the defendants were not the decedent's employer because they assert that the decedent was not a statutory employee.
The defendants have replied, arguing that the plaintiffs' complaint alleges a specific factual pattern that the decedent was lawfully working as an employee at the defendants' construction site, and therefore the plaintiffs' claims should be brought through the workers' compensation system.
After reviewing the arguments, the court finds that the plaintiffs have not provided sufficient allegations to establish an employer-employee relationship between the defendants and the decedent.
Therefore, the court sustains the defendants' demurrer with leave to amend the complaint within 20 days.
If no parties submit or appear at the hearing, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
