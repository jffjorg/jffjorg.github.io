Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer to the complaint with leave to amend. The Plaintiffs filed a wrongful death action against the Defendants alleging that the decedent was injured while working on a construction site and that the Defendants failed to provide a safe working environment. The Defendants argued that the complaint fails to state a cause of action because the decedent's claims are barred by the workers' compensation exclusivity doctrine. The Judge found that the complaint falls short of alleging that the decedent was the Defendants' employee or that the Defendants hired the decedent, but instead alleges that the decedent was working on the construction site at the direction of the Defendants. The Judge granted the Plaintiffs 20 days to amend the complaint to cure the defects.
