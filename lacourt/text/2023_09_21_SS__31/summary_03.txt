And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied Defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that Plaintiff has raised triable issues of material fact. The Court found that Defendant did not meet its burden of showing that the condition of the carpet was open and obvious, as the photographs taken by Defendant's employee demonstrated a raised portion on the center edge of the mat. Additionally, the Court found that Defendant's triviality argument was premised on an inaccurate assumption about the condition of the carpet. As a result, the Court has denied Defendant's motion for summary judgment and ordered Defendant to give notice.
