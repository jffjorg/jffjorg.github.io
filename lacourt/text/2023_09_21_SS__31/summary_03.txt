The Court has denied Defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that Plaintiff has raised triable issues of material fact. The Court found that Defendant did not meet its burden of showing that the condition of the carpet was open and obvious, as the photographs taken by Defendant's employee demonstrated a raised portion on the center edge of the mat. Additionally, the Court found that Defendant's triviality argument was premised on an inaccurate assumption about the condition of the carpet. As a result, the Court has denied Defendant's motion for summary judgment and ordered Defendant to give notice.

English text:
This tentative ruling is for the case 21STCV33179, scheduled for a hearing on September 21, 2023, in Dept. 31 of the Superior Court of the State of California, Central District, County of Los Angeles. The case involves Plaintiff Maria L. Barrera and Defendant In-N-Out Burgers.
The Plaintiff visited an In-N-Out restaurant on October 4, 2019, with her husband and tripped and fell on a mat inside the front door. The Defendant has moved for summary judgment, which the Plaintiff opposes.
The Court has reviewed the evidence and determined that the Defendant has not met its burden that there was no existence of a dangerous condition. The Court also found that the Defendant did not meet its burden that the condition was open and obvious, as the photographs and video do not establish the obviousness of the condition. The Defendant's triviality argument is also not valid, as the photographs demonstrate that the center edge of the mat was raised.
Therefore, the Defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement. If the parties do not submit or appear at the hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.

## Case Summary: Barrera v. In-N-Out Burgers

**Case Number:** 21STCV33179
**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023
**Court:** Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles - Central District

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Maria L. Barrera
* **Defendant:** In-N-Out Burgers

**Facts:**

* Plaintiff tripped and fell on a floor mat while exiting an In-N-Out restaurant. 
* Plaintiff alleges the mat was curled up, causing her to fall.
* Defendant argues the mat was not curled up and the condition was open and obvious.
* Defendant moved for summary judgment, claiming no triable issues of material fact exist.

**Issues:**

* **Dangerous condition:** Did the mat pose a dangerous condition?
* **Open and obvious:** Was the condition open and obvious, relieving Defendant of liability?
* **Trivial defect:** Was the alleged defect trivial and not actionable?

**Arguments:**

* **Plaintiff:**  Photographs and surveillance video show a curled-up area on the mat, posing a danger.
* **Defendant:**  Photographs taken after the incident show no curled edges, and the mat was open and obvious.

**Evidence:**

* Plaintiff's testimony describing the mat as "folded" and causing her to trip.
* Defendant's photographs taken after the incident showing the mat with a raised center edge.
* Defendant's surveillance video, which is unclear and does not definitively show the mat's condition.

**Ruling:**

* The Court **DENIED** Defendant's motion for summary judgment.
* The Court found that Defendant did not meet their burden of proving there were no triable issues of material fact regarding the dangerous condition of the mat.

**Reasons:**

* The surveillance video is insufficient to determine the mat's condition.
* The photographs taken after the incident show a raised portion on the mat, contradicting Defendant's claim that it was flat.
* The Court found the condition may not have been open and obvious based on the evidence presented.

Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in Markdown format:

**Case Information**
=====================

* Case Number: 21STCV33179
* Hearing Date: September 21, 2023
* Department: 31
* Court: Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, Central District
* Plaintiff: Maria L. Barrera
* Defendant: In-N-Out Burgers, et al.

**Tentative Ruling**
=====================

* The defendant's motion for summary judgment is DENIED.

**Background**
-------------

The plaintiff, Maria L. Barrera, filed an action against the defendant, In-N-Out Burgers, alleging causes of action for negligence and premises liability. The plaintiff tripped and fell on a curled-up carpet mat while exiting the restaurant.

**Defendant's Argument**
----------------------

The defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because the condition and placement of the mat did not constitute a dangerous condition. The defendant asserts that the mat was only 10 months old, and surveillance videos and photographs from the incident demonstrate no curled-up corners, wrinkles, or wear and tear on the mat.

**Plaintiff's Argument**
----------------------

The plaintiff argues that the photographs submitted by the defendant demonstrate a curled-up/wrinkled area on the side of the mat. The plaintiff also contends that the defendant's surveillance video is distant and partially blocked by a part of the building, and that the 480 individuals walking over the top of the mat is not the area which the plaintiff claims caused her fall.

**Court's Analysis**
-------------------

The court analyzed the defendant's motion for summary judgment and found that the defendant did not meet its burden of proof that there were no triable issues of material fact. The court concluded that the defendant's triviality argument was premised on the notion that the mat's corners were not turned up, and that the mat was lying flat without curled edges and wrinkles. However, the photographs clearly demonstrate that the center edge of the mat was raised.

**Conclusion**
--------------

Based on the foregoing, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is DENIED. The defendant is ordered to give notice.

**Next Steps**
--------------

Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.

# Case Summary

Case Number: 21STCV33179

Hearing Date: September 21, 2023

Dept: 31, Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles - Central District

Plaintiff: Maria L. Barrera

Defendant: In-N-Out Burgers, et al.

## Tentative Ruling

The Judge denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment.

## Background

Plaintiff Maria L. Barrera filed a lawsuit against Defendant In-N-Out Burgers, alleging negligence and premises liability. The complaint states that Plaintiff tripped and fell on a curled-up carpet while exiting the restaurant.

Defendant moved for summary judgment, and Plaintiff opposed the motion. Defendant then filed a reply to Plaintiff's opposition.

## Analysis

The Judge reviews the evidence presented by both parties, including surveillance videos and photographs taken before and after the incident. The Judge concludes that the video quality is not clear enough to discern the condition of the mat, and the photographs taken by Defendant's employee show a raised portion on the center edge of the mat.

Plaintiff testified that she tripped because her foot got stuck against the mat, and the raised portion was located on the edge of the mat.

The Judge determines that Defendant did not meet its burden to prove that there was no existence of a dangerous condition or that the condition was open and obvious. Defendant's triviality argument is also not supported by the evidence.

Since Defendant did not discharge its burden of proof, Plaintiff has no burden to come forward with any evidence.

## Conclusion

The Judge denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment.
