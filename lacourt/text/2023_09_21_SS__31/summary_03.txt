The Court has denied Defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that Plaintiff has raised triable issues of material fact. The Court found that Defendant did not meet its burden of showing that the condition of the carpet was open and obvious, as the photographs taken by Defendant's employee demonstrated a raised portion on the center edge of the mat. Additionally, the Court found that Defendant's triviality argument was premised on an inaccurate assumption about the condition of the carpet. As a result, the Court has denied Defendant's motion for summary judgment and ordered Defendant to give notice.

English text:
This tentative ruling is for the case 21STCV33179, scheduled for a hearing on September 21, 2023, in Dept. 31 of the Superior Court of the State of California, Central District, County of Los Angeles. The case involves Plaintiff Maria L. Barrera and Defendant In-N-Out Burgers.
The Plaintiff visited an In-N-Out restaurant on October 4, 2019, with her husband and tripped and fell on a mat inside the front door. The Defendant has moved for summary judgment, which the Plaintiff opposes.
The Court has reviewed the evidence and determined that the Defendant has not met its burden that there was no existence of a dangerous condition. The Court also found that the Defendant did not meet its burden that the condition was open and obvious, as the photographs and video do not establish the obviousness of the condition. The Defendant's triviality argument is also not valid, as the photographs demonstrate that the center edge of the mat was raised.
Therefore, the Defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement. If the parties do not submit or appear at the hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.
