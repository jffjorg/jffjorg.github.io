And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion of Counsel, Paul M. Krueger, to be relieved as counsel for the Plaintiff, Nadine Starr. The motion was made on the grounds that Counsel has been unable to communicate with the Plaintiff and has been met with unreasonable difficulty in carrying out representation. Counsel has made efforts to locate a current address for the Plaintiff, but has been unable to confirm it. The judge has instructed Counsel to continue serving the moving papers on the Plaintiff and on all defendants who have appeared in this action, as well as on the Clerk of the Court, as previously directed. The motion is denied without prejudice, and Counsel is ordered to give notice. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the required information.
