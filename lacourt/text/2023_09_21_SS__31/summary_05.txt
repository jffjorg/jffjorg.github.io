**English Text Summary:**

The judge is denying the attorney's request to be relieved from representing the Plaintiff in this case. The attorney stated that he couldn't communicate with the Plaintiff and was having trouble effectively representing her. The judge previously denied a similar request and instructed the attorney to serve the motion to be relieved on the Clerk of the Court if he couldn't confirm the Plaintiff's current address. 

While the attorney attempted to confirm the Plaintiff's address through the US Postal Service, the judge determined it wasn't sufficient proof. The attorney must continue to serve the motion to be relieved on the Plaintiff and all Defendants who have appeared in the case, as well as the Clerk of the Court.  The denial is without prejudice, meaning the attorney can re-file the motion if necessary.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of Plaintiff's attorney, Paul M. Krueger, to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion was filed due to the attorney's inability to communicate with the plaintiff and conduct which renders it unreasonably difficult to carry out representation effectively. The attorney declared that he had served the moving papers on the plaintiff via mail at the client's last known address, but was unable to confirm the address or locate a more current address. The court previously denied a similar motion on June 26, 2023, and instructed the attorney to serve the moving papers on the Clerk of the Court if unable to serve the plaintiff at a confirmed address. The attorney has submitted a supplemental declaration and requested confirmation from the U.S. Postmaster, but the court finds that confirmation that mail is delivered to the address does not necessarily confirm it is the plaintiff's current address. The court orders the attorney to serve the moving papers on the Clerk of Court and denies the motion without prejudice. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if necessary, appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
