**Tentative Ruling:**

**Case Number:** 20STCV45654
**Plaintiff's Name:** Marcela Elidet Martinez
**Defendant's Name:** Liliana Cruz, et al.

**Background:** The plaintiff, Marcela Elidet Martinez, filed a lawsuit against defendant Liliana Cruz, alleging that Cruz physically assaulted and beat Martinez in a public parking lot. The plaintiff is seeking summary judgment on the grounds that there is no defense to the alleged causes of action.

**Request for Judicial Notice:** The plaintiff requested the court to take judicial notice of two case law opinions, Thomas v. Doorley and People v. Moody. The request is granted only to the extent that the court can take judicial notice of the existence of judicial opinions and verdicts from other cases, but not of the truth of hearsay statements from them.

**Motion for Summary Judgment:** The plaintiff has moved for summary judgment, alleging that the defendant's conduct was intentional and caused harm to the plaintiff. The court previously denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, and this is the second time the plaintiff is seeking summary judgment.

**Analysis:** The court has reviewed the evidence presented by the plaintiff, including the complaint, photographs of the alleged injury, medical records, and witness statements. However, the majority of the evidence is inadmissible hearsay, and the plaintiff has not demonstrated any hearsay exceptions. The court finds that the plaintiff has not proved each element of the causes of action with admissible evidence, and therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied.

**Conclusion:** Based on the foregoing, the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is DENIED. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice.

**Next Steps:** The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number. The party must also include the hearing date and time, counsel's contact information, and the identity of the party submitting. If all parties submit, the court will adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court. If no parties submit, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.

**Case Number:** 20STCV45654

**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023

**Dept:** 31 SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA - FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT

**Plaintiff(s):** Marcela Elidet Martinez

**Defendant(s):** Liliana Cruz, et al.

**People-Names:** Marcela Elidet Martinez, Liliana Cruz, Elissa Burgos, Downey Police Department.

**Places:** Public parking lot.

**Dates:** Unspecified date when the alleged assault took place.

**Events:** The plaintiff, Marcela Elidet Martinez, alleges that the defendant, Liliana Cruz, physically assaulted and beat her in a public parking lot.

**Disputes:** The disputes revolve around the allegations of assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress made by the plaintiff against the defendant.

**Acts:** The defendant is accused of punching the plaintiff in the face multiple times in a public parking lot.

**Agreements:** None mentioned in the summary.

**Laws:** Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, Evidence Code section 1200.

**Case Citations:** Thomas v. Doorley (1959) 175 Cal. App 2d 545, People v. Moody (1943) 62 Cal. App. 2d 18.

**Significant Statements:** The motion for summary judgment is denied due to the plaintiff's failure to produce admissible evidence on each element of her causes of action.

The plaintiff, Marcela Elidet Martinez, initiated a lawsuit against the defendant, Liliana Cruz, alleging assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiff previously moved for summary judgment, which was denied. She has now brought the motion once more on substantially the same grounds, with only changes in the amount of damages. However, the court has found that the plaintiff has not produced admissible evidence on each element of her causes of action.

The plaintiff requested the court to take judicial notice of two case law opinions, which was granted only to the extent of the existence of judicial opinions and verdicts from other cases, but not of the truth of hearsay statements from them.

In assessing the motion for summary judgment, the court found that the plaintiff failed to provide admissible evidence regarding the defendant's intent, the plaintiff's harm, and the defendant's conduct being a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff's harm. The majority of the evidence presented by the plaintiff was inadmissible hearsay, and she did not demonstrate any hearsay exceptions.

Ultimately, the court denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment due to her inability to prove each element of her causes of action with admissible evidence.
