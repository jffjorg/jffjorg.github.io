And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The COURT has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Marcela Elidet Martinez's motion for summary judgment in her case against Defendant Liliana Cruz, ET AL. The Plaintiff alleges that she was physically assaulted and battered by the Defendant, and seeks damages for assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Court has reviewed the evidence presented by the Plaintiff, including photographs, medical records, and witness declarations, but has found that the majority of the evidence is inadmissible hearsay. The Court concludes that the Plaintiff has not provided sufficient admissible evidence to support her claims, and therefore denies the motion for summary judgment. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and are required to submit to the Court's tentative ruling by email or in person at the scheduled hearing.
