The Judge's tentative ruling grants Showbiz Restrooms, LLC's motion to continue the trial date from October 23, 2023 to February 26, 2024. The motion was unopposed and was based on the need for additional discovery, including the completion of medical records, depositions of out-of-state treating providers, and the issuance of subpoenas. The Judge found good cause to grant the continuance, considering the proximity of the original trial date, the need for additional discovery, and the potential prejudice to the parties if the continuance were not granted. The new trial date is set for February 26, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 31 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
