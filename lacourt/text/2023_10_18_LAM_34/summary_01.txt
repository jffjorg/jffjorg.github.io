And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The motion for leave to file a second amended complaint is denied. The court finds that the case has been ongoing for over a year and is now moot since the real property at issue has been vacated. Instead of amending the pleadings, the court recommends dismissing the case. The court notes that most of the causes of action and parties would be included in the related case, and if the plaintiffs wish to amend their pleadings, they can file a motion in that case.
