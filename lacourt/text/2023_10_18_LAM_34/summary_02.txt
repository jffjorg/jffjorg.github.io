And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition. The defendant had noticed the deposition for August 9, 2023, but the plaintiff did not respond. The defendant re-noticed the deposition for August 30, 2023, but the plaintiff did not appear. The plaintiff argues that he had been unrepresented after the death of his prior counsel and had trouble participating in his deposition due to inadequate communication from the defense counsel. The judge finds that the plaintiff has been willing to participate in his deposition but has had trouble doing so and does not believe that an order compelling the deposition is necessary.
