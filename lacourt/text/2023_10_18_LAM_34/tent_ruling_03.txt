The Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is DENIED.
 
BACKGROUND:
 
On December
16, 2022, Plaintiff Juan Lopez, who at that time was unrepresented by counsel,
filed his Complaint against Defendant Sylvia Mouneu. 
 
On February 3,
2023, with the assistance of counsel, Plaintiff filed his First Amended
Verified Complaint. 
 
On April 21,
2023, Defendant filed her Verified Answer to First Amended Complaint. 
 
On September
14, 2023, Plaintiff’s Counsel, Angela Swan, filed: (1) MC-051, Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel; (2) MC-052, Declaration; and (3) POS-030, Proof of Service
by First-Class Mail — Civil.
 
No opposition
or other response has been filed to the Motion. 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
An attorney moving to be relieved as counsel under California Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) must meet the requirements set out in California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 
 
To comply with rule 3.1362, the moving party must submit the following
forms: (1) Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel; (2)
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel; and (3)
Order Granting Attorney's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a), (c), (e).) 
 
The moving party must serve the aforementioned forms on the client and
all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(d).) Further, when the client is served by mail, the attorney's
declaration must show that the client's address was confirmed within the last
30 days and how it was confirmed. (Id.) 

 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for
withdrawal should be granted. (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 406.) 
 
II.      
Discussion
 
Procedurally, Counsel’s Motion does not comply with all of the
requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. Specifically, Judicial
Council Form MC-053, Proposed Judgment, has not been submitted, nor has any
other form of proposed judgment been filed. The Court lacks sufficient evidence
to determine whether such a form has been properly served, which is also a
requirement. 
 
Substantively, the Court is unaware of the reason for the proposed
withdrawal from representation. Plaintiff’s Counsel states in the Declaration,
“See Exhibit #1.” But no such exhibit is attached to the declaration submitted
or to any of the other filings submitted. 
 
        Without the items mentioned above, the
Court lacks a sufficient basis to balance the harms and grant the relief
Plaintiff’s Counsel seeks. 
 
The Court
DENIES the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel. 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is DENIED.
