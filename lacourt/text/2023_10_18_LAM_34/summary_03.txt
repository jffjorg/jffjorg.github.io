And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Plaintiff's Counsel, Angela Swan. The Motion has been DENIED. The Judge found that Counsel failed to comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, specifically by not submitting the Proposed Judgment form and not providing sufficient evidence of its service. Additionally, the Judge is unaware of the reason for Counsel's proposed withdrawal from representation, as no exhibit was attached to the Declaration. Without the required information, the Court lacks a sufficient basis to balance the harms and grant the relief sought by Counsel.
