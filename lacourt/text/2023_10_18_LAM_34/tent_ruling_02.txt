ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
“If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party
under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (a).)
 
“If a motion under subdivision (a)
is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g).)
 
II.       Discussion
 
Defendant moves the Court to compel Plaintiff to appear for a
deposition within five days of the issuance of this Order. (Motion, p.
5:19–21.) Defendant does not request monetary sanctions. 
 
Defendant argues: (1) that Defendant noticed the deposition of Plaintiff
for August 9, 2023, but no response came from the office of Plaintiff’s
Counsel; (2) that Defendant re-noticed the deposition of Plaintiff for August
30, 2023, but Plaintiff did not appear for the deposition; and (3) that
Defendant must be allowed to conduct and complete the deposition of Plaintiff.
(Motion, pp. 4:23–28, 5:1–17.)
 
        Plaintiff opposes the Motion, arguing:
(1) that Plaintiff did not have counsel from March 30, 2023 to October 6, 2023;
(2) that Plaintiff now has counsel and is now participating fully in the
discovery process; and (3) that Plaintiff did, in fact, appear at the
deposition on August 30, 2023 but that Defendant did not let him into the
deposition from the virtual waiting room. (Opposition, pp. 2:11–27, 3:4–8.) In
support of this last point, Plaintiff attaches a screenshot of the virtual
waiting room he was allegedly in on August 30, 2023. (Decl. Atherton, Exh. 1.)
Plaintiff does not request monetary sanctions in his Opposition. 
 
        Defendant has not submitted a reply or
other response regarding the Motion. 
 
        It appears that Plaintiff has been
willing to participate in his deposition but has had trouble doing so; in part this
may have been because he had been unrepresented after the death of his prior
counsel, and in part because Defense Counsel had not adequately communicated
with Plaintiff. 
 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel agrees that defense counsel has the right to deposition
Plaintiff.  (Opposition, p. 2:21-23.)  The Court does not believe that an order
compelling Plaintiff’s deposition is necessary.  Should there be any problem in arranging for
Plaintiff’s deposition, the Court is always available for an Informal Discovery
Conference. 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The Motion is DENIED.
