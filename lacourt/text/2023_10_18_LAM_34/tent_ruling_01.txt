ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
“The court may, in furtherance of justice, and
on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or
proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a
mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may,
upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The court may likewise,
in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as
may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars;
and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by
this code.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).)
 
        “Any judge, at any time before or
after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such terms
as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any pleading or pretrial
conference order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 576.)
 
“A motion to amend a pleading before trial
must: (1) Include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which
must be serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or
amendments; (2) State what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to
be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the deleted
allegations are located; and (3) State what allegations are proposed to be
added to the previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line
number, the additional allegations are located.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1324(a).)
 
“A separate declaration must accompany the
motion and must specify: (1) The effect of the amendment; (2) Why the amendment
is necessary and proper; (3) When the facts giving rise to the amended
allegations were discovered; and (4) The reason why the request for amendment
was not made earlier.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b).)
 
“This discretion should be exercised liberally
in favor of amendments, for judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed
matters in the same lawsuit.” (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Super. Ct. (1989)
213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.)   Leave to
amend is thus liberally granted, provided there is no statute of limitations
concern. (Kolani v. Gluska (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 402, 411.) The Court may deny the
plaintiff’s leave to amend if there is prejudice to the opposing party, such as
delay in trial, loss of critical evidence, or added costs of preparation. (Id.)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
Plaintiffs move for leave to file their
Proposed Second Amended Complaint, which would include new claims and new
parties. (Motion, p. 14:13–14.)
 
Defendant argues that leave to amend should
be denied because the Proposed Second Amended Complaint is duplicative of Plaintiffs’
Second Amended Complaint in the civil action. (Opposition, p. 6:20–21.)
 
In their Reply (which was timely filed on
October 11, 2023, but which still came after the original tentative order was
released on October 10, 2023), Plaintiffs reiterate their arguments, as well as
arguing: (1) that the Court should reconsider the tentative decision in light
of the Reply; and (2) that the amendments should be allowed, and the cases
consolidated, rather than the amendments denied with this case dismissed.
(Reply, pp. 1:2–4, 5:19–12.)
 
The Court agrees with Defendant’s argument. 
 
This case (Case No. 22STCV19824) regards
an alleged unlawful detainer. Given that this case began more than one year
ago, it is long past the time in which this case should have been resolved.
Further, this case is now moot because, as Plaintiffs admit, Defendant vacated
the real property at issue on July 10, 2023. (Motion, p. 13:17–18 and Decl.
Goldberg, ¶ 7.) No trial is presently scheduled in this matter.  However a trial is scheduled for March 4, 2024
in the related case. 
 
Rather than amend the FAC, it appears to the
Court that this case should be dismissed. Dismissal would not prejudice
Plaintiffs at all because, as Defendant correctly notes, the lead case (Case
No. 22STCV10347) is a civil case that already includes (via the Hughes’ Second
Amended Cross-Complaint in that matter) most of the causes of action and most of
the parties that would be involved with the Proposed Second Amended Complaint.
If Plaintiffs wish to amend their Second Amended Cross-Complaint in the lead
case in the manner they have proposed in this case, they can file the
appropriate motion.  
 
 
III.    
Conclusion
 
The Motion is DENIED.
