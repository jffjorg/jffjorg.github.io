BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action arising from an architectural services agreement.
In July 2020, Plaintiff MMA and Defendant Bently Real Estate LLC (Bently) entered
into an agreement in which MMA agreed to provide architectural services to
Bently for the development of a commercial property in West Covina.
Subsequently, MMA alleges Bently began to fall behind on payments for MMA’s
services. In January 2023, MMA terminated the agreement as a result of Bently’s
alleged failure to make payments. On February 1, 2023, MMA recorded a
mechanic’s lien against the West Covina property which is allegedly owned by Defendant
Diamond City Shopping Center, LLC (Diamond City).
On May
2, 2023, MMA filed a complaint against Diamond City, Bently, and Does 1-10, alleging
the following causes of action: (1) breach of contract, (2) foreclosure of
mechanic’s lien on real property, and (3) promissory estoppel. On September 5, MMA’s
process server served Diamond City and Bently with substitute service in West
Covina.
On October
19, 2023, default was entered against Diamond City and Bently. On November 6,
Diamond City and Bently filed an answer. MMA then submitted the present
application for default judgment on November 22.
An
OSC Re: Default/Default Judgment and case management conference are set for December
5, 2023.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of Court
3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
MMA
seeks default judgment against Diamond City and Bently in the total amount of $35,935.98,
including $28,815 in damages, $2,501.13 in interest, $4,200 in attorney fees,
and $419.85 in costs. Because the court finds MMA submitted sufficient
evidence, the court GRANTS their application for default judgment with
the following modification.
While
MMA requests $4,200 in attorney fees, the court awards reasonable attorney fees
pursuant to Local Rule 3.214 in the reduced amount of $1,254.45 ($690 + $564.45
or 3% of $18,815).
CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, MMA’s
application for default judgment is TENTATIVELY GRANTED and the court
will enter default judgment for MMA in the amount of $32,990.43 upon MMA’s
dismissal of the Doe Defendants in this action pursuant to Rule 3.1800,
subdivision (a)(7) of the California Rules of Court.Furthermore, on its own motion, the court STRIKES
the untimely answer filed by Diamond City and Bently on November 6, 2023,
as they are in default.
