And here is a summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on four motions filed by Plaintiff Adriana Fadlallah against Defendant Robert McKee and his attorneys. The motions were for an order compelling further responses to special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and requests for admission, as well as a motion to compel attendance and production at deposition. The court granted all four motions, finding that Defendant McKee failed to provide code-compliant responses to discovery requests and failed to appear for deposition.

The court ordered Defendant McKee to provide code-compliant responses to all requests identified as "at issue" in the motions, without objections except as to attorney work product and attorney-client privilege, within 30 days of the order. The court also imposed monetary sanctions on Defendant McKee and his attorneys in the amount of $4,080, representing $1,020 for each of the four motions.

The court continued a motion for order establishing admissions and for monetary sanctions against Oliver Holt, who is deceased, and ordered Plaintiff Fadlallah to provide a supplemental brief with legal authority for deeming requests for admission admitted against a deceased party or imposing monetary sanctions for failing to respond when the party is deceased.

The court's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300, 2033.290, 2025.450, and 2033.280, as well as California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a). The court's significant statements include that a party who fails to give notice of a motion to compel a further response within 45 days of the service of the verified response waives any right to compel a further response, and that a court shall impose a monetary sanction on a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response, unless the party acted with substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
