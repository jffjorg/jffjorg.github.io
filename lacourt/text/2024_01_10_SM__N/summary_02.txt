And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's request to file a second amended complaint, which will allow them to address deficiencies in their original pleading. The plaintiff's original complaint included 12 causes of action, but it has deficiencies such as duplicative, unrecognized, or insufficiently pled causes of action. The judge notes that this is the first demurrer in the case, and therefore will allow the plaintiff to amend their pleading to address these issues. The plaintiff will have 20 days to file the second amended complaint, and may only amend the pleading as to the causes of action pled in the original complaint. The defendant's demurrer to the original complaint is taken off calendar.
