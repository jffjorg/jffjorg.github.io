And here is the English-text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Court has granted Plaintiff Alan Kapilow's motion to vacate dismissal and enter a stipulated judgment to enforce the settlement. The parties entered into a Settlement and General Release Agreement on August 13, 2018, which provided for the Court to retain jurisdiction. The agreement was modified by a 2nd Amendment on September 30, 2019, but this amendment did not include the provision for the Court to retain jurisdiction. The Court may incorporate the terms of the original agreement into the revised agreement to enforce the settlement. The Court's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, which allows the Court to enter judgment based on a settlement agreement.
