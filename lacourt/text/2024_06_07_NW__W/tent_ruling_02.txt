BACKGROUND
 
On August 29, 2023, Plaintiff Ismail
Akel filed a complaint against Defendant Farideh Javaheripour and Ramin
Javahery for Violation of Los Angeles Municipal Code sect. 151.10; Violation of
Business and Professions Code 17200; Common Counts: Money Had and Received;
Fraud; and Violation of Cal Civil Code 1947.11. Plaintiff alleges they entered
into a lease agreement with Defendants to rent a property owned by Defendants.
Plaintiff alleges Defendant represented that the Property was legal to be
rented; however, upon taking possession and steps to arrange for US mail
delivery to the Property, Plaintiff discovered the Property was an illegal
structure. 
 
On February 8, 2024, Farideh
Javaheripour filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiff for breach of written
agreement and common counts. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendant’s
Motion to Deem Requests for Admissions Served upon Plaintiff Ismail Akel
Admitted is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant Farideh Javaheripour move the
court for an order compelling Plaintiff Akel to have the genuineness of the
documents and truth of matters specified in Plaintiff’s First Set of Request
for Admissions be deemed admitted. Defendant also requests monetary sanctions
entered against Plaintiff.
 
Where there has been no timely response to a request for admission
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move
for an order that the truth of any matters specified in the requests and the
genuineness of any documents be deemed admitted, as well as a monetary
sanction. (CCP §2033.280(b).) The party who failed to respond waives any
objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the
waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially
compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result
of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (CCP §2033.280(a)(1)-(2).) The
court shall grant the motion “unless it finds that the party to whom the
requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the
motion, a proposed response … in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”
(CCP §2033.280(c); St. Mary v. Sup. Ct. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762,
777-78.)
 
On March 7, 2024, Defendant served on Plaintiff the first set of
discovery requests which included the Request for Admissions. (Kritzer Decl.
¶2, Exh. 1.) Responses were due by April 8, 2024. (Kritzer Decl. ¶4.) As of the
date of this filing, Defendant has not received any responses despite several
conversations between counsel. (Kritzer Decl. ¶4.) 
 
The court finds Plaintiff Akel has
failed to timely respond to Defendant’s properly served discovery request. The
court therefore GRANTS Defendant’s Motion
to Deem Requests for Admissions Served Upon Plaintiff Akel.  
 
Sanctions
 
Where a party fails to provide a timely
response to requests for admission, “[i]t is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (CCP
§2033.280(c).) 
 
Defendant requests $1,110.00 in
sanctions for 1 hour preparing the instant motion, another two hours preparing
any reply and attending the hearing on the motion, and the $60 filing fee.
Counsel’s hourly rate is $350.00. 
 
The court GRANTS Defendant’s request
for sanctions in the amount of $760.00.
