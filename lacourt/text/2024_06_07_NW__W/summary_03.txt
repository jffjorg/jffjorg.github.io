The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the motion to relieve counsel. Counsel, Natali Shabani and Paul Aghabala of Prestige Law, has been unable to contact any of the three plaintiffs, Ralph Hitchcock, Jeanie Cootz, and Robert Duecker, despite attempting to reach out to them. Notably, Plaintiff Hitchcock passed away intestate with no assets or heirs. Counsel has complied with the requirements of CRC Rule 3.1362 by filing necessary forms and lodging a copy of the proposed order. The trial is not yet set, but a Trial Setting Conference is scheduled for October 2, 2024.
