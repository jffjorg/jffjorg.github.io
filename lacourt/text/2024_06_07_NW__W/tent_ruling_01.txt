DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff moves this court for an order for evidence, issue,
terminating, and/or monetary sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§
2023.010, 2023.030(a)-(d), and 2025.450(h) against Defendant General Motors,
LLC preventing GM from calling witnesses at trial whom it refuses to produce at
deposition, or an order that Plaintiff’s Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act
claims have been proven and limiting the issues at trial to the question of
damages, or striking GM’s answer and rendering judgment by default against GM
based upon the persistent failure to comply with authorized methods of
discovery as well as this Court’s February 26, 2024, Order. Plaintiff also
moves for an order of monetary sanctions of $2,750.00 for having to bring the
instant motion as well as an additional $500.00 a day in which GM violated this
Court’s Order. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 empowers the Court to impose
terminating, issue, and evidentiary sanctions in the event an individual
engages in conduct which constitutes a “misuse of the discovery process”.  (CCP § 2023.030(b), (c), (d).)  A “misuse of the discovery process” includes
failure to respond to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying a court
order to provide discovery.  (CCP §
2023.010(d), (g).)   
 
Terminating sanctions should not be ordered lightly, but are justified
where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and there is
evidence that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the
discovery rules.  (Doppes v. Bentley
Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.)  Lack of diligence may be deemed willful where
the party understood its obligation, had the ability to comply, and failed to
comply.  (Deyo v. Killbourne
(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 787; Fred Howland Co. v. Superior Court of Los
Angeles County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605, 610-611.)  The party who failed to comply with discovery
obligations has the burden of showing that the failure was not willful.  (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at
p. 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250;
Evid. Code, §§ 500, 605.)
 
On February 26, 2024, this court granted Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
the Deposition of Defendant General Motors, LLC’s Person(s) Most Qualified,
with Production of Documents and ordered GM’s Person Most Qualified (“PMQ”) to
appear for deposition on or before April 26, 2024, and to produce all requested
documents. On March 11, 2024, Plaintiff served its Third Amended Notice of GM’s
PMQ deposition. (Hunt Decl. ¶7.) On March 20, 2024, GM wrote to Plaintiff and
stated that it could produce a PMQ witness for twelve (12) separate cases
between the parties on April 26, 2024. (Hunt Decl. ¶8.) However, on March 26,
2024, GM served Plaintiff with objections to the Third Amended Notice. (Hunt
Decl. ¶10.) Upon receiving the objections, Plaintiff informed Defendant they
had a court order for the deposition and produced a Fourth Amended Notice for
April 23, 2024. (Hunt Decl. ¶¶11, 12.) GM again served objections. (Hunt Decl.
¶13.) Although not for the instant matter, the deposition did take place on
April 23, 2024 for two other cases. (Major Decl. ¶6.) Plaintiff served a Fifth
Amended Notice, however, GM did not object or appear in response to the Fifth
Amended Notice. (Hunt Decl. ¶15.) Plaintiff then filed the instant motion for
terminating sanctions. 
 
Plaintiff argues this court should impose evidence, issue, or
terminating sanctions as GM has demonstrated a deplorable pattern and practice
of obstructive delay tactics without substantial justification and a conscious
disregard for the discovery process; judicial process; this court and its
orders; and every effort to move this case forward. 
 
In opposition, GM argues Plaintiff has failed to meet and confer in
good faith, repeatedly ignoring GM’s efforts to identify a date so that GM’s
PMQ could be deposed on or before the court-ordered deadline. Despite the
repeated threats of Plaintiff’s counsel; despite Plaintiff’s serving Third and
Fourth Amended Deposition Notice unilaterally scheduling the deposition for
dates that GM had specifically said would not work; and despite GM’s good faith
efforts to work on mutually agreeable dates after entry of the Court’s Order,
Plaintiff filed this Motion on April 30th, GM remains willing to provide its
PMQ for deposition on the witness’s first available date.
 
The court finds evidentiary, issue, and/or terminating sanctions not
warranted considering both parties have created this issue before the court.
The court further finds monetary sanctions not warranted at this time. The
court reminds the parties that discovery is supposed to be self-executing.
Defendant cannot ignore its statutory obligation to comply with a properly noticed
PMK deposition by stringing Plaintiff along then playing victim. However,
Plaintiff must fully exhaust the meet and confer process rather than rushing to
court, filing serial motions, and failing to consider the burden on this court
to hear unnecessary and repetitive motions. The parties must work together in
good faith before returning to the court with easily-resolvable discovery
disputes like this one. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff Lonni LZ Inc.’s Motion for Terminating, Issue, Evidence and/or
Monetary Sanctions in the Amount of $2,750.00 is DENIED.
