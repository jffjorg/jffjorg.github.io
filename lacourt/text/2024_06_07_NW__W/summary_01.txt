And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Lonni LZ Inc.'s motion for terminating, issue, and/or monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,750.00. The motion was filed in response to Defendant General Motors, LLC's failure to produce a Person Most Qualified (PMQ) for deposition and its obstruction of the discovery process. The judge found that both parties have contributed to the issues and that the motion was not warranted. The judge reminded the parties that discovery is supposed to be self-executing and that they must work together in good faith to resolve discovery disputes.
