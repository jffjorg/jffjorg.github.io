And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of BITA/SAMIR LLC v. 2013 Babak Agah, et al. The ruling addresses a motion to contest an application for determination of good faith settlement filed by the Non-Settling Defendant, Yanonis Enterprises dba Save the Day Restoration.

The Judge finds that the Settling Defendants, Babak Agah, Meroeh Meraji, and Park Westwood Towers Condominium Assoc., Inc., have provided sufficient evidence to show that the settlement was made in good faith. The evidence includes a rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery, the amount paid in settlement, and the allocation of settlement proceeds among defendants.

The Judge also finds that the settlement allocation was reasonable, noting that the Settling Defendants have claimed attorney's fees from the plaintiff based on the applicable CC&R's and the Davis-Stirling Act, and that the parties participated in a private mediation.

The Judge denies the Non-Settling Defendant's motion to contest the application for good faith settlement, finding that the party asserting the lack of good faith has the burden of proof and that the Non-Settling Defendant failed to meet that burden.

The Judge grants the Settling Defendants' application for good faith settlement, and orders any and all claims and comparative indemnity based on comparative negligence or comparative fault arising from the alleged damages and injuries to be forever barred.
