And here is a summary in plain English:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer without motion to strike filed by the defendants, Yevgeniya Lisitsa and Lisitsa Law, Inc., and Michael Shemtoub. The Judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff, Erina Gilerman, cannot amend her complaint to address the defects identified.

The Judge found that the plaintiff failed to plead enough facts to meet the statute of limitations for the fraud claim, and failed to plead specific factual allegations to reach multiple elements of the fraud claim, including the plaintiff's intent to defraud and a causal connection to the pleaded damages.

The Judge also granted the defendants' request for judicial notice (RJN) as to the documents requested, but not as to the truth of the facts asserted within the documents. This means that the Court will take notice of the existence, content, and authenticity of the documents, but will not assume the truth of the factual matters asserted in them.

The case will proceed with the defendants' demurrer sustained, and the plaintiff will need to re-file her complaint or re-plead her fraud claim to address the defects identified by the Judge.
