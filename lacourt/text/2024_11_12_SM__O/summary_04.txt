And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies Defendant Rachel King's motion to vacate the default judgment. King argues that she was not properly served with the summons and complaint, but the evidence shows that she was personally served on July 16, 2024. King provides a declaration stating that she was in bed at the time of service, but the credible evidence shows pictures of Rose at the time of service cleaning the pool. The judge finds that King was properly served and denies her motion to vacate the default judgment.

The judge also denies King's motion to quash the service of summons. King argues that the service was not proper and that the complaint does not allege a landlord-tenant relationship between Rose and King. However, the judge finds that the complaint does allege a landlord-tenant relationship and that King's motion to quash is untimely.

The judge denies King's motion to set aside the default judgment under CCP § 473.5(a) and CCP § 473(b). King argues that she lacked actual notice of the complaint in time to defend the action, but the judge finds that Rose has shown that King was actually served with the complaint and that King's lack of notice was caused by her avoidance of service.

The judge orders that the stay on the enforcement of the writ of possession be vacated and that the plaintiff submit a proposed order.
