And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's Pitchess Motion for Discovery of Peace Officer Personnel Records, as the plaintiff failed to provide a declaration showing good cause for the discovery. The statutory scheme for obtaining police officer's confidential personnel records requires a party seeking discovery to file a written motion with the court, including identification of the proceeding, the party seeking discovery, and the peace or custodial officer whose records are sought. The motion must also include a description of the type of records or information sought, and affidavits showing good cause for the discovery. The plaintiff's motion did not comply with this scheme, and the judge has denied the motion accordingly.
