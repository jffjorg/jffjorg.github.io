And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to set aside dismissal filed by the plaintiff, Shambria Williams, is granted. The plaintiff's counsel claims that the dismissal occurred due to a calendaring error and that they did not participate in or have knowledge of the non-appearance at the hearing. The judge finds that the dismissal was due to counsel's mistake or neglect and that the motion was filed diligently. Therefore, the motion to set aside the dismissal is granted, and the parties are ordered to appear at a trial setting conference and an order to show cause why the action should not be dismissed for failure to file a proof of service.
