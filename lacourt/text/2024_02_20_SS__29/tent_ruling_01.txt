Background
On November 12, 2020, Plaintiff Maria Belknap (“Plaintiff”)
filed her complaint against Defendants Roya Ashtiani, Alex Ashtiani, and Does 1 through 100, for the causes of action of
(1) Negligence, (2) Negligence Per Se, (3) Negligent Entrustment of Vehicle,
and (4) Motor Vehicle Owner Liability – Permissive Use.  Defendants Roya
Ashtiani and Alex Ashtiani (collectively “Defendants”) filed their answer on
April 1, 2022.
 
On July
17, 2023, Defendants served Plaintiff with Supplemental Demand for Production and
Supplemental Interrogatory.  (Caudill
Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff
did not respond.  (Id., ¶ 5.)
 
On December
11, 2023, Defendants filed the Motions to Compel
Plaintiff’s Responses to Supplemental Demand for Production and
Supplemental Interrogatory.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
“In addition
to the number of interrogatories permitted by Sections 2030.030 and 2030.040, a
party may propound a supplemental interrogatory to elicit any later acquired
information bearing on all answers previously made by any party in response to
interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.070, subd.(a).) 
A party
must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a
party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
“In
addition to the demands for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling permitted
by this chapter, a party may propound a supplemental demand to inspect, copy,
test, or sample any later acquired or discovered documents, tangible things,
land or other property, or electronically stored information in the possession,
custody, or control of the party on whom the demand is made.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.050, subd.(a).) 
If a
party to whom requests for production of documents are directed does not
provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling
response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts
are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial
responses to requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
“[P]roviding
untimely responses does not divest the trial court of its authority [to hear a
motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.)  Even if the untimely response “does not
contain objections [and] substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion
to compel responses … the trial court retains the authority to hear the
motion.”  (Id. at pp. 408-409.)  This rule gives “an important
incentive for parties to respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”  (Id.
at p. 408.)  If “the propounding party [does not] take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,” the trial court may
“deny the motion to compel responses as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in
part, and just impose sanctions.”  (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may
award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion
to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1348(a).)  
"Except as otherwise provided in this
chapter, any party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery
proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery
heard on or before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of
the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).) 
Discussion
Defendants
served Plaintiff with Supplemental Demand for Production and Supplemental
Interrogatories on July 17, 2023. (Caudill Decls., ¶ 3.)  Plaintiff did not serve responses.
 (Id., ¶ 5.)
 
Defendants
do not need to show anything more.  The
Court GRANTS the motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Supplemental Demand
for Production and Supplemental Interrogatories.
 
The
request for sanctions is granted in part. 
Given the relatively straightforward nature of a motion to compel
initial responses, and the economies of scale associated with filing multiple
discovery motions, the Court sets sanctions on each motion in the amount of $410,
calculated based on 2 hours of attorney work, multiplied by attorney’s hourly
billing rate of $175.00 plus the $60.00 filing fee.  (Id., ¶ 6.)
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
GRANTS the motions to compel.
 
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff’s to provide code compliant, verified, written responses,
without objection, to Defendants’ Supplemental Demand for Production of
Documents and Defendants’ Supplemental Interrogatories within 21 days of
notice.
 
The Court
GRANTS in part Defendants’ requests for sanctions.
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to pay
monetary sanctions to Defendants under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of
$820 ($410 per motion, multiplied by two motions) within 21 days of notice.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
