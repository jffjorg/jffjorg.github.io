And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for determination of worker's compensation lien. The Plaintiff, Ralph Chiappone, filed an action against Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for injuries sustained in a fall on May 17, 2021. The Plaintiff sought to reduce the worker's compensation lien amount to $5,764.82, citing employer negligence.

The Judge found that Security National Insurance Company, the non-party and authorized agent of AmTrust Financial Services, Inc., the worker's compensation carrier, is not estopped from claiming the final lien amount of $90,741.26. The Judge noted that Security provided the final lien amount on March 6, 2024, and that the Plaintiff still had an opportunity to negotiate the settlement terms before signing the final agreement on March 25, 2024.

The Judge granted the motion in part, entitling Security to a final lien amount of $43,000.49, which represents the reduction of the lien amount by attorney's fees and costs. The Judge also found that the reduction of the lien amount based on employer negligence would be contrary to settled law, as the duty to inspect the premises is imputed upon the property owner, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
