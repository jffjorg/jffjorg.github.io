And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for trial setting preference filed by Plaintiff Victoria Sims, who is over 70 years old and suffers from serious medical conditions. The plaintiff seeks a trial setting preference due to her age and health, while the defendants oppose the motion, citing concerns about due process.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has made a sufficient showing that her health is such that a trial setting preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The judge also declines to consider the defendants' due process argument, finding that they have no standing to raise the issue.

The judge sets a trial date of March 20, 2025, and a final status conference on March 17, 2025. The judge also sets a hearing on any summary judgment motions the parties wish to file, and encourages the parties to work together to complete discovery expediently.

The judge warns that any party that fails to comply with discovery obligations may be subject to sanctions. The judge also notes that the parties must familiarize themselves with Assembly Bill 2049, which changed the statutory dates for moving, opposition, and reply papers, and must file all papers in compliance with the newly enacted statute.
