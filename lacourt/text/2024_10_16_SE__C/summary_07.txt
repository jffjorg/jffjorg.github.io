And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a Song-Beverly action case, where Plaintiff Edith Gonzalez Castaneda is seeking attorney fees and costs against Defendant Hudson Insurance Company. The parties settled the case before filing any motions, exchanging written discovery, or deposing anyone. The Court grants Plaintiff's motion for attorney fees and costs in part, awarding $13,125.00 in attorney fees and $1,077.40 in costs.

The Court finds that the case did not present particularly complex or unique issues, and did not require any discovery motions or trial. The Court also finds that the attorneys' rates are excessive in this action, setting a blended rate of $350 per hour for all five attorneys who worked on the case. The Court awards $13,125.00 in attorney fees, based on 37.5 hours billed at $350 per hour.

The Court also finds that the paralegals' rates are not justified with evidence that they are consistent with market rates, and strikes the paralegals' entries. The Court awards the fee request and requires Plaintiff to serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of entry of judgment.
