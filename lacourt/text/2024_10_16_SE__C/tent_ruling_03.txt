 Case Number:  22NWCV01165    Hearing Date:   October 16, 2024    Dept:  C Hernandez Eduardo vs Ernesto Grajada
Rodriguez, et al., Case No.: 22NWCV01165
This is a personal injury action.
Defendants Ernesto Grajeda Rodriguez and Maria Araujo apply Ex Parte for an
order permitting Maria Araujo to file a cross-complaint against Defendant Jobet
dba Dedicated Home Health Care.  With requests such as these, this Court
typically requires a party seeking ex parte relief to first make a reservation
on the Court’s reservation system and then file and serve a noticed
motion.  Moving party has not done this.  Thus, the ex parte
application is DENIED without prejudice.  However, moving party indicates
that counsel for Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant do not oppose moving party’s
request for leave to file a cross-complaint.  As such, the parties may
file a stipulation to that effect with the Court.  They may also move for
a trial continuance in Dept. SE-F.  Moving party to give notice.
