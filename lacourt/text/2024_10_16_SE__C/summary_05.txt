And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Tyrone Montero's motion for terminating sanctions. As a result, Plaintiff Randa Issa's complaint is struck. The motion was unopposed by Plaintiff as of October 14, 2024. The Court finds that Plaintiff has willfully disobeyed several discovery orders, including an order compelling discovery responses issued on December 15, 2023. Despite numerous opportunities to comply with the discovery rules, Plaintiff has failed to respond to discovery requests or pay sanctions. The Court concludes that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, and therefore grants the motion for terminating sanctions.
