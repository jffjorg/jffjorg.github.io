Moving party to give NOTICE. 
 
 
This is an elder abuse and wrongful death
case against a skilled nursing facility and its owners, managing entities,
administrators, and directors of nursing. 
 
Defendant Life Care Centers of America, Inc.
moves to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One; Special Interrogatories,
Set One; Requests for Admissions, Set One; Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One against plaintiffs Edwanda Pruitt and Daryl Pruitt.  The Court will address all four together. 
 
Timeliness 
 
Notice of the motion to compel further must be
provided within 45 days of service of the response or on or before any specific
later date to which the parties have agreed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (c).) This 45-day deadline runs from the date the verified response is
served and is extended for service by mail in accordance with Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1010.6, subdivision (a)(4) and 1013, subdivision (a). Failure
to timely move to compel within the specified period constitutes a waiver of
any right to compel a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)

 
The 45-day rule to bring a motion to compel is
mandatory and jurisdictional “in the sense that it renders court without
authority to rule on motions to compel other than to deny them.” (Sexton v.
Super. Ct. (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) 
 
Here, Defendant served discovery responses on January 18,
2024. (Decl. Schlueck, ¶ 9.) These responses were unverified. (Decl. Schlueck,
¶ 9.) Unverified
objections are effective responses. (Blue
Ridge Ins. Co. v. Super. Ct. (1988)
202 Cal.App.3d 339, 344.)
 
Defendant filed the instant motion
on January 25, 2024. Thus, the motion is timely. 
 
Separate Statement
 
Any motion involving the content of
a discovery request or the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a
separate statement. The motions that require a separate statement include a
motion: (1) To compel further responses to requests for admission; (2) To
compel further responses to interrogatories;
(3) To compel further responses to a
demand for inspection of documents or tangible things …” (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1345.)
 
Defendant has not included a
separate statement in the instant motion. 
Compliance with CRC, rule 3.1345 is mandatory.  Defendant is ORDERED to file and serve a SEPARATE
STATEMENT for each motion no later than November 15, 2024.  Failure to do so will result in the motions
being DENIED and taken OFF-CALENDAR.  
 
Meet
and Confer
 
The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)  A meet and
confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a
reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.) 
 
For purposes of
determining whether a motion to compel discovery was preceded by a reasonable
and good faith effort to meet and confer, such a reasonable and good faith
attempt at informal resolution entails something more than bickering with
opposing counsel; rather, the law requires that counsel attempt to talk the
matter over, compare their views, consult, and deliberate. (Clement v.
Alegre (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1294.) 
 
On
January 22, 2024, Defendant sent a meet and confer letter to plaintiffs. (Decl.
Schlueck, ¶ 10.) Plaintiffs did not respond. (Decl. Schlueck, ¶ 11.)
 
Given
that Defendant filed the instant motion on January 25, 2024, the Court finds
that the parties did not sufficiently meet and confer.  Provided Defendant complies with this Court’s
order to file and serve separate statements by November 15, 2024, Counsel are ORDERED to make further efforts to resolve the
issues presented. If, after exhausting those efforts, court intervention is
needed, counsel may appear and argue the merits on the continued hearing date.
If counsel are unable to informally resolve their discovery disputes, then
counsel are instructed to submit a JOINT SEPARATE STATEMENT with a detailed
outline of the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is required,
referencing each discovery request. The JOINT SEPARATE STATEMENT must be
FILED on or before March 1, 2025.
