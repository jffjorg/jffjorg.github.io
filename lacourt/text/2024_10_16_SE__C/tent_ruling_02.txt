RULING
 
Plaintiff
Adrian Cortes Tecuanhuehue’s motion to compel the deposition of H-T General

imposed upon Defendant and Defendant’s counsel, jointly and severally, payable

Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
This is a breach of contract dispute between a
homeowner and a general contractor. Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant’s
Person Most Qualified (PMQ) deposition according to Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.450.  
 
Discussion
 
If
a party or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a
party under Section 2025.230 does not appear for deposition after service of a
deposition notice and the party has not validly objected, the noticing party
may move to compel the deponent’s attendance and testimony. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (a).)  
 
A party served with a deposition notice waives any error or irregularity
unless that party serves a written objection specifying that error or
irregularity at least three calendar days before the deposition. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.410, subd.
(a).) 
 
When the deponent
fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, the motion shall be
accompanied by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the
deponent to inquire about the nonappearance. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(2).) The
declaration shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2016.040.) 
 
On April 16,
2024, Plaintiff noticed the deposition of Defendant’s person most qualified for
May 3, 2024. (Decl. Peto, ¶ 10.) Defendant did not object. (Decl. Peto, ¶ 11.)
 
On the day of
the deposition, Defendant did not appear. (Decl. Peto, ¶ 18.) Plaintiff’s
counsel contacted Defendant afterward to ask about the nonappearance. (Decl.
Peto, ¶¶ 19 to 21.) The parties met and conferred about other possible dates. (Decl.
Ledezma, ¶¶ 21 to 32.) 
 
Based on the
above, the motion is GRANTED. The deposition must occur within 30 days.  
 
Sanctions
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section¿2025.450(c)
further provides, “(1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court
shall impose a monetary sanction . . 21. in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450(c).) 
 
Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of
$4060.00 for one hour meeting and conferring, thirty minutes attending the
deposition on May 3 and taking a nonappearance, 2.5 hours drafting this motion,
and another two hours drafting a reply brief and attending the hearing on this
matter, for a total of six hours at a rate of $500 per hour, or $3,000.00.  Plaintiff also requests $1000.00 for
conference room and court reporter cancellation fees, and $60 in costs.  
 
The Court
imposes sanctions in the reasonable sum of $2060.00 upon Defendant and
Defendant’s counsel, jointly and severally, payable within 60 days.
