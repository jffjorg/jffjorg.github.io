TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff Kira Lynn Chavez’s motion to compel further responses to Request
for Production of Documents, Set One is CONTINUED to March 12, 2025 at 10:30
a.m. in Dept. SE-C. 
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE. 
 
 
This is a Song-Beverly action. Plaintiff moves to
compel further responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, request
numbers 1 through 3; 7 through 9, 12, 17, 19, 22, 24, 30, 35, 38, 40-41, 49,
54, 56-57, 66, 74-77, and 86. 
 
Timeliness

 
Notice of the motion to compel further must be
provided within 45 days of service of the verified response or on or before any
specific later date to which the parties have agreed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (c).) This 45-day deadline runs from the date the verified response is
served and is extended for service by mail in accordance with Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1010.6, subdivision (a)(4) and 1013, subdivision (a). Failure
to timely move to compel within the specified period constitutes a waiver of
any right to compel a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)

 
The 45-day rule to bring a motion to compel is
mandatory and jurisdictional “in the sense that it renders court without
authority to rule on motions to compel other than to deny them.” (Sexton v.
Super. Ct. (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) 
 
On November 2, 2023, Defendant
served unverified responses to Plaintiff’s first set of requests for production
of documents, and Defendant served verifications on December 11, 2023. (Decl. Sanaia,
¶ 24, Ex. 9.) 
 
Adding the days for electronic
service, the clock ran on January 29, 2024. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd.
(a)(3), 2016.050.) Plaintiff filed on January 29, 2024.  
 
Thus, Plaintiff is timely. 
 
Meet
and Confer
 
The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion
shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal
resolution of each issue presented by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2016.040.) 
 
For purposes of
determining whether a motion to compel discovery was preceded by a reasonable
and good faith effort to meet and confer, such an attempt at informal
resolution requires something more than bickering with opposing counsel;
rather, the law requires that counsel attempt to talk the matter over, compare
their views, consult, and deliberate. (Clement v. Alegre (2009) 177
Cal.App.4th 1277, 1294.) 
 
On December 26, 2023, Plaintiff sent
a meet and confer letter regarding the responses she received. (Decl. Sanaia, ¶
30, Ex. 12.) On January 29, 2024, Plaintiff sent another meet and confer
letter. (Decl. Sanaia, ¶ 32, Ex. 14.) On January 30, 2024, Defendant responded
to the meet and confer letter. (Decl. Keshishian, ¶ 6, Ex. A.) Plaintiff filed
the instant motion on January 29, 2024. On October 3, 2024, Defendant filed an
opposition, addressing the discovery requests by category. 
 
Given that Plaintiff sent a second
meet and confer letter the same day she filed the instant motion and Defendant
responded the day after, the Court is not persuaded that counsel have exhausted
their meet and confer obligations pursuant to the Code. In addition, the Court
advises both parties to refer to the case management conference order they
received issued in Department F about Song-Beverly discovery. It addresses many
of the discovery requests at issue. 
 
The Court believes that further meet
and confer efforts will resolve many of the issues before the Court. Therefore,
Counsel are ORDERED to make further efforts to resolve the issues presented.
If, after exhausting those efforts, court intervention is needed, counsel may
appear and argue the merits on the continued hearing date. If counsel are
unable to informally resolve their discovery disputes, then counsel are
instructed to submit a REVISED JOINT SEPARATE STATEMENT with a detailed outline
of the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is required. The revised
joint separate statement must be FILED on or before March 1, 2025.
