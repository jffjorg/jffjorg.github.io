  - "For purposes of determining whether a motion to compel discovery was preceded by a reasonable and good faith effort to meet and confer, such an attempt at informal resolution requires something more than bickering with opposing counsel; rather, the law requires that counsel attempt to talk the matter over, compare their views, consult, and deliberate." (Clement v. Alegre)
  - "The Court is not persuaded that counsel have exhausted their meet and confer obligations pursuant to the Code."

The Judge issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents. The motion was filed by Kira Lynn Chavez, the Plaintiff, against General Motors LLC and DOES 1 through 10, inclusive. The Judge continued the hearing to March 12, 2025, at 10:30 a.m. in Department SE-C. The Plaintiff moves to compel further responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, request numbers 1 through 3; 7 through 9, 12, 17, 19, 22, 24, 30, 35, 38, 40-41, 49, 54, 56-57, 66, 74-77, and 86.

The Judge noted that the 45-day deadline for bringing a motion to compel has passed, and the Plaintiff is timely. The Judge also found that the parties have not exhausted their meet and confer obligations, and ordered them to make further efforts to resolve the issues. If the parties are unable to resolve their disputes, they must submit a revised joint separate statement with a detailed outline of the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is required.
