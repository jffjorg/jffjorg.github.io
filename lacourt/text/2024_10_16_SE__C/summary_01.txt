And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to discovery requests by the defendant, Life Care Centers of America, Inc. The motion is timely, as it was filed within 45 days of the service of the discovery responses. The judge orders the defendant to file and serve a separate statement for each motion by November 15, 2024, and failure to do so will result in the motions being denied and taken off-calendar.

The judge also notes that the parties did not sufficiently meet and confer before filing the motion, and orders them to make further efforts to resolve the issues presented. If the parties are unable to informally resolve their discovery disputes, they must submit a joint separate statement with a detailed outline of the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is required by March 1, 2025.
