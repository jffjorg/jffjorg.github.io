And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a personal injury case (Hernandez Eduardo vs Ernesto Grajada Rodriguez, et al.). The defendants (Ernesto Grajada Rodriguez and Maria Araujo) asked the court to allow Maria Araujo to file a cross-complaint against Jobet (dba Dedicated Home Health Care), but they did not follow the proper procedure for seeking this relief. As a result, the judge has denied their request without prejudice, meaning they can reapply using the proper procedure. However, the judge notes that counsel for the plaintiff and cross-defendant do not oppose the cross-complaint, so the parties are free to file a stipulation with the court and may also request a trial continuance.
