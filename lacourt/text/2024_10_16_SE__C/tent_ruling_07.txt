TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Plaintiff Edith
Gonzalez Castaneda’s motion for attorney fees and costs against Defendant
Hudson Insurance Company is GRANTED in part. Plaintiff is entitled to $13,125.00
in attorney fees and $1,077.40 in costs. 
 
Moving Party to give
NOTICE.
 
 
This is a Song-Beverly action. The parties settled before they
filed any motions, exchanged written discovery, inspected vehicles, or deposed
anyone. (Decl. Phan, ¶ 9.) Plaintiff Edith Gonzalez Castaneda moves for $18,350.00 in attorney fees and $1,077.40 in costs. 
 
Prevailing Party
 
Under
Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (d), “[i]f the buyer prevails in an action
under [the Song-Beverly Act], the buyer shall be allowed by the court to
recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs
and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” 
 
Here,
under the terms of the settlement agreement, the parties agreed that Plaintiff
is the prevailing party and Defendants will not dispute Plaintiff’s underlying
entitlement to attorney’s fees and costs.
 
Reasonableness of Attorney’s Fees
 
A buyer prevailing under the
Song-Beverly Act may recover “reasonable” attorney fees and costs as determined
by the Court. (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d).) As to Song–Beverly warranty claims,
prevailing buyers have the burden to show that the fees incurred were reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation and were reasonable amounts.  (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 967, 998.)  The question
whether attorneys’ fees were reasonably incurred may depend on circumstances
including, “factors such as the complexity of the case and procedural demands,
the skill exhibited, and the results achieved.” 
(Goglin v. BMW of North America, LLC (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 462,
470.) 
 
Lodestar
is the objective starting point to determine if attorney’s fees are reasonable.
(Nichols v. City of Taft (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1233, 1242.) Lodestar is
calculated by using the reasonable rate for comparable services in the local
community, multiplied by the reasonable number of hours spent on the case. (Ibid.)
Lodestar requires the court to determine the reasonable number of hours
expended for the work performed. (Concepcion v. Amscan Holdings, Inc.
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1309, 1320.) The lodestar approach has been applied to
determining attorney’s fees under Song-Beverly. (Robertson v. Fleetwood
Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817.)
 
In
evaluating whether the attorney fee request is reasonable, the trial court
should consider whether the case was overstaffed, how much time the attorneys
spent on claims, and whether the hours were reasonably expended. (Morris v. Hyundai Motor Am. (2019) 41
Cal.App.5th 24, 38.) Reasonable compensation does not include compensation for
padding in the form of inefficient or duplicative efforts. (Ibid.) A
reduced award might be fully justified by a general observation that an
attorney submitted a padded bill. (Ibid.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff seeks to recover attorney
fees and costs for the following: (1) attorney Christopher P. Barry for 7.8
hours at $695 per hour; (2) attorney Gregory T. Babbitt for 4.6 hours at $610
per hour; (3) attorney Joseph S. Green for 4.4 hours at $550 per hour; (4) attorney
Nathan N. Kiyam for 19.0 hours at $340 per hour; (5) attorney Ahmed Yousef for
1.7 hours at $280 per hour; (6) paralegal Brandon Rodriguez for 1.1 hours at
$195 per hour; (7) paralegal Laura Turner for 1.8 hours at $195 per hour; and
(8) paralegal Jeanette Abbenhaus for 1.3 hours at $155 per hour. (Decl. Barry, ¶¶
7, 15; Decl. Kiyam, ¶ 3; Decl. Green, ¶ 4; Decl. Babbitt, ¶ 7; Decl. Turner, ¶ 4.)

 
Plaintiff argues that the fee
request is reasonable because all the services performed were necessary to litigate
the case and given the work that went into the case and outcome achieved, the
time spent was reasonable and necessary. Plaintiff also argues that the hourly
rates and billed hours are presumed to be reasonable. The rates are reasonable
based on the experience and qualifications of the attorneys. Plaintiff further
argues that California courts and arbitrators often approve Plaintiff’s
counsel’s hourly rates. In addition, Plaintiff’s firm charges competitive
market rates based on a national survey of prevailing rates for consumer
attorneys conducted in 2023. 
 
In opposition, Defendant argues
that there was overstaffing; some of the work was inefficient, redundant, and
duplicative; Plaintiff’s counsel billed for vague and ambiguous entries;
billings related to discovery should be stricken; billings related to
intraoffice communications should be stricken. In addition, the Court should
not award fees which are prospectively estimated. Further, Plaintiff’s counsel
fails to establish that Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rates are prevailing rates
in Los Angeles. 
 
In reply, Plaintiff asserts that
the case was not overstaffed; Defendants have not established there is an
inefficient, redundance, and duplicative billing; the time entries are not
vague or ambiguous; billings related to discovery are proper; billings for
communications about the case between paralegals and junior attorneys and the
supervising attorneys is appropriate; Plaintiff’s rates are reasonable.
Further, Plaintiff amends its request for the preparation of the reply. 
 
Here, the Court finds that this
case did not present particularly complex or unique issues, did not require any
discovery motions, and did not go to trial.  The case settled in three months. (Decl. Phan,
¶ 8.) Further, because the attorneys have litigated Song-Beverly cases many
times, the Court finds that there is a certain methodology in prosecuting these
cases and a template the attorneys follow. (Decl. Green, ¶¶ 8,12.) Because of
the simple and straightforward nature of the litigation, the little litigation
it required, and the experience of the attorneys, the Court finds the attorney
rates excessive in this action. The Court sets a blended rate of $350 per hour
for all five attorneys who worked on the case. 

 
When
attorney fees are recoverable by statute, the reasonable attorney fees incurred
in preparing the motion are also recoverable. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors,
Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 1002.) Thus, the Court also includes the
fees in incurred in preparing the instant motion. 
 
Based upon
an hourly rate of $350 per hour, and a total of 37.5 hours billed, the Court
awards $13,125.00 in attorney fees,  
 
          Paralegals
 
Paralegal and other professional staff rates must be justified
with evidence that they are consistent with market rates. (See, e.g.,
Shame on You Prods. v Banks (9th Cir. 2018) 893 F.3d 661, 670.)
 
Plaintiff has not submitted
evidence that the paralegal’s rates are consistent with market rates. Thus, the
Court strikes the paralegals’ entries. 
 
 
Costs
 
The memorandum of costs must be served and filed within 15 days
after the date of service of the notice of entry of judgment or of service of
written notice of entry of judgment. (Cal. Rules of Ct, rule 3.1700(a).)
 
Here, Plaintiff included a memorandum of costs as part of its
motion. Defendant do not oppose Plaintiff’s fee requests. 
 
Thus, the Court awards the fee request.
