The judge's tentative ruling is to continue the hearing on the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by the Barrett Defendants and Todd Wakefield to May 23, 2024. The judge has determined that the issues presented in the Barrett Defendants' and Wakefield's motions are overlapping. The judge has denied the Plaintiff's request for a longer continuance to take the deposition of incarcerated Phillip Layfield. The judge has also made rulings on the evidentiary objections submitted by the parties. The judge has overruled Plaintiff's objections to the declarations of Joseph Barrett and Todd Wakefield, and sustained some of the objections submitted by the Defendants. The judge has also overruled the Plaintiff's objections to the declaration of Plaintiff's counsel, Yana Henriks. The judge has determined that there is no good cause to continue the hearing on the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, and that the case has been pending for over six years.
