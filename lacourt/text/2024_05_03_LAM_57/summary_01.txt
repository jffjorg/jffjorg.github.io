And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied both defendants' motions for sanctions against the plaintiff and his counsel. The defendants claimed that the plaintiff acted in bad faith by adding individual defendants to the case, including one of their own attorneys, and that he threatened to seek sanctions against another attorney for filing demurrers in bad faith. The court found that the defendants failed to show that the plaintiff's actions were made in bad faith or for an improper purpose. Additionally, the court ruled that the sanctions motions were premature because the individual defendants had filed demurrers that had not yet been heard. The court expressed its concern about the high level of conflict in the case and urged cooler heads to prevail in the future.
