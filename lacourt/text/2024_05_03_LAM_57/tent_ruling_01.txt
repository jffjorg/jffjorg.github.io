  Case Number:  23STCV11642    Hearing Date:   May 3, 2024    Dept:  57 Pending before the Court are the Defendants' motions under Code of Civil Procedure Sections 128.5 and 128.7 for an order imposing sanctions on Plaintiff and his counsel for adding as individual Defendants in this action Evan Grant (who also is Defendants' counsel), Sevada Abraamyan, Sean Olson, and Rob Stewart, and for threatening to seek sanctions against Grant for filing demurrers in bad faith.  The Court is denying both motions.  In the Court's view, Defendants have failed to show that Plaintiff’s decision to add the four above-listed persons as individual Defendants and Plaintiff's threat to seek sanctions against Grant were made in bad faith or for an improper purpose.  Furthermore, the sanctions motions are premature in that the individuals who were added as Defendants have filed demurrers that have not yet been heard.  The rulings on the demurrers may bear on Defendants' contention in the motions that sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel are warranted under Sections 128.5 and 128.7.The filing of these sanctions motions is further manifestation of the remarkably high degree of rancor and conflict in this case.  Cooler heads need to prevail.  The Court has conveyed this message before.  The Court's admonition has not been heeded.  The Court hopes that it will be heeded going forward.
