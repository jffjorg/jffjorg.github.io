EXPRESS RESTORATION CORP.,

NANCY M.

                                  Defendant.
 


 Case No:  24STCV09823
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  October 1, 2024
 Calendar
  Number:  11



 
            Defendant
Nancy M. Chein demurs to and moves to strike portions of plaintiff Express
Restoration Corp.’s complaint.
 
            The
Court OVERRULES the demurrer. The Court DENIES the motion to strike.
 
Background
 
            Plaintiff Express Restoration Corp.
sued defendant Nancy M. Chien on April 18, 2024 for (1) breach of contract, (2)
work, labor, and materials furnished, and (3) unjust enrichment.
 
            Plaintiff alleges it performed
construction work at seven (7) properties owned by Defendant. (Compl., ¶ 7; see
also id., Exhs. A-H [copies of contracts].) Defendant allegedly did not
pay Plaintiff for its services, and Plaintiff seeks to recover approximately
$250,000 in damages.
 
            On August 12, 2024, Defendant
demurred to and moved to strike certain portions of Plaintiff’s complaint. On
September 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed its oppositions. On September 23, 2024,
Defendant replied.

Request for Judicial
Notice
 
            Defendant requests judicial notice of Exhibit 1 to its
demurrer, which purports to be Plaintiff’s current license record printed from
the Contractors State License Board website. The Court denies the request, as
it is not based on a certified government record. Even if the Court granted
Defendant’s request, it could not take notice of the facts within the document,
which remain inadmissible hearsay. And even if the Court could take notice of
the facts within the document, the fact that Plaintiff was licensed between
2021 and 2025 does not establish it was otherwise unlicensed when it performed
work for Defendant. 
             
            The Court denies the request.
 
Discussion
 
            Meet and Confer
 
            Code of Civil Procedure sections
430.41 and 435.5 require a moving party to meet and confer with its opponent
before filing a demurrer or motion to strike, respectively. Counsel submitted a
form declaration satisfying the meet and confer requirements. (08-12-2024 Zuetel
Decl., ¶ 2(a) [Form CIV-140].)
 
            Demurrer
 
            Where pleadings are
defective, a party may raise the defect by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v.
Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) When considering a demurrer, a court
reads the allegations stated in the challenged pleading liberally and in
context, and “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly
pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Serrano
v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the
evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects
appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. The only issue
involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) 
 
            Defendant demurs to all three of
Plaintiff’s causes of action, arguing for each that Plaintiff fails to state a
claim or has not alleged its cause of action with sufficient certainty. 
 
            Defendant relies on the assertion
that Plaintiff did not have a contractor’s license when it performed work on
her properties. The Court has declined to take notice of the relevant records.  The matter falls outside the four corners of
the complaint and noticeable materials. 
Accordingly, the demurrer lacks merit.
 
            Motion to Strike
 
            The court may, upon a motion,
or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 436(a).) As with a demurrer, the grounds for moving to strike must
appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Id. § 437.)
 
            The Court denies Defendant’s motion
to strike for the same reason the Court overruled the demurrer. Defendant seeks
to “strike all paragraphs for which Plaintiff is barred [from recovering] by
the Contractors’ State License Law”. (Mot., 3:18-19.) As discussed above,
Defendant has not established that any such bar appears on the face of the
complaint or in judicially noticeable materials.
