And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for an award of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, but only in part. The plaintiff is awarded $47,593.96, inclusive of fees and costs. The court calculated the fees based on the time reasonably spent by the attorneys and a reasonable hourly rate. The court denied the plaintiff's request for a 35% multiplier, as the case did not involve extraordinary circumstances justifying such an enhancement. The court also struck the plaintiff's claim for $3,500.00 related to reviewing an opposition, filing a reply, and appearing at the hearing on the motion, as this was not supported by sufficient evidence.
