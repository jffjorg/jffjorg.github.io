And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Shawn Shayan, has moved for prevailing party fees and costs under Civil Code section 1717.5. However, the court denies the motion. The court finds that section 1717.5 does not apply to this case because the plaintiff did not assert a cause of action based on an open book account, which is required by the statute. The plaintiff sued the defendant for breach of contract, alleging an agreement wherein the defendant would use the plaintiff's credit card and pay the bill, but did not allege lending money and keeping a ledger, as required for an open book account claim. The jury returned a verdict that the parties' alleged contract was fatally uncertain, and the plaintiff did not claim attorneys' fees under section 1717.5. Therefore, there is no basis for an award of fees under section 1717.5.
