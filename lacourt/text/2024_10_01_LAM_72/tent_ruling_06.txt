TENTATIVE RULING

                                  Plaintiff,
  
         v.
 
 
REPUBLIQUE, LLC,
 
                                  Defendant.

 Hearing Date:  October 1, 2024
 Calendar
  Number:  6



 
            Plaintiff
Daniel Rodriguez, individually and on behalf of others aggrieved, moves for
approval of the settlement of his PAGA action against Defendants.
 
            The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff Daniel Rodriguez,
individually and on behalf of aggrieved employees, filed this action against
defendant Republique, LLC on June 22, 2023, under California’s Private
Attorneys-General Act. Defendant answered on August 8, 2023.
 
On April 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Notice of Settlement.
 
On August 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a Motion for Final Approval of the parties’ settlement, as required by Labor
Code section 2699.
 
Defendant filed no opposition.
 
Legal Standard
 
“The superior court shall review and
approve any settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to [the PAGA].” (Lab.
Code, § 2699(s)(2).) “In review and approval of a proposed settlement under
section 2699, subd. (l)(2) [new subd. (s)(2)], a trial court must scrutinize
whether, in resolving the action, a PAGA plaintiff has adequately represented
the state’s interests, and hence the public interest.” (Moniz v. Adecco USA,
Inc. (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 89 .) The court may refuse to approve a
settlement that is unfair or inadequate. (See O’Connor v. Uber Technologies,
Inc. (N.D.Cal. 2016) 201 F.Supp.3d 1110, 1133-1134.)

Settlement
  Agreement submitted to the LWDA on June 25, 2024. (Genish Decl., ¶ 16 and
  Exh. 3.) 



 
Analysis of Settlement Agreement
 
            Presumption of Fairness
 
Counsel Genish attests “the extent
of informal discovery conducted was sufficient ... to evaluate the strength and
value of the PAGA claims”, “the settlement negotiations were conducted by
highly capable and experienced counsel”, and “Counsel are respected members of
the bar with strong records of vigorous and effective advocacy.”
(Gensh Decl., ¶ 51.) The matter was resolved with the assistance of a
mediator. (Settlement, II(5).)
 
The settlement is entitled to a
presumption of fairness.
 
            Fair,
Adequate, and Reasonable
 
“The most important factor [for the
court’s review] is the strength of the case for plaintiffs on the merits,
balanced against the amount offered in settlement.” (Kullar v. Foot
Locker Retail, Inc. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 116, 130.)
 
                        i.
Basis of Claims
 
Plaintiff’s counsel explains the basis for the claims
asserted in the complaint. (Genish Decl., ¶¶ 34-47.) Plaintiff claims, in
brief, that Defendant required him and his colleagues “to perform work
off-the-clock by requiring them to attend pre-shift meetings”, that Defendant
“required [them] to perform pre-shift work activities off-the-clock”, and that
Defendant failed to pay overtime as required. (Id., ¶ 34; see also ¶¶
37, 40 [meal and rest periods], ¶¶ 45, 47 [derivative claims and penalties].)
 
                        ii. Amount Offered
 
Defendant’s estimated maximum exposure for all Plaintiff’s
claims is $3,733,000.00. (Id., ¶¶ 46-47.) Plaintiff concedes that this
outcome is unlikely given Defendant’s vehement denial of any liability in this
matter; expected costs of vigorous litigation, including appeals; the
likelihood that Plaintiff will not prevail on some or all of his claims at
trial; ambiguities in the law regarding PAGA penalties; and the court’s
discretion to reduce penalties.
 
To account for the risks associated with proving the
underlying violations and the cost and delay in recovering alleged potential
penalties, Plaintiff reduced his expected recovery by 75% to $933,250.00.
(Genish Decl., ¶ 47.)
 
To account for the risks associated with succeeding on the
merits and establishing liability, Plaintiff discounted by 75% a second time,
bringing the value of his claims to $233,312.50. (Ibid.)
 
According to these calculations, the gross settlement of
$225,000 is a fair, reasonable recovery, adjusting for costs and risks.
 
Assuming all deductions are taken in full, a net $35,132.46
will remain to compensate 275 estimated aggrieved employees. Each aggrieved
employee will recover an average of approximately $127.75.
 
iii. Discovery Conducted, Experience
of Counsel
 
            As discussed above, Counsel attests
to sufficient informal discovery and to his and his associates’ long experience
with PAGA claims.
 
                        iv. Conclusion
 
            Plaintiff has shown the settlement
is fair, adequate, and reasonable.
 
            Scope of Release
 
            The Settlement states: “Upon the
Effective Date and payment of all funds
under
this Settlement, Aggrieved Employees (including Plaintiff) and the State of
California, (Including the LWDA,) will be forever barred from pursuing any and
all PAGA Released Claims defined in Section 1.16 herein. This release of claims
expressly excludes any non-PAGA claims held individually by Aggrieved Employees
other than Plaintiff.” (Settlement, ¶ III(5).) It also provides for Plaintiff to
submit a proposed judgment that, in relevant part, “enjoins the
prosecution of any of the PAGA Released Claims against Defendant. The judgment
will not release or bar any claims other than the PAGA Released Claims as to
Plaintiff, the State of California, and Aggrieved Employees.” (Settlement, ¶
III(11).)
 
            “
‘PAGA Released Claims’ means any and all claims for civil penalties that were
alleged or reasonably could have been assessed upon and collected from the
Defendant and the Released Parties under PAGA, based on the factual allegations
in the Action and the PAGA Notice, including but not limited to purported
violations of California Labor Code sections 201, 202, 203, 204, 226(a), 226.7,
510, 512(a), 1174(d), 1194, 1197, 1197.1, 1198, 2800, and 2802 and Industrial
Welfare Commission Wage Orders, including inter alia. Wage Order 5-2001,
arising under the PAGA Period from the alleged claims against Defendant for
Republique’s alleged failure to provide meal and rest periods and premiums;
failure to pay minimum wages; failure to pay overtime; failure to pay wages
during employment; failure to pay all wages upon termination, failure to
provide accurate wage statements; failure to maintain complete and accurate
payroll records of hours worked and meal periods; and failure to reimburse
business expenses.” (Settlement, ¶ I(16).)
 
            “
‘Released Parties’ means Republique, LLC and each of its former and present
directors, officers, shareholders, owners, attorneys, insurers, predecessors,
successors, assigns, subsidiaries, and affiliates.” (Settlement, ¶ I(20).)
 
            Notice
 
PAGA has no notice requirements for unnamed class members,
nor may such employees opt out of a PAGA action. (See Hernandez v. DMSI
Staffing, LLC. (N.D. Cal. 2015) 79 F.Supp.3d 1054, 1063, aff’d sub nom. Hernandez
v. DMSI Staffing, LLC (9th Cir. 2017) 677 Fed.Appx. 359.)
 
The Settlement Administrator will mail an “Explanatory
Letter” to each Aggrieved Employee, which is attached to the Settlement as
Exhibit A. (Settlement, ¶ IV(3) and Exh. A.)

Attorneys’ Fees and Costs 
 
An aggrieved employee who prevails in a PAGA action may
recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. (Labor Code, § 2699(g)(1).)
Whether a plaintiff established entitlement to an award of fees under PAGA is a
question best decided by the trial court. (San Diego Municipal
Employees Association v. City of San Diego (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 906.)
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel requests attorneys’ fees of $67,500.00
and reasonable litigation costs of $12,520.16. (Genish Decl., ¶ 19.)
The Settlement provides for fees up to $67,500 and costs up to $16,000.
(Settlement, ¶ I(12).)
 
“Courts recognize two methods for calculating attorney fees
in civil class actions: the lodestar/multiplier method and the percentage of
recovery method.” (Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 224, 254.) Here, Plaintiff’s counsel requests attorney fees using
the percentage method.
 
In common fund cases, the Court may employ a percentage of
the benefit method, as cross-checked against the lodestar. (Laffitte v.
Robert Half Int’l, Inc. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 503. Here, the fee
request of $67,500 represents 33% of the maximum settlement amount, which is
equal to slightly less than the 33% average generally awarded in class
actions. (See In re Consumer Privacy Cases (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th
545, 558, fn.13 [“Empirical studies show that, regardless whether the
percentage method or the lodestar method is used, fee awards in class actions
average around one-third of the recovery.”].)
 
Regarding
lodestar, Plaintiff’s counsel has provided the following information for the
attorneys at Blackstone Law, APC:

Plaintiff’s counsel’s percentage-based request discounts the
lodestar by 50%. The percentage-based request is reasonable.
 
Plaintiff’s counsel also attests to reasonable costs via
invoice and the declaration of the Settlement Administrator. (Genish Decl., ¶
61 and Exh. 4 [cost invoice]; Lawrence Decl., ¶¶ 3, 6-16, and Exh. B
[Administrator costs].)
 
Conclusion 
 
For the foregoing reasons, the Motion for Approval of PAGA
Settlement is GRANTED.
