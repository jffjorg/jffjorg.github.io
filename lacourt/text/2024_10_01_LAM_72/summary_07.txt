And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants plaintiff George Rahme's unopposed motion for leave to amend his operative complaint. The proposed First Amended Complaint (FAC) makes minimal changes to account for changes in ownership and management of the casino during plaintiff's 37-year employment. The court finds that permitting the amendment would be in furtherance of justice and that the adverse parties were properly noticed. The plaintiff is ordered to electronically file a clean FAC within ten days of this order.
