         v.
 
 
SHAWN SHAYAN,
 
                                  Defendant.

Defendant Shawn Shayan moves for prevailing party
fees and costs according to Civil Code section 1717.5. 
 
The Court DENIES the motion.
 
            Defendant relies on
Civil Code section 1717.5:
 
“[I]n any action on a contract based on
a book account ... , which does not provide for attorney's fees and costs, as
provided in Section 1717, the party who is determined to be the party
prevailing on the contract shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees, as
provided below, in addition to other costs.”
 
(Civ. Code, § 1717.5(a).)
 
Section 1717.5
does not apply here. Plaintiff sued Defendant for breach of contract on May 22,
2020. (Compl., pp. 1-2.) She did not assert a cause of action based on an open
book account. (Ibid.) Nor did she state such a claim, whether or not she
captioned it as such. “The elements
of an open book account cause
of action are:
‘1. That [plaintiff] and [defendant] had financial transactions ... ; [¶] 2.
That [plaintiff] ... kept [an] account of the debits and credits involved in
the transactions; [¶] 3. That [defendant] owes [plaintiff] money on the
account; and [¶] 4. The amount of money that [defendant] owes [plaintiff].’ (State Compensation Insurance Fund v. ReadyLink Healthcare, Inc.
(2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 422, 449.) Plaintiff alleged an agreement wherein
Defendant would use her credit card and pay the bill, and she would keep the
points; she did not allege she loaned Defendant money in various amounts and
kept a ledger, as an open book account claim contemplates.
 
Plaintiff did not claim attorneys’ fees under section 1717.5. (Id.,
p. 2, ¶ 10(c) [attorneys’ fees according to proof, no basis specified].) No
cause of action for open book account was submitted to the jury. (See
06-07-2024 Jury Instructions.) The jury returned a verdict that the parties’
alleged contract was fatally uncertain. (See 06-07-2024 Special Verdict.)
 
There is no basis for an award of fees under section 1717.5.
