TENTATIVE RULING
 



KENNETH MACKENZIE, 
 
                                  Plaintiff,
  
         v.
 
 
GENERAL MOTORS LLC,
 
                                  Defendant.
 


 Case No:  22STCV11847
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  October 1, 2024
 Calendar
  Number:  4



 
Plaintiff
moves for an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs as agreed by
settlement.
 
Plaintiff’s
motion is granted in part, in the total amount of $47,593.96, inclusive of fees
and costs.
 
Background
 
            Plaintiff
Kenneth Mackenzie filed this lemon law action against defendant General Motors
on April 7, 2022. The case has settled. Plaintiff moves for attorneys’ fees.
Defendant does not oppose.
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
            Plaintiff’s
request for judicial notice is denied in its entirety. Other trial courts’
rulings are neither binding nor necessarily persuasive for this Court.
 
Discussion
 
Where the buyer of a
vehicle prevails in an action under the Song-Beverly Act, he “shall be allowed
by the court to recover ... a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and
expenses, including attorney's fees based on actual time expended, determined
by the court to have been reasonably incurred ... .” (Civ. Code, § 1794(d).)
 
Defendant was given
timely notice of this motion and filed no opposition. (See 08-23-2024 POS.)
Defendant does not dispute that the parties have agreed in their settlement
that Plaintiff will recover fees and costs.
 
            Plaintiff
seeks reasonable fees.
 
“[T]he
starting point of every fee award ... must be a calculation of
the attorney's services in terms of the time he has expended on the case.
Anchoring the analysis to this concept is the only way of approaching the
problem that can claim objectivity, a claim which is obviously vital to the
prestige of the bar and the courts.”  (In re Vitamin Cases (2003)
110 Cal. App. 4th 1041, 1058, citation omitted.)  “[T]he primary method for
establishing the amount of ‘reasonable’ attorney fees is the lodestar method.
The lodestar (or touchstone) is produced by multiplying the number of hours
reasonably expended by counsel by a reasonable hourly rate.” (Thayer v.
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal. App. 4th 819, 833.) Under this approach, a base amount is calculated from a
compilation of time reasonably spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each
attorney. (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48; Serrano v.
Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 639.)
 
The determination of
reasonable amount of attorney fees is within the sound discretion of trial
courts. (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79 Cal.
App. 4th 1127, 1134.) The
Court “need not simply award the sum requested.” (Id.) “[R]easonableness of
attorney fees is ... to be determined from a consideration of such factors as
the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the experience and
expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved. The court may also
consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or duplicative
work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)
 
Plaintiff
requests an award of $66,866.54. Plaintiff assigns $3,500.00 for reviewing an
opposition, filing a reply, and appearing at the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion.
The Court strikes this claim. Defendant filed no opposition and Plaintiff no
reply, and Plaintiff does not distinguish the hours billable for his hearing
appearance.
 
Plaintiff
also requests a 35% multiplier. The Court denies the request. There was no
extraordinary “delay in payment” here justifying a multiplier, as Plaintiff
contends. The case has gone through the ordinary life cycle for lemon law
proceedings.
 
Counsel’s
declaration otherwise satisfies the Court that Plaintiff claims reasonable fees
based on a reasonable hourly rate: 95.3 hours at an average rate of $472.87.
 
Plaintiff
also claims reasonable, awardable costs of $2,529.46.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
awards fees of $45,064.50 and costs of $2,259.46, for a total award of $47,593.96.
