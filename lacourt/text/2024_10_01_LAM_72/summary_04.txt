And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the motion of the defendants (Core/Related Grand Ave. Owner, LLC, et al.) to bifurcate the trial and discovery related to alter ego allegations. The defendants had argued that bifurcation would promote judicial economy and streamline the litigation, but the Judge disagrees. The Judge believes that bifurcation would actually make the litigation more complicated and potentially lengthy and unwieldy. The Judge notes that the case involves high dollar amounts and multiple complex issues, and that bifurcating the alter ego issues would not make the case significantly less complicated. The Judge also notes that deferring certain issues could delay a final resolution of the case, whether by trial or settlement. The Judge concludes that the most practical approach to discovery is to continue discovery of all factual issues, and that the parties should take discovery of all factual issues as they proceed with the litigation.
