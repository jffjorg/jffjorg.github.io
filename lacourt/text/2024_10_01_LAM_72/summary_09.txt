And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Express Restoration Corp. v. Nancy M. Chien. The case involves a dispute over a contract for construction work performed at seven properties owned by Chien. Express Restoration Corp. is seeking to recover approximately $250,000 in damages for breach of contract, work, labor, and materials furnished, and unjust enrichment.

Chien demurred to and moved to strike certain portions of Express Restoration Corp.'s complaint, arguing that it fails to state a claim or has not alleged its cause of action with sufficient certainty. The judge has overruled the demurrer and denied the motion to strike, finding that the demurrer lacks merit.

The judge also denied Chien's request for judicial notice of Exhibit 1 to her demurrer, which was a document purporting to be Express Restoration Corp.'s current license record printed from the Contractors State License Board website. The judge found that the document is not a certified government record and that even if it were, it would not establish that Express Restoration Corp. was unlicensed at the time it performed the work.

The judge's ruling is based on the parties' pleadings and the law, and does not consider any extrinsic evidence. The case will proceed to a hearing on October 1, 2024, where the parties will have an opportunity to present evidence and argument.
