As for the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies defendant AIDS Healthcare Foundation's motion to strike certain allegations and prayers from relief in plaintiff George Handy's complaint. The complaint alleges that defendant, as the landlord, maintained two residential units in untenantable condition, causing severe leaking, bedbug infestation, and code violations. The judge finds that plaintiff has alleged enough facts to support a claim of oppression by defendant's officers, which is sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge also finds that plaintiff's complaint contains allegations sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages under California Civil Code section 3294. The judge denies defendant's motion to strike and orders defendant to give notice.
