COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES
 
DEPARTMENT 72
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 



GEORGE RAHME, 
 
                                  Plaintiffs,
  
         v.
 
 
THE BICYCLE CASINO, L.P., et al.,
 
                                  Defendants.
 


 Case No:  23STCV16017
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  October 1, 2024
 Calendar
  Number:  7



 
            Plaintiff
George Rahme moves for leave to amend his operative complaint.
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s unopposed motion.
 
            This
is an employment suit. Plaintiff George Rahme sued defendants The Bicycle Casino,
L.P. and Hashem Minay on July 10, 2023. He now moves to file an operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”). Defendants do not oppose.
 
 A party may file
an amended pleading once without leave of the court at any time before a
demurrer or motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike
is filed as long as it is served no later than the date for filing an
opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 472(a),
430.40(a).) Outside that timeframe, a party must obtain leave of the court to
amend its pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).) 
 
The court may grant leave to amend
a pleading, in its discretion, “upon any terms as may be just,” if it finds
that permitting the amendment would be “in furtherance of justice,” and that
the adverse party was noticed. (Ibid.) The court may grant leave to amend at any
stage of the proceeding, even “after commencement of trial.” (Id., § 576; see Hirsa v.
Superior Court (1981) 118
Cal.App.3d 486, 488-489.)
 
Pursuant to California Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1324, a motion to amend a pleading must: 
 
(1)  Include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading,
which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or
amendments;
 
(2)  State what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to
be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the deleted
allegations are located; and
 
(3)  State what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous
pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located.
 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a).)
 
A separate declaration must
also accompany the motion and must specify: 
 
(1)  The effect of the amendment;
 
(2)  Why the amendment is necessary and proper;
 
(3) When the facts giving rise to the amended allegations
were discovered; and
 
(4)  The reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier.
 
(Id., subd. (b).) 
 
            As
an initial matter, the Court notes that Plaintiff served the motion on all
interested parties electronically, through their counsel, on August 23, 2024.
Notice and service comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 1005 and 1010.6.
Defendants were given proper notice and filed no opposition.
 
            As
for the applicable law: the exhibits to Plaintiff’s motion satisfy Rule 3.1324(a).
(Yenoki Decl., Exh. 1 [redline], Exh. 2 [clean proposed FAC].) The motion
and counsel’s accompanying declaration satisfy Rule 3.1324(b). The minimal
proposed amendments account for “multiple changes with [sic] ownership
of the casino and the companies who managed operations over the course of
plaintiff’s 37 year[] [employment]”; those changes are still being explored
during discovery. (See Yenoki Decl., ¶ 2.)
 
            Plaintiff’s
unopposed motion is granted. Plaintiff ordered to electronically file a clean
FAC within ten (10) days of this order.
            
            Plaintiff
to give notice.
