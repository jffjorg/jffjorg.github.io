action arises from a breach of commercial lease. Plaintiff Maple DTLA, LLC

Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
seeks default judgment in the amount of $140,430.37, which includes $37,849.67 in
interest, $965.70 in costs, and $2,865 in attorney fees. 
 
Currently, a
motion to set aside the entry of default has been reserved for February 1,
2024, but no motion has been filed. 
 
            Plaintiff
avers that, on June 26, 2015, it entered into a written Standard
Industrial/Commercial Multi-Tenant Lease (Lease) with Defendant for rental of certain
real property located at 1331 and 1333 Maple Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90015. (Parsakar
Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. A.) Thereafter, starting in January 2020, Defendant fell behind
on the required monthly payments and the total amount of $98,750 is now owed by
Defendant on the Lease. (Parsakar Decl., ¶ 9.) Plaintiff has submitted
sufficient evidence to support the breach of the Lease but not the resulting
damages.
 
            Plaintiff
submits evidence that Defendant’s base rent was increased to $5,800 on May 2019
and, “[a]fter offsetting by partial payments tendered by Tenant for some
months, Tenant failed to pay the Base Rent for the months of January 2020 to
December 2021, August 2021, and September 2021.” (Parsakar Decl., ¶ 9.)
Plaintiff, however, does not identify what partial payments were made and when;
further, the failure to pay base rent for the months of January 2020, December
2021, August 2021, and September 2021 only amounts to $23,200. The Court is
unable to substantiate the $98,750 in damages sought based on the foregoing evidence.

Additionally,
Plaintiff improperly calculated its pre-judgment interest. Plaintiff seeks
interest on the amount of $98,750, accruing at 10% from the date of January 1,
2020 (date of the breach) to October 31, 2023. (Shakouri Decl., ¶ 13.) However,
the full amount of $98,750 was not owed on January 2020, but only became due
after failing to also pay the rents owed on December 2021, August 2021, and September
2021, as well. (Shakouri Decl., ¶ 6.) Thus, this interest calculation is
incorrect.
 
Plaintiff also requests
attorney fees in the amount of $2,865, which complies with LASC 3.214; however,
this amount is based on the underlying, unsubstantiated damages. (Shakouri Decl.,
¶ 11.) 
 
Lastly, Plaintiff
substantiates the request for reasonable costs in the amount of $965.70, which
includes $560.70 in clerk’s filing fees, and $405 in service of process fees. (Shakouri
Decl., ¶ 12.)
 
The request for
entry of default judgment is denied.
