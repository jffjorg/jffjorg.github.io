 
This is an
action under the Song-Beverly Act in which Arman Arakelian and Siranush
Arakelian (Plaintiffs) alleged defects in a 2017 Mercedes-Benz Metris (Vehicle).
Plaintiffs sued Mercedes-Benz
USA, LLC and Mercedes-Benz of Beverly Hills (Defendants or Mercedes) for breach
of express and implied warranties. 
 
The parties settled this Song-Beverly matter except as to
the issues of attorney fees and costs. Plaintiffs now move for an award of
attorneys’ fees. 
 
Plaintiffs argue that, as the
prevailing party, they are entitled to fees and costs under Civil Code section
1794, subdivision (d). They seek lodestar attorneys’ fees of $41,596.50, plus a
1.5 multiplier -- in the amount of $20,798.25 -- and costs of $2,340.19. The
total requested in attorney fees and costs is $62,394.75. 
 
Defendants filed an opposition,
arguing the amounts requested in fees and costs are excessive and unreasonable.

 
The Court grants the motion for
attorneys’ fees in a reduced amount. 
 
Plaintiffs’ objections to Defendants’
evidence are ruled as follows: No. 1 is overruled and Nos. 2-3 are sustained.
 
Legal Standard
 
            A prevailing buyer in an action
under Song-Beverly “shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the
judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including
attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the Court to have
been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action.”¿¿(Civ. Code, § 1794,¿subd. (d).) 
 
            The
prevailing party has the burden of showing that the requested attorney fees
were “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.” (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California
Inc.¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817.) The party seeking attorney fees “
‘is not necessarily entitled to compensation for the value of attorney services
according to [his] own notion or to the full extent claimed by [him].’ ” (Levy
v. Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc.¿(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807,
816.)¿¿Therefore, if the “time expended or the monetary charge being made for
the time expended are not reasonable under all the circumstances, then the
court must take this into account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.”
(Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America¿(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
            A court may
“reduce a fee award based on its reasonable determination that a routine,
noncomplex case was overstaffed to a degree that significant inefficiencies and
inflated fees resulted.”¿¿(Morris v. Hyundai Motor America¿(2019) 41
Cal.App.5th 24, 39.)¿¿It is also appropriate to reduce an award based on
inefficient or duplicative efforts. (Id.¿at p. 38.) However, the
analysis must be “reasonably specific” and cannot rely on general notions of
fairness. (Kerkeles¿v. City of San Jose¿(2015) 243 Cal.App.4th
88,¿102.)¿¿Moreover, in conducting the analysis, courts are not permitted to
tie any reductions in the fee award to some proportion of the buyer’s damages
recovery. (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc.¿(2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24,
39.)
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiffs
seek $41,596.50 in attorneys’ fees for Norman Taylor & Associates (NTA)
and Wirtz Law (WL), plus a 1.5 multiplier enhancement, and costs of $2,340.19, for
a total $62,394.75. 
 
            Defendants Mercedes
do not dispute that Plaintiffs are the prevailing party under the settlement
agreement. Instead, Defendants argue the that hours incurred to litigate this
routine, non-complex case that settled before trial is unreasonable. 
 
            A
calculation of attorneys’ fees for a Song-Beverly action¿begins with the
“lodestar” approach, under which the Court fixes the lodestar¿at¿“the number of
hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Margolin
v. Regional Planning Com.¿(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004-1005.)
“California courts have consistently held that a computation of time spent on a
case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of
an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Ibid.)¿ “ ‘The reasonable hourly
rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.’ ” (Id.¿at p.
1004.) The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of
factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value
for the legal services¿provided.¿(Serrano v. Priest¿(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25,
49;¿PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler¿(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) 
 
            “[T]rial
courts need not, and indeed should not, become green-eyeshade accountants. The
essential goal in shifting fees (to either party) is to do rough justice, not
to achieve auditing perfection. So trial courts may take into account their
overall sense of a suit, and may use estimates in calculating and allocating an
attorney's time.” (Fox v. Vice (2011) 563 U.S. 826, 838.)
 
Attorneys’ Fees
 
Hourly
Rate: 
 
            Defendants first
contend that Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ hourly rates are unreasonable.
 
            In assessing
the reasonableness of hourly billing rates,¿“the court may rely on its own
knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, as well as the experience,
skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees [citation], the
difficulty or complexity of the litigation to which that skill was applied
[citations], and affidavits from other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in
the community and rate determinations in other cases.”¿(569 East County
Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc.¿(2016) 6 Cal.App.5th
426, 437; see¿Mountjoy v. Bank of America, N.A.¿(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th
266, 272 [“ ‘ “a reasonable hourly rate is the product of a multiplicity of
factors…[including] the level of skill necessary, time limitations, the amount
to be obtained in the litigation, the attorney’s reputation, and the undesirability
of the case” ’ ”].)¿
 
            In
challenging the hourly rates, Defendants request that the Court reduce all
hourly rates to, “at most,” $250. However, Defendants do not submit evidence specifically
addressing Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ hourly rates. Instead, Defendants point to several Los
Angeles Superior Court cases where attorney hourly rates were reduced. These
cases are not controlling on this Court and the objections to this evidence are
well taken. 
 
            Defendants
also cite the holding in Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North America, LLC (2020) 48
Cal.App.5th 240
– where the Court of Appeal upheld a trial court’s reduction of a firm’s hourly
rate to $350. While this case does suggest that the nature and complexity of
the underlying litigation are factors in determining whether attorney’s fees
are reasonable (id. at p. 255), it does not definitively hold that the
rates requested in this case are unreasonable. That is, under the applicable
standard of review, the court of appeal only found that the trial court’s
decision to reduce the hourly rate was not “clearly wrong.” (Id. at p. 246.)
Thus, Mikhaeilpoor is of only limited help to Defendants. 
 
Rather,
a review of the Wirtz Declaration and
Taylor Declaration in support of the motion for attorney’s fees – which
contains a description of each attorneys’ education and experience – supports
finding Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ hourly rates ranging from $250 to $750 were
reasonable; the rates are supported by substantial evidence under the present
circumstances. (Taylor Decl., ¶¶ 6-14, 24 Exs. 2-5; Wirtz Decl., ¶¶ 4-28, Exs.
2-3.)
 
Based on the Court's familiarity
with the current local market, and Plaintiffs’ evidence of the experience and
skills of the various attorneys – the Court finds that Plaintiff's requested
rates per hour – although high – are reasonable. These high hourly rates,
however, bear on the reasonableness of the hours incurred given the purported
skill and expertise of these attorneys. 
 
            Number
of Hours Incurred: 
 
            Plaintiffs also
challenge the hours incurred, arguing that the amounts sought by Plaintiffs are
the result of overstaffing, duplicative billing, overbilling, and billing for clerical
tasks.
 
            Duplicative
Billing: Defendants contend that, as result of overstaffing, Plaintiffs
billed for duplicative entries of the same task. However, Defendants’ claim of
duplicative billing appears overstated as Defendants have only identified two examples
of duplicative billing. In reviewing these examples and as argued in reply, the
tasks identified are different and not duplicative.  
 
            Excessive
Billing: Defendants also argue that the total number of hours claimed in
this case of 102.8 hours is excessive. For the reasons discussed below, the
Court agrees. 
 
First, Defendants note that Plaintiffs
billed a significant number of hours for client communications; specifically,
NTA spent 10.1 hours communicating with their client ($5,882.50) and WL spent
another 10.5 hours communicating with their client ($3,705) for a total of $9,587.50.
While the Court does not wish to discourage client communication, the Court
agrees that these hours appear excessive in a straightforward lemon law case
such as this one. The Court will reduce the hours by $4,000. 
 
Second, Defendants argue that
Plaintiffs’ counsel spent a substantial amount of time on the surrender of the
subject vehicle, which did not require Plaintiffs’ counsels’ time because
surrenders are usually handled by Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs’ counsel bill 7.6
hours for a total of $2,195 for this task. These fees are excessive where Plaintiffs’
counsel hours were incurred by sending emails regarding the surrender and also to
travel with Plaintiffs to “ensure the process was completed correctly.” The
Court will reduce these fees by $1,000. 
 
            Third,
Defendants challenge the amount of time incurred on drafting the motion for
attorney fees. According to Plaintiffs’ motion, WL anticipates incurring 10
hours ($5,225) to draft the Motion, review the opposition, draft the reply and
attend the hearing. The drafting of these motions and the issues raised are standard;
given Plaintiffs’ purported experience with these types of cases and the
typical fee motions involved, these fees are excessive. The Court will reduce
the fees by $2,000. 
 
            Fourth, Defendants
take issue with the amount of time NTA incurred in commencing this case (8.1
hours), including drafting the complaint, reviewing Defendants’ answers, and
drafting the CMC statement – for a total of $3,763. Similar to the motion for attorney’s
fees, this case involved standard legal issues; given counsel’ extensive experience
in this area of the law, these fees are excessive. The Court will reduce fees
by $1,500. 
 
            Fifth, Defendants
argue the time incurred by Plaintiffs’ counsel in preparing and responding to
discovery was excessive. Plaintiffs seek numerous hours for time incurred on
propounding and responding to discovery. According to Plaintiffs, they incurred
21.4 hours preparing Plaintiffs’ request for discovery ($11,982.50) and 2.4
hours responding to Defendants’ requests for discovery ($750).[1]
Again, given Plaintiffs’ counsel’s experience in this type of litigation and
the simple lemon law issues involved in this case, the Court agrees that the
time incurred on such tasks were excessive and unreasonable. The Court will
reduce fees by $5,500.
 
            Finally, Defendants
note that NTA transferred this matter to WL around March 7, 2023, but generated
billing entries for this case on May 3, and May 4, 2023. Plaintiffs’ counsel represents
that Plaintiffs contacted them about the case after it had been transferred and
counsel responded. These fees do not appear unreasonable or excessive under
these circumstances.
 
            Administrative
Billing: Defendants challenges Plaintiffs’ paralegals’ billings entries for
October 25, 2021, October 27, 2021, February 15, 2022, February 16, 2022,
February 24, 2022. These entries involved calendaring and other administrative
type tasks. Although Plaintiffs used paralegals (and paralegal hourly rates)
for these tasks, the paralegal hourly rates are high (nearly the rate for some
attorneys). Thus, assuming the skill and expertise for these paralegals to bill
at these rates, the Court finds that the amounts sought are excessive for the
task involved. The Court will reduce the fees by $200 to account for an
attorney hourly rate used on these administrative tasks.
 
            Erroneous
Billing: On NTA’s billing records, NTA billed for an attorney communication
regarding a divorce on September 20, 2022. In reply, Plaintiffs state that
Attorney Taylor billed to speak with Plaintiff Arakelian’s divorce attorney;
Plaintiffs represent that the divorce was material to this case because counsel
had to determine how the divorce proceedings would affect this case. The entry
was not an error and is not excessive.  
 
            Multiplier
adjustment:
 
            Finally,
Plaintiffs seek a 1.5 lodestar multiplier based on the risk of taking this case
on contingency and based on the public interests at issue in this matter.  
 
            Relevant
factors to determine whether an enhancement is appropriate include (1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132.)  
 
            Although
this matter was taken on contingency (Taylor Decl., ¶ 30; Wirtz Decl., ¶ 34),
none of the other factors support the application of a multiplier. This was a
garden variety Song-Beverly case; there were no novel or difficult questions
presented. (Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819,
834.) Further, the¿contingent risks, skill, and difficulty¿Plaintiff’s
attorneys¿assert are absorbed by¿their¿already high (albeit reasonable) hourly
rates. (See¿Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California. Inc.¿(2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 785, 822.) 
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ request for a lodestar multiplier is denied.
 
            Adjustments
to attorneys’ fees are summarized as follows:
 




 


Reductions


Total




Original Lodestar Amount


 


$41,596.50




 


 


 




Excessive Billing


Client communications: $4,000
Surrender: $1,000
Motion for attorney fees: $2,000
Commencement: $1,500
Discovery: $5,500
Total: 
 


 




Administrative Billing


$200


 




 


 


 




Reduced Lodestar Amount


$14,200


$27,396.50




 
            The Court
grants Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’ fees in the sum of $27,396.50.
 
Costs: 
 
Defendants also challenge Plaintiffs’
claimed costs of $2,340.19 on the grounds that Plaintiffs
have not submitted any evidence of the reasonableness of the costs incurred. Plaintiffs’ motion, however,
clarifies that Plaintiffs are not seeking their costs and expenses by way of this
Motion. Instead, Plaintiffs argue that they are already entitled to full
recovery of their costs because Defendants did not file any timely challenge to
Plaintiffs’ Memorandums of Costs.
 
Plaintiffs’ position is correct. 
 
Under California
Rule of Court, rule 3.1700(b)(1) a motion to strike or tax costs must be served
and filed no later than 15 days after service of the memorandum of costs. The
failure to file a timely motion to tax costs constitutes a waiver of the right
to object. (Douglas v. Willis (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 287, 289; Jimenez
v. City of Oxnard (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 856, 859 [“By not filing said
motion within the period specified in section 1033, plaintiffs waived the right
to object to the costs claimed by the city.”].) 


Here, Plaintiffs filed two
memorandums of costs on October 13, 2023. No motion to tax these costs was
filed by Defendants. Defendants only raised an objection to these costs in
their opposition to the motion for attorney’s fees, filed on December 28, 2023.
 
            
            Accordingly, the Court will grant
costs in the amount requested by Plaintiffs.
            
Conclusion
 
            The motion
for attorneys’ fees and costs is granted in part. In sum, the Court grants
Plaintiffs’ request for attorneys’ fees in the total
amount of $27,396.50, which is a reduction of the
lodestar amount by $13,200. The request for costs is granted in the
amount of $2,340.19.  
 
            Defendants
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC and Mercedes-Benz of Beverly Hills are ordered to pay to
Plaintiffs’ counsel the sum of $29,736.69 ($27,396.50 + 2,340.19) for
attorneys’ fees and costs. This amount shall be paid on or before February 12,
2024.
