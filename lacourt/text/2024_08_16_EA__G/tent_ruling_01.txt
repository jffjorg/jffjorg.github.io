  Case Number:  24PSCV00507    Hearing Date:   August 16, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Joseph Kohl’s Application for Default  Judgment Respondent: NO OPPOSITION TENTATIVE RULING Plaintiff Joseph Kohl’s Application for Default  Judgment is CONTINUED to a date to be  determined at the hearing set in Department G (Pomona). Plaintiff Joseph  Kohl is further ordered to resubmit Plaintiff  Joseph Kohl’s supporting declaration in  compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2015.5. BACKGROUND This  is a breach of contract action arising from a lease agreement. In October 2012,  Plaintiff Joseph Kohl, Defendant Cindy Long, and Michael Goff entered into a  written lease agreement for a property in Claremont. In November 2014, Kohl  alleges Long breached the lease agreement by failing to pay rent or late  payment fees; failing to keep the premises in clean, sanitary, and good  condition; failing to notify Kohl of defects in and about the premises; failing  to reimburse Kohl for repairs; making repairs or alterations of premises  without written consent; changing locks for the premises; violating municipal  codes; committing waste; creating a nuisance; and keeping pets. On February  16, 2024, Kohl filed a complaint against Long and Does 1-10, alleging the  following causes of action: (1) breach of contract, (2) negligence, and (3)  trespass. On March 29, 2024, Kohl’s process server served Long with substitute  service in Westminster. On May  8, 2024, the court entered default against Long after Long failed to file a  timely answer. On August 8, 2024, Kohl submitted the present application for  default judgment. An  OSC Re: Default Judgment and OSC Re: Sanctions is set for August 16, 2024. LEGAL STANDARD Code  of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a  party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on  the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a  brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in  support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)  a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a  dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application  for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for  each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees  if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of  Court 3.1800.) ANALYSIS Kohl  seeks default judgment against Long in the total amount of $72,255.06,  including $63,000.00 in damages, $8,647.26 in interest, and $607.80 in costs. But  while Kohl provided a declaration in support of the application for default  judgment, the declaration is insufficient because it does not state it was made  in California or that it is “under penalty of perjury under the laws of the  State of California” as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2015.5. (See  Bombardier Recreational Products, Inc. v. Dow Chemical Canada ULC (2013)  216 Cal.App.4th 591, 604.) Accordingly, Kohl’s declaration must be resubmitted in  compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2015.5. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Kohl’s  application for default judgment is CONTINUED to a date to be determined at  the hearing set in Department G (Pomona). Kohl is further ordered to  resubmit Kohl’s supporting declaration in  compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2015.5.
