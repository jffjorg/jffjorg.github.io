And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is continuing the hearing on Joseph Kohl's application for default judgment against Cindy Long. Long has no opposition to the application. Kohl is seeking a default judgment in the amount of $72,255.06, including damages, interest, and costs. However, Kohl's supporting declaration is insufficient because it does not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 2015.5, which requires declarations to be made in California and under penalty of perjury. As a result, Kohl is ordered to resubmit the declaration in compliance with the statute. The judge has set an OSC Re: Default Judgment and OSC Re: Sanctions for August 16, 2024, and will determine a new date for the hearing on Kohl's application.
