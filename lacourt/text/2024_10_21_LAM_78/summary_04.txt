And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a request for default judgment against defendants Herbal Solutions, LLC, Jokes Up Ice Kream, LLC, UTR Management, LLC, and Stephen Brown. The plaintiff, Paul Nevarez, alleges that he was discriminated against, harassed, and retaliated against by the defendants while employed by them. The complaint includes 13 causes of action, including discrimination, harassment, retaliation, wrongful termination, and failure to pay wages.

The judge grants the request for default judgment, but reduces the amount of damages and attorney's fees. The plaintiff is awarded $51,663.36 in principal damages, $2,000.00 in attorney's fees, and $1,622.97 in prejudgment interest. The judge also awards the plaintiff $809.93 in costs.

The judge reduces the amount of damages for emotional distress from $40,000 to $20,000, citing a lack of specificity in the plaintiff's declaration. The judge also adjusts the calculation of prejudgment interest, using a 7% per annum rate for the failure to provide meal and rest periods and a 10% per annum rate for the remaining penalties.
