And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion to seal a settlement agreement. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs, Beverly M. Haller, Richard A. Haller, and Melissa Haller, who brought an action against the defendants, Santa Paula Post Acute, LLC, LBCSP Skilled, LLC, Matthew Haller, and others, arising from the death of decedent Beverly M. Haller. The motion seeks to seal the settlement agreement, which is unopposed. The court previously denied the initial motion to seal, but the plaintiffs provided a newly redacted version of the motion that addresses the court's concerns. The court finds that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest of confidentiality and that there is no less restrictive means of achieving that interest. Therefore, the court grants the motion to seal the settlement agreement.
