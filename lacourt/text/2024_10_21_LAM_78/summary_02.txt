And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by defendants Elsie I. Wynn, 3557 Stoner, LLC, Thomas James Capital, Inc., and Thomas Beadel. The demurrer was filed to challenge the sufficiency of the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by plaintiffs Blair Cobb and Adam Eatroff.

The Court finds that the FAC sufficiently alleges causes of action for negligence and nuisance against the defendants. The FAC alleges that the defendants oversaw the construction and destruction of a stone retaining wall, and that the wall was replaced with an unpermitted concrete block non-retaining wall, which collapsed.

The Court rejects the defendants' argument that the FAC does not articulate a specific duty owed to the plaintiffs. The Court finds that the FAC sufficiently alleges that the defendants owed a duty of care to avoid causing harm to the plaintiffs, and that they are thus liable for injuries caused by their negligence.

The Court also rejects the defendants' argument that the FAC is uncertain and fails to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action against them. The Court finds that the FAC is sufficiently clear and that any ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.

The Court overrules the demurrer and orders the defendants to give notice. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, the party must send an email to the court.
