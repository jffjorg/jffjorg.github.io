And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff Bernal's motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Maggiore. The court finds that Maggiore did not object to the deposition notice and is now available and willing to be deposed. Despite the delays in moving forward with the deposition, the court grants the motion subject to certain conditions. Maggiore is ordered to appear for deposition on a date, time, and location to be noticed by Plaintiff Bernal. The parties are ordered to meet and confer on a mutually agreeable date for the deposition to proceed and to be completed by November 15, 2024. If Maggiore does not meaningfully participate in the meet and confer discussion, Plaintiff Bernal may unilaterally notice Maggiore's deposition. The court also declines to award any sanctions under the circumstances.
