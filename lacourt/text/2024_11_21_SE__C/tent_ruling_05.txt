Defendant MARIA
LILLIANA RAMIREZ’s unopposed Motion to Compel Responses to Request for
Production of Documents (Set One) from Plaintiff MASIAH SMITH, a minor through
her GAL Jalia Stephens, is GRANTED.
 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
 
On July 26,
2023, Plaintiff Maria Lilliana Ramirez (“Plaintiff”), a minor, through her GAL
Jalia Stephens, filed this personal injury suit against Defendants Deon
Quinine, Los Anqeles Metropolitan Transit Authority, and Maria Lilliana Ramirez
arising from a motor vehicle collision on December 22, 2022 on Long Beach Ave.,
10 feet South of Vernon Ave, at a railroad intersection.  The sole cause of action is for
negligence.  
 
Defendant
Maria Lilliana Ramirez moves to compel responses to Request for Production of
Documents (Set One) from Plaintiff.  
 
No
Opposition filed as of November 18, 2024. Due by November 7, 2024. (CCP
§1005(b).)   
 
If a party
to whom document demands are directed fails to respond at all, the propounding
party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers thereto. (CCP §
2031.300.) All that needs to be shown is that the discovery was properly served
on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no
response of any kind has been served. The moving party is not required to show
a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the matter informally before
filing this motion. A motion to compel initial discovery responses need not
show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely filing, and need not be
accompanied by a separate statement. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The
failure to timely respond also waives all objections. 
 
Here, Defendant
has shown that Request for Production of Documents (set one) was properly
served onto Plaintiff on March 18, 2024. The original deadline, and multiple
extensions to respond granted by Defendant’s Counsel have expired. No responses
of any kind have been provided.  This
Motion was filed on July 9, 2024—almost four months after service of the discovery.
As of November 18, 2024, no Opposition has been filed. 
 
The Court
notes that Plaintiff’s former counsel’s Motion to Withdraw as Counsel of Record
was granted on July 11, 2024. As of the date of this hearing, Plaintiff is
self-represented.  
 
The unopposed
Motions to Compel is GRANTED, and Plaintiff
is ORDERED to provide verified
responses and documents, without objection by no later than 30 days from
date of the Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may be extended by
stipulation of the parties. If any objections are asserted, it will be
tantamount to no response at all and will be deemed a violation of this Court’s
order. 
 
Reasonable
sanctions are GRANTED in the total amount of $360.00. Plaintiff is  ORDERED to pay Defendant and their counsel of
record sanctions in the total amount of $360.00, payable within 30 days from
the date of the Court’s issuance of this Order.
