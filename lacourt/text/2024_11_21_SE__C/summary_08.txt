And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the unopposed motion of Marc Aaron Goldbach and the Goldbach Law Group to withdraw as counsel of record for Plaintiff Donald Emerson. The motion was filed on November 12, 2024, and no opposition was filed by that date. The Court has reviewed the declaration by Counsel, which indicates a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The Court finds that Counsel has met the procedural requirements, including proper notice to the client, and that the breakdown in communication does not appear to serve the interests of justice. The motion to withdraw is granted, and Counsel is relieved of its duties. The trial is still scheduled to begin on February 15, 2025, at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-F.
