And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff made a mistake in filing an incorrect version of the amended complaint, naming Sandra Plonowski as a defendant instead of Community Escrow Services, Inc. The judge cites California law and previous court cases to support the decision, stating that the court must permit a party to amend its operative pleading in the furtherance of justice and on such terms as may be just. The plaintiff must file and serve the corrected amended complaint within 10 calendar days.
