The judge has granted Defendant Ninive Gastelum's unopposed motion to compel Plaintiff Josefina Cruz Sanchez's responses to Form Interrogatories (set one). The motion was filed over four months after service of the discovery, and no opposition was filed by Plaintiff. The judge found that the Form Interrogatories were properly served on Plaintiff and that the deadline to respond has expired. Since no responses of any kind have been provided by Plaintiff, the judge granted the motion to compel. The judge ordered Plaintiff to provide verified responses to Form Interrogatories without objection within 30 days from the date of the court's issuance of this order. Additionally, the judge granted sanctions in the amount of $360.00 to be paid by Plaintiff to Defendant and their counsel within 30 days from the date of the court's issuance of this order.
