- "Demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that the defendant cannot reasonably respond, i.e., he or she cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him or her." (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif. Inc.)
- "The basic elements of unlawful detainer for nonpayment of rent contained in CCP §1161(2) are: (1) the tenant is in possession of the premises; (2) that possession is without permission; (3) the tenant is in default for nonpayment of rent; (4) the tenant has been properly served with a written three-day notice; and (5) the default continues after the three-day notice period has elapsed." (Kruger v. Reyes)

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Demurrer to Plaintiff's Complaint and two Motions. The Demurrer to the Complaint is sustained with 5 days' leave to amend. The Judge finds that the pleading is not uncertain, and the Defendant's demurrer is well-taken due to the lack of proof of service for the 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit attached as Exhibit 3 to the Complaint.

The Motion to Compel Deposition of the Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) and Production of Documents is granted. The Judge orders the Defendant to produce its PMK for deposition and to produce documents by a certain date.

The Motion for Sanctions is denied. The Judge finds that the Defendant's Demurrer is not frivolous and that the Plaintiff has not shown bad faith or an improper purpose. The Judge notes that the congested calendar may have contributed to the delay in scheduling a hearing date.
