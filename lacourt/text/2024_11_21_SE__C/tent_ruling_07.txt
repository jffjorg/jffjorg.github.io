This lemon law action
concerning the sale of a Tiffin Allegro Breeze vehicle to Plaintiffs JEWEL
JONES and CLEMERSTINE JONES (collectively “Plaintiffs”) was filed against
Defendants TIFFIN MOTORHOMES INC. (“Tiffin”); MIKE THOMPSON RV 2 (“Mike
Thompson RV”); FREIGHTLINER CUSTOM CHASSIS CORPORATION, INC. (“Freightliner”);
and Does 1 through 10 (collectively “Defendants”) on October 6, 2023.  
 
On November 6, 2023,
Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). Plaintiffs
allege that “[o]n NOVEMBER 29, 2022, Plaintiffs acquired a 2022 TIFFIN ALLEGRO
BREEZE…. [¶] The Vehicle was sold with TIFFIN MOTORHOMES INC.’s and FREGHLINER’s
warranty and, to be free from defects in materials and workmanship. Defendant,
by way of their warranties, promised Plaintiffs to make or provide repairs that
were free of charges during the warranty period.” (FAC ¶¶16-17.) “Plaintiffs,
from the time of the acquisition of the Vehicle to the present, the Vehicle has
suffered extensive and ongoing problems….” (FAC ¶20.) “Plaintiffs Vehicle
continued to experience mechanical issues. Plaintiffs were forced to return to
the servicing dealership, multiple times with the same underlying issues.” (FAC
¶22.) “The servicing Dealerships, including… are TIFFIN MOTORHOMES, INC and
FREIGHTLINER’s agents in the capacity as they perform warranty repairs on
behalf of them. It is clear that Defendants is unable to fix, remedy, and/or
repair the Vehicle to conform to the warranty. Their multiple repair attempts
have proven willfully unsuccessful in resolving the issue.” (FAC ¶24.) 
 
Plaintiffs’ FAC asserts
the following causes of action: 
 
(1)
Violation
of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act Breach of Express Warranty; 
(2)
Violation
of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act Breach of Implied Warranty; 
(3)
Violation
of Business and Professions Code §17200; and 
(4)
Negligent
Repair
 
Tiffin and Mike
Thompson RV now move to stay the action under CCP §410.30, arguing that the
parties are bound to litigate their claims in Franklin County, Alabama under
the forum selection clause contained in the express warranty, that this
agreement is mandatory, and that the agreement requires application of Alabama
law. Tiffin and Mike Thompson RV indicate that they will stipulate to “not
object” to the application of California law (related to the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act) in a Franklin County, Alabama court. 
 
In Opposition, Plaintiffs
argue: (1) the forum selection clause at issue violates public policy; (2) the
State if Alabama does not provide statutory protections to purchasers of motor
homes, RV and trailers, under its lemon law statute; and (3) Defendants’ offer
to stipulate does not cure the problem. 
 
“When a court upon
motion of a party or its own motion finds that in the interest of substantial
justice an action should be heard in a forum outside this state, the court
shall stay or dismiss the action in whole or in part on any conditions that may
be just.” (CCP §410.30.) 
 
On November 29, 2022, Plaintiff
purchased the Subject Vehicle.  The Sales
Contract had a Warranty Registration Form, which was signed by Plaintiffs and
acknowledges that Plaintiffs agreed to the terms of Tiffin’s Limited Warranty,
which states in relevant part: “PURCHASER AND TIFFIN AGREE THAT EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF ANY PROCEEDING HEREUNDER SHALL BE IN THE STATE COURT OF GENERAL
JURISDICTION IN AND FOR FRANKLIN COUNTY, ALABAMA, OR IN THE FEDERAL
DISTRICT COURT DIVISION THAT INCLUDES FRANKLIN COUNTY, ALABAMA.
PURCHASER AND TIFFIN AGREE TO SUBMIT THEMSELVES, IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR
PROCEEDING BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS LIMITED WARRANTY OR OTHERWISE TO THE
STATE OR FEDERAL COURT FOR FRANKLIN COUNTY, ALABAMA, AND CONSENT THAT ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE BROUGHT IN SUCH COURTS, AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY
OBJECTION THAT EACH MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE VENUE OF ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT.” (Tyler Decl., Ex. B.) 
 
A “mandatory [forum
selection] clause will ordinarily be given effect without any analysis of
convenience; the only question is whether enforcement of the clause would be
unreasonable. On the other hand, when the clause merely provides for submission
to jurisdiction and does not expressly mandate litigation exclusively in a
particular forum, then the traditional forum non conveniens analysis applies.”
(Intershop Communications A.G. v. Superior Court (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th
191, 196.) “[I]f there is a mandatory forum selection clause, the test is
simply whether application of the clause is unfair or unreasonable, and the
clause is usually given effect… ‘Mere inconvenience or additional expense is
not the test of unreasonableness…’ of a mandatory forum selection clause.” (Berg
v. MTC Electronics Technologies (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 349, 358-359.)
 
“California favors contractual forum selection clauses so long as
they are entered into freely and voluntarily, and their enforcement would not
be unreasonable. [Citations Omitted.]” (Lathrop v. Thor Motor Coach, Inc.
(2024) 105 Cal.App.5th 808,165.) “Nonetheless, California Courts will refuse to
defer to the selected forum if to do so would substantially diminish the rights
of California residents in a way that violates our state’s public policy. The
party opposing enforcement of a forum selection clause ordinarily bears the
substantial burden of proving why it should not be enforced. That burden,
however, is reversed when the claims at issue are based on unwaivable rights
created by California statues. In that situation, the party seeking to enforce
the forum selection clause bears the burden to show litigating the claims in the
contractually designated forum will not diminish in any way the substantive
rights afforded… under California law. [Citations Omitted.]” (Id.) 
Here, the plain language of the forum selection clause at issue
dictates that all disputes involving warranty claims be filed in the State of
Alabama, and requires Plaintiffs to waive their Song-Beverly warranty rights in
violation of Cal. Civ. Code §1790.1, which is direct violation of public policy
and, thus, void. 
Moreover, as argued in Opposition, a stipulation to apply
California law does not render an otherwise unenforceable forum selection cluse
enforceable. (Id. at 169.) 
The Motion is DENIED.
