CASE
NO.:  23NWCV03552
HEARING:  11/21/24
 
#4
 
Attorney
Marc Aaron Goldbach and the Goldbach Law Group’s unopposed motion to withdraw
as counsel of record for Plaintiff DONALD EMERSON is GRANTED.  
 
Moving
Party to give notice. 
 
No
Oppositions filed as of November 12, 2024.  
 
The
Court finds that Counsel has met the procedural requirements, including proper
notice to the client at the last known residence or business address of the
client.  C.R.C. 3.1362.
 
Here,
Counsel’s declaration indicates that there has been a breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship. Where the issue (or conflict) is between the
lawyer and client(s), without implicating other parties, the court can rely on
counsel’s sworn declaration absent any reason to doubt the representations. 
 
There
is an undisputed breakdown in attorney-client communications. It does not
appear that the Attorney Goldbach’s continued representation would serve the
interests of justice. The motion to withdraw is GRANTED.  
 
The
Court notes that trail is scheduled to begin on February 15, 2025 at 9:30 a.m.
in Dept. SE-F.
