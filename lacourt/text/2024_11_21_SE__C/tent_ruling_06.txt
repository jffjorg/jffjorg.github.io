CASE
NO.:  23NWCV03017

Defendant
NINIVE GASTELUM’s unopposed Motion to Compel Plaintiff JOSEFINA CRUZ SANCHEZ’s Responses
to Form Interrogatories (set one) is GRANTED.

 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
 
On
September 25, 2023, Plaintiff Josefina Cruz Sanchez (“Plaintiff”) filed this
lawsuit against Defendant Ninive Gastelum (“Defendant”) seeking monetary,
declaratory, and injunctive relief for housing discrimination based on
Defendant’s refusal to provide a reasonable accommodation to Plaintiff in
violation of the Federal Housing Act and related state laws. 
 
Defendant
moves to compel responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) and for
sanctions.  
 
No
Opposition filed as of November 19, 2024. Due by November 7, 2024. (CCP
§1005(b).) 
 
If a party
to whom interrogatories are directed fails to respond at all, the propounding
party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers thereto. (CCP §
2030.290.) All that needs to be shown is that the discovery was properly served
on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no
response of any kind has been served. The moving party is not required to show
a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the matter informally before
filing this motion. A motion to compel initial discovery responses need not
show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely filing, and need not be
accompanied by a separate statement. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The
failure to timely respond also waives all objections. 
 
Here, Defendant
has shown that Form Interrogatories (set one) was properly served onto Plaintiff
JOSEFINA CRUZ SANCHEZ (“Plaintiff”) (in pro per) on March 5, 2024. The deadline
to respond have expired, and no responses of any kind have been provided.  This Motion was filed on July 29, 2024—over
four months after service of the discovery. As of November 19, 2024, no Opposition
has been filed to the subject Motion. 
 
The unopposed
Motion to Compel is GRANTED, and Plaintiff
is ORDERED to provide verified
responses, without objection by no later than 30 days from date of the
Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may be extended by stipulation of
the parties. If any objections are asserted, it will be tantamount to no
response at all and will be deemed a violation of this Court’s order. 
 
Reasonable
sanctions are GRANTED in the total amount of $360.00. Plaintiff JOSEFINA CRUZ
SANCHEZ is ORDERED to pay Defendant and their counsel of record sanctions in
the total amount of $360.00, within 30 days from the date of the Court’s
issuance of this Order.
