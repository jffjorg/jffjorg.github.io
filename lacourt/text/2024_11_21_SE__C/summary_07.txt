And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has denied the Motion to Stay Action Based on Inconvenient Forum filed by Tiffin Motorhomes Inc. and Mike Thompson RV 2. The motion was filed in connection with a lawsuit brought by Jewel Jones and Clemerstine Jones, who purchased a 2022 Tiffin Allegro Breeze vehicle that has suffered extensive and ongoing problems. The Judge found that the forum selection clause in the warranty agreement requires the parties to litigate in Franklin County, Alabama, but held that this clause is void because it violates California's public policy by requiring Plaintiffs to waive their Song-Beverly warranty rights. The Judge also rejected the Defendants' offer to stipulate to apply California law, finding that this would not cure the problem. As a result, the motion to stay the action is denied, and the case will proceed in California.
