Court notes that although the Motions are titled as “Motion to Quash Service of
Summons and Amended Complaint” all the parties filings refer to the initial
Complaint that was filed on July 18, 2023. The FAC was filed on December 20,
2023, and was served the same day via email on Defense counsel. (See Proof of
Service filed on 12/20/23.) Moving Defendants make no arguments as to improper
service of the FAC, solely the initial Complaint.
