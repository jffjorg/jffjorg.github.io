(CCP § 2030.290, subds. (b), (c), & §

TENTATIVE RULING: GRANT
 
            Plaintiff
I.L.W.U. Credit Union’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set
1) and Motion for Order that Matters and Requests for Admissions Be Deemed
Admitted are both GRANTED. Sanctions will be imposed upon Defendant
and granted to Plaintiff in the amount of $1,000.00. Both the responses
to the Form Interrogatories (Set 1), and the $1,000.00 sanctions are due 30
days from the date of this order. The Requests for Admissions are deemed
admitted.  
Background
            This case stems from a loan where money was lent and not paid back. On
April 26, 2023, I.L.W.U. Credit Union (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint containing
seven causes of action against Andre T. Thomas (Defendant). The Complaint
alleges that on September 29, 2021, Defendant took out a loan for a vehicle.
(Complaint, ¶ 6.) The loan agreement required that Defendant make monthly
payments, however, Defendant has defaulted on those payments, and now Plaintiff
seeks to sue for the money owed. 
 
            The motions now before the Court are
two discovery motions: (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories
(Set 1) and (2) Motion for Order That Matters and Requests for Admissions Be
Deemed Admitted (the Motions). Both Motions request sanctions and are supported
by the Declaration of Bruce P. Needleman (Needleman Decl.) The Motions are
unopposed. 
 
Discussion
 
Legal Standard for a Motion to Compel Responses to Form
Interrogatories
            If a party
to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary
sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds. (b), (c).) Failure to timely
respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product, unless
“[t]he party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial
compliance” and “[t]he party’s failure to serve a timely response was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2030.290, subds.
(a)(1), (a)(2).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel
where no responses have been served and no meet and confer is required when a
party does not respond to discovery requests. All that need be shown in the
moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the
opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of
any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d
902, 905-906.)
 
Legal Standard for a Motion that Requests for Admissions
be Deemed Admitted
            Code of
Civil Procedure § 2033.250, provides, in pertinent part, that “[w]ithin 30 days
after service of the request for admissions . . . the party to whom the
requests are directed shall serve the original of the response to them on the
requesting party.” A motion to deem admitted requests for admissions lies based
upon a showing of failure to respond timely. (CCP §2033.280(b); Demyer v.
Costa Mesa Mobile Home Estates (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 393, 395, disapproved
on other grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 983.)
Requests for admissions must be deemed admitted where no responses in
substantial compliance was served before the hearing. (CCP §2033.280(c).)     
            If a party
to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the following rules apply:
   (a) The party to
whom the requests for admission are directed waives any objection to the
requests, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both
of the following conditions are satisfied:
   (1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.
   (2) The party's
failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect.
(CCP § 2033.280)
 
Analysis
            The
Needleman Decl. states that on December 7, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel propounded
discovery of both the Form Interrogatories (Set 1) and the Requests for
Admissions on Defendant. (Needleman Decl., ¶ 2.) The deadline for responses was
January 11, 2024, however, no responses came, and Plaintiff’s counsel then
reached out to meet and confer. (Id. at ¶ 3.) However, as of the date of
the Needleman Decl., February 15, 2024, no responses were received. (Id.
at ¶ 4.) Therefore, the Motions are granted, and sanctions will be imposed.
Plaintiff’s counsel provides the following calculations: 
·        
Counsel’s rate is $195.00 per hour
·        
Counsel spent 2 hours preparing each Motion
·        
Counsel anticipates spending 2.5 hours appearing
for the Motion and any follow-up.
·        
Counsel incurred a $60.00 filing fee
·        
In total, counsel requests $937.50 per Motion
 
            Considering the similarities between the Motions, the
Court will impose $1,000.00 in monetary sanctions against Defendant, and award
them to Plaintiff.  
 
Conclusion
            Plaintiff
I.L.W.U. Credit Union’s Motion to Compel Responses to Dorm Interrogatories (Set
1) and Motion for Order that Matters and Requests for Admissions Be Deemed
Admitted are both GRANTED. Sanctions will be imposed upon
Defendant and granted to Plaintiff in the amount of $1,000.00. Both the
responses to the Form Interrogatories (Set 1), and the $1,000.00 sanctions are
due 30 days from the date of this order. The Requests for Admissions are deemed
admitted.
