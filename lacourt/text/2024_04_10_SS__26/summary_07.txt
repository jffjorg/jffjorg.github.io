Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled to deny the motions to quash filed by defendants Jillian Goldsmith and Ariel Mehrban. The motions were filed in response to the service of the summons and amended complaint. The judge found that service of the summons was proper, as it was served on an individual working at the storefront address and the individual was informed of the general nature of the contents. The judge also noted that the service was consistent with California Code of Civil Procedure Section 415.20, which permits service on an individual by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person's dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or in the presence of a person apparently in charge of his or her office. The judge denied the motions on their merits, finding that service was properly accomplished on both moving defendants.
