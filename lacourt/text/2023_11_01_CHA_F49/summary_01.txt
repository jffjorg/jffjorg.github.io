And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 19CHCV00155, in which the defendant, Lashon Bundy, is moving to enforce a settlement agreement that was reached on June 1, 2022. The agreement, which was amended on November 29, 2021, called for the sale of a property located at 15156 Kingsbury St., Mission Hills, and the appointment of an elisor to facilitate the sale.

The court has found that the instant motion is directly related to the subject matter of the underlying action and that the parties have stipulated to the filing of a first amended complaint, which lists causes of action for Financial Elder Abuse, Quiet Title, Ejectment, Cancellation of Instrument, and Partition of Real Property.

The court has therefore ordered the instant motion off-calendar and stayed the action. The court has set an OSC re: Status of Appeal for January 31, 2024, and has ordered the parties to submit any supplemental briefs, if necessary, no later than nine (9) court days before the next hearing.
