And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the application for a writ of attachment against defendant Jonathan M. Kramer in the amount of $8 million. The writ of attachment is based on a guaranty agreement executed by Kramer for $8 million, which is not secured by any collateral. The court finds that plaintiff Access Road Capital, LLC has shown a probably valid claim against Kramer for breach of the guaranty agreement.

The court also grants the defendant's claim of exemption for the residence, limiting the writ of attachment to $1,122,692. The defendant had claimed a homestead exemption for the residence, which the court finds is valid.

The court requires the plaintiff to post an undertaking of $10,000 before the writ of attachment is issued. The plaintiff is seeking a writ of attachment against the defendant's property, including the residence, which has a current market value of $4.6 million.

The court notes that the plaintiff's application for a writ of attachment is based on a guaranty agreement, which is a separate and independent obligation from the primary loan. The court finds that the guaranty agreement is unsecured and that the plaintiff is entitled to attach the defendant's property, including the residence, up to the amount of the guaranty.
