[1] Defendant has not filed for bankruptcy relief, and the
pending bankruptcy of Borrowers does not impact Plaintiff’s right to apply for
attachment against Defendant. (See Appl. ¶ 8; Ingersoll-Rand Financial Corp. v. Miller Min.
Co., Inc. (1987) 817 F.2d 1424, 1427.)


[2]
Section 9.2 of the Credit and Security Agreement
provides that following an Event of Default, Plaintiff may declare all
principal and interest owing under the loan and note forthwith due and payable.
(Id. Exh. 1.)
 


[3] It appears likely Plaintiff concedes the exemption’s
application here.
