And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling denies Petitioner Geary J. Johnson's motion to amend judgment and enforce a writ directing the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board (CUIAB) to set aside its decision denying Petitioner's request for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) benefits. The CUIAB found that Petitioner's unemployment, which predated the pandemic, was not caused by the pandemic but was exacerbated by it. The court concludes that the CUIAB's decision is supported by the applicable regulations and that Petitioner's self-certification is not sufficient to override the decision.
