It
appears Petitioner appealed the 2022 Decision. (See Appeal attached to
Opposition.) The results of the appeal are not before the court. Thus, it is
unclear whether Petitioner now challenges a decision that is not yet final.

Respondent
contends the application was for PUA benefits citing AR 160. The citation does
not support the application as one for PUA benefits. It is unclear to the court
how Petitioner could have applied for PUA benefits prior to passage of the
CARES Act. The application indicates Petitioner’s unemployment was unrelated to
disaster. (AR 162.)

Prior
to that determination, the EDD found Petitioner qualified for PUA as of July
19, 2020. The finding, however, was contingent as the EDD needed additional
certification for benefits to be payable. The 2022 Decision explains why the
EDD is not bound by the initial determination and notes the initial
determination “explicitly indicates the claimant is subject to further
certification.” (2022 Decision 4.)
