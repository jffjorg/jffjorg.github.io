[1] The court has considered Petitioner’s opening brief,
Respondent’s “response” to the opening brief, Petitioner’s reply, and the
administrative record, which is attached to Petitioner’s declaration filed with
the opening brief. (See Albertoni Decl. ¶ 1, Exh 1.) The court further addresses
the declarations submitted by the parties in the Analysis section below. The
court notes Petitioner’s Reply Brief is 12 pages and therefore exceeds the
applicable 10-page limit.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1113, subd. (d); Los Angeles County Court (LASC) Rules, Rule
3.231, subd.(i).) The court has nonetheless exercised its discretion to consider
the entire Reply Brief.


[2] In its
ruling on demurrer dated April 26, 2023, the court concluded Petitioner had not
stated a cause of action for ordinary mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1085. (See Demurrer Ruling 3-5.) Nonetheless, for the reasons discussed below in the Analysis
section, the court also considers the petition under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1085. The court reaches the same result here whether governed by Code
of Civil Procedure section 1085 or 1094.5.
 


[3] While LAUSD cites the court’s ruling on its demurrer (see
Opposition 7 and fn. 1), it is unclear whether LAUSD also believes Code of
Civil Procedure section 1085 also does not apply.  


[4] The court’s ruling is necessarily based on the
arguments that have been made by Petitioner in her briefing. (See Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1113, subds. (a), (d); see also Quantum Cooking Concepts, Inc. v. LV Associates, Inc. (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th
927, 934 [“trial
court ha[s] no obligation to undertake its own search of the record ‘backwards
and forwards to try to figure out how the law applies to the facts’ of the
case”].)


[5] Petitioner cites Government Code section 11513 with a “see”
signal for support. As LAUSD is not a state agency, the statute is inapplicable
here. (Gov. Code, §
11500, subd. (a).)


[6] Petitioner’s appeal letter is not properly before the court.
See fn. 11 infra.


[7]
Importantly, Petitioner also cites no authority that due
process or fair hearing necessarily requires under these circumstances an
opportunity to confront or respond to statements of other persons. Petitioner
also does not show the Bulletin, LAUSD policy, an applicable statute or
regulation requiring an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses. Finally, as
here, the appeal process allows the employee to present a response to evidence
as summarized by the RA Committee in its letter.


[8]
In her Reply Brief, Petitioner cites Goldberg v. Kelly (1970) 397 U.S.
254, which held
procedural due process requires a pretermination evidentiary hearing be held
when public assistance payments to a welfare recipient are discontinued. Petitioner
does not show good cause to cite new authority and make new arguments in her Reply
Brief. (Balboa Ins. Co. v.
Aguirre (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 1002, 1010.) Further, Petitioner does not
show her request for a reasonable accommodation–to work remotely indefinitely–is
comparable to the discontinuation of public welfare benefits that were a “matter of
statutory entitlement for persons qualified to receive them.” (Goldberg v.
Kelly, supra, 397 U.S. at 261-262.)


[9] Further, as noted earlier, any error is subject to
harmless error analysis.


[10] To the extent Petitioner makes entirely new arguments
in her Reply Brief about LAUD’s reasons for denying the request for reasonable
accommodation, as with other arguments, the arguments made for the first time
in reply are procedurally improper and rejected for the reasons discussed
above. (See Balboa Ins.
Co. v. Aguirre, supra, 149 Cal.App.3d at 1010.)


[11] To the extent Petitioner seeks to “correct” the
administrative record with any evidence, including her attorney’s 19-page October
6, 2021 letter to LAUSD (see Albertoni Decl. pp. 24-45), Petitioner did not
bring a timely motion to do so. (See LASC Rule 3.231, subd. (g)(3).) In any
event, Petitioner does not show the letter is dispositive to any issue before
this court.  


[12] Because the court has denied the petition, the court
need not reach the parties’ remaining contentions, including the proper remedy
if the court were to grant the petition.
