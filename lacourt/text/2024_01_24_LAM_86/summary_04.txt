And here is the English summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented in the administrative record and the parties' briefs. The court has considered the Petitioner's revised opening brief, Respondent's opposition brief, and the reply brief. The Judge has also considered the administrative record, including the contract between Wrightsman and Gawi, and the checks payable to TO2 Group.

The Judge rejects the Petitioner's contention that his statements at the meeting were a "settlement offer" that should have been ruled inadmissible. The court also rejects the Petitioner's contention that the Board was required to find that his conduct "caused Ms. Wrightsman to contract with Mr. Gawi."

The Judge notes that the Board's failure to address the point suggests that the Petitioner's argument is meritorious. However, the court questions whether the Petitioner raised any argument about the standard of proof in the administrative proceedings or submitted any evidence before the ALJ suggesting that the fines and penalties were excessive.

The Judge also notes that the automatic suspension of the license is triggered by the failure to pay the civil penalty or comply with the order of correction, and that this provision is governed by Section 7090.1, subdivision (a).
