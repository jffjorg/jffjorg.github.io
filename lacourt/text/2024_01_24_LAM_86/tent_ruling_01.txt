[Tentative]       ORDER
DENYING MOTION TO AMEND JUDGMENT
 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                            
 
Petitioner, Geary J. Johnson, brings this motion to
amend judgment. Respondent, California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board
(CUIAB), opposes the motion.
 
RELEVANT
HISTORY
 
On July 25, 2022, this court
issued its judgment granting Petitioner’s request for a peremptory writ of
mandate. The judgment ordered that a writ issue directing CUIAB to set aside
its April 16, 2021 decision and reconsider the matter pursuant to Topanga
Association for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11
Cal.3d 506. The court did so finding the underlying decision, a denial of
Petitioner’s request for federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA)
benefits, could not be properly reviewed because the rationale for the CUIAB’s
decision was unclear.
 
On December 2, 2022, the
CUIAB filed its return on the writ. The return indicated its prior decision had
been vacated and included a new decision issued on or about November 4, 2022
(the 2022 Decision).[1] The
2022 Decision again found Petitioner ineligible for PUA.
 
On December 12, 2022,
Petitioner filed his opposition to the return asserting the 2022 Decision “does
not comply with the judgment of the Superior Court . . . .” (Opposition
1:22-23.) Petitioner argued he “did not apply for unemployment based on
COVID-19 reasons in December 2019, yet the [2022 Decision] used the same 2019
benefit filing as the basis for its [2022 Decision], an argument already
rejected by the court as false and not factual.” (Opposition 1:25-28.)
Petitioner also argued the 2022 Decision is not supported by “facts or laws . .
. .” (Opposition 2:3.) Petitioner contends the CUIAB is unable “to provide any
law to support its decision that Petitioner was not entitled to PUA benefits
because he was unemployed before the Pandemic was declared; not one
[unemployment insurance code] or state or federal law in support is presented
by the” CUIAB. (Opposition 2:8-10.)
 
On September 13, 2023,
Petitioner filed this motion. While styled as a motion to amend the judgment,
the motion seeks further relief against CUIAB as having not complied with the
court’s prior writ. The court thus treats Petitioner’s motion as a motion to
enforce the writ. (See City of Carmel-By-The-Sea v. Board of Supervisors (1982)
137 Cal.App.3d 964, 971 [motion can be used to enforce a writ].)
 
ANALYSIS
 
As noted, Petitioner argues
CUIAB did not comply with the writ because the CUIAB mistakenly notes
Petitioner “did not apply for unemployment based on COVID-19 reasons in
December 2019, yet the [2022 Decision] used the same 2019 benefit filing as the
basis for its [2022 Decision], an argument already rejected by the court as
false and not factual.” (Opposition 1:25-28.) Petitioner also argued the 2022
Decision is not supported by “facts or laws . . . .” (Opposition 2:3.)
 
The CUIAB asserts Petitioner
is wrong. The CUIAB argues:
 
Specifically, the ALJ found that the last time petitioner worked was in
2019. Based on that last date of employment, the ALJ then analyzed the
legislative history of the CARES Act and PUA program and the criteria for
eligibility for a person to qualify for PUA assistance. Finally, in finding
petitioner ineligible for PUA assistance, the ALJ specifically cited to title
15 United States Code section 9021(h) and 20 Code of Federal Regulations part
625.5 (2021) to support his finding (See Exhibit A). (CUIAB Opposition 4:7-12.)
 
In its judgment in this proceeding, the court
explained the dispute between the parties:
 
According to his testimony, Petitioner last worked for wages or other
compensation on December 31, 2019. (AR 86-87, 162, 188). Since that date,
Petitioner did not perform any work for wages, money or other compensation. (AR
86-87.)
 
On January 13, 2020, Petitioner submitted a “UI Online Application
Report for Confirmation” for benefits. (AR 160.) In the application, Petitioner
stated he last worked on December 31, 2019. (AR 162.) He also indicated he did
not become unemployed due to disaster.[2] (AR 162.)
 
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
Act (CARES Act) was enacted. The CARES Act provided financial assistance to
individuals affected by the COVID-19 public health emergency declared by the
United States Secretary of Health and Human Services on January 27, 2020. (See
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, 21 Pub. L. No. 116-136, 134
Stat. 281 (2020).) The CARES Act created a new temporary federal program, the
PUA program, which provided unemployment benefits to workers not covered by
regular unemployment insurance, including self-employed workers and gig
workers. (15 U.S.C. § 9021.) Although the PUA benefit and administration costs
are federally funded, individuals applied for PUA benefits through state unemployment
agencies, and those state agencies process PUA applications and make
eligibility determinations. (15 U.S.C. § 9021(f).)
 
On August 10, 2020, Petitioner received a Notice of Pandemic
Unemployment Assistance Award stating the EDD had filed petitioner’s PUA claim.
(AR 120). The notice explained “[t]o receive PUA benefits, you must provide the
EDD with eligibility information every two weeks.” (AR 120.) The notice also
explained, “In order to provide benefits as quickly as possible, your claim has
been filed with the minimum amount of $167 allowed under federal law. After
these initial payments, depending on your prior earnings, your weekly amount of
$167 per week may be increased based on the annual income you provided in your
initial PUA application.” (AR 120.)
 
Petitioner received an undated Notice of Determination for Pandemic
Unemployment Assistance from the EDD reporting he did not qualify for federal
PUA benefits. The notice explained Petitioner was not entitled to PUA benefits
because his date of unemployment preceded the Secretary of Health and Human
Services’ declaration of a COVID-19 public health emergency on January 27,
2020. (AR 121.) The notice advised federal law did not permit payment of PUA
benefits to him. (AR 121.) 
 
Petitioner appealed the EDD’s decision based on the conflict in the
notices. Petitioner thereafter withdrew the appeal believing he could get an
explanation from the EDD about the contradictory notices. After finding no
success with an explanation from the EDD, Petitioner reinstated the appeal. (AR
187.)
 
On February 11, 2021, an administrative law judge (ALJ) conducted an
administrative hearing. (AR 56-94.) The hearing focused on whether Petitioner
became unemployed, partially unemployed, or unable to or unavailable for work
prior to January 27, 2020, and therefore not as a direct result of the COVID-19
pandemic health emergency. (AR 59, 188.) Petitioner testified he last worked on
December 31, 2019. (AR 86.) (Writ, Exh. A, pp. 1-3.) 
 
To be clear, the court did not find in
its order and judgment that Petitioner was entitled to PUA benefits. The court
remanded the matter to CUIAB because the decision was unclear and could not
effectively be reviewed by the court.

              The
2022 Decision
 
The 2022 Decision explains
Petitioner last worked in 2019. He filed a valid claim for unemployment
insurance benefits effective January 12, 2020. Petitioner exhausted the
benefits payable on that claim. Thereafter, Petitioner qualified for Pandemic
Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUA), a federally funded extension of
unemployment insurance benefits created under Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, 21 Pub. L. No.
116-136, 134 Stat. 281 (2020), the CARES Act. Petitioner thereafter exhausted
all benefits payable under the PEUA program.
 
The Employment Development Department
(EDD) thereafter considered whether Petitioner qualified for PUA. Ultimately,
the EDD determined Petitioner was ineligible for PUA benefits.[3]
 
The PUA eligibility provisions of the
CARES Act are set forth in 15 U.S.C. section 9021 (Section 9021). Section 9021,
subdivision (a)(3)(A)(ii) provides the eligibility requirements for PUA.
Section 9021, subdivision (a)(3) defines covered individuals. Covered
individuals include those who are not eligible for regular or extended benefits
(“including an individual who has exhausted all rights to regular unemployment
or extended benefits under State or Federal law”) and who certify they are
otherwise able to work “except the individual is unemployed, partially
unemployed, or unable or unavailable to work because” of certain conditions. (§
9021, subd. (a)(3)(A)(ii).) 
 
The PUA program is related to and
fashioned after the Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) program. Certain
regulations have been promulgated for the DUA. (See 20 CFR § 625.) Those
regulations are applicable to consideration of PUA. (§ 9021, subd. (h).)
 
The applicable DUA regulations define
“unemployed worker” at section 625.2, subdivision (s):
 
means an
individual who was employed in or was to commence employment in the major
disaster area at the time the major disaster began, and whose principal source
of income and livelihood is dependent upon the individual's employment for
wages, and whose unemployment is caused by a major disaster as provided in § 625.5(a).
 
The applicable DUA
regulations define and explain when the unemployment of an unemployed worker is
caused by a major disaster at section 625.5, subdivision (a):  
The unemployment of an unemployed worker is caused by a major
disaster if— 
(1) The individual has a “week of unemployment” as defined in § 625.2(w)(1) following
the “date the major disaster began” as defined in § 625.2(e), and such
unemployment is a direct result of the major disaster; or 
(2) The individual is unable to reach the place of employment as a
direct result of the major disaster; or 
(3) The individual was to commence employment and does not have a job
or is unable to reach the job as a direct result of the major disaster; or 
(4) The individual has become the breadwinner or major support for a
household because the head of the household has died as a direct result of the
major disaster; or 
(5) The individual cannot work because of an injury caused as a
direct result of the major disaster. (Emphasis added.)
Finally,
the applicable DUA regulations define when unemployment is a direct result of
the disaster at section 625.5, subdivision (c):
For the purposes of paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of this
section, a worker's . . . unemployment is a direct result of the major disaster
where the unemployment is an immediate result of the major disaster itself, and
not the result of a longer chain of events precipitated or exacerbated by the
disaster. Such an individual's unemployment is a direct result of the major
disaster if the unemployment resulted from: 
(1) The physical damage or destruction of the place of employment; 
(2) The physical inaccessibility of the place of employment in the
major disaster area due to its closure by or at the request of the federal,
state or local government, in immediate response to the disaster; or 
(3) Lack of work, or loss of revenues, provided that, prior to the
disaster, the employer, or the business in the case of a self-employed
individual, received at least a majority of its revenue or income from an
entity in the major disaster area that was either damaged or destroyed in the
disaster, or an entity in the major disaster area closed by the federal, state
or local government in immediate response to the disaster.
Under the applicable
regulations, an individual’s unemployment is not the direct result of the
pandemic where the “unemployment is an immediate
result of the major disaster itself, and not the result of a longer chain of
events precipitated or exacerbated by the disaster.” (Ibid.)
 
The
CUIAB found Petitioner’s unemployment—which predated the pandemic—was not the
direct and immediate result of the public health emergency. The CUIAB found Petitioner’s
“loss of employment was not related to the pandemic, . . . .” (2022 Decision p.
6.) The CUIAB noted the pandemic undoubtedly made it more difficult to “find
new work,” but the pandemic “was not the cause of the unemployment in the first
place, but rather exacerbated by the public health emergency.” (2022 Decision
p. 6.) Thus, the CUIAB determined Petitioner was not qualified for PUA benefits
because Petitioner’s unemployment was not caused by the pandemic and instead
was the “result of a longer chain of events precipitated or exacerbated by the
disaster.” (20 CFR part 625.5, subd. (c).) 
 
On
the facts before the court, it appears CUIAB is correct. That is, Petitioner’s
unemployment was exacerbated by the pandemic, not caused by it. Petitioner
became unemployed prior to the pandemic. That the Secretary of Health and Human
Services declared COVID-19 to be a public health emergency on January 20, 2020 did
not cause Petitioner’s unemployment—it exacerbated it.
 
              Petitioner’s Position
 
Petitioner
does not explain how the CUIAB’s decision is flawed. Petitioner does not
address the CUIAB’s legal reasoning. Petitioner appears to acknowledge the DUA
regulations are applicable to decisions made for PUA. (Opposition, Appeal
attachment, p. 8, item 42.) Petitioner appears to contend, however, he is
entitled to PUA solely based on his self-certification. (§ 9021, subdivision
(a)(3)(A)(ii).
Petitioner does not explain how any self-certification would override a
decision his unemployment was not caused by the pandemic under the applicable
regulations. Importantly, Petitioner does not address why his unemployment
existing on January 20, 2020 was caused by the pandemic as opposed to
exacerbating his unemployment thereafter.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, the court
discharges the writ and overrules Petitioner’s objection.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
