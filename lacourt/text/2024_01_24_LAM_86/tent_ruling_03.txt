 Case Number:  21STCP03359    Hearing Date:   January 24, 2024    Dept:  86 ORAVECZ v. CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD
Case Number: 21STCP03359
Hearing Date: January 24, 2024 
 
[Tentative]       ORDER
GRANTING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 
 




















 
Through his petition, Paul Allan Oravecz
(Petitioner), seeks a writ of administrative mandate directing Respondent,
Contractors State License Board (Board), to set aside its administrative
decision (Decision) affirming Citation number 2 2019 2234 (the Citation) issued
to ADR Design Inc. (ADR). The Citation, as affirmed by the Board, requires ADR
to pay a civil penalty of $2,000 within 30 days of the effective date of the
Decision, and to pay the cost of correction in the amount of $50,000 to Real
Party in Interest, Mariya Wrightsman, also within 30 days of the effective date
of the Decision. The Board opposes the petition.
 
[Petitioner
shall address service of the petition or briefs on Wrightsman. It appears there
is no service. Given Wrightsman’s interest in the proceedings, how can the
court proceed without notice to her?]
 
Petitioner’s request for judicial notice of the Board’s website listing for ADR is denied.  (See Opening Brief 17.) “[A] hearing
on a writ of administrative mandamus is conducted solely on the record of the
proceedings before the administrative agency.” (Toyota of Visalia, Inc. v. New Motor Vehicle Bd. (1987) 188
Cal.App.3d 872, 881.) Extra-record evidence may be admitted if, in the exercise of
reasonable diligence, the relevant evidence could not have been produced or was
improperly excluded at the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5, subd. (e).) A request for judicial notice cannot be
used to circumvent the rules about extra-record evidence. (Ballona Wetlands
Land Trust v. City of Los Angeles (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 455, 475, fn. 10.)
As Petitioner has not addressed the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure
section 1094.5, subdivision (e) and augmentation in his request for judicial
notice, the request is denied.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Wrightsman Hires Amos Gawi to Build
an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) and Petitioner Obtains the Building Permits 
 
On May 14, 2008, the Board issued a
general building contractor license to ADR. (AR 674-676.) Petitioner is ADR’s
responsible managing officer. (AR 675.)  
 
In 2018, Wrightsman decided to convert
the garage of her home to an ADU. (AR 121-122.) Wrightsman’s handyman, Erick
Franco, referred her to Amos Gawi as someone who could do the work. (AR 34,
122-123, 718.) In a declaration dated in February 2021, Franco attested “[o]ver
the years working for Mr. Gawi, I remember several occasions where [Gawi]
referred to his ‘business partner,’ whose name he said was ‘Paul.’ ” (AR 718.)
 
“Gawi is not licensed by the Board.
Gawi instructed Wrightsman to write checks to TO2 Group Corporation, which is
not licensed by the Board.” (AR 34, ¶ 6 [administrative findings of fact].)[1]
 
“Wrightsman met Gawi in April 2019 to discuss
plans. Gawi told her he had a partner who could help resolve issues and guide
him. After the plans needed to be corrected, Gawi told Wrightsman the city
approved the plans.” (AR 34, ¶ 7; see also AR 124-125 [testimony of
Wrightsman].)  
 
In a declaration, Petitioner attests,
in April 2019, “I received a call from Amos Gawi asking for help on [an ADU] that
he and his friend where [sic] preparing for her residence as she was the owner.
I agreed and I met with him as he bought [sic] the plans to explain the
problem.” (AR 828.)  Petitioner further attests:
“[Gawi’s] problem was that of an engineering issue of which I realized there
was an engineer of record and he should take the plans back to him and have it resolved
. . . . After some small talk we departed, after a week or so he called again
and asked me if I wanted to build the project I said yes but I need to bid it
out so he dropped the plans off to me.” (AR 828; see also AR 59-60 [summary of
Petitioner’s interview with a Board investigator].)  
 
“Gawi and Wrightsman signed the
contract on May 2, 2019. (Exhibit 3). The contract listed the contractor as TO2
Group dba ADR Design. The work was described as adding a second story to the
existing garage ADU. The contract price was $92,000. Wrightsman made a down
payment of $16,000 on May 2, 2019 payable to TO2 Group Corporation.” (AR 35, ¶
8; see also 678-680.)  The contract also
specifies an approximate completion date of August 22, 2019. (AR 678.)
 
“Gawi told Wrightsman he and his
partner would do the project together and his partner had insurance. Gawi
showed insurance certificates to Wrightsman that listed [ADR] as the insured.
(Exhibit 6.).”  (AR 35, ¶ 9; see also AR
126-127, 695-96.) “The insurance certificates Gawi showed to Wrightsman were
obtained by [ADR] for other jobs, in some instances in other states. [Petitioner]
did not know how Gawi obtained those certificates.” (AR 38, ¶ 24.)
 
“Gawi contacted [Petitioner] and asked
him to get building permits, for the owner to use to get a building loan. [Petitioner]
asked to meet the owner, and a meeting was arranged at city hall on May 13,
2019.” (AR 36, ¶ 11; see also AR 130-132.) 
 
“Building permits were issued on May
13, 2019, for plumbing, electrical, mechanical, and general building. (Exhibit
7.) The permits list [ADR] as the contractor. [Petitioner] signed each of the
permits in three places, indicating [ADR] was licensed, had worker's
compensation insurance, and agreed to comply with ordinances and statutes
relating to building construction.” (AR 36, ¶ 12; see also 703-706.)  
 
At the administrative hearing,
Petitioner testified neither Wrightsman nor Gawi could have obtained the
permits because neither is a licensed contractor. (AR 358-59.) Petitioner
testified he “was officially the owner of the building permits.” (AR 828, 362.)
 
Significantly, however, Petitioner
also testified Gawi asked him to obtain the building permits “for a bank loan
as the owner was going to borrow the money to fund the project.” (AR 828, ¶
14.) Petitioner testified he agreed to obtain the permits for that purpose. (AR
828.) According to Petitioner, after the city issued the permits, Gawi told
Petitioner “ok we will call you when we get the financing.” (AR 829, ¶ 19.)
Petitioner attested: “That was the last time I spoke to Miss Wrightsman until
on or about July 13th. I spoke with [Gawi] a few times after that but he would
shift the conversation to his vacations and as I was in the same state of mind
it was summer and time to travel.” (AR 829, ¶ 21.) In its Decision, the Board
did make any finding regarding the credibility of these details in Petitioner’s
testimony. (See AR 38, ¶ 23.)  
 
Gawi Abandons the Project;
Wrightsman Files a Police Report and Complaint to the Board; and Petitioner Makes
Statements Concerning the Contract Terms
 
“Work commenced with demolition later
in May 2019. Some work was done on the foundation. Wrightsman paid a total of
$77,200 to Gawi. The last payment, in the amount of $40,000, was on June 12,
2019. No work was performed on the project after that date.” (AR 36, ¶ 16; see also
AR 144-145.)  
 
“According to city inspection cards
dated May 31 and June 11, 2019, corrections were needed to the work that had
been performed by Gawi on the project. (Exhibit 16.)”  (AR 37, ¶ 17; see AR 741-742 [Exhibit 16];
see also AR 55 [Board investigation report].)
 
While Gawi initially responded to
Wrightsman’s inquiries, and gave excuses about material supplier delays, by
July 2019 he completely ceased communicating with her. (AR 144-45.)  In July 2019, Wrightsman filed a police
report and a complaint with the Board. (AR 145-146; see also AR 50-68 [Board
investigation report].)
 
On August 21, 2019, Petitioner met
with Wrightsman at her home. Also in attendance were handyman Franco and
Randall Martinez, a building inspector Wrightsman had hired to assist with the
ADU project. (AR 149-152; see also AR 713, 718.) Among other things, the ADU
project, Wrightsman’s contract with Gawi, and Wrightman’s complaint to the Board
were discussed. (AR 149-152, 713-14, 718-719.) In its Decision, the Board did
not make any specific findings or conclusions based on Petitioner’s alleged
statements at the August 21, 2019 meeting. (See AR 37, ¶ 19.)[2]
 
Two days later, on August 23, 2019, Petitioner
and Wrightsman exchanged text messages. (AR 154-155, 722-723). Petitioner advised
he was meeting with a city inspector about the ADU project, and “the quickest
way for both of us is for me to finish the project as per the contract.” (AR 722.)
Petitioner also texted: “I’m sorry if I upset u. . . . This is very unexpected.
. . . Never had to deal with anything like this before.” (AR 722) When
Wrightsman texted Petitioner and explained “the project was supposed to be done
by August 22, 2109 [sic],” she was planning to move into the new ADU in
September 2019; and “this has to be addressed,” Petitioner responded: “that’s
not in the contract.” (AR 723.) 
 
Petitioner and Wrightsman exchanged
more text messages on August 28, 2019. (AR 158, 727-728). This exchange
addressed payments, invoices, and work done pursuant to the contract between
Wrightsman and Gawi. (AR 727-728.) In particular, Petitioner advised Wrightsman
she would owe $23,950 under the contract, which is the exact amount Wrightsman
had yet to pay TO2 Group pursuant to the contract she and Gawi had signed. (AR 728.)[3]

 
At the administrative hearing, Petitioner
testified he was referring to a “hypothetical contract” in his text messages
about “the contract” and, in such text messages, he was “investigating
[Wrightsman] and trying to get her to give [him] information that [he] could
use against her.”  (AR 373-75, 379-81.) The
Board found Petitioner’s testimony he was referring to a “hypothetical
contract” lacked credibility.[4]
(AR 37.)
 
On August 28, 2019, although
Petitioner texted Wrightsman to advise her that he would bring a project
foreman to the property the following week (AR 728), Petitioner never returned
to the property. After August 28, 2019, ADR did not work on the ADU project.
(AR 154, 160.) In September 2019, Wrightsman collected $15,000 on ADR’s
contractor’s bond. (AR 730-31, 753.)
 
The Citation; Administrative
Proceedings; and Writ Proceedings 
  

On June 25, 2020, after an
investigation, the Board issued the Citation against ADR. (AR 47-48.) The
Citation alleged ADR had aided and abetted an unlicensed person with the intent
to evade the Contractor’s License Law in violation of Business and Professions
Code section 7114, subdivision (a).[5]
(AR 47-48.) The Citation assessed a civil penalty of $2,000 as well as an order
of correction payable to Wrightsman in the amount of $62,200. (AR 47-48.)
 
Petitioner appealed the Citation. An
administrative law judge (ALJ) conducted the appeal hearing. In April 2021, the
ALJ issued a proposed decision to affirm the Citation as to the violation of
section 7114, subdivision (a) and the $2,000 civil penalty. The proposed decision
also affirmed an order of correction due to Wrightsman but reduced the amount to
$50,000.  (AR 33-44.) In the proposed decision,
the ALJ applied a preponderance of the evidence standard because “the issues
relate to imposition of fines and not license discipline such as revocation or
suspension.” (AR 40, ¶ 2.)
 
By an order dated June 7, 2021, the
Board adopted the ALJ’s proposed decision as its Decision. The Board set an
effective date of August 6, 2021 for the Decision. (AR 32.)
 
This proceeding ensued.[6]
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW 
                 
Petitioner seeks relief from the court pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5.
 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, subdivision (b), the issues for review
of an administrative decision are: whether the respondent has proceeded without
jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial, and whether there was a
prejudicial abuse of discretion.  An
abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the
manner required by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, or the
findings are not supported by the evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5, subd.
(b).)
 
Petitioner argues his failure to pay
the civil penalty ($2,000) and correction to Wrightsman ($50,000) within 30
days of the Decision’s effective date resulted in his license being suspended
by operation of law pursuant to section 7090.1, subdivision (a). (Opening Brief
6:15-19.)[7]  Petitioner suggests “because of that suspension, this Court may
independently review the evidence.” (Opening Brief 6:20-21.)  
 
“The courts must decide on a case-by-case
basis whether an administrative decision or class of decisions
substantially affects fundamental vested rights and thus requires independent judgment review.” (Bixby v.
Pierno (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 144.) “ ‘In determining whether the right is fundamental the courts do not
alone weigh the economic aspect of it, but the effect of it in human terms and
the importance of it to the individual in the life situation.’ ” (Benetatos v. City of Los Angeles (2015)
235 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1281.) Generally, “[a]dministrative decisions which result in restricting a
property owner’s return on his property, increasing the cost of doing business,
or reducing profits are considered impacts on economic interests, rather than
on fundamental vested rights.” (E.W.A.P.,
Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 310, 325.) “In contrast, the independent judgment
test is applied to review administrative decisions that will drive an owner out
of business or significantly injure the business's ability to function.”  (Benetatos
v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 235
Cal.App.4th at 1281.)
 
Petitioner’s argument
the Decision substantially affects a fundamental vested right is unpersuasive. “In a case such as this one, where the
only sanction imposed is a fine—not revocation, suspension, or restriction of
the petitioner's license—no fundamental vested right is implicated and the
trial court is not authorized to exercise independent judgment on the evidence.”
(Handyman Connection of Sacramento, Inc. v. Sands (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th
867, 880.)[8]
 
Further, the Decision itself imposed only financial penalties; the
Board’s action did not result in revocation, suspension or restriction of ADR’s
license. Even if the court were to judicially notice ADR’s suspended license
status under section 7090.1, Petitioner has not cited any evidence
demonstrating ADR’s license was suspended because of the amount of the Citation or the limited time
permitted to pay the Citation. Stated another way, Petitioner does not sufficiently
demonstrate “the fines and penalties imposed were so burdensome as to be
tantamount to a suspension or revocation of his license.” (Owen v. Sands (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 985, 992.)
 
Based on the foregoing, the court applies
the substantial evidence test to review the Board’s factual findings. Substantial
evidence is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate
to support a conclusion (California Youth
Authority v. State Personnel Board (2002) 104 Cal. App. 4th 575, 584-585),
or evidence of ponderable legal significance which is reasonable in nature,
credible and of solid value. (Mohilef v.
Janovici (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 267, 305 n. 28.) Under the substantial
evidence test, “Courts may reverse an [administrative] decision only if, based
on the evidence . . ., a reasonable person could not reach the conclusion
reached by the agency.” (Sierra Club v.
California Coastal Com. (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 602, 610.)   
 
“[A] trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings.” (Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal.
4th 805, 817.) Petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate, by citation
to the administrative record, that substantial evidence does not support the
administrative findings. (Strumsky v. San
Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. (1974) 11 Cal.3d 28, 32; Steele v. Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission (1958) 166
Cal.App.2d 129, 137.) 
 
“On questions of law arising in mandate
proceedings, [the court] exercise[s] independent judgment.” (Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15
Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.) The interpretation of statute or regulation is a
question of law.  (See State Farm Mutual
Automobile Ins. Co. v. Quackenbush (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65, 77.)  
 
ANALYSIS 
 
The Board Properly Applied the Preponderance of
the Evidence Standard
 
Petitioner contends the Board (through the ALJ) should have applied a
clear and convincing standard because “the citation involved a suspension when
Petitioner did not pay the $52,000 in the brief time permitted.” (Opening Brief
6:15-19.) The argument is unpersuasive.
 
To the extent Petitioner relies on his unsuccessful request for
judicial notice to prove his point, the argument is unsupported.
 
Further, at the agency level, “the
standard of proof to revoke a professional license is clear and convincing
evidence. . . .” (Lone Star Security
& Video, Inc. v. Bureau of Security and Investigative Services (2012)
209 Cal.App.4th 445, 454.) The Citation here merely imposed financial penalties
and did not suspend or revoke ADR’s license. “[B]ecause the citation hearing on
review could only result in civil penalties or correction orders, and could not
have resulted in orders suspending, limiting, or revoking [ADR’s] license, the
preponderance of the evidence rather than the clear and convincing evidence
standard of proof applied.” (Owen v. Sands, supra, 176 Cal.App.4th at 992.)
 
Petitioner concedes “the facts of the Owens [sic] case are
very close on many points.”  (Reply 3:10-11.)
Petitioner cites the following statement in Owen v. Sands to suggest an
“important distinction” (Reply 3:11): “Critically, Owen does not argue that the fines and penalties imposed
were so burdensome as to be tantamount to a suspension or revocation of his
license.” (Owen v. Sands, supra, 176 Cal.App.4th at 992.) Petitioner argues:
“In the instant case, the [Board] and ALJ imposed a very large payment
obligation that was due in a very short period of time. That lethal combination
was so burdensome that a license suspension was nearly guaranteed.” (Reply 3:15-17.)

Petitioner’s argument is unsupported by evidence. As discussed earlier, Petitioner has not cited any evidence suggesting
ADR’s license was suspended because of the amount of the Citation or the
time permitted to pay the Citation. Although the total dollar amount of the
Citation ($52,000) was not insignificant, the court cannot conclude, without
evidence of ADR’s financial circumstances, that paying the Citation within the
time permitted by the Citation and section 7090.1 would necessarily result in
suspension or revocation of its license. Petitioner has provided no factual
context for his claim $52,000 is so burdensome it is tantamount to a
suspension.
 
The licensee in Owen
v. Sands was required to pay a $2,000 penalty and a correction to the
homeowner in the amount of $7,880.79. (See Owen v. Sands, supra, 176
Cal.App.4th at 988-989.) While the amount of correction there was less
than here, the amount of the penalty was the same. The Court of Appeal decided Owen
v. Sands in 2009, suggesting the amount of correction and penalty could be considered
in context and adjusted (raised) to present-day dollars. Owen v. Sands did
not specify the size of a financial penalty necessary to justify application of
a clear and convincing standard. Given that Petitioner does not submit
evidence “the
fines and penalties imposed were so burdensome as to be tantamount to a
suspension or revocation of his license,” Owen v. Sands does not support
Petitioner’s position that a clear and convincing standard should have been
applied by the ALJ.[9] 
 
 
Based on the foregoing, Petitioner does not demonstrate
the Board improperly applied a preponderance
of the evidence standard of proof in the administrative proceedings.  
 
Review of the Board’s Findings and Decision 
 
              The
Elements of Aiding and Abetting Pursuant to Section 7114, Subdivision (a)
 
Section 7114, subdivision (a) provides: 
 
Aiding or abetting an unlicensed person to evade the
provisions of this chapter or combining or conspiring with an unlicensed
person, or allowing one's license to be used by an unlicensed person, or acting
as agent or partner or associate, or otherwise, of an unlicensed person with
the intent to evade the provisions of this chapter constitutes a cause for
disciplinary action.  
 
The Contractors’ State License Law (§
7000 et seq.) “is a regulatory statute. It seeks to protect the public
from incompetence and dishonesty in those who provide building and construction
services . . . .” (MW Erectors, Inc. v. Niederhauser Ornamental & Metal
Works Co., Inc. (2005) 36 Cal.4th 412, 436) “[W]hen the
Legislature’s intent is to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the
public rather than to serve punitive interests, that body additionally intends,
in order to protect the public, that the law be interpreted broadly so that
particular licensees not be able easily to evade the statute’s protective
purposes.” (Hughes v. Board
of Architectural Examiners (1998) 17 Cal.4th 763, 786.)
 
Petitioner argues
the court should interpret section 7114, subdivision (a) here consistently with
the law of aiding and abetting in civil and criminal cases. Notably, the Board
develops no argument to the contrary. Because section 7114, subdivision (a)
uses the specific legal term “aiding and abetting,” the court agrees with
Petitioner that case law discussing elements of aiding and abetting, both in
criminal and civil contexts, is instructive here.  
 
“In the civil
arena, an aider and abettor is called a cotortfeasor. . . . A defendant can
be held liable as a cotortfeasor on the basis of acting in concert only if he
or she knew that a tort had been, or was to be, committed, and acted with
the intent of facilitating the commission of that tort. ” (Gerard
v. Ross (1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 968, 983 [emphasis added].) Stated more
fully, “ ‘[l]iability
may . . . be imposed on one who aids and abets the commission of an intentional
tort if the person (a) knows the other's conduct constitutes a breach of duty
and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other to so act or (b)
gives substantial assistance to the other in accomplishing a tortious result
and the person’s own conduct, separately considered, constitutes a breach of
duty to the third person.’ ” (Casey v. U.S. Bank Nat. Assn. (2005) 127
Cal.App.4th 1138, 1144.)
 
Similarly, under
criminal law, “[a] person aids and abets the commission of a crime when he or
she: [¶] (1) With knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator,
and [¶] (2) With the intent or purpose of committing or encouraging or
facilitating the commission of the crime, and [¶] (3) By act or advice
aids, promotes, encourages or instigates the commission of the crime. . . . Mere
knowledge that a crime is being committed and the failure to prevent it does
not amount to aiding and abetting.” (Casella v. SouthWest Dealer Services,
Inc. (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1127, 1140-41 [emphasis added].) 
 
“While aiding and abetting may not
require a defendant to agree to join the wrongful conduct, it necessarily
requires a defendant to reach a conscious decision to participate in tortious
activity for the purpose of assisting another in performing a wrongful act.”
(American Master Lease LLC v. Idanta
Partners, Ltd (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th
1451, 1476 [emphasis added].)  
 
Sufficiency of the Board’s Findings 
 
Petitioner contends “[t]he ALJ never
expressly states what Mr. Oravecz did to purportedly satisfy [the substantial
assistance] element [of aiding and abetting], which may in and of itself be a
basis to remand, at a minimum.” (Opening Brief 8:11-23.)  
 
Petitioner raises an issue of whether the Board’s
findings in the Decision’s comply with Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v.
County of Los Angeles (1974) 11
Cal. 3d 506, 515 [Topanga]. In Topanga, the Supreme Court held
that “implicit in [Code of Civil Procedure] section 1094.5 is a requirement
that the agency which renders the challenged decision must set forth findings
to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or
order.” “Administrative agency findings are generally permitted considerable
latitude with regard to their precision, formality, and matters reasonably
implied therein.” (Southern Pacific
Transportation Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 938,
954.)  
 
As Petitioner
acknowledges, the Decision discusses Petitioner’s relevant acts and omissions,
including reviewing the plans with Gawi, obtaining the permits, and failing to
take action once work on the Project began. The Decision is reasonably
interpreted to find, at the least, that obtaining the ADU project permits and
then failing to take action once Gawi commenced unlicensed work substantially
assisted Gawi in evading the Contractor’s License Law. (See AR 40-42.) The
Decision also includes findings regarding Petitioner’s knowledge and intent. (AR
40-42.) The findings are sufficient for judicial review and therefore satisfy Topanga.   
 
Does
Substantial Evidence Support the Board’s Findings that ADR Substantially
Assisted an Unlicensed Person Evade the Provisions of the Contractor’s License
Law?
 
Gawi informed Petitioner of the ADU project in
April 2019, and Petitioner met with Gawi at that time to discuss the plans. (AR
828.) On May 2, 2019, not long after Petitioner met with Gawi, Gawi and
Wrightsman executed a contract that lists the contractor as TO2 Group dba ADR
Design. (AR 35, ¶ 8; AR 595.) Gawi represented to Wrightsman in the contract
and related documents that the ADU project would be built “according to code”
and would pass a “final inspection” before the final payment was due. (AR
595-604.)
 
On May 13, 2019, shortly after Gawi and
Wrightsman executed the contract, Petitioner met Gawi and Wrightsman at city
hall and obtained the building permits. (AR
36, ¶ 12; see also 703-706.) Petitioner “signed each of the permits in three
places, indicating [ADR] was licensed, had worker's compensation insurance, and
agreed to comply with ordinances and statutes relating to building
construction.” (AR 36, ¶ 12; see also 703-706.)  
 

Wrightsman testified that demolition worked
commenced a “couple days” after the permits were issued. (AR 134-136.) City
inspection cards dated May 31 and June 11, 2019 showed some of Gawi’s work on
the project required corrections.  (AR
741-742, 55; see also AR 37, ¶ 17.)   
 
Wrightsman made a payment of $40,000 to Gawi on
June 12, 2019, after the city issued the permits and after Gawi
commenced construction. (See AR 36, ¶ 16 and 693.)
 
A reasonable person could conclude
from this evidence that obtaining the building permits enabled Gawi, who was
unlicensed, to commence construction and obtain further payments from
Wrightsman under the contract.  
 
Petitioner argues “there is no basis
to impose a duty on [him] to check on a construction project he had not been
engaged to perform.” (Opening Brief 8:18-20.) Thus, Petitioner ignores his representations
on the permits that ADR was the licensed contractor responsible for the project.
(AR 703-706.) As ADR’s responsible managing officer, Petitioner was
“responsible for exercising supervision and control of [ADR’s] construction
operations to secure compliance with [the law] and the rules and regulations of
the board.” (§ 7068.1, subd. (a).)  
 
Petitioner next contends ADR “could
not be found to have aided or abetted an unlicensed contractor because the
unlicensed contractor had a fully executed construction contract prior to any
action on [Petitioner’s] part.” (Opening Brief 8:26-28.) Although Wrightsman
had signed the construction contract before Petitioner obtained the permits,
the construction work did not begin until the city issued the permits. Wrightsman
made a payment of $40,000 to Gawi on June 12, 2019, after the
permits were issued and after Gawi commenced construction. (See AR 36, ¶ 16 and
693.) Therefore, substantial evidence supports the Board’s finding that ADR’s
participation substantially assisted Gawi’s evasion of the Contractor’s License
Law after the contract was executed. Petitioner
cites no legal authority to support his assertion that aiding and abetting can
only occur before a contract is signed but not during the course of its  performance.[10]
 
Petitioner also contends substantial evidence
does not support the Board’s finding of causation because it is “speculative” whether the project would have
proceeded without Petitioner having obtained the permits. (Opening Brief 11:7.)
Gawi
represented to Wrightsman the project would be built “according to code” and
would pass a “final inspection” before the final payment was due. (AR 595-604.)
Within a “couple days” of permitting,
construction work on the permits started. (AR 134-136,
741-742, 55.) A reasonable person could
conclude from the evidence, including the timing of events, that obtaining the
permits “was a substantial factor in causing the harm suffered.” (American
Master Lease LLC v. Idanta Partners, Ltd, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at 1476.)
Petitioner’s arguments about what Gawi would have done had the permits not been
obtained are speculative.

Based on the foregoing, substantial evidence supports the Board’s findings that
ADR’s actions in obtaining the permits and not monitoring the construction of
the project after the permits were issued substantially assisted Gawi, an
unlicensed person, to evade the provisions of the Contractor’s License Law.
 
Did the Board Apply the Correct Standard of Intent
to Petitioner?  
 
Section 7114 sets forth required standard of
intent: “ . . . the intent to evade the provisions
of this chapter . . . .” That is, to violate section 7114, Petitioner must have
acted “with the intent to evade the provisions of” the law.    
 
Petitioner
contends the Board improperly applied a general intent standard, rather than a
specific intent standard, when concluding that ADR acted with intent to evade
the Contractor’s License Law. (Opening Brief 12:25-26.) The Board does not
squarely address the argument in its opposition brief.[11]
The court finds Petitioner’s argument persuasive—that is, when it imposed
liability on Petitioner, the Board misapplied the standard of intent required
to prove a violation of section 7114 and aiding and abetting. 
 
The Board concluded “Had [Petitioner] checked with the city, he could have
learned as early as May 31, 2019, that work was performed and that the work did not pass inspection. [Petitioner’s]
actions were sufficient evidence to establish [ADR’]s knowledge that Gawi was
using its license, and therefore establish [ADR’s] intent to evade the
provisions of the Contractor's License Law.” (AR 41, ¶ 4.) Relatedly, the Board
found that “[a]lthough Gawi and [Petitioner] spoke during the period when work
was being performed on the project, they did not speak about the work, as Gawi
redirected the discussions to the subject of vacation travel. After Wrightsman
complained, [Petitioner] claimed he first became aware of the project and the
problems.” (AR 41, ¶ 4; see also AR 38, ¶ 23.) The Board did not find
Petitioner actually learned Gawi performed work on the project after the
permits were issued or anytime before Wrightsman complained to him. Thus, it
appears the Board concluded Petitioner acted with the intent to evade the
Contractor’s License Law because he should have learned
construction work was performed, which implies a negligence (or perhaps
recklessness) standard.  
 
Other findings also show the Board misapplied
the standard of intent. Thus, when addressing ADR’s contention it did not
intend to violate the law, the Board concluded as follows: “Under totality of
the circumstances, the evidence summarized above indicates that such a belief
was not reasonable and could not have been held in good faith. . . . The intent
necessary to establish a violation is the intent to take the acts. (Brown v.
State Department of Health {1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 548, 554.) Here, [ADR] was
aware Gawi had plans for the project, and [ADR] intentionally obtained permits.
[ADR] then took no action to determine whether any construction activity was
undertaken using those permits.” (AR 41, ¶ 5 [emphasis added].)  
 
The emphasized sentence above indicates
the Board believed ADR should have taken action to determine whether
construction activity was undertaken pursuant to the permits, and ADR was
negligent in failing to do so. However, the Board did not find Petitioner specifically
knew, before Wrightsman complained, that Gawi had commenced construction or
that Petitioner specifically intended to assist Gawi in evading the
Contractor’s License Law when Petitioner failed to learn that construction
activity had commenced.  
 
In Brown v. State Department of Health (1978)
86 Cal.App.3d 548, 554, relied upon by the Board, the Court of Appeal
considered a statute that states “it is unprofessional conduct to ‘knowingly‘
make or sign a certificate which ‘falsely represents‘ a state of facts.” (Id. at 554.)  The Court held the statute did not require
specific intent to deceive, noting “California case law has long held that the
requirement of ‘knowingly’ is satisfied where the person involved has knowledge
of the facts, though not of the law.” (Ibid.)  
 
As discussed earlier, the Board has not disputed that the
elements of aiding and abetting from civil and criminal law inform on the proper
application of section 7114, subdivision (a), a statute expressly using the
phrase “aiding and abetting.” As summarized earlier, those civil authorities require
that the aider and abettor act “with the intent of facilitating the commission of that tort.” (Gerard v. Ross (1988) 204
Cal.App.3d 968, 983 [emphasis added].) The aider and abettor must “reach a conscious
decision to participate in tortious activity for the purpose of assisting
another in performing a wrongful act.” (American Master Lease LLC v. Idanta Partners, Ltd,
supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at 1476.) Brown v.
State Department of Health involved a
statute for which specific intent was not required; it does not inform on the interpretation
of section 7114, subdivision (a).   
 
In distinguishing a case cited by
Petitioner during the administrative proceeding, the Board stated: “In the
present matter, [ADR’s] acts were unlike the facts in Swickheimer,
because [Petitioner’s] and [ADR’s] acts indicated their knowledge of the
project. [ADR] cannot rely upon [Petitioner’s] failure to take the action a
reasonable contractor would have taken after obtaining permits that give
permission for construction of the project to begin, even if he believed the
permits were obtained for a different purpose.” (AR 42, ¶ 6 [bold
added].)  
 
While the meaning of the emphasized statement
is somewhat unclear, it appears the Board was referring to Petitioner’s
testimony that “Gawi contacted Oravecz and asked him to get building permits,
for the owner to use to get a building loan” and that Petitioner obtained the
permits for that purpose (i.e., to obtain a loan). (See AR 36, ¶ 11; see also
AR 828, ¶ 14.)  The Board did not find
Petitioner’s testimony regarding his purpose of obtaining the permits was false
or lacked credibility as it did with other testimony from him. Nor did the Board
reject Petitioner’s testimony that “Gawi said he would call [Petitioner] when
the financing was obtained” and that Petitioner believed Gawi statement the
permits would be used to obtain financing for the project. (See AR 36, ¶ 13 and
AR 829-830, ¶¶ 19-28.) Thus, in context, the Board’s findings and legal
conclusions show the Board applied a negligence or general intent standard, not
a specific intent standard, in assessing Petitioner’s liability under section
7114, subdivision (a). That is, the Board did not find Petitioner acted with the
specific intent to facilitate Gawi’s wrongful conduct when he obtained the
permits, failed to monitor the project, or took other actions related to the project.
 
The Board’s argues Gawi and Petitioner
referred to each other as “partners” and Gawi’s use of ADR’s insurance
certificates “supports the inference that Gawi and [Petitioner] worked together
as partners.” (Opposition 9:22-27.) The Board’s contends at city hall “Wrightsman
handed Gawi a check in front of [Petitioner].” (Opposition 10:12-13.) The Board
asserts Petitioner’s “statements that Gawi had paid him, and his multiple text
messages affirming the Wrightsman-Gawi contract terms support the inference
that Oravecz and Gawi had been working together.” (Opposition 11:2-4.) The Board
also argues, without citation to the record, that “two different witnesses
(Wrightsman and Franco) testified that Oravecz admitted that he was paid by
Gawi.” (Opposition 14:8-9.) The Board also reports Petitioner “represented to
the City of Torrance that construction on the ADU project would proceed without
a construction loan.” (Opening Brief 13:1-2.)
 
The Decision undermines the Board’s
argument before the court—it never made such findings. The Decision does
not include any findings that Petitioner and Gawi worked as partners (with
respect to the project or otherwise); that Petitioner authorized Gawi to use
ADR’s name on the contract or ADR’s insurance certificates; that Petitioner’s
statements about the contract supported any inference of a partnership with
Gawi or intent to assist Gawi in evading the Contractor’s License Law; that
Petitioner witnessed Wrightsman hand Gawi a check or admitted he was paid by
Gawi; or that Petitioner’s testimony about the purpose of obtaining the permits
(for the owner to obtain a loan) was false. Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1094.5, the court reviews the factual findings made by the Board, not
post hoc legal arguments made by the Board on judicial review. The court’s role
here is not to parse the record to find some theory to uphold the Board’s
decision. (See American Funeral Concepts v. Board of Funeral Directors &
Embalmers (1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 303, 311.)
 
Based on the foregoing, the court finds
the Board did not apply the correct standard of intent when it determined
Petitioner aided and abetted Gawi in evading the Contractor’s License Law in
violation of section 7114, subdivision (a). Accordingly, the matter must be
remanded to the Board to reconsider the Decision and apply the correct standard
of intent required by section 7114, subdivision (a).   
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The petition for writ of mandate is GRANTED IN
PART.  
 
The court will issue a writ directing the
Board to aside the Decision and reconsider the case in light of the court’s
opinion and judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5, subd. (b).) On remand, the  Board shall determine whether ADR acted with
the specific intent of assisting Gawi to evade the provisions of the
Contractor’s License Law. (See Gerard
v. Ross, supra, 204 Cal.App.3d at 983; American Master Lease LLC v. Idanta Partners, Ltd, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at 1476.)  
 
[Petitioner
must address how this court adopts and issues this order given his failure to provide
notice to Wrightsman.]
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
