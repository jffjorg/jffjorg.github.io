And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a tentative ruling in a case where Petitioner is appealing a 2022 decision. The Petitioner's application for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) benefits is in question. The Respondent claims the application was for PUA benefits, but the citation does not support this claim. The court is unsure how Petitioner could have applied for PUA benefits before the CARES Act was passed. The Employment Development Department (EDD) initially found Petitioner qualified for PUA benefits as of July 19, 2020, but this determination was contingent on additional certification. The court notes that the 2022 decision explains why the EDD is not bound by the initial determination. The judge is unclear whether Petitioner is challenging a decision that is not yet final.
