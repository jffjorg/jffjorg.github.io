[1] At times, where facts are not disputed, the court quotes
findings made in the administrative decision. (See AR 33-44 [administrative
decision].)  


[2] Accordingly, the court need not consider Petitioner’s
contention his statements at the meeting were a “settlement offer (that should
have been ruled inadmissible).” (Reply 1:23.)


[3] Specifically, $90,950, the total contract price as
modified by Wrightsman and Gawi in June 2019 (AR 686-687), minus the $67,000
already paid by Wrightsman pursuant to the contract.  (See AR 689-693 [checks payable to TO2 Group
totaling $77,200]; AR 38-39, ¶ 25 [$8,100 permit fee reimbursement and $2,100
survey fee reimbursement were not part of the contract].)  


[4] The Decision does not specify the facts the Board
relied upon to reach its credibility conclusion.


[5] All undesignated statutory references are to this
code.
 


[6] In this proceeding, the court has considered
Petitioner’s revised opening brief filed November 21, 2023, Respondent’s
opposition brief filed October 2, 2023, the reply brief filed October 13, 2023.
The court has also considered the Bates-stamped administrative record lodged
with the court after the November 1, 2023 hearing. Although the court has
considered the claims made in Petitioner’s first amended petition (FAP), the
court has not considered the exhibits to the FAP or the original petition to be part of the administrative
record. As with his request for judicial notice, Petitioner has not moved to
augment the administrative record with any documents from the FAP or petition.
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5, subd. (e).)

Section 7090.1, subdivision (a) states: “Notwithstanding any other provisions
of law, the failure to pay a civil penalty, or to comply with an order of
correction or an order to pay a specified sum to an injured party in lieu of
correction once the order has become final, shall result in the automatic
suspension of a license by operation of law 30 days after noncompliance with
the terms of the order.”
 


[8] As discussed earlier, the court did not receive the
evidence proffered by Petitioner through his request for judicial notice.


[9] While not briefed by the parties, the court also
questions whether Petitioner raised any argument about the standard of proof in
the administrative proceedings (i.e., exhausted the issue) or submitted any
evidence before the ALJ suggesting the amount of the fines and penalties “were so burdensome as to be tantamount to
a suspension or revocation of his license.”


[10] Based on this same reasoning, the court rejects
Petitioner’s contention the Board was required to find Petitioner’s conduct
“caused Ms. Wrightsman to contract with Mr. Gawi.” (Opening Brief 10:10-17.)  


[11] While not dispositive, the Board’s
failure to address the point suggests Petitioner’s argument is meritorious. (Sehulster
Tunnels/Pre-Con v. Traylor Brothers, Inc. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1328, 1345, fn. 16 [failure to address point is
“equivalent to a concession”].)
