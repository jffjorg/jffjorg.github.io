Case Number: 22STCV33196 
Hearing Date: January 24, 2024 
 
[Tentative]       ORDER
GRANTING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF ATTACHMENT 
 
 
Plaintiff, Access Road Capital, LLC, moves for a
writ of attachment against Defendant, Jonathan M. Kramer, in the amount of $8,000,000.
 
Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections to Defendant’s
declaration are overruled.
 
APPLICABLE LAW 
 
“Upon the filing of the complaint or at
any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply pursuant to this article for a
right to attach order and a writ of attachment by filing an application for the
order and writ with the court in which the action is brought.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 484.010.)
 
The court
shall issue a right to attach order if the court finds all
of
the following: 
 
(1)   The claim
upon which the attachment is based is one upon which an attachment may be
issued. 
(2)   The
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim upon which the
attachment is based. 
(3)   The
attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim
upon which the attachment is based. 
(4)   The amount
to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero.  
 
(Id. at
§ 484.090.) 
 
“A claim has ‘probable validity’
where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment
against the defendant on that claim.” (Id. at § 481.190.) “In contested 
applications, the
court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective
parties and make a determination of¿the probable outcome of the litigation.”¿(Hobbs
v. Weiss (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 76, 80.) 

 
“The application
shall be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the facts
presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.”¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 484.030.) Code of Civil Procedure
section 482.040 states in pertinent part: “The facts stated in each affidavit filed pursuant to this
title shall be set forth with particularity. Except where matters are
specifically permitted by this title to be shown by information and belief,
each affidavit shall show affirmatively that the affiant, if sworn as a
witness, can testify competently to the facts stated therein. As to matters
shown by information and belief, the affidavit shall state the facts on which
the affiant's belief is based, showing the nature of his information and the
reliability of his informant. The affiant may be any person, whether or not a
party to the action, who has knowledge of the facts.”  
 
“The Attachment Law statutes are subject
to strict construction.” (Epstein v. Abrams (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1168.)  
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Probable Validity of Plaintiff’s Claim
 
The application is based on Plaintiff’s cause
of action for breach of a guaranty agreement (the Guaranty). To establish a
claim for breach of contract, a plaintiff must prove: (1) existence of a
contract; (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance; (3)
defendant’s breach of the contract; and (4) damages incurred by plaintiff resulting
from the breach. (Durell v. Sharp
Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1367.)  
 
In support of the application, Plaintiff
submits a declaration of Idan Shani, Plaintiff’s Chief Operating Officer. Shani
declares he has “personal knowledge of the facts set forth in th[e] declaration
based upon [his] personal experience and knowledge and [his] review and
knowledge of business records, documents, materials and files pertaining to [Plaintiff’s]
operations.” (Shani Decl. ¶ 1.)  
 
Shani also submits the following evidence
to support the probable validity of Plaintiff’s claim: 
 
On or about March 26, 2020, Plaintiff and
Rive Gauche Television and Aftershock Comics, LLC (Borrowers) executed a Credit
and Security Agreement under which Plaintiff agreed to provide Borrowers a
four-year non-revolving loan in the principal amount of $11,090,000, secured by
a lien on Borrowers’ personal property. (Id. ¶ Exh. 1.) Borrowers also executed
a promissory note in favor of Plaintiff in the face amount of $11,090,000. (Id.
¶ 3, Exh. 2.) Borrowers used the proceeds of the loan to retire an existing
loan to Rive Gauche Television made by East West Bank. In consideration for
Rive Gauche Television satisfying the East West Bank loan, East West Bank
agreed to dismiss a lawsuit it had filed against Rive Gauche Television and to assign
to Plaintiff certain collateral it had received to secure the loan. (Id.
¶ 4.)
 
On or about March 23, 2020, Defendant
executed the Guaranty of up to $8 million of the obligations arising from the loan
to Borrowers under the Credit and Security Agreement. The Guaranty is not
secured. (Id. ¶ 6, Exh. 4.) The Guaranty states Plaintiff “[o]n the date
on which any payment is due and payable by the Borrower under the Financing
Documents, Lender, in its sole discretion, may proceed directly against the
Guarantor to exercise any right or remedy that Lender may have under this
Guaranty without pursuing or exhausting any other right or remedy that Lender
may have against the Borrower.” (Id. ¶ 8, Exh. 4.)  
 
On or about October 15, 2021, Plaintiff
and Borrowers entered into an amendment to the Credit and Security Agreement
under which Plaintiff agreed to make additional loans in an amount equal to 85
percent of the receivables payable to Rive Gauche Television pursuant to
specified license agreements in an amount not to exceed $2,392,000. (Id.
¶ 5, Exh. 3.)
 
Shani attests: 
 
Borrowers have defaulted under the Loan Documents and are in breach of
those agreements by virtue of, among other things, having failed to pay
principal and interest when due (“Event of Default”). As of January 26, 2023,
there is unpaid principal and interest owing of not less than $15,964,182.00 .
. . . Plaintiff notified Borrowers and [Defendant] by letter of the Events of
Default on May 5, 2022. A true and correct copy of the notice of default is
attached hereto as Exhibit 5. Despite being notified, Borrowers and [Defendant]
failed to cure the Events of Defaults. (Id. ¶¶ 13-14, Exh. 5.)  
 
Borrowers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
relief on December 19, 2023. (See Notice of Filing filed May 4, 2023.)
Plaintiff represents the bankruptcy matter is still pending. (Appl. ¶ 4.)[1]  
 
The foregoing evidence, if not rebutted,
supports all elements of Plaintiff’s claim for breach of the Guaranty against
Defendant in the amount of $8 million, specifically: (1) the existence of the
Credit and Security Agreement and Guaranty; (2) Plaintiff’s performance of the
agreements; (3) Defendant’s breach of the Guaranty for failure to pay the full
amount due after Borrowers’ event of default; and (4) Plaintiff’s damages in
the amount of $8 million.  
 
Defendant contends the evidence “lacks
the particularity necessary to satisfy due process requirements” and Code of
Civil Procedure section 482.040. Specifically, Defendant contends Shani’s
declaration is deficient because “[t]he amount that was actually lent is not
stated” and “[n]o calculation showing how the amount owing came to exceed the
maximum amount that could be lent by more than $2 million is provided.” (Opposition
3:13-14, 16-18.)  The argument is unpersuasive.  
 
Shani described, with particularity, how
Borrowers executed the Credit and Security Agreement and Plaintiff executed the
Guaranty; how Plaintiff performed, as evidenced by the promissory note in the
face amount of $11,090,000 and Borrowers’ use of the loan proceeds to retire
the East West Bank loan; and the event of default triggering a total balance
due of $15,964,182 (including accrued interest). (Shani Decl. ¶¶ 2-15.) Shani’s
declaration is corroborated by Exhibit 5, which is a demand letter to Borrowers
and Defendant, dated May 5, 2022, advising an event of default occurred under
the Credit and Security Agreement, including failure to make a $1,428,436 principal
and interest payment on March 28, 2022. The demand letter also states, pursuant
to section 9.2(b) of the Credit and Security Agreement,[2] the entire balance of the
note (then $13,715,613.82) became due and payable, and that default and regular
interest had accrued (increasing the balance to $14,077,674.14 as of May 5,
2022) and that such interest continued to accrue on a per diem basis in the
amount of $12,899.70. (Id. Exh. 5.)
 
Such evidence is sufficiently detailed to
satisfy Code of Civil Procedure section 482.040.
 
Randone v. Appellate Department (1971) 5 Cal. 3d 536, cited by
Defendant, is inapposite. The case concerned the constitutionality of a prior
attachment statute under which attachment could be granted without prior notice
or hearing. Here, in contrast, Defendant has received notice and opportunity to
respond to Plaintiff’s evidence. The court also notes Plaintiff’s attachment
application has been pending for almost an entire year and repeatedly continued
at the request of both parties.
 
Notably, Defendant does not rebut the evidence
submitted by Plaintiff. Defendant does not submit any evidence disputing the
event of default by Borrowers or the total amount due, including interest,
after acceleration of the loan pursuant to section 9.2(b) of the Credit and
Security Agreement. The court also notes Defendant’s obligation under the
Guaranty is limited to $8 million, substantially less than the amount of loan
funds extended to Borrowers and the $15,964,182 balance due with interest.
Defendant submits no evidence to suggest that the total amount due on the
Credit and Security Agreement by Borrowers, who are in bankruptcy, is less than
$8 million.  
 
Except for an issue regarding the
valuation of Borrowers’ collateral (discussed below), Defendant does not raise
any other argument to dispute the probable validity of Plaintiff’s claim.  
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff has
shown a probably valid claim against Defendant in the amount of $8
million.  
 
Basis
of Attachment 
 
“[A]n attachment may be issued only in an
action on a claim or claims for money, each of which is based upon a contract,
express or implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or
readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred dollars ($500)
exclusive of costs, interest, and attorney's fees.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 483.010,
subd. (a).) “An attachment may not be issued on a claim which is secured by any
interest in real property arising from agreement . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 483.010,
subd. (b).) “[A]n attachment
will lie upon a cause of action for damages for a breach of contract where the
damages are readily ascertainable by reference to the contract and the basis of
the computation of damages appears to be reasonable and definite.” (CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc. (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 541.)
 
“If the
action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a claim which arises out of the conduct by the defendant of a
trade, business, or profession. (Code Civ. Proc., § 483.010, subd. (c); see Advance
Transformer Co. v. Superior Court (1974) 44 Cal.App.3d 127, 143-144.)  
 
Here, Plaintiff’s application for a writ
of attachment is based on an agreement where the total amount allegedly due exceeds
$500. The Guaranty is not secured by real property. Plaintiff’s damages are
fixed and readily ascertainable from the terms of the Guaranty and Plaintiff’s
declaration and exhibits. The evidence shows Defendant executed the Guaranty as
part of his trade, business, or profession. (See Shani Decl. ¶ 14 and Exh. 1-3
[evidence showing Defendant is the President of Rive Gauche Television and the
Managing Member of Aftershock Comics, LLC].) 

 
Purpose and Amount of Attachment 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 484.090
states the court shall issue a right to attach order if “the attachment is not
sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the
attachment is based . . . [and] the amount to be secured by the attachment is
greater than zero.”
 
Plaintiff declares, and the court finds,
the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on
Plaintiff’s contract claim. (Appl. ¶ 4.) The amount to be secured is greater
than zero.
 
Reduction of Amount to be Secured by Attachment 
 
Defendant argues “repayment of the
underlying obligation is secured by (1) an assigned pledge of shares of Rive
Gauche that Kramer holds through the Kramer Living Trust and also 
(2) a pledge of Kramer’s membership
interest in AfterShock.” (Opposition 3:22-25.) Defendant “has concluded, based
on his discussions with numerous prospective investors, that the assets have a
value in excess of $10 million.” (Opposition 5:8-10 [citing Kramer Decl. ¶ 4].)
 
Although the court admits paragraph 4 of
Defendant’s declaration into evidence, the court agrees with Plaintiff—in the
context of the Borrowers’ pending bankruptcy—such evidence is insufficient to
prove the pledged assets have the value of $10 million or any other specific
value. (See Reply 4:16-19.) Defendant fails to discuss the bankruptcy
proceedings in his valuation of the pledged assets, and he fails to provide
sufficient evidence that a $10 million valuation of his partial interest is
reasonable in light of the pending bankruptcy. (See Kramer Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.)
 
Moreover, regardless of the value of the
pledged assets, Defendant fails to respond to Plaintiff’s argument and cited
authorities as to the effect of the waivers included in the Guaranty. (See
Appl. 5-6; Sehulster Tunnels/Pre-Con v.
Traylor Brothers, Inc. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1328, 1345, fn. 16 [failure
to address point is “equivalent to a concession”].)  
 
Specifically, “[a] guaranty is a separate
and independent obligation from that of the principal debt.” (United Central
Bank v. Superior Court (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 212, 215.) “Case law holds
that a writ of attachment may issue on a guaranty, regardless of whether the
principal loan is secured, so long as the guarantor has waived the right to
require the creditor to proceed first against the security given for the
primary obligation.” (Ibid.) “[W]here [the] guarantor waives rights arising from
existence of security given by debtor, guarantor's obligation is unsecured and
creditor can obtain attachment order against guarantor.” (Ibid. See also
Bank of America, N.A. v. Stonehaven Manor, LLC (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 719, 723.)  
 
Here, the Guaranty states Guarantor
“waives any right to require Lender to: (a) proceed against any person,
including Borrower, (b) proceed against or exhaust any collateral held from the
Borrower or any other person; (c) pursue any other remedy in Lender’s power; or
(d) make any presentments, demands for performance, or give any notices of
nonperformance, protests, notices of protests or notices of dishonor in
connection with any obligations or evidences of the payments under the Loan
guaranteed hereunder.” (Shani Decl. ¶ 10 and Exh. 4.)
 
Based on the authorities cited above and
the waiver provision in the Guaranty, Plaintiff has a probably valid claim it
is not required to exhaust any collateral held by Borrowers before obtaining a
writ of attachment against Defendant. Accordingly, Defendant does not show the
attachment should be reduced by an attachable claim for offset or an
affirmative defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 483.015, subd. (b).)
 
Subject Property
 
Plaintiff
requests attachment against Defendant, a natural person, of items listed in Code
of Civil Procedure section 487.010, subdivisions (c) and (d). Specifically,
Plaintiff seeks to attach Defendant’s residence located at 470 25th Street in Santa
Monica (the Residence). (Appl. ¶ 9c.) That request is proper. (See Bank of
America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc. (1989) 207 Cal. App. 3d 260, 267-268
[“all-inclusive” application satisfies Code of Civil Procedure section 484.020,
subd. (e)].)  
 
Exemptions 
 
Defendant has filed a claim of exemption
for the Residence. Defendant contends the homestead exemption in Code of Civil
Procedure sections 704.710 and 487.025, subdivision (b) apply and reduces the
amount of attachment against the Residence to $1,122,692. (Claim of Exemption ¶
4.c (5); Opposition 5:19-6:9; Kramer Decl. ¶¶ 5-9.)  
 
“If a defendant filing a notice of
opposition desires to make any claim of exemption as provided in Section
484.070, the defendant may include that claim in the notice of opposition filed
pursuant to this section.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 484.060, subd. (b).) A claim of
exemption must describe the property to be exempted and specify the statute
section supporting the claim. (Id. at § 484.070, subd. (c).) “The claim
of exemption shall be accompanied by an affidavit supporting any factual issues
raised by the claim and points and authorities supporting any legal issues
raised.” (Id. at § 484.070, subd. (d).)
 
“If the plaintiff desires to oppose the
claim of exemption, the plaintiff shall file and serve on the defendant, not
less than two days before the date set for the hearing, a notice of opposition
to the claim of exemption, accompanied by an affidavit supporting any factual
issues raised and points and authorities supporting any legal issues raised. If
the plaintiff does not file and serve a notice of opposition as provided in
this subdivision, no writ of attachment shall be issued as to the property
claimed to be exempt.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 484.070, subd. (f) [emphasis added].)
As noted earlier, “[t]he Attachment Law statutes are subject to strict construction.”
(Epstein v. Abrams, supra, 57 Cal.App.4th at 1168.) 
 
Here, consistent with Code of Civil
Procedure sections 484.060 and 484.070, Defendant filed an opposition and
claimed a specific statutory exemption for the Residence. Plaintiff did not
timely file a notice of opposition to the claim of exemption as required by Code
of Civil Procedure section 484.070, subdivision (f).[3] 
 
Accordingly, the claim of exemption is
granted. Specifically, the writ of attachment on the Residence is limited to
the surplus over $3,477,308 ($1,833,000 plus $923,000 plus $671,308.)  Defendant submits undisputed evidence that
the current market value of the residence is $4.6 million. (Kramer Decl. ¶
7.)  Thus, the writ of attachment on the
residence is limited to $1,122,692
($4,600,000 minus $3,477,308.)
 
It is somewhat unclear from the
application whether Plaintiff seeks a writ of attachment only against the
Residence or against all of Defendant’s property subject to attachment,
including the Residence. (Appl. ¶ 9.c.) Plaintiff’s counsel should clarify at the hearing.
Any attachment against the Residence is limited to $1,122,692 based on Defendant’s claim of exemption.
 
Undertaking 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 489.210
requires the plaintiff to file an undertaking before a writ of attachment is
issued. Code of Civil Procedure section 489.220 provides, with exceptions, for
an undertaking in the amount of $10,000. The court concludes that the statutory
undertaking of $10,000 is appropriate.  
 
///
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The
application for writ of attachment is GRANTED in the amount of $8 million.  Defendant’s claim of exemption is also
GRANTED in the amount of the homestead exemption specified in Defendant’s
opposition ($3,477,308).  
 
It appears from the application Plaintiff
seeks a writ of attachment only against the Residence. (Appl. ¶ 9.c.)
Accordingly, based on the current value of the Residence, the writ of
attachment is limited to $1,122,692.
 
Alternatively, if
Plaintiff seeks attachment against all of Defendant’s property subject to
attachment, then the writ of attachment against the Residence is limited to $1,122,692. The writ of attachment against Defendant’s remaining
property subject to attachment is granted in the amount of $8 million.  
 
Plaintiff to post an
undertaking of $10,000.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
