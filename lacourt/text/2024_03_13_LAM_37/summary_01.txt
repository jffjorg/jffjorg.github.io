And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages from the plaintiff's complaint with leave to amend. The plaintiff is given 30 days to amend his complaint to cure the defects that were identified by the court. The case management conference is taken off calendar and the defendants are ordered to give notice. The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to show that the defendants acted with malice, fraud, or oppression, which is required to support a claim for punitive damages under Civil Code section 3294. The court also found that the plaintiff failed to provide facts to show that the defendant's representative, Simcha Bornstein, acted with malice, fraud, or oppression, and that the plaintiff's allegations were insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages against the defendants.
