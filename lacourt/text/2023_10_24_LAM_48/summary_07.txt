And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to quash service of summons and complaint filed by Defendant Seizmic, Inc. The motion was filed in response to the Plaintiff's attempt to amend the complaint to name Sal Fateen as Doe 1. The Judge ruled that the Plaintiff did not comply with the statutory requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 474, which requires that a summons served on a newly named Doe defendant include a notice stating that the person is being sued under a fictitious name. The Judge found that the summons served on Defendant Fateen did not comply with this requirement and therefore granted the motion to quash service of summons and complaint.
