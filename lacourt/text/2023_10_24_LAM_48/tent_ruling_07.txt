[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO QUASH
  SERVICE OF SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 24, 2023



 
On June 14, 2022, Plaintiff Timothy
Philips filed this action against Defendant Seizmic, Inc.  Plaintiff has since filed a first amended complaint
(“FAC”) and a second amended complaint (“SAC”). 
On June 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed an Amendment to Complaint (Fictitious/Incorrect
Name), naming Sal Fateen as Doe 1.
On
July 27, 2023, Fateen filed a motion to quash service of summons and complaint.
A.        Plaintiff Properly Named Fateen Under
Section 474.
Code
of Civil Procedure section 474 permits a plaintiff who is ignorant of the name of
a defendant to name a Doe in a complaint, and “when his true name is discovered,
the pleading or proceeding must be amended accordingly.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 474.)  To do so, the plaintiff must have actually been
ignorant of the defendant’s identity when he or she filed the complaint.  (Optical Surplus, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1991) 228 Cal. App. 3d 776, 783-782.)  “Ignorance
of the true name of the defendant should not be feigned.”  (Scherer v. Mark (1976) 64 Cal. App. 3d
834, 840.)  “[T]he trial court is vested with
broad discretion when presented with a motion for leave to file an amended pleading
and may consider such factors as whether the proffered pleading states facts which
could have been pleaded earlier, and whether a party has established a reasonable
excuse for the delay.”  (A.N. v. County
of Los Angeles (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1058, 1067.)  Courts should liberally grant leave to amend where
no prejudice is shown.  (Atkinson v. Elk
Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.)
Fateen
argues that Plaintiff did not comply with section 474 because he was not ignorant
of Fateen’s identity and relationship.  (Motion
at p. 4.)  Fateen notes that Plaintiff previously
included allegations about him being in the room when Plaintiff made his safety
violations complaint.  (Complaint ¶ 27; FAC
¶ 24; SAC ¶ 24.)
“Code
of Civil Procedure section 474 states that it applies when ‘the plaintiff is ignorant
of the name of a defendant.’  That phrase
has not been interpreted literally.  Even
though a plaintiff knows the true name of a person he is still ‘ignorant of his
name’ if he lacks knowledge of facts giving him a cause of action against that person.”  (Breceda v. Gamsby (1968) 267 Cal.App.2d
167, 174.)  “The distinction between a suspicion
that some cause could exist and a factual basis to believe a cause exists is critical
in the operation of section 474.  The former
is one reason attorneys include general charging allegations against fictitiously
named defendants; the latter requires substitution of the defendant’s true name.  [The defendant’s] present urging that its ostensible
liability was always obvious to plaintiff confuses these two standards of knowledge
and is based upon hindsight.”  (Dieckmann
v. Superior Court (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 345, 363.)
As
Plaintiff asserts, his “retaliation claim arises out of the termination that resulted
from his complaints, not the mere communication of the complaints themselves.”  (Opposition at p. 5.)  On February 13, 2023, Defendant Seizmic responded
to Plaintiff’s interrogatories.  (Mah Decl.
¶ 3.)  In response to Special Interrogatory
31, which asked Seizmic to “IDENTIFY the person(s) most knowledgeable at SEIZMIC
about TERMINATION of PLAINTIFF’S employment with YOU,” Seizmic stated “Sal Fateen.”  (Mah Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5 & Ex. B.)  There is nothing to suggest that Plaintiff knew
of Fateen’s involvement in his termination before the interrogatory responses.
Because
Fateen has not shown an improper amendment under section 474 and has not shown prejudice,
the motion is denied on this ground.
B.        The Service of Summons is Defective.
Fateen
argues that the summons did not include the required information.  A summons served on a newly named Doe defendant
must include a notice stating in substance: “To the person served: You are hereby
served in the within action (or proceedings) as (or on behalf of) the person sued
under the fictitious name of (designating it).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 474.)
On
January 28, 2023, Fateen’s counsel received a summons with the SAC and a Form LASC
LACIV 105 Amendment to Complaint.  (Green
Decl. ¶ 3.)  At the bottom of the summons,
no box is checked following “NOTICE TO THE PERSON SERVED: You are served.”  (Green Decl., Ex. 1.)  Because the summons did not indicate that Fateen
was being sued under the fictitious name of Doe 1, it does not comply with section
474.
Plaintiff
acknowledges that “boxes on the summons were inadvertently left unchecked,” but
he argues that “[o]nly substantial—and not perfect—compliance is necessary.”  (Opposition at pp. 6-7.)  Plaintiff’s cited authority does not support his
argument in the context of section 474 and facts similar to this case.  Bein v. Brechtel-Jochim Group, Inc. (1992)
6 Cal.App.4th 1387 considered whether substituted service under section 415.20 was
effective service under the circumstances. 
The court in Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th
1426, 1436-1439, found no substantial compliance with sections 415.40 or 416.10.  In Cory v. Crocker National Bank (1981)
123 Cal.App.3d 665, 669, the “fundamental issue on appeal [was] whether the summons
served upon respondent was valid and in compliance with section 412.30.”
A
finding of substantial compliance requires three things: (1) some degree of compliance
with the offended statutory requirements; (2) a high probability that the objective
nature and circumstances of the attempted service imparted the same notice as full
compliance; and (3) actual sufficient notice to put the defendant on his defense.  (Carol Gilbert, Inc. v. Haller (2009) 179
Cal.App.4th 852, 865-866 (Carol Gilbert, Inc.).)
Here,
there was no compliance with the statutory requirements of section 474.  The complete failure to indicate on the summons
that Fateen was being sued under a fictitious name forecloses a finding of substantial
compliance.  (See MJS Enterprises, Inc.
v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 555, 558 [a “complete failure to comply”
with statutory requirements is not substantial compliance]; Mannesmann DeMag,
Ltd. v. Superior Court (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 1118, 1123 [“not a case of substantial
compliance but one of no compliance at all”].) 
Service of a copy of the amendment identifying Fateen as Doe 1 is not a substitute
for statutory compliance.  (Carol Gilbert,
Inc., supra, 179 Cal.App.4th at p. 859.)
The
motion is granted on this ground.
C.        Conclusion
The
motion to quash is GRANTED due to defective service of summons.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
