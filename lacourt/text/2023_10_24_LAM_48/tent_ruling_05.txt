[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE
  ORDER 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 24, 2023



 
On May 25, 2023, Defendants Walmart Inc.
and Wal-mart.com Inc. filed, on behalf of themselves and Plaintiff Consumer Advocacy
Group Inc., a Stipulation and Protective Order – Confidential Designation Only.  On May 30, 2023, the Court issued a Notice of
Rejection of Electronic Filing, which stated, “The Court directs the requesting
party to file a noticed motion to address the entitlement of a protective order
as outlined in the stipulation.”
On
September 25, 2023, Defendants filed a motion for entry of proposed protective order.  All parties agree to the protective order.  (See Stanton Decl. ¶¶ 5, 9 & Ex. H.)  The protective order is necessary to protect Defendant’s
confidential or sensitive business, commercial, and financial information that are
implicated in Plaintiff’s discovery requests. 
(Motion at p. 6.)  The protective order
“largely mirrors the model Los Angeles Superior Court Los Angeles Superior Court
Stipulated Confidentiality Order Form and is tailored to the present litigation.”  (Id. at p. 5.)
The
motion for protective order is GRANTED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 24th day of October 2023
