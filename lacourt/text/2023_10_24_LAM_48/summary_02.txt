And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the unopposed motion of Scott E. Gizer, counsel for the defendants JewnJabi Inc., Michael Farah, and Mandeep Kaur Saggi, to be relieved as counsel. The motion is granted on the condition that counsel provides the defendants' current or last known phone numbers at the hearing. The Judge notes that the relationship between the counsel and the defendants has broken down, and the counsel has failed to pay his fees. The case was previously dismissed due to a settlement, and no prejudice is shown. The Judge also orders that JewnJabi Inc. must retain new counsel before making any further appearances.
