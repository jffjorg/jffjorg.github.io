  CASE NO.: 20STCV38399
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 24, 2023



 
Scott
E. Gizer, counsel of record for Defendants JewnJabi Inc., Michael Farah, and Mandeep
Kaur Saggi, seeks to be relieved as counsel. 
Counsel’s declaration states that the relationship has broken down and it
is unreasonably difficult for him to carry out his representation effectively.  There has also been an irreconcilable breakdown
in the attorney-client relationship and Defendants have failed to pay counsel’s
fees.  No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motions
comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  This case was dismissed pursuant to a settlement,
and no prejudice is shown.
The
proposed orders do not include Defendants’ current or last known phone numbers.  Counsel must provide this information at the hearing.
Subject
to the provision of Defendants’ phone numbers, the unopposed motions to be relieved
are GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of service showing service of the
signed Form MC-053 orders and this order on JewnJabi Inc., Michael Farah, Mandeep
Kaur Saggi, and all parties who have appeared.
“[A]
corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  JewnJabi Inc. must retain new counsel before any
further appearances.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
