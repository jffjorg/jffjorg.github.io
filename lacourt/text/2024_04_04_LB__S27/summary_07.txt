And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling is in response to the demurrer filed by the defendants, David L. Grimmett and Catalina Island Vacation Rentals, Inc., to the third cause of action for strict liability in the complaint filed by plaintiff Natalie Harris. The defendants contend that plaintiff has failed to allege facts showing that the defendants distributed, manufactured, or sold the stool on which plaintiff was sitting when she was injured. The plaintiff cites Fakhoury v. Magner (1972) for strict liability and argues that the defendants are strictly liable for injuries sustained when a tenant is injured on the furnishings. The court rules in favor of the plaintiff and overrules the demurrer, ordering the defendants to file an answer to the complaint within ten days.
