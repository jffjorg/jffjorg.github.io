 Case Number:  22STCV07659    Hearing Date:   April 4, 2024    Dept:  S27 Adam Dolce, attorney for Aligda
Cortez, et al., filed these motions to be relieved as counsel and related
papers on 3/04/24.  Each of the motions
includes a notice of motion, declaration, proposed order, and proof of
service.  The declarations indicate
working with the clients would be a hardship, but fail to provide any
additional details.  The declarations are
devoid of required information, including upcoming hearing and trial dates, and
are unsigned.      
 
Additionally, the proof of service
documents are entirely blank, containing no information at all.  
 
Because the declarations and proofs
of service are incomplete and unsigned, the motions are denied.
 
Counsel is ordered to give
notice.  
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the
tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed
off calendar.  If a party submits on
the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify
the party submitting on the tentative. If any party does not submit on the
tentative, the party should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing
on this matter.
