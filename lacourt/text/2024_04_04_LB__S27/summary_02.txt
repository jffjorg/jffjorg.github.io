And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by SEJ Properties, L.P. (SEJ) against 1801-1899 Willow, LLC (Willow) and others. Willow has cross-complained against SEJ, alleging fraud, intentional misrepresentation, and breach of contract. The judge notes that the parties have not met and conferred as required by California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 430.41, and orders them to do so forthwith.

The judge provides guidance to the parties on the issues to be discussed in the meet and confer process, including whether Willow has alleged any facts showing SEJ made an actionable misrepresentation to Willow, and whether SEJ did anything to deny Willow the benefits of the agreement.

The judge sets a continued hearing on the demurrer for June 11, 2024, and orders the parties to file briefs (no more than five pages) on any outstanding issues and declarations re: their meet and confer efforts at least two weeks prior to the continued hearing date. The judge also reminds the parties that there is a Case Management Conference scheduled concurrently with the hearing on the demurrer.
