And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the plaintiff filed a motion to compel the defendant to produce a permanent medical qualification (PMQ) and certain documents. The defendant argued that the motion was moot and should not have been filed, as they had previously offered dates for PMQ depositions. The plaintiff replied that the motion was not moot because the defendant had continued to fail to produce the PMQ and documents. The court has continued the hearing to April 18, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department S27. The parties are strongly encouraged to meet and confer to resolve all outstanding issues regarding depositions and document production. If they are unable to resolve their dispute, they must file briefs and declarations by April 12, 2024.
