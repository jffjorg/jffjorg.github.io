And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court's tentative ruling is a proposed decision on a motion to enforce a settlement agreement. The parties entered into a settlement agreement, where the defendant would pay the plaintiff $305,000 in exchange for the plaintiff's quitclaim title to the subject property. Despite the defendant making all payments, the plaintiff has failed to quitclaim title. The defendant seeks an order enforcing the settlement and requiring the court to sign the quitclaim deed on behalf of the plaintiff. The Court notes that CCP ยง664.6 permits the court to reduce the parties' settlement to a legal judgment when one party is in breach of the settlement. However, the Court declines to "act as excelsior" and sign the quitclaim deed, citing a lack of specific authority permitting such action. The Court will process a proposed judgment reflecting the terms of the settlement if submitted by the defendant. If the plaintiff continues to fail to comply with the settlement, the defendant may pursue remedies for violation of the judgment.
