[Tentative] Order Denying
Petition for Writ of Mandate
  
            
INTRODUCTION 
 
Petitioner Joel W. Hay, Ph.D.
(“Petitioner”), who is approximately 72 years old, was a tenured professor at
the University of Southern California (“USC”) who was terminated after making numerous
racist and abusive comments to students and colleagues.  For example, Petitioner mocked a female South
Asian student’s disability and sent her text messages stating: 
 
·       “I have come to the conclusion that Indians are the most
fucked up mentally of anybody on the planet and they must also do a lot of
fucking because there’s so many of them. 
They need birth control a hell of a lot more than the Chinese.”
 
·       “I have no clue why you wanted a kid you’re too fucked up.”
 
·       “Fuck you 2 bitch.”
 
·       “As Winston
Churchill said, in the morning I’ll Be [sic] sober, and you will still be
fucking ugly!”  
 
(Administrative Record (“AR”)
3.)  On one occasion, Petitioner wrote: “Why
are Justin Brooks Ruben Gutman and Steven Fox all from the cancel culture and
all Jewish?”  (AR 29.)  Petitioner referred to someone as having a “nice
nazi name.”  (AR 3.)  Petitioner repeatedly said or wrote “fuck you
all” and “fuck off” to colleagues.  (Ibid.)  Petitioner left a voicemail for a student
saying, “Fuck you asshole.  Piece of
shit.”  (AR 27.)  These are just a sampling of Petitioner’s
comments.   
 
Petitioner does not dispute that he
made any of these comments, most of which were in writing.  Nor does Petitioner dispute that he violated
an order not to contact USC students, faculty, and staff while the
investigation was ongoing, which led to a charge of retaliation.  Instead, Petitioner argues that USC deprived
him of due process; USC abused its discretion in terminating him; and the
disciplinary proceedings stemmed from his views on COVID-19, which were
protected by tenure.  The petition is
denied.   
 


 
BACKGROUND 
 
A.        USC Policies Against
Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation 
 
            Petitioner
was a tenured professor in USC’s Department of Pharmaceutical Economics and
Policy.  (AR 1294-96.)  As a faculty member, Petitioner was subject to
USC’s Faculty Handbook and Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment, and
Retaliation (“DHR Policy”). (AR 62-88, 205, 208- 209.)  The DHR Policy “applies to all … faculty” and
states that “[a]ny individual found responsible for engaging in Prohibited
Conduct in violation of this Policy will face disciplinary sanctions up to and
including … termination from employment.” 
(AR 65.)
 
            As
relevant to the charges made against Petitioner, the DHR Policy defines
“Harassment,” “Retaliation,” and “Violation of a University Directive” as
follows: 
 
·      
“Hostile Environment Harassment:
Harassment occurs when verbal, physical, written, electronic, or other conduct
based on an individual's Protected Characteristics is sufficiently severe,
persistent, or pervasive that it unreasonably interferes with, limits, or
denies that individual's ability to participate in or benefit from the
University's educational program or activity, … when viewed from both a
subjective and objective perspective.” 
(AR 71-72.)
 
·      
“Retaliation: Retaliation
means any adverse action, intimidation, threat, coercion, or discrimination
against an individual taken for the purpose of interfering with any right or
privilege secured by this Policy or federal, state, or local laws or
ordinances, and their implementing regulations (e.g., protesting, making a
report), or because the individual has made a report or Formal Complaint of
Prohibited Conduct….”  (AR 76-77.)
 
·      
“Violation
of a University Directive: Any individual may be found in violation for
failure to comply with a University directive regarding a restrictive
supportive measure ( e.g., violating the terms of an Avoidance of Contact
Directive).”  (AR 77.)
 
The
DHR Policy states that USC “is equally committed to maintaining academic
freedom, as declared in Section 3-b(l)(a) of the Faculty Handbook, and free
speech, consistent with Federal and state law” and that “allegations of
harassment involving elements of speech that arise in the educational context
will be considered in keeping with the University's commitment to academic
freedom and free speech.”  (AR 66.)
 
B.        USC Receives Reports that
Petitioner Violated the DHR Policy 
 
            Between
November 2019 and May 2021, USC’s Office of Equity, Equal Opportunity, and
Title IX (“EEO-TIX”) received multiple reports that Petitioner violated the DHR
Policy.  These reports include, but are
not limited to, the following:
 
·      
In or around November 2019, a
graduate student in the School of Pharmacy, identified as “Student 11,”
reported to USC that Petitioner had sent her abusive emails in response to her
requests for advice on a research paper. 
According to the report, Petitioner emailed Student 11, “Have you ever
had a High School English teacher grade your writing? Do you want me to get my
Mom to help you? She’s a retired HS English teacher. I don't have time to fix
high school writing.”  The report states
that Student 11 “received
education through high school abroad and speaks English as a second
language.”  (AR 818-820.)  
 
·      
In
December 2019, a female Indian student identified as “Student 1” reported that
Petitioner was “overworking students” and threatening her with
retaliation.  (AR 463.)  In or about January 2021, Student 1 submitted
to USC copies of text messages from Petitioner that read: “When are you going
to become interested in being honest with me? And explaining to me why you
totally freaked out and mentally?;” “I have come to the conclusion that Indians
are the most fucked up mentally of anybody on the planet and they must also do
a lot of fucking because there’s so many of them;” “They need birth control a
hell of a lot more than the Chinese;” “I have no clue why you wanted a kid
you’re too fucked up;” “Fuck you 2 bitch;” and “As Winston Churchill said, in
the morning I’ll Be [sic] sober, and you will still be fucking ugly!”  (AR 3, 461-467.)  
 
·      
In
September 2020, an anonymous alumnus of USC reported that Petitioner posted the
following on LinkedIn: “56% of Vietnamese rats have C19 [Covid 19], no
Vietnamese deaths, explain? The Vietnamese love to eat rats! They lick and rub
them all over their faces and mouths! ZERO DEATHS!”  (AR 795-98.) 

 
·      
In or about May 2021, it was reported to
USC that Petitioner wrote the following, among other things, in an email
exchange with other USC faculty members regarding the Covid-19 pandemic: “Every
fucking one of you is too stupid??? You do realize that you’re on the hook to
explain this fucking mess. And none of you can do so? Not even the genius Dana
Goldman?” and “Why are Justin Brooks Ruben Gutman [sic] and Steven Fox all from
the cancel culture and all Jewish?”
(AR 583-585.)
 
C.        USC
Conducts an Investigation of Petitioner’s Conduct 
 
On May 13, 2021,
USC placed Petitioner on paid administrative leave.  (AR 273.) Respondents later determined that
Petitioner violated the terms of his administrative leave by contacting
students about a final exam and calling and texting a USC colleague.  (See Opposition (“Oppo.”) 12:2-19, citing
record; see also AR 37-40.)
 
On May 19, 2021,
the Vice President of EEO-TIX issued a Formal Complaint against Petitioner on
behalf the individuals who submitted reports.  (AR 94, 275-278.)  EEO-TIX issued Petitioner a Notice of
Investigation listing the allegations that were to be investigated, and
appointed Respondent David Reyes (“Investigator Reyes”) to conduct the
investigation. (AR 279-284.)  
 
On several
occasions, USC instructed Petitioner that he should notify EEO-TIX (i) “if [he
was] an individual with a disability and need[ed] a reasonable accommodation;”
and/or (ii) if he needed “assistance with access to supportive measures.”  (See AR 281-283, 314, 312, 300-302.)  Petitioner never informed Investigator Reyes
of any disability or need for reasonable accommodation.  (AR 1073-1074.)
 
Investigator Reyes
interviewed Petitioner twice, with his attorney present, on July 20, 2021, and
October 7, 2021.  (AR 317-319,
2737-40.)  During his interviews,
Petitioner admitted to, among other things, making the LinkedIn post and the
emails to other faculty members regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.  (AR 317-319.) 
Petitioner did not recall sending the text messages to Student 1 quoted
above.  (Ibid.)  With respect to Student 11’s report,
Petitioner admitted that the “general theme” of what was stated in the Notice
of Investigation was correct, but he did not know if the “verbiage” was as
stated.  (Ibid.)  
 
Investigator Reyes
also interviewed multiple witnesses, including the student that made the formal
complaint against Petitioner (“Reporting Party”), Student 1, several other
students, and several USC faculty members or other “colleagues.”  (AR 6-7.) 
Among other things, these witnesses reported the following in their
interviews:
 
·      
Reporting Party told Investigator
Reyes that Petitioner asked if Reporting Party believed the New York travel ban
was constitutional. When Reporting Party said he was unsure, Petitioner began
“five minutes of impassioned yelling” at Reporting Party.  Petitioner yelled “so forcefully that he was
“yelling himself hoarse” and “was losing his voice while he was yelling.” (AR
35, 398-399.)  When asked by Investigator
Reyes, Petitioner did not recall the conversation. (AR 337.)
 
·      
Student 4 told Investigator Reyes
that he became concerned that Petitioner had hit his grandson and felt
obligated to call the police on June 11, 2021. (AR 26, 724-730.) According to Student
4, he received later that day an email from Petitioner with the subject line,
“Hey [Student 4] are you piece of shit [sic] don’t call cops” and a body of:
“Last Time I ever talk to you piece of shit.” Petitioner copied ten people on
the email, including four of Student 4’s classmates. (AR 715; 724-726, 728,
730.)
 
D.        EEO-TIX Issues an
Avoidance-of-Contact Directive 
 
On June 17, 2021, EEO-TIX issued an avoidance-of-contact
directive (“AOC Directive”) to Petitioner. (AR 40, 285-289.) The AOC Directive
instructed Petitioner “not to approach, attempt to speak to, or otherwise have
contact with University students, faculty, and staff” including “through third
parties or through electronic means, including but not limited to email, text,
or social media.” The AOC Directive stated that “failure to follow this
directive could result in further University action, including disciplinary
measures, for failure to follow a University directive or as prohibited
retaliation.”  (AR 40, 285-287.)
 
EEO-TIX received reports that Petitioner violated the AOC Directive,
including, but not limited to, the following: 
·      
Petitioner reportedly left Student 4
a voicemail on August 17, 2021 stating in part: “Fuck you asshole. Piece of
shit.” (AR 27, 744.)  At his interview,
Petitioner did not recall having made the call or left the voicemail.  Petitioner speculated that “maybe [he] had
too much to drink.”  (AR 27, 337.)
 
·      
On
October 13, 2021, Petitioner sent an email to USC faculty, students, and alumni
with subject line “Fwd: Federal Indictment Of Mark Ridley-Thomas Rocks LA City
Council And Scand…” (AR 338.)  That same
date, Petitioner sent two emails to USC faculty, students, and alumni with
subject line “USC Sucks.” (AR 339.) He also sent two emails to faculty and
students, including Reporting Party, with subject line: “Seriously????” The
first email stated, “I have to put up with this bullshit while you are dealing
with federal indictments????? Seriously???? You fucking piece of shit.”  (AR 340.)
 
E.         EEO-TIX Amends the
Notice of Investigation to Include Alleged Retaliation 
 
On October 13, 2021, Petitioner sent four emails to
Reporting Party and other students, which stated the following: “Maybe you
should ask fuckhead [Reporting Party] tell you what’s going on.” “What a
fucking back stabbers he [sic].” “Let’s see if USC supports him with all my
shit!” “BecausIf [sic] they don’t he’s a pile of shit and he’s gonna have zero
dollars the rest is fucking life.” (AR 43-44, 411-412.)  Petitioner sent these emails days after his
October 7, 2021, interview with Investigator Reyes at which Petitioner was
asked about the alleged call with Reporting Party involving the New York
pandemic travel ban. (AR 43, 337, 411-412.) 
 
On October 22, 2021, Reporting Party filed a formal
complaint of retaliation against Petitioner. (AR 290-291.)  EEO-TIX issued an Amended Notice of
Investigation to Petitioner on November 1, 2021, adding retaliation as a basis
for the investigation. (AR 297-303.) 
 
On November 1, 2021, Investigator Reyes asked Petitioner
whether he would like to meet to address the new allegations in the Amended
Notice of Investigation.  (AR 342.)  Investigator Reyes noted that “the new
allegations are based on documentary evidence, i.e., email
communications.”  (Ibid.)  Petitioner declined
to be interviewed about these emails.  On
November 4, 2021, Petitioner wrote to Investigator Reyes: “I don’t feel the
need to meet. That evening I was drunk and I sent some emails to the wrong
addresses.” (AR 341-342.)
 
On May 6, 2022, Petitioner also emailed the following to USC
faculty who were notified about Reporting Party’s upcoming dissertation
defense: “NOT ACCEPTABLE!!!!! His thesis is a total fucking fraud. I will
complain to Pres. Biden!!!!!” (AR 44-45, 2862-2863.)  This May 2022 email was considered by
Investigator Reyes in the investigation findings related to the charge of
retaliation against Reporting Party.  (AR
44-45.)
 
F.         Petitioner Reviews and
Responds to the Investigation Evidence 
 
On November 11, 2021, EEO-TIX invited Petitioner and his
attorney/advisor to review the evidence gathered during the investigation
(“Evidence Review”). (AR 7, 2819.)  At
Petitioner’s request, EEO-TIX extended the Evidence Review period to December
2, 2021. (AR 7, 2819.)
 
On December 2, 2021, Petitioner submitted a written response
to Evidence Review.  (AR 2840.)  Petitioner identified approximately 60
“exculpatory witnesses” to “testify to [his] credentials, behavior, and value
[he] brings to the University and [his] area of specialty.”  (AR 2838-2839.)  Investigator Reyes exercised his discretion
not to contact these individuals.  (AR 5,
2857.)  
 
G.        EEO-TIX Concludes that Petitioner
Violated the DHR Policy; and USC Denies Petitioner’s Appeals of the
Investigation Findings 
 
On June 2, 2022, EEO-TIX completed its investigation and
concluded there was sufficient evidence that Petitioner had violated the DHR
Policy, and that Petitioner was responsible for: (i) harassment based on race,
national origin, ethnicity, religion, disability; (ii) harassment based on
non-protected classifications, (iii) retaliation against Reporting Party, and
(iv) multiple violations of university directives. (AR 1-54.)
 
On July 6, 2022, Petitioner appealed EEO-TIX’s findings on
the ground that EEO-TIX failed to interview all the witnesses he identified and
failed to keep him apprised of the process. 
(AR
832, 834.)  On July 20, 2022, Elizabeth
Graddy (the Provost’s delegate) denied Petitioner’s appeal.  (AR 3180-3182.)
 
H.        USC Initiates Dismissal
Proceedings
 
On June 24, 2022, the Sanctioning Panel, comprised of tenured
faculty members, issued a written letter unanimously recommending that USC
initiate dismissal proceedings against Petitioner. (AR 828-830.)  Petitioner received the Sanctioning Panel’s
“Written Notice of Outcome” on June 29, 2022. (AR 3077.)  On July 6, 2022, Petitioner responded to the
Notice of Outcome on the same grounds as his appeal of the EEO-TIX
findings.  (AR 3141-42.)  EEO-TIX determined that Petitioner’s
response did not constitute an appeal within the terms of USC’s policies.  (AR 3141.) 

 
On July 8, 2022,
the Sanctioning Panel’s recommendation was sent to University Provost Charles
Zukoski. (AR 111, 3144-3147.)  Provost
Zukowski agreed that dismissal proceedings should commence.  On August 12, 2022, the Provost sent
Petitioner a Statement of Charges listing, in detail, the conduct being
considered as the basis for his termination.  (AR 845-849.) 
The charges included instances of harassment, retaliation, and failure
to follow university directives based on the communications summarized above,
among others.  The charges also included
alleged interactions between Petitioner and faculty members dating to
2015.  However, the charges did not
include Petitioner’s post on LinkedIn about the Covid-19 pandemic in Vietnam,
summarized above and in the parties’ writ briefs.  (See Ibid.)  
 
I.          Grievance Hearing and
President Folt’s Final Decision 
 
The dismissal
hearing was held on January 27, 2023, before a three-member Faculty Grievance
Panel (the “panel”).  (AR 882-883.)  USC called four witnesses: Professors Vassili
Papadopolous, William Padula, and Geoffrey Joyce, and Investigator Reyes.  (See AR 885.) 
Petitioner had the opportunity to cross-examine those witnesses.  (Ibid.)  Petitioner also called three witnesses and
testified in his own defense.  (AR 886.)  The panel also considered extensive
documentary evidence, including the investigation report, statements of the
parties, and evidence presented by Petitioner. 
(AR 2638.)  
 
At the dismissal
hearing, Petitioner did not deny he engaged in the conduct alleged in the
Statement of Charges.  Nor did Petitioner
take full responsibility for his misconduct. 
As an example, Petitioner did not deny sending inappropriate text
messages to Student 1 (e.g., “Indians are the most fucked up mentally of
anybody on the planet and they must also do a lot of fucking because there’s so
many of them;” “fuck you 2 bitch”).  When
asked why he sent the text messages, Petitioner testified: “I think I was
angry. I think I was frustrated.  I think
she had let me down, just along with everybody else at the University of
Southern California.  And so I was upset.”  (AR 1156.) 
He also attributed the text messages to alcohol, stating: “[i]f I was
not drunk, I never would have said those thing[s] to her or anyone.” (AR1156.)
 
As another
example, with respect to a voicemail to Student 4 (“fuck you asshole. Piece of
shit”), Petitioner testified that he regretted leaving the voicemail,
explaining, “I was under the influence of alcohol.”  (AR 1162-63.)  Petitioner also explained that “[Student 4]
was another backstabber.”  (AR 1162-63;
see also AR 744 [recording of the voicemail].)
 
On February 1,
2023, after reviewing all the materials submitted by Petitioner and USC, the panel
issued a written decision unanimously recommending that President Folt dismiss
Petitioner from the University. (AR 2638-2639.) 
Petitioner provided a post-hearing statement to President Folt on
February 16, 2023.  (AR 1246-55.)  
 
J.         The Termination Decision
 
On June 16, 2023,
President Folt issued a detailed, nine-page letter explaining her decision to
accept the recommendation of the panel and to dismiss Petitioner from the USC
faculty and from his employment with USC. 
(AR 4533-41; see also AR 243 [“All grievance panel decisions are
recommendations to the President of the University.”])  President Folt determined that “the
investigation process and the hearing were fair,” that “clear and convincing
evidence” established that Petitioner violated USC policies, and none of
Petitioner’s “arguments provide a defense, nor a substantial basis for
mitigation.” (AR4541.) President Folt agreed that Petitioner’s “pattern of
language toward students and faculty was aggressive, profane, disrespectful and
offensive” and Petitioner “created an abusive and hostile education and
learning environment and failed to uphold the most basic standards for our
faculty.” (AR4541.)  Notably, President
Folt found that “[e]ach of the bullet points in the Provost’s letter and each
of these policy violations provides independent and adequate grounds for your
dismissal.”  (Ibid.)  
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1094.5(b), the pertinent issues are whether the
respondent has proceeded without jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial,
and whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.  An abuse of discretion is established if the
agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not
supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the
evidence.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(b).)
 
Petitioner
contends that he has a fundamental vested right in his employment with USC, a
private university, and the court is therefore required to apply the
independent judgment test to any administrative findings challenged in this
writ action.  (See Opening Brief (“OB”)
9-10.)  The court need not decide this
issue.  Petitioner has not advanced any
argument that USC’s decision is not supported by its findings, or that the
findings are not supported by the evidence. 
Further, even if he had advanced such argument, the court would reach
the same result on the writ petition regardless of whether the independent
judgment test or the substantial evidence test applies to the court’s review of
the administrative findings.  
 
Petitioner is
correct that the independent judgment test applies to legal questions raised by
the petition, including about the fairness of the administrative process used
by USC.  “On questions of law arising in
mandate proceedings, [the court] exercise[s] independent judgment.’”  (Christensen
v. Lightbourne (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.)  The interpretation of statute or regulation
is a question of law.  (See State Farm
Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Quackenbush (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65, 77.)  “A challenge
to the procedural fairness of the administrative hearing is reviewed de novo on
appeal because the ultimate determination of procedural fairness amounts to a
question of law.”  (Nasha L.L.C. v. City of Los Angeles (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 470,
482.)  
 
Petitioner bears
the burden of proof and persuasion under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5.  (See e.g. Strumsky v. San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. (1974) 11
Cal.3d 28, 32; Steele v. Los Angeles County Civil
Service Commission (1958) 166 Cal. App. 2d 129, 137; Elizabeth D. v. Zolin (1993) 21
Cal.App.4th 347, 354.) A reviewing court “will not act as counsel
for either party to an appeal and will not assume the task of initiating and
prosecuting a search of the record for any purpose of discovering errors not
pointed out in the briefs.” (Fox v.
Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742.) 

 
DISCUSSION 
 
            A.        Petitioner Received Due Process and a
Fair Trial 
 
Petitioner
contends that Respondents “failed to ensure promised basic due process
safeguards: USC denied him the ability to cross-examine witnesses, curtailed
his ability to testify, and staffed his dismissal hearing with inexperienced
and biased faculty.”  (Opening Brief
(“OB”) 1:16-18.)  Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1094.5(b), the pertinent issues include whether there was a
fair trial. 
“Generally, a fair procedure requires ‘notice reasonably calculated to
apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action ... and an opportunity
to present their objections.’”  (Doe v. University of Southern California
(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 221,
240.)  “‘The common law requirement of a
fair procedure does not compel formal proceedings with all the
embellishments of a court trial ... nor adherence to a single mode of process.
It may be satisfied by any one of a variety of procedures which afford a fair
opportunity for [the respondent] to present his position....’”  (Goodstein v. Cedars-Sinai Med. Ctr.
(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1257, 1265-66.)  Due
process principles, as applied to administrative proceedings, are similar.  (Gross v. Lopez (1975) 419 U.S. 565.)  
 
Procedural errors,
“even if proved, are subject to a harmless error analysis.”  (Hinrichs
v. County of Orange (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 921, 928; see Doe
v. Regents of University of California (2021) 70 Cal. App. 5th 521, 539– 40
[rejecting a fair procedure claim where the petitioner did not show
prejudice].)  
 
1.         Petitioner received notice and a reasonable
opportunity to respond 
 
In this case, Petitioner received notice of the charges.  (See
AR 846-849.)  Petitioner also had the opportunity to respond to the evidence against
him at two interviews with Investigator Reyes. 
(AR
5, 317-319, 334-337.)  Investigator Reyes
offered Petitioner a third interview to discuss the allegations of retaliation
in the Amended Notice of Investigation, but Petitioner declined.  (AR 341-342.) 
Petitioner had the opportunity to provide exculpatory evidence and to
identify witnesses during the fact-gathering stage of investigation.  (AR 5-7, 317-319, 334-337, 341-342.)  Following the fact-gathering stage of the
investigation, Petitioner and his counsel participated in the “Evidence
Review,” and Petitioner submitted a written response to the evidence against
him.  (AR 2837-2846.)
 
After Investigator
Reyes issued the investigation report, Petitioner had the opportunity to appeal
the investigation findings to the Provost. 
(AR 832-834.)  After the
Sanctioning Panel recommended that USC initiate dismissal proceedings,
Petitioner received a formal Statement of Charges outlining the specific
“abusive messages” and “statements,” instances in which Petitioner failed to
comply with university directives, and alleged acts of retaliation.  (AR 846-849.) 
At the live hearing before the panel, Petitioner had an opportunity to
cross-examine USC’s witnesses; to present his own witnesses and testimony; to
present documentary evidence, including a declaration of his treating
psychiatrist (AR 2628); and to present pre- and post-hearing statements.  (See AR 942-1168, 858-869, 2638-39.)  
 
            As shown by the
investigation report, the Statement of Charges, the panel’s recommended
decision, and President Folt’s final decision, the charges and findings against
Petitioner were based almost entirely on Petitioner’s own emails, text messages,
voicemails, telephonic, or in-person communications.  (See 846-849, 4533-41.)  In his interviews, correspondence with
Investigator Reyes, and at the administrative hearing, Petitioner admitted to
making many of the communications or claimed that he did not recall making them
because he was “drunk.”  (See e.g. AR 341-342, 1156-58, 1160-63.)  Petitioner has not shown, with record
citation, that he ever disputed the authenticity of the emails, text messages,
and other recorded messages upon which the charges were based.
 
                        2.         Limiting the hearing to one-day did not
deprive Petitioner of due process
 
Petitioner
contends that he was denied a fair process because the panel limited the
hearing to one day.  (OB 14-15.)  The court disagrees.  As an initial matter, tribunals may set
reasonable time limits on proceedings:
 
Some litigants are
of the mistaken opinion that when they are assigned to a court for trial they
have camping rights. . . . This view is not only contrary to law but undermines
a trial judge’s obligation to be protective of the court’s time and resources
as well as the time and interests of . . . other litigants waiting in line to
have their cases [tried]. 
 
(California
Crane School, Inc. v. National Com. For Certification of Crane Operators
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 12, 20.)  The
one-day time limit is generally sufficient for “most hearings” at USC.  (See AR 3282-83 [Rule 32].)    
 
            In this case, Petitioner does not
identify any evidence that he was unable to present at the hearing.  (See OB 15:1-23, citing record.)  To the contrary, Petitioner had sufficient
time to present his defense.  Petitioner
acknowledges that nine witnesses testified during the hearing.  (See OB 15:1.)  The transcript demonstrates that Petitioner
called five witnesses, including himself, and USC called the remaining four
witnesses.  (See AR 885-886.)  Petitioner does not identify any witness he
was unable to call.  The record shows
that Petitioner gave a lengthy statement to the Grievance Panel, both at the
hearing and in writing.  (See AR 1128-1168,
878-879, 2638-39.)  Petitioner also
submitted a written statement that was considered by President Folt.  (See AR 4534.)  Petitioner argues that the panel “cut short”
his testimony, and that there was no time for closing arguments, but he does
not identify any information he was unable to provide during his testimony or
in his post-trial submissions.  
 
Regardless,
Petitioner forfeited this issue by not making a formal request for additional
time.  Chairperson Apostolos explained
that she wanted the hearing to be concluded in one day because if they
continued to another day, it may be necessary to convene a new panel and “start
over,” and she wished to timely complete the process. (AR 903-904, 1065-1066.)[1]  After this explanation, Petitioner’s counsel
stated: “Great. I'm not criticizing your timing either way. I'm just trying to
understand the process you expect to take.” 
(AR 1066.)  Although Petitioner’s
counsel objected to the limitation of just one day at the start of the hearing
(AR 904), he did not make a formal motion at the end of the hearing to continue
for a second day or to convene a new panel. 
(See AR 1066-67.)  Petitioner’s
counsel also did not make an offer of proof of the additional testimony he
would have elicited at a second hearing. 
(See AR 4540.)
 
Finally,
even if the time limit constituted a procedural error and Petitioner preserved
this issue for review, the court finds that the error was harmless.  Petitioner does not demonstrate that the
outcome would have been different had he received a longer hearing.  (See Doe v. Regents of University of
California (2021) 70 Cal. App. 5th 521, 539– 40 [rejecting a fair procedure
claim where the petitioner did not show prejudice].)
 
3.         The investigator was not required to
interview every witness 
 
Petitioner
contends that “USC overlooked … due process safeguards [when] [i]t refused to
interview any of his identified witnesses during the investigation.”  (OB 11.) 
Pursuant to the applicable
Resolution Process, Investigator Reyes “ha[d] the discretion to determine which
of those potential witnesses, or other persons, [identified by the respondent]
may have relevant information about the alleged conduct.”  (AR 107.) 
Investigator Reyes exercised his discretion not to contact the 60
“exculpatory witnesses” proposed by Petitioner. 
(AR 5, 2857.) 
 
Petitioner does not demonstrate that this was an abuse of
discretion.  In his request, Petitioner
indicated that the 60 witnesses would “testify to [his] credentials, behavior,
and value [he] brings to the University and [his] area of specialty.” (AR
2838-2839.)  Petitioner’s credentials and
academic value to USC were not in dispute. 
Although Petitioner stated that the witnesses would testify to his
“behavior,” he did not represent that any of the witnesses had observed the
“acts in question” or could provide “contextual information” about such
acts.  (Ibid.)  Further, there was no prejudice to
Petitioner; he could have called any of these witnesses at the administrative
hearing.      
 
                        4.         There is no evidence two members of the
panel were biased
 
Petitioner
contends two members of the panel—Chairperson Margo Apostolos and Professor Devin
Griffiths—were biased against him because: (1) “the committee chair, Prof.
Apostolos, used first names multiple times to communicate with USC’s counsel”;
(2) “she interrupted counsel various times expressing opinions against Dr. Hay
and supporting USC”; and (3) Professor Griffiths “exhibited a similar tone in
USC’s favor” and asked leading questions during the hearing.  (OB 15-16.) 

 
“Absent
a financial interest, adjudicators are presumed impartial.”  (Today’s Fresh Start, Inc. v. Los Angeles
County Office of Education (2013) 57 Cal.4th 197, 219.)  “Bias and prejudice are never implied and
must be established by clear averments.” 
(Burrell v. City of Los Angeles (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 568,
581-582.)  Petitioner must show “‘an
unacceptable probability of actual bias on the part of those who have actual
decisionmaking power over their claims.’” 
(Nasha LLC v. City of Los Angeles (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 470,
483.)  
 
Although
Chairperson Apostolos sometimes referred to Respondent’s counsel by his first
name, she also sometimes referred to Petitioner’s attorney and other hearing
participants by their first names.  (See
AR 909, 941-942 [referring to court reporter “Catherine”], 1067:4 [referring to
Petitioner’s counsel as “Bret”].)  There
is no evidence that the Chairperson had a relationship with Respondent’s
counsel that required disclosure or disqualification.  Mere informality does not establish bias by
“clear averments.”  
 
The
procedural rules for the panel authorize faculty members on the panel to ask
questions and also authorize the chairperson to rule on the relevance of
evidence or arguments. (AR 3282 [Rules 31(f) and 32.)  Petitioner does not show that Chairperson
Apostolos’ rulings on the relevance of certain topics, or the questions asked
by Professor Griffiths, exceeded the scope of such authority or reflect an
unacceptable risk of actual bias.  (See
AR 968-970, 973-975, 1037-38.) 
Commenting on the proceedings or evidence does not constitute bias.  “Expressions of opinion uttered by a judge,
in what he conceived to be a discharge of his official duties, are not evidence
of bias or prejudice.”  (Jack
Farenbaugh & Son v. Belmont Construction, Inc. (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d
1023, 1031.)  
 
Petitioner
also contends that Chairperson Apostolos, a professor of dance, was
“unrelenting and inexperienced” in how she conducted the hearing and that her
statements “demonstrated her lack of respect for the hearing.”  (See OB 15:5-12 and Reply 3:27-28.)  Petitioner highlights the following statement
of Chairperson Apostolos: 
 
I’m not an
attorney. I am a professor of dance, so the timeline is something I establish.
It is the way I run it, this is the way you keep your dance shows on point, you
know…. I want to remind everyone, this is a one-day hearing, and we have a lot
of material to cover.  
 
(AR
898.)  The court disagrees with
Petitioner’s interpretation.  Taken in
context, Chairperson Apostolos simply explained, from her perspective, how she
intended to conduct the hearing.    Chairperson Apostolos’ reasons for limiting
the hearing to one day do not reflect bias, but rather a desire to complete the
process in a timely manner.  Based on the
foregoing, Petitioner has not proven by “clear averments” that any of the panel
members were biased.  
 
            5.         The
lack of cross-examination is not a due process violation
 
Petitioner
argues that USC’s Faculty Handbook granted him a right to cross-examine the
witnesses against him, which included the students who provided information to
Investigator Reyes but did not testify. 
Petitioner focuses on Students 1, 4, and 11.  Petitioner has not identified any other witnesses who he
contends should have been subject to cross-examination.  
 
Respondents’
counsel argues that private universities need only provide “notice of the
charges and a meaningful opportunity to be heard,” and are not required to
provide “the opportunity to directly or indirectly cross-examine the accuser
and other witnesses at a live hearing.” 
(Oppo. 30:9-14, citing Boermeester v. Carry (2023) 15 Cal.5th 72,
79.)  Nevertheless, a university must
comply with its own policies and procedures in disciplinary proceedings.  (See Teacher v. California Western School
of Law (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 111, 116, citing Doe v. University of
Southern California (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 221, 239.)  
 
In
this case, the Faculty Handbook states in relevant part:
 
Each
party shall have the opportunity to present its evidence, including witnesses,
and to make an argument to the grievance panel.  Each party shall have the right to
confront and question the witnesses of the other.  Each party shall have the right to inspect and
respond to all written and documentary evidence offered. Technical rules of
evidence, voir dire proceedings, and pretrial discovery proceedings are not
applicable.  
 
(AR 241 [bold italics added].)  It is unclear whether this rule applies only
to the witnesses who testified at the disciplinary hearing or extends to
witnesses who provided information to USC’s investigator.  The court need not resolve this issue.  Even if the latter, there was no due process
violation.  Petitioner was afforded a
hearing at which he could call witnesses; Petitioner never sought to call these
witnesses in order to cross-examine them on their statements to Investigator
Reyes (i.e., by calling them as adverse witnesses).  
 
Petitioner
cites Teacher v. California Western School of Law, but that case is
distinguishable.  In Teacher, the
petitioner had no opportunity to call any witnesses because the proceeding did
not involve live testimony.  (Teacher,
supra, 77 Cal.App.5th at 128-129.)  The
District Court of Appeal found that the respondent “affirmatively discouraged”
the petitioner from exercising his right of cross-examination by informing him
that the hearing would “not be a trial” and that there would not be any live
witnesses.  (Ibid.)  By contrast, in the instant case, USC did
nothing to prevent Petitioner from calling any students to cross-examine them
on their statements to Investigator Reyes. 
 
USC
also agreed to make these students available to Petitioner, notwithstanding the
“no contact” order.  The AOC Directive
states that “should you believe that any communication is necessary with
respect to the ongoing investigation under the Resolution Process for
Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation … involving you … , please let me
know, and I will assist with making an exception to this directive, as
appropriate.”  (AR 287.)  There is no record that Petitioner ever asked
Respondents to contact the students or make them available. (See AR 3366,
4431.)  
 
In
the alternative, Petitioner has not persuasively shown that the interview statements of
Students 1, 4, and 11, or any other students, were necessary to the final
administrative decision.  (See OB 16-18,
citing record.)  The EEO-TIX
findings and the panel’s recommendation relied substantially on Petitioner’s
own admissions that he sent the emails, texts, and voicemail messages at issue
or that he did not remember sending them due to being drunk. (See AR 13, 18,
21, 22, 25, 31, 34, 40, 341-342, 1156-1158, 1160-1163.)  These facts were undisputed.  Indeed, President Folt informed Petitioner: “You
did not deny any of the behavior charged against you, though you testified you
did not remember some of it.”  (AR 4533.)  To establish that he was prejudiced by the
lack of cross-examination, Petitioner would need to explain how the interview
statements or summaries were actually relied upon and material to each of the
policy violations that, independently, supported his dismissal, separate and
apart from his admissions of misconduct. 
Petitioner has not made that showing. 
The court has no obligation to “assume the task of initiating and
prosecuting a search of the record for any purpose of discovering errors not
pointed out in the briefs.” (Fox v.
Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742.) 

 
B.        Petitioner Has Not Shown
a Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion 
 
1.         The findings are
supported by the evidence and support the decision
 
In his opening brief and reply, Petitioner has not advanced any argument
that the administrative findings are not supported by the evidence or that the
findings do not support the decision. 
(See Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(b).) 
Accordingly, Petitioner has forfeited that issue.  (Nelson v. Avondale
HOA
(2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 857, 862-863 [“When an appellant fails to raise a point,
or asserts it but fails to support it with reasoned argument and citations to
authority, we treat the point as waived”].) 
Further, exercising its independent judgment on the record, the court
also concludes that the administrative findings in the panel’s letter and
President Folt’s final decision are supported both by the weight of the
evidence and by substantial evidence.  As
discussed, the charges and findings are based primarily on Petitioner’s own
emails, text messages, or other communications. 
Petitioner did not dispute the authenticity of these communications.  Nor did Petitioner dispute that he engaged in
the conduct at issue.  
 


 
            2.         The
panel and the president adequately considered “exculpatory evidence”
 
Petitioner contends that Respondents abused their discussion by failing
to evaluate “exculpatory evidence,” specifically Petitioner’s “deteriorating
mental health” and alcoholism.  (See OB 1-2 and 10-13.)  That is not correct; the panel and the
president considered these issues.    
 
The Resolution Process states that “[t]he investigation report will
include all relevant information provided by either party, including
inculpatory and exculpatory information, that will be used in the determination
of responsibility or sanction.”  (AR 104;
see also AR 107-109.) Petitioner had the opportunity to present exculpatory
information to Investigator Reyes at his interviews.  (AR 5, 317-319, 334-337.)  The report includes details of Petitioner’s
explanations of his conduct, including his “general frustration” about his
colleagues’ views on the COVID-19 pandemic (AR 29), his “frustration” about the
investigation itself (AR 40), and that “he may have had ‘too much to drink.’”
(AR 42.)  
 
The panel’s recommendation
and President Folt’s dismissal decision further demonstrate that Respondents
considered Petitioner’s arguments for mitigation, including based on his alleged
alcoholism and mental health issues and isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.  (AR 4535-38.) 
As examples, President Folt found that Petitioner’s psychiatrist
“offered no opinion connecting your alcohol abuse disorder to your emails or
your in-person interactions.”  (AR
4536-37.)  President Folt found: 
 
Your lawyer claims it should have been obvious to the
school that you had a mental disorder, but that cannot be so. Even the
psychiatrist who saw you for 16 sessions provided no evidence of a mental
condition other than alcohol abuse disorder during the first four months of
2022. 
 
(Ibid.)  Further, President Folt found: 
 
Neither a claim for alcoholism over the long period of
your misbehavior, nor the claim about your mental and emotional condition, were
established. And your attempts to blame your purported conditions on the
actions or inactions of your colleagues have no merit. In any case, those
purported conditions do not constitute a defense to your outrageous behavior as
your behavior was widespread and long preceded the special circumstances which
you contend led to your conditions.
 
(AR 4538.)  Further, exercising its independent judgment
on the record, the court concludes that President Folt’s findings regarding the
alleged mitigating circumstances are supported both by the weight of the
evidence and substantial evidence.  
 
                        3.         USC did not abuse its discretion in
failing to accommodate Petitioner
 
Petitioner argues that Respondents abused
their discretion in failing to take sufficient action, short of dismissal, to
“help” him with his mental health issues, feelings of isolation, and alleged
alcoholism.  Specifically, Petitioner
contends that Respondents should have: 
(1)
“involve[d] professionals that could help Dr. Hay”; (2) placed Petitioner on a
“Special Leave of Absence”; and (3) “ma[d]e reasonable accommodation for the
known … mental disability” of Petitioner. 
(OB 10-13.)  Petitioner also
argues that USC should have offered him
“supportive measures.”  (OB 13-14.)  
 
Supportive measures may include counseling, extensions
of deadlines or other course-related adjustments, modifications of work or
class schedules, campus escort services, mutual restrictions on contact between
the parties, changes in work or housing locations, leaves of absence, increased
security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus, or other similar
measures.
 
(AR
85.)  Among other evidence, Petitioner
cites evidence that “at least 11 people at USC—administrators, deans,
department chairs, investigators, and an associate general counsel, among
others—knew about Dr. Hay’s deteriorating mental health.”  (OB 11:7-11, citing AR 1-54, 461-462,
466-467, 481, 493-498, 517-519, 525-529, 538, 582-604, 617-619, 622, 709-710,
797-800, 2255.)  
 
To the extent Petitioner’s argument is
that Respondents were required to take certain action under the Fair Employment
and Housing Act (“FEHA”) or the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), those
issues are not before the court on this petition for writ of administrative
mandate.  Regardless, Petitioner is
incorrect to the extent he suggests that Respondents could not dismiss his
employment for alcohol-related misconduct. 
(See Labor Code § 1025.)
            
            Instead, Petitioner seems to argue that
USC abused its discretion in terminating him when there were less drastic
options available.  The court finds that
USC did not abuse its discretion in imposing the penalty of termination.  As discussed, USC considered all of the
aggravating and mitigating factors.  The
decision to terminate Petitioner is supported by the findings, and the findings
are supported by the evidence.
 
            C.        There
is no Evidence of Retaliation or Violations of Academic Freedom   
 
Finally, Petitioner alleges that Respondents violated his right to
academic freedom “by
initiating a drawn-out investigation and career-ruining disciplinary proceeding
against him after he posted his theory about the effects of the Vietnamese diet
on the COVID-19 mortality rate in Vietnam on LinkedIn.”  (OB 18-19.) 
There is no evidence that these proceedings were retaliatory.  The Statement of Charges, upon which the
dismissal was based, did not include Petitioner’s post on
LinkedIn regarding “the COVID-19 mortality rate in Vietnam.” (AR 845-849.)  As phrased by President Folt, “Your
COVID-related statements are not any part of the Provost's charges against
you.”  (AR 4535.)  Petitioner has not identified any specific
factual allegation in the Statement of Charges, or any factual finding in the panel’s
letter or President Folt’s decision, that was based on Petitioner’s academic
views or statements.  To the contrary,
the disciplinary proceedings were supported by ample evidence of racist and
abusive comments by Petitioner.  
 


 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 
            Based
upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The petition for writ of administrative
mandate is denied.
 
            2.         Respondent’s counsel shall lodge a
proposed judgment for the court’s signature.
 
            3.         The court’s clerk shall provide
notice.  
 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
