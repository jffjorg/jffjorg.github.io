Rinsch  v. Bureau of Real Estate
Appraisers
Case No. 24STCP00255
[Tentative] Order Sustaining Demurrer to
Petition for Writ of Mandate
 
 
INTRODUCTION

 
            Petitioner
Daniel Rinsch (“Petitioner”), a self-represented party, filed this petition for
writ of administrative mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 against
the Board of Real Estate Appraisers (“Respondent” or the “Board”).  Petitioner challenges the Board’s decision to
place him on probation for two years. 
Now, Respondent demurs, arguing that the petition is barred by the
applicable statute of limitations.  The
court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend.   
 
BACKGROUND
 
             Petitioner “was a licensed Certified
Residential Appraiser with the Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, License
#AR029246 beginning on 3/11/2005.” 
(Petition for Writ of Mandate (“Pet.”) ¶ 1.)  Petitioner “was a full-time appraiser during
this period and had never had a complaint filed against him with the Department
of Consumer Affairs or the Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, prior to the
complaint filed by Servicelink, a nationwide [Appraisal Management
Company].”  (Id. ¶ 2.)  “The complaint filed by Servicelink dated May
8, 2020, represents the first complaint filed with the Bureau of Real Estate
Appraisers against Daniel Rinsch, and is authored by an attorney for
Servicelink LLC.”  (Id. ¶ 3.)
 
In an order dated October 11, 2023,
Respondent adopted a proposed decision of an administrative law judge to revoke
Petitioner’s license but stayed the revocation and placed Petitioner on
probation for two years (the “decision”). 
(RJN Exh. A.)   The decision was
mailed to Petitioner on October 11, 2023. 
(Ibid.)  The decision
states an effective date of November 13, 2023. 
(Ibid.)  
 
Respondent received a petition for
reconsideration from Petitioner on November 9, 2023.  In an ordered dated November 14, 2023,
Respondent stated: “The decision and order having become effective, the Bureau
lacks jurisdiction over the petition for reconsideration. Accordingly,
respondent’s petition for reconsideration is deemed denied by operation of law
for want of jurisdiction.”  (RJN Exh. B.)
 
On January 24, 2024, Petitioner filed this
petition for writ of mandate.  In the
petition, which is verified, Petitioner alleges that he retained attorney Peter
Christensen as his defense attorney against the administrative complaint; that
the Engagement Letter included James Martin as an expert witness; and that
James Martin was the Bureau Chief for the Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers unit
July 2020, during the period of time that Servicelink filed its complaint.  (Pet. ¶¶ 4-5.)  Petitioner further alleges that “Christensen’s
collaboration with Jim Martin, after Mr. Martin’s relevant leadership of the
Bureau and reported participation in the investigations of [Petitioner’s] work,
clearly tainted the defense of [Petitioner] and violated his due process
rights.”  (Id. ¶ 9.)  
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
A demurrer tests the
sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer must appear on the
face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters. (Code Civil Proc. §
430.30, subd. (a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “We
assume the truth of the allegations in the complaint, but do not assume the
truth of contentions, deductions, or conclusions of law.”  (California
Logistics, Inc. v. State (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 242, 247.)  The
allegations in the petition must be liberally construed in favor of Petitioner
on demurrer.  (See Mobil Oil Corp. v
Exxon Corp. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 942, 947.)  “A demurrer must dispose of an entire
cause of action to be sustained.”  (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)  “A demurrer on the ground of the bar of
the statute of limitations will not lie where the action may be, but is not
necessarily barred.  It must appear
clearly and affirmatively that, upon the face of the complaint, the right of
action is necessarily barred.”  (Lockley
v. Law Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 875, 881, citations and internal quotations omitted.)  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            The
petition, as pleaded, is barred by the statute of limitations.  Under Government Code section 11523, a
petition for writ of administrative mandate challenging Respondent’s final
administrative decision “shall be filed within 30 days after the last day on
which reconsideration can be ordered.”  (See
also 10 Cal. Code Regs. § 3721(b) and (c).) 
“The power to order a reconsideration shall expire 30 days after the
delivery or mailing of a decision to a respondent, or on the date set by the
agency itself as the effective date of the decision if that date occurs prior
to the expiration of the 30-day period.” 
(Gov. Code § 11521(a).)  Service
by mail does not extend the 30-day time limit. (Compton v. Board of Trustees
(1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 150, 154 fn. 3 [“The fact that the decision was mailed,
rather than delivered, did not extend the 30 day time limit of section 11521”].)  Nor is it extended when a licensee files a
petition for reconsideration of the decision.  (Anderson v. Dept. of Alcoholic Beverage
Control (1958) 159 Cal.App.2d 413, 415.) 

 
Here,
Respondent mailed the Decision on October 11, 2023.  The 30-day time period expired on Friday,
November 10, 2023.  Because this was observed
as Veterans Day, Respondent’s authority to reconsider its decision expired on
the next business day, which was Monday, November 13, 2023, which was also the
effective date of the decision.  (See Civ.
Code, §§ 7, 11; RJN Exh. A.)  Respondent
did not grant a stay of the expiration under Government Code section 11521.  (RJN Exh. B.) 
 
Accordingly,
the statute of limitations expired 30 days after November 13, 2023, which was Friday,
December 13, 2024.  This petition was
filed after that deadline, on January 24, 2024. 
Based upon the information contained in the petition and the exhibits
subject to judicial notice, the petition appears to be untimely.  
 
  In opposition, Petitioner argues that his
deadline to file the petition was extended pursuant to Government Code section
11523 because he requested the administrative record from Respondent and
because the record provided was not “complete.” 
(Oppo. 2; see Gov. Code § 11523.) 
Petitioner also argues that the limitations period should be extended
pursuant to the doctrine of equitable tolling. 
(Oppo. 2-8.)  These arguments rely
on extrinsic materials that are not subject to judicial notice, which the court
cannot consider in ruling on a demurrer. 
“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters.”  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)  In other words, Petitioner
must allege the relevant facts to support his arguments in the petition and/or attach
the relevant documents as exhibits to his petition in order for the court to
consider them.  
 
Based
upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
1.         The court sustains Respondent’s
demurrer.
 
2.         The court grants leave to amend.  Petitioner shall file a first amended
petition within thirty (30) days.  The
court provides notice that if Petitioner fails to do so, absent good cause,
this case will be dismissed with prejudice.
 
3.         The court continues the trial setting
conference to October 11, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. 
 
4.         Respondent’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of service with the court.
