Specially Appearing Defendant
Guidoni USA Inc.’s motion to quash service of summons is granted.

 
Specially Appearing Defendant Guidoni USA Inc. (“Guidoni”) (“Specially
Appearing Defendant”) moves to quash Plaintiff Adan Gomez-Rivera’s
(“Gomez-Rivera”) (“Plaintiff”) service of summons upon it on the grounds this
Court lacks personal jurisdiction over it because there are insufficient
contacts between Guidoni and the State of California to support any
constitutional basis for jurisdiction over Guidoni.  (Notice Quash, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §418.10.)
 
Procedural
History
Guidoni
filed the instant motion on April 5, 2024. 
Plaintiff filed his opposition on August 6, 2024.  Guidoni filed its reply on August 7, 2024.
 
Legal
Standard
“A defendant, on or before the day of his or her time to
plead . . . may serve and file a notice of motion . . . [t]o quash service of
summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”  (C.C.P. §418.10(a)(1).)  By filing such motion, “a defendant makes a
special appearance for the narrow purpose of contesting personal jurisdiction
where the summons is defective.”  (Stancil
v. Superior Court (2021) 11 Cal.5th 381, 393.)
“In the absence of a voluntary submission to the authority
of the court, compliance with the statutes governing service of process is
essential to establish that court’s personal jurisdiction over a defendant.”  (Floveyer International, Ltd. v. Superior
Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 793; see also Calvert v. Al Binali
(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 954, 961 [“To establish personal jurisdiction, it is essential
to comply with the statutory procedures for service of process.”].)  “When a defendant challenges that jurisdiction
by bringing a motion to quash, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the
existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service.”  (Lebel v. Mai
(2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160, internal quotations omitted.)
A non-resident defendant may be subject to either general or
specific jurisdiction.  (See Elkman v. National States Insurance Co. (2009) 173
Cal.App.4th 1305,
1314.) 
 
Discussion
California’s long-arm statute
permits a court to exercise personal jurisdiction on any basis consistent with
state or federal constitutional principles. 
(C.C.P. §410.10.)  “When a defendant
moves to quash service of process on jurisdictional grounds, the plaintiff has
the initial burden of demonstrating facts justifying the exercise of
jurisdiction.  Once facts showing minimum
contacts with the forum state are established, however, it becomes the
defendant’s burden to demonstrate that the exercise of jurisdiction would be
unreasonable.”  (Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 434,
449, citations omitted.)  Plaintiff must
meet his initial burden by a preponderance of competent and relevant evidence,
as shown in affidavits and documentary evidence.  (See Ziller Electronics Lab GmbH v.
Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1222, 1232-1233.)
          “Personal jurisdiction may be either general or specific. A
nonresident defendant may be subject to the general jurisdiction of the
forum if his or her contacts in the forum state are ‘substantial . . .
continuous and systematic.’ In such a case, ‘it is not necessary that the
specific cause of action alleged be connected with the defendant’s business
relationship to the forum.’ Such a defendant’s contacts with the forum are so
wide-ranging that they take the place of physical presence in the forum as a
basis for jurisdiction.”  (Vons Companies, Inc., 14 Cal.4th at pgs. 445-446, citations omitted.)
“If the nonresident defendant
does not have substantial and systematic contacts in the forum sufficient to
establish general jurisdiction, he or she still may be subject to the specific jurisdiction of the forum, if
the defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of forum benefits,
and the ‘controversy is related to or ‘arises out of’ a defendant’s contacts
with the forum.’”  (Id. at pg. 446, citations omitted.) 
The purposeful availment test is only satisfied if the defendant
purposefully and voluntarily directs its activities toward California so that
the defendant should expect, because of the benefits it receives, to be subject
to jurisdiction here based on its contacts with California.  (Snowney v. Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc.
(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1054, 1062.) 
Purposeful availment occurs when a nonresident defendant purposefully
directs its activities at California residents, deliberately engages in
significant activities here, or creates “continuing obligations” between itself
and California residents.  (Id. at
pg. 1063.)
“The crucial inquiry concerns
the character of defendant’s activity in the forum, whether the cause of action
arises out of or has a substantial connection with that activity, and upon the
balancing of the convenience of the parties and the interests of the state in
assuming jurisdiction.”  (Vons Companies, Inc., 14 Cal.4th at pg. 448, citing Cornelison v. Chaney (1976) 16 Cal.3d
143, 147-148).  Jurisdiction is proper
when the defendant’s contacts proximately result from its actions that create a
“substantial connection” with the forum state. 
(Hanson v. Denckla (1958) 357 U.S. 235, 253.)
Plaintiff fails to demonstrate by a preponderance of
evidence that Guidoni has sufficient contacts with California for this Court to
exercise general jurisdiction over it. 
Plaintiff’s opposition does not explicitly argue the issue of general
jurisdiction, and therefore concedes this Court lacks general jurisdiction over
Guidoni.  (See Opposition, pg.
4.)  
Plaintiff fails to demonstrate by a preponderance of
evidence that Guidoni has sufficient contacts with California for this Court to
exercise specific jurisdiction over it. 

First, Plaintiff’s argument that Guidoni has already
submitted to the jurisdiction of this Court by filing answers in Rivas-Williams
v. A & A Granite Marble et al., LASC Case No. 23STCV08523 and Segura-Meza
at Al. v. Agoura Hills Marble and Granite, Inc., et al., LASC Case No. 22STCV38729
and its identical motion to quash in Melendez-Murillo et al. v. AKG Trading
(USA), Inc., et al., LASC Case No. 23STCV08596 was denied by Judge Teresa
M. Traber is unavailing.  This Court is
tasked to determine if specific jurisdiction exists in the instant case and
other superior court judges’ rulings have no binding authority on this
Court.  Further, filing answers in
response to a lawsuit in this Court is not purposeful availment of this Court’s
jurisdiction in the sense that initiating a lawsuit in LASC would be.
Second, Plaintiff’s argument that Guidoni conducted business
in California by shipping at least 34 containers of its artificial stone
products directly into the Port of Long Beach, as recently as October 27, 2022,
does not satisfy his burden.  (Decl. of
Metzger ¶6, Exh. A.)  Plaintiff fails to
lay the proper foundation for this evidence—a website screenshot—and also fails
to show Guidoni’s shipment of the 34 containers to Long Beach constitute
continuous and systematic contacts necessary for general personal jurisdiction;
such a shipment could be evidence of only one day of contact with California.  Similarly, Plaintiff fails to demonstrate that
Guidoni purposefully availed itself of California’s benefits.  A declaration that a website shows Guidoni
made one shipment of 34 containers to the Port of Long Beach does not establish
intentionality on part of Guidoni to avail itself to the benefits of California,
and could be the result of “random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts.”  (Pavlovich v. Superior Court (2002) 29
Cal.4th 262, 269.)   Lastly, Plaintiff submits no evidence to
support asserting personal jurisdiction over Guidoni on the basis of one shipment
would comport with fair play and substantial justice.
Accordingly, Guidoni’s motion
to quash service of summons is granted.
 
Conclusion
Guidoni’s
motion to quash is granted.  
Moving
Party to give notice.
