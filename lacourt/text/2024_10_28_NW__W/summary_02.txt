And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling on Lyft, Inc.'s motion to strike portions of Paul Pinckard's first amended complaint. The court grants the motion in part, striking certain paragraphs that contain irrelevant, false, or improper matter, or that are not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of California. The court finds that certain allegations regarding vicarious liability for assault and punitive damages are sufficient, but strikes other paragraphs that contain legal citations or fail to plead facts supporting the claims. The court also agrees that Lyft's corporate leadership acted with oppression, fraud, or malice by failing to implement adequate safety measures despite being aware of the risks to passengers. The court's ruling is subject to change after further consideration and argument at the hearing on October 28, 2024.
