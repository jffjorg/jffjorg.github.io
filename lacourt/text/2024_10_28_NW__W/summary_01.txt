As for the summary of the judge's tentative ruling, here is a brief summary of the document:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Ron Rozillio and production of documents. The ruling states that Rozillio failed to appear for his deposition on October 1, 2024, and did not produce demanded documents. The judge finds that good cause exists to compel the deposition and production of documents, as Rozillio's refusal to appear compromises the plaintiff's ability to conduct follow-up discovery before mediation and trial. The judge orders the parties to appear with dates they are available for the deposition of Rozillio. The request for sanctions is denied.
