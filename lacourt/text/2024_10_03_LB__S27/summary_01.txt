And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, County of Los Angeles, on the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Soledad Gutierrez, alleges that she was discriminated against and retaliated against by the County due to her race and national origin. The defendant argues that the plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies and that her claims are barred by the statute of limitations.

The judge finds that the plaintiff did not make a prima facie showing of adverse employment action, which is a prerequisite to each of her claims. The judge also finds that the paid administrative leave taken by the plaintiff was not an adverse employment action. The judge grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment and denies the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.

The judge notes that the parties' additional arguments are not necessary to dispose of the entire action, and therefore declines to rule on them. The judge orders the defendant to give notice and sets the matter for hearing on October 3, 2024.
