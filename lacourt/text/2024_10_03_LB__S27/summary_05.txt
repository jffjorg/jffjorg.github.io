```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) and a motion to quash. The complaint alleges illegal surveillance by the California Department of Corrections and seeks damages. The demurring party (Defendants) argues that the plaintiff failed to plead compliance with the Government Tort Claims Act, which requires a plaintiff to present a government tort claim to the public entity before commencing suit. The court agrees with the demurring party and sustains the demurrer, granting leave to amend. The plaintiff must file a Second Amended Complaint within twenty days, pleading compliance with the Act and attaching a copy of the claim. The motion to quash is also granted, as there is no authority permitting a party to subpoena a witness for a hearing on a demurrer or motion.

The court notes that the parties did not meet and confer as required by California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) §430.41, and that the plaintiff failed to oppose the demurrer prior to the hearing. The court also finds that the FAC does not state a claim for relief due to the failure to plead compliance with the Government Tort Claims Act.
