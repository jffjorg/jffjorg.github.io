**English Text Summary**

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Mark C. Kim in a case between Plaintiff Elisa Carrillo and Defendants Gardaworld Security Services of California, Inc. and Ecamsecure. The case involves a motion to compel arbitration and a dispute over the existence and enforceability of an arbitration agreement.

The Court finds that the Defendant has met its burden to show that an arbitration agreement exists and is enforceable. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff failed to show that the agreement was not actually signed and failed to show any defense to enforcement of the agreement.

The Court grants the motion to compel arbitration and stays the litigation against the Defendants pending the outcome of arbitration. The parties are reminded of a Case Management Conference that will discuss a post-arbitration status conference date.

In reaching its decision, the Court applied California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) §1281, which governs motions to compel arbitration, as well as CCP §1281.2 and §1281.4. The Court also considered California Civil Code (Civ. Code) §1633.9, which governs electronic signatures.
