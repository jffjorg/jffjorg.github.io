Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the discovery motions filed by the plaintiffs, Angelica Arreguin-Aguilar and Jose A. Arechiga-Perez, against the defendant, Joan M. Attwell. The plaintiffs had sought to compel the defendant to provide a deposition and to produce documents related to the insurance policies that provide coverage for the subject accident.

The judge denied the motion to compel deposition, finding that the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden to show that the defendant failed to appear at a scheduled deposition. The judge also denied the motion to compel further response, finding that the defendant had already provided a complete response to the FROGs (Formal Requests for Evidence) and that the plaintiffs' requests for additional information were not justified.

The judge also denied the motion to compel production of documents, finding that the plaintiffs failed to show good cause for the production of the documents sought. The judge noted that the plaintiffs' explanation for why they needed the unredacted documents was speculative and that the information sought could be obtained through deposition or other easily available means.

The judge ordered the parties to meet and confer forthwith to schedule all depositions without the need for further law and motion practice. The judge also denied the request for sanctions and ordered the parties to give notice.

The judge's tentative ruling will be considered at a hearing on October 3, 2024, and will be finalized unless the parties submit written objections by email to the court.
