S27 8:30 a.m. October 3, 2024Moving Party: Defendants, Corn Maiden Foods, Inc. and Maria JimenezJoining Party: Cross-Defendant, Leading Staffing SolutionsOpposing Party: None filedNotice: OK1. Background FactsPlaintiff, Elman Salazar-Ramirez filed this action against Defendants, Corn Maiden Foods, Inc. and Maria Jimenez for damages arising out of a slip and fall incident. Defendants filed a cross-complaint against Leading Staffing Solutions. Plaintiff was working for Corn Maiden Foods, where he had been placed by staffing company, LSS, on the date of the incident. Plaintiff added Go Fire Protection, Inc. as Doe 1 on 2/23/24; its role in the slip and fall is not clear from the complaint or the pending motion for determination of good faith settlement.2. Motion for Determination of Good Faith SettlementCorn Maiden Foods and Jimenez have agreed to settle all claims with Plaintiff for $90,000. Defendants seek an order from the Court finding that the settlement is in good faith.Any opposition to the motion was due nine court days prior to the hearing. CCP §1005(b). Nine court days prior to the hearing fell on 9/20/24. On 7/29/24, Go Fire Protection opposed an ex parte application to grant the motion, noting that it needed time to review the settlement and determine whether to oppose the substantive relief sought. It did not, however, file opposition to the motion itself, and nothing in the opposition to the ex parte application indicates it substantively opposes the relief sought.The burden on a motion for determination of good faith settlement rests squarely on the party opposing the finding of good faith. CCP §877.6(d). In light of the lack of opposition, no party has met that burden. The motion for determination of good faith settlement is therefore granted.3. JoinderThe Court notes that LSS filed a joinder to the motion on 8/14/24. Nothing in the moving papers indicates LSS is a party to the settlement. LSS does not disclose the terms of any settlement between Plaintiff and LSS. The tentative ruling is therefore to deny the joinder. If the parties submit on the tentative ruling, the joinder will be denied. If the parties appear and explain the settlement between Plaintiff and LSS, and Go Fire does not oppose the requested good faith finding, then the joinder will be granted.Moving Defendants are ordered to give notice.Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org. If the department does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed off calendar. If a party submits on the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify the party submitting on the tentative. If the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear remotely.DATED: October 3, 2024 _____________________________________MARK C. KIM Judge of the Superior Co
