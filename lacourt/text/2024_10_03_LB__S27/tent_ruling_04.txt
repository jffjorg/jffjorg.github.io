S27 8:30 a.m. October 3, 2024Moving Party: Plaintiff, Brenda CifuentesOpposing Party: None filedNotice: OK1. Background FactsPlaintiff, Brenda Cifuentes filed this action against Defendants, Rockpoint Group, Westin Long Beach, and Mariott Intl Inc. on 12/12/23. On 2/26/24, Plaintiff appeared at an OSC re: failure to file proof of service, where the Court noted that not all defendants had been served. On 5/09/24, no party appeared at the continued OSC re: proof of service, and the Court set an OSC re: proof of service, CMC, and OSC re: failure to appear, prosecute, and dismissal for 7/03/24. On 7/03/24, the Court noted that Plaintiff had not filed proof of service on Westin Long Beach, and the Court dismissed the action without prejudice.2. Motion to Vacate DismissalOn 7/05/24, Plaintiff filed this motion to vacate the dismissal, contending it was entered as a result of Plaintiff’s attorney’s mistake or neglect. The motion is granted. The dismissal was entered without any statutory or other authority for dismissing the action. CCP §583.420(a)(1) permits the Court to dismiss an action if the summons and complaint are not served within two years after the action is filed. §583.410 also permits the Court to dismiss an action if the case is not brought to trial within two years after filing. There are various other statutes that permit dismissal of an action, none of which apply here. Pursuant to Lyons v. Wickhorst (1986) 42 Cal.3d 911, 915-917, the Court’s powers to dismiss absent a statutory basis are extremely limited, and can only be applied in sham actions or where a delay of less than the statutory period has been prejudicial to the other party.The Court wishes to note various problems with the moving papers. First, Plaintiff’s attorney does not list his State Bar Number as required by CRC 2.111(1). Additionally, the case number for the case does not appear in the caption of the first page of the moving papers, as required by 2.111(5). Finally, the proof of service of the moving papers indicates a document entitled “NOTICE OF CASE REASSIGNMENT AND ORDER FOR PLAINTIFF TO GIVE NOTICE” was served on Defendants; the Court presumes the document that was actually served was this motion to vacate dismissal. The Court asks Plaintiff’s attorney to ensure future papers are not filed with such defects in this or other actions.Because the dismissal was entered without statutory or other basis, it is void and the Court vacates the dismissal.The Court sets an OSC re: Proof of Service, Case Management Conference and Trial Setting Conference for November 13, 2024.Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.
