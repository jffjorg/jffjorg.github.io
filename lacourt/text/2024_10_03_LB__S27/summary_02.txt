And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by the defendants, Corn Maiden Foods, Inc. and Maria Jimenez, is granted. The defendants have agreed to settle all claims with the plaintiff, Elman Salazar-Ramirez, for $90,000. Since no party has opposed the motion, the judge has found that the settlement is in good faith. The judge has also denied the joinder filed by Leading Staffing Solutions, as the company has not disclosed the terms of any settlement between the plaintiff and the company. The parties are ordered to notify the court if they intend to submit on the tentative ruling, and if no party appears and explains the settlement between the plaintiff and Leading Staffing Solutions, the joinder will be denied.
