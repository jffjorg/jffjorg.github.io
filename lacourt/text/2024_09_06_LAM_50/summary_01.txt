And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion filed by Cynthia Barron, a defendant in the case, to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiffs, Craig Dixon, et al. Barron is seeking to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiffs alleging breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, indemnification, and declaratory relief.

The judge has found that Barron has demonstrated good cause to file the proposed cross-complaint, despite the fact that it was filed late. The judge has granted the motion and ordered Barron to file and serve the proposed cross-complaint within 3 days of the date of this order.

The judge has also found that the plaintiffs have failed to show that Barron's motion is being made in bad faith. The judge has rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the proposed cross-complaint is futile and pointless.

The judge has noted that the proposed cross-complaint is related to the subject matter of the original complaint and that Barron has shown that she has a valid claim for indemnification and performance under a Hold Harmless Agreement entered into in 2010.
