  ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFF
  KENNETH WENGROD, TRUSTEE OF THE MANHATTAN TRUST DERIVATIVELY ON BEHALF OF
  LILY BLEU, INC.’S CORRECTED MOTION TO TAX COSTS
 



 
Background
On February 25, 2021, Plaintiff Kenneth Wengrod, Trustee of
The Manhattan Trust, derivatively on behalf of Lily Bleu, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed
this action against Defendants Michael Weiss and Barbara Clark
Cambilargiu, and “Nominal Defendant” Lily Bleu, Inc. (“Lily Bleu”).
            On December 26, 2023, Plaintiff
filed the operative Third Amended Verified Derivative Complaint (“TAC”) against
Defendants Michael Weiss, Barbara Clark Cambilargiu (“Barbara
Cambilargiu”), Miriam Weiss, Carl Cambilargiu, Jessica Weiss Sonnabend
(“Jessica Weiss”), Jenna Cambilargiu, Good Day Gardena Properties, LLC (“Good
Day”), and Nominal Defendant Lily Bleu. The TAC alleges causes of action for
(1) breach of fiduciary duty, (2) corporate waste, (3) unjust enrichment, (4)
fraud (concealment), (5) fraud (misrepresentation), and (6) negligent
misrepresentation.
            On May 23, 2024, a Judgment was
entered in this matter providing, inter alia, that “[o]n May 6, 2024,
Defendants Michael Weiss, Barbara Cambilargiu, Good Day Gardena Properties LLC,
Carl Cambilargiu, Miriam Weiss, Jenna Cambilargiu, and Jessica Weiss
Sonnabend’s Demurrer to Plaintiff Kenneth Wengrod, Trustee of the Manhattan
Trust’s (‘Plaintiff’) Third Amended Verified Derivative Complaint was heard in
Dept. 50 of the above-captioned Court, the Hon. Teresa Beaudet presiding….The Demurrer
was SUSTAINED as to third cause of action for Unjust Enrichment, without leave
to amend. As a result of the Court’s order sustaining the Demurrer to
Plaintiff’s Third Cause of Action, no causes of action remain against
Defendants Good Day Gardena Properties LLC, Carl Cambilargiu, Miriam Weiss,
Jenna Cambilargiu, and Jessica Weiss Sonnabend.” 
The May 23, 2024 Judgment further provides, inter alia, that “Judgment
is entered in favor of defendants Good Day Gardena Properties LLC, Carl
Cambilargiu, Miriam Weiss, Jenna Cambilargiu, and Jessica Weiss Sonnabend, and
against Plaintiff,” and that “Defendants Good Day Gardena Properties LLC, Carl
Cambilargiu, Miriam Weiss, Jenna Cambilargiu, and Jessica Weiss Sonnabend are
prevailing parties against Plaintiff, and are therefore entitled to recover
their costs.” 
            On June 10, 2024, Miriam Weiss, Carl
Cambilargiu, Jenna Cambilargiu, Jessica Weiss, and Good Day filed their
respective memorandums of costs. 
            Plaintiff now moves to tax costs.
Michael Weiss, Barbara Cambilargiu, Miriam Weiss, Carl Cambilargiu, Jenna
Cambilargiu, Jessica Weiss, and Good Day (collectively, “Defendants”) oppose. 
Request for Judicial Notice 
The Court grants Defendants’ request for judicial notice. 
Discussion 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b),
“[e]xcept as otherwise
expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of
right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.” Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (a)(4), “‘[p]revailing party’ includes
the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal
is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any
relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any
relief against that defendant.” 
As set forth above, the May
23, 2024 Judgment in this action provides, inter alia, that “Defendants
Good Day Gardena Properties LLC, Carl Cambilargiu, Miriam Weiss, Jenna
Cambilargiu, and Jessica Weiss Sonnabend are prevailing parties against
Plaintiff, and are therefore entitled to recover their costs.” The May 23, 2024
Judgment provides that “Plaintiff shall recover nothing from Defendants Good
Day Gardena Properties LLC, Carl Cambilargiu, Miriam Weiss, Jenna Cambilargiu,
and Jessica Weiss Sonnabend.” 
Costs recoverable under section 1032 are restricted to those that are both
reasonable in amount and reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1033.5, subds. (c)(2), (3).) Costs
“merely convenient or beneficial” to the preparation of a case are disallowed.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2); see Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774 [expenses for
attorney meals incurred while attending local depositions not “reasonably
necessary”].) 
“A ‘verified memorandum
of costs is prima facie evidence of [the] propriety’ of the items listed on it,
and the burden is on the party challenging these costs to demonstrate that they
were not reasonable or necessary.” (Adams
v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199
Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486-1487 [italics and brackets omitted].) “If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper
charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were
not reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if the items are properly
objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party
claiming them as costs.” (Ladas v. California
State Auto. Assn., supra,
19 Cal.App.4th at p. 774.) Costs otherwise allowable as a matter of
right may be disallowed if the court determines they were not reasonably
necessary, and the court has power to reduce the amount of any cost item to an
amount that is reasonable. (See Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 245 [finding
that “the intent and effect of section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(2) is to
authorize a trial court to disallow recovery of costs, including filing fees,
when it determines the costs were incurred unnecessarily”].)
As discussed, on June 10, 2024, Miriam Weiss, Carl Cambilargiu, Jenna
Cambilargiu, Jessica Weiss, and Good Day filed their respective memorandums of
costs. In the instant motion, Plaintiff asserts that “all proper costs must be
borne by Lily Bleu, Inc. (‘Lily Bleu’), on whose behalf the TAC was brought,
rather than by Plaintiff.” (Mot. at p. 4:3-4.) 
As an initial matter, Defendants assert that Plaintiff’s motion to tax
is untimely. Pursuant to California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1700, subdivision (b)(1), “[a]ny notice of motion to strike or to
tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost
memorandum. If the cost memorandum was served by mail, the period is extended
as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1013.
If the cost memorandum was served electronically, the period is extended as
provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6
(a)(4).” Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6,
subdivision (a)(4) provides that “[a]ny document that is served
electronically between 12:00 a.m. and 11:59:59 p.m. on a court day shall be
deemed served on that court day. Any document that is served electronically on
a noncourt day shall be deemed served on the next court day.” 
Here, Miriam Weiss, Carl Cambilargiu, Jenna Cambilargiu, Jessica
Weiss, and Good Day filed their respective memorandums of costs on June 10,
2024. The proofs of service attached to the memorandums of costs indicate that the
memorandums were served on June 10, 2024 by electronic service. Monday, June
10, 2024 is a court day. Defendants note that fifteen days after June 10, 2024
is June 25, 2024. However, the instant motion was filed on July 2, 2024.[1]
Plaintiff did not file any reply in support of the motion and thus
does not address 
Defendants’
assertion that the motion is untimely. On July 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel
filed a declaration in support of the motion providing, inter alia, that
“[t]he Memorandum of Costs in this matter was served on me electronically on
December 28, 2022. This Motion to Tax Costs is timely filed on January 17, 2023
(noting that January 16, 2023 was a Court holiday.).” (Latter Decl., ¶ 2.)
These dates appear to be listed in error. As discussed, the subject memorandums
of costs were filed on June 10, 2024, and the proofs of service attached to the
memorandums indicate that they were served on June 10, 2024. The instant motion
was filed on July 2, 2024.
As discussed, Plaintiff’s counsel also filed a separate declaration on
June 28, 2024. In such declaration, Plaintiff’s counsel states that “[t]he
Memorandum of Costs in this matter was served on me electronically on June 11,
2024. This Motion to Tax Costs is timely filed on June 28, 2024.” (Latter
Decl., ¶ 2.) However, no motion to tax costs was filed on June 28, 2024. As
discussed, the motion was filed on July 2, 2024. Moreover, even if the
memorandums of costs were served on June 11, 2024, fifteen days after this date
is June 26, 2024. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700,
subd. (b)(1).) 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Defendants have shown
that the instant motion is untimely. 
Moreover, as discussed, Plaintiff argues that “all proper costs must
be borne by Lily Bleu, Inc. (‘Lily Bleu’), on whose behalf the TAC was brought,
rather than by Plaintiff.” (Mot. at p. 4:3-4.) But as noted by Defendants, the
May 23, 2024 Judgment provides, inter alia, that “Defendants Good Day
Gardena Properties LLC, Carl Cambilargiu, Miriam Weiss, Jenna Cambilargiu, and
Jessica Weiss Sonnabend are prevailing parties against Plaintiff, and
are therefore entitled to recover their costs.” (Emphasis added.) Plaintiff did
not file any reply and thus does not address this point. 
In light of the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s motion to tax
costs.  
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
motion to tax costs is denied. 
Defendants are ordered provide
notice of this ruling.¿
