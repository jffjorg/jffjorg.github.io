(Defendants). The Plaintiff has filed a motion to tax costs, which was filed late and is therefore denied. The court has determined that the Defendants are prevailing parties and are entitled to recover their costs, and that the Plaintiff shall recover nothing from the Defendants. The court has also ruled that the costs claimed by the Defendants are reasonable and necessary to the conduct of the litigation. The Plaintiff's motion to tax costs is denied, and the Defendants are ordered to provide notice of this ruling.
