[1]The Court notes
that Plaintiff filed an amended opposition on June 3, 2024. The Court considers
Plaintiff’s June 3, 2024 opposition papers herein. 


[2]On July 30, 2024,
the Court issued an Order in this matter providing, inter alia, that
“[t]he MSJ hearing is set on 9/6/24 [at] 1:30 pm in Dept 50. The Court will
rule on the remaining objections (11) based on the conditions set forth in the
Revised Joint Statement filed 7/25/24. If the Court finds that the evidence
deemed immaterial per the Revised [Joint] Statement is, in fact, material then
the Court will rule on the objection.” The instant order on Defendant’s motion
cites to certain evidence referenced in Plaintiff’s conditionally withdrawn
Objections Nos. 3 and 4. Thus, the Court rules on such objections herein. 


[3]Plaintiff cites to
Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (b)(1),
which provides that “[t]he motion shall be supported by affidavits,
declarations, admissions, answers to interrogatories, depositions, and matters
of which judicial notice shall or may be taken. The supporting papers shall
include a separate statement setting forth plainly and concisely all material
facts that the moving party contends are undisputed. Each of the material facts
stated shall be followed by a reference to the supporting evidence. The failure
to comply with this requirement of a separate statement may in the court’s
discretion constitute a sufficient ground for denying the motion.”
