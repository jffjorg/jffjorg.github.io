And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's request for default judgment. The plaintiff, Brian Whitaker, is seeking a default judgment against the defendant, Byte to Bite (California), LLC, in the amount of $9,710.32. The judgment consists of $4,000.00 in damages, $1,770.32 in costs, and $3,940.00 in attorney fees, as well as $200.00 in "other" unspecified costs.

The court notes that the plaintiff's previous request for default judgment included a request for $200.00 in "other" unspecified costs, which was unclear and may not be allowable under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5. The plaintiff's latest request includes a similar request for "Investigation Fees" in the amount of $200.00, but the court finds that this request is also unclear and may not be allowable.

The court advises the plaintiff to file a revised request for default judgment and a revised proposed judgment to address this defect. Alternatively, the plaintiff may choose to exclude the request for "Investigation Fees" and the court will grant the request for default judgment. The court will reconsider the request if the defect is corrected before the hearing.
