[1]“[T]he elements of a cause of action for breach of
contract are (1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or
excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting
damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)


[2]Russell states
that Mr. Boyce’s email references “an email from Carl Fairbank, Breakout’s
founder.” (Russell Decl., ¶ 27.) 


[3]SecurCapital notes
that the April 29, 2019 “Side Letter” provides, inter alia, that “Finders
fee will be 7% of cash raised for the asset purchase/funding OPX, other than
from Wave/Boyce (‘Finders Fee’). For example, if $1.5 million is raised from
SecurCapital and other sources, then the Finders Fee would be $105,000. This
consideration takes into account that investment for Breakout comes in as
tranches over time in 2019, and may include other capital sources other than
SecurCapital. This finder’s fee does not apply to capital that Boyce personally
invests.” (Russell Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. 3.)
 


[4]In Chambers v.
Kay (2002) 29 Cal.4th 142, 151, cited by
Wave, the California Supreme Court noted that “[i]n Bank of California v. Connolly (1973) 36
Cal. App. 3d 350 [111 Cal. Rptr. 468], the Court of Appeal explained that [a]
joint venture exists where there is an agreement between the parties under
which they have a community of interest, that is, a joint interest, in a common
business undertaking, an understanding as to the sharing of profits and losses,
and a right of joint control…In comparing joint ventures with partnerships, the
court commented that the incidents of both relationships are the same in all essential respects.” (Internal
quotations and emphasis omitted.) 
 


[5]Wave does not
appear to allege that it seeks damages in connection with its second cause of
action for declaratory relief. Rather, Wave alleges, inter alia, that it
is “entitled to a judicial declaration pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 1060 that Wave and SecurCapital formed the
partnership, or in the alternative, joint venture described above.” (TAC, ¶
59.) 


[6]As discussed, the
TAC alleges that “Wave contributed $100,000 to the partnership or joint venture
for the purpose of the partnership or joint venture’s investment or acquisition
transaction with Breakout,” and that “[o]n or about July 8, 2019, SecurCapital
unilaterally closed a transaction with Breakout instead of closing that
transaction on behalf of the partnership or joint venture, thereby converting
Wave’s $100,000 partnership or joint venture contribution to SecurCapital’s own
private use. (TAC, ¶¶ 74-75.)
