And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has reviewed the information presented and has tentatively ruled on the case. The case involves a dispute between Wave and SecurCapital over a partnership or joint venture with Breakout. Wave alleges that SecurCapital breached the agreement and converted Wave's contribution to its own private use. The Judge notes that the elements of a cause of action for breach of contract include the existence of the contract, performance or excuse for nonperformance, breach, and resulting damages. The Judge also references a California Supreme Court case that defines a joint venture as an agreement between parties with a community of interest in a common business undertaking. The Judge has not yet ruled on the merits of the case, but has tentatively concluded that Wave's allegations of breach of contract and conversion are not frivolous. The next step is for the parties to present further evidence and arguments at the upcoming court hearing.
