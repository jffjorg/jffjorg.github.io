[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT




            
Plaintiff Brian Whitaker (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default
judgment against Defendant Byte to Bite (California), LLC. Plaintiff seeks
judgment in the total amount of $9,710.32, comprising $4,000.00 in damages, $1,770.32
in costs, and $3,940.00 in attorney fees.
            The Court notes that the August 15,
2024 Order on Plaintiff’s previous request for default judgment provides, inter
alia, as follows: 
 
“The Court notes that in the June 18, 2024 Order on
Plaintiff’s previous request for default judgment, the Court noted that ‘Plaintiff
seeks $200.00 in ‘other’ unspecified costs. It is unclear if such unspecified
costs are allowable under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5.” (June 18,
2024 Order at p. 1:19-20.) Plaintiff’s new request filed on June 26, 2024 still
indicates that Plaintiff seeks $200.00 in “other” unspecified costs. (See Form CIV-100,
Item 7(c).) It is still unclear if such unspecified costs are allowable under Code
of Civil Procedure section 1033.5. Otherwise, Plaintiff has
sufficiently supported his request with the submitted declarations and
evidence.” (August 15, 2024 Order at p. 1:18-26.) 
The Court notes that Plaintiff’s latest request for default
judgment filed on December 9, 2024 indicates that Plaintiff seeks, inter
alia, $200.00 in “other” costs for “Investigation Fees.” (See Form CIV-100,
Item 7(c).) However, Plaintiff does not appear to demonstrate that
“Investigation Fees” are allowable under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5. Moreover, the Court notes that Code
of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (b)(2) provides that “[t]he
following items are not allowable as costs, except when expressly authorized by
law:…(2) Investigation expenses in preparing the case for trial.” Plaintiff does not appear to cite to any legal
authority authorizing his request for “Investigation Fees.” 
Plaintiff may file a revised request for court judgment (Form
CIV-100) and a revised proposed judgment (Form JUD-100) to address the
above-referenced defect. If the foregoing defect is corrected before the
hearing, the Court will grant Plaintiff’s request for default
judgment.  Alternatively, Plaintiff may exclude the request for “Investigation
Fees” and the Court will grant the request for default judgment.
