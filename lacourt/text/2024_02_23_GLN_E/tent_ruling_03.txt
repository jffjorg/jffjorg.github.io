TENTATIVE
RULING ON MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES 
BACKGROUND
On
10/27/2022, Plaintiff, Khachik Ayvazian, filed the Complaint in this action
against Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., a corporation; Galpin Volkswagen, a
business entity, form unknown; and DOES 1-40 inclusive.
The first three causes of action – (1) Violation of
Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty, (2) Violation of Song-Beverly
Act – Breach of Implied Warranty, and (3) Violation of Song-Beverly Act –
Section 1793.2 – are alleged against Defendant Volkswagen Group of America,
Inc.
The fourth cause of action for negligent repair is
alleged against Galpin Volkswagen.
Plaintiff alleges that on or about November 8, 2019,
Plaintiff leased the Subject Vehicle, a 2019 Volkswagen Jetta. (See Compl. ¶¶7-9.)
RELIEF REQUESTED
Plaintiff,
Khachik Ayvazian, moves the Court for an order compelling Defendant, Volkswagen
Group of America, Inc. (“VW”), to serve further responses to Plaintiff’s Second
Set of Requests for Production (“RFP”) Nos. 38-58.
Plaintiff also move for an order that VW and/or its counsel
pay to the moving party the sum of $3,210.00 as the reasonable costs and
attorney fees incurred by Plaintiff for these proceedings. (Decl. Mellgren, ¶
6, Ex. G.)
This motion is based on Code of Civil Procedure §§
2031.210, subd. (a) and 2031.310, subd. (a) due to (what Plaintiff
characterizes as) VW’s evasive and incomplete statements in response to the
written discovery requests. A declaration conforming to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2016.040 was concurrently filed. Plaintiff states VW has not produced
all documents in response to these RFPs. 
Procedural
Moving Party: Plaintiff, Khachik Ayvazian
Responding Party: Defendant, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. (VW or
Defendant)
Proof of Service Timely Filed (CRC Rule 3.1300): Ok

16/21 Court Days Lapsed (CCP 1005(b)):No/Yes. This motion was served
electronically on January 29, 2024. Sixteen court days before the hearing would
be January 30, 2024. However, since 2 calendar days must be added because
service was done electronically, the motion would have had to have been served
by January 28, 2024. However, “Plaintiff’s Notice After Post Mediation Status
Conference Hearing” filed on 2/5/2024 indicates that the Court advanced this
hearing from March 15, 2024 to February 23, 2024. This notice indicates that
Defendant objected, but the Court ordered the hearing date advanced to the
instant hearing date.

Proper Address (CCP §1013, §1013a, §1013b): Ok

LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL FURTHER – REQUESTS
FOR PRODUCTION
Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may obtain discovery
regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action..., if the matter either is itself admissible in
evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.”  The Section
specifically provides that “[d]iscovery may relate to the claim or defense of
the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action,” and that discovery
“may be obtained of the identity and location of persons having knowledge of
any discoverable matter, as well as of the existence, description, nature,
custody, condition and location of any document, electronically stored
information, tangible thing, or land or other property.”

 
CCP § 2031.310(a) provides that a party demanding a document
inspection may move for an order compelling further responses to the demand if
the demanding party deems that:
“(1)   A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete.
  (2)   A
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
  (3)  
An objection in the response is without merit or too general.”  

 
Under
CCP § 2031.310 (b)(1), “The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.”  
 
“In
the more specific context of a demand for production of a tangible thing, the
party who asks the trial court to compel production must show “good cause” for
the request—but unless there is a legitimate privilege issue or claim of
attorney work product, that burden is met simply by a fact-specific showing of
relevance.” (TBG Ins. Services Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96
Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)


PROCEDURAL ANALYSIS
45-Day Requirement
Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days
of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response,
or on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any right
to compel a further response to the demand. (CCP §2031.310(c).) 
This motion appears timely.
Meet and Confer
“The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040.” (CCP § 2031.310(b)(2).)
Here, Plaintiff’s counsel alleged she met and
conferred. (Mellgren Decl. ¶4.) Opposition’s argument that Plaintiff did not
meet and confer is unavailing.
Discovery Cutoff


“Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any
party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings
on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or
before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the
action.” (CCP § 2024.020(a).)
Here, the parties are to address at the hearing
whether or not the hearing on this motion complies with the discovery cutoff.
TENTATIVE RULING


The instant motion pertains to RPDs, Set Two, numbers 38-58.
As to RPDs 38-40, and 43-44, the Court sustains
Defendant’s objections as to vague and ambiguous. Defendant explains how these
requests use terms that are not clearly defined such as random mixes of numbers
where it is unclear what the numbers are associated with.
Further, as to 38-40 and 43-57, the Court sustains
Defendant’s objections as to overbroad because the requests are not limited to
vehicles in California.
As to 58, the Court also sustains Defendant’s
objection as to overbroad. RPD 58 requests documents evidencing the total
number 2019 Volkswagen Jetta vehicles sold in California through the present
date. Movant did not establish good cause as to this request and the Court is
uncertain as to why the total number of 2019 Volkswagen Jettas sold, even those
not suffering from any of the defects that Plaintiff’s vehicle is suffering
from, is relevant to the instant action.
Further, as to 45-57, the Court also sustains
Defendant’s objections as to overbroad because the requests are not limited to vehicles
of the same make, model, and year of the subject vehicle.
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further response to RPDs,
Set Two, numbers 38-40, and 43-58 is DENIED.
As to RPDs 41 and 42, Defendant’s objections are
overruled. Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to RPDs 41-42 is
GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to provide code compliant further responses
without objection within 10 days of the instant hearing.
 
Sanctions


Except as provided
in subdivision (j), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with § 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (CCP § 2031.310(h).)
 
“The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
Plaintiff also
moves the Court for an order that VW and/or its counsel pay to the moving party
the sum of $3,210.00 as the reasonable costs and attorney fees incurred by
Plaintiff for these proceedings.
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel bases the fee request on the following: (1) An hourly rate of $450; (2)
Three hours drafting the moving papers, including the motion, declaration,
compiling exhibits, and the proposed order; and (3) Four hours to review
Defendant’s opposition and any responses to the RFPs, draft the reply, prepare
for oral argument, and remotely attend the hearing. 
 
Defendant argues
that it acted with substantial justification because it properly objected to
the requests.
 
The Court will
hear argument as to sanctions.
