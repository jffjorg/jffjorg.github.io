```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's motion to compel further discovery responses is confusing and unclear. The judge is unclear as to what specific documents are being requested and what the issues are with the defendant's motion. The judge notes that the plaintiff produced some documents, but not all, and that the plaintiff's counsel sent an email on September 15, 2023, requesting additional time to comply with the court order. The judge is also unclear as to why the defendant is seeking sanctions under CCP § 2031.320(c). The judge tentatively plans to deny all sanctions requests and will hear argument as to sanctions at the hearing. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's Opposition was late and that certain documents were not provided until the Opposition was submitted, which would indicate that all documents were not provided on August 1, 2023.
