Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses from the defendant. The plaintiff, Dietrich Wilhelm George Lusse, seeks to compel further responses to his Requests for Admission (Set One) because the defendant's initial responses were evasive and incomplete. The judge finds that the motion is moot as to the responses, as the defendant has already provided further responses. However, the judge does not find the motion moot as to sanctions, which the plaintiff is seeking against the defendant or his counsel for the defendant's failure to provide timely and complete responses.

The judge tentatively plans to grant sanctions in favor of the plaintiff, but will hear argument as to the appropriate amount. The judge notes that the plaintiff's counsel, Curtis J. Crawford, has not provided sufficient information in his declaration to fully assess the appropriate level of sanctions, and will require further argument on this issue.
