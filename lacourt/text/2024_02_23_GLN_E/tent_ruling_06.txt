RELIEF REQUESTED
Defendant, Elvis Madatyan, moves the Court for an order sustaining his demurrer
to the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and ninth causes of action of
Plaintiffs’ Complaint pursuant to CCP §430.10.
Defendant
moves to strike the following from Plaintiffs’ Complaint:
The
demand for “punitive damages” and “attorney fees” from the first, third, sixth,
and ninth causes of action and in the Prayer for Relief.  
PROCEDURAL ANALYSIS
Proof of Service Timely Filed (CRC Rule
3.1300): Ok
16/21 Court Days Lapsed (CCP 1005(b)): Ok
Proper Address (CCP §1013, §1013a, §1013b): Yes and No – Two attorneys are
listed on eCourt as the Plaintiffs’ counsel. Ignacio J. Lazo is listed as
Plaintiffs’ counsel, and Bobby Samini is also listed as Plaintiffs’ counsel. According
to the proof of service, this demurrer and motion to strike was served via
email to bsamini@saminilaw.com and andrew.sussman@saminilaw.com. Therefore, it
appears as if Bobby Samini was served this demurrer and motion to strike, but
Ignacio J. Lazo was not. Moving Defendant’s counsel can address this issue at
the hearing.
TENTATIVE RULING
“A party may amend its pleading once without leave of
the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is
filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before the demurrer
or motion to strike is heard if the amended pleading is filed and served no
later than the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or motion to
strike. A party may amend the pleading after the date for filing an opposition
to the demurrer or motion to strike, upon stipulation by the parties. The time
for responding to an amended pleading shall be computed from the date of
service of the amended pleading.” (CCP §472(a).)
The Complaint in this action was filed on 09/19/2023. Moving
Defendant’s demurrer and motion to strike was filed and served on 01/17/2024.
Since the instant hearing date is for 02/23/2024, the deadline for filing an opposition
to the instant demurrer and motion to strike would have been 02/08/2024. Here,
the First Amended Complaint (FAC) was filed on 02/02/2024, which is before the
opposition deadline for the instant demurrer and motion to strike.
Plaintiffs’ filing of the FAC after the filing of the
demurrer and motion to strike, but before the deadline for filing an opposition
to the demurrer or motion to strike, would normally moot the instant demurrer
and motion to strike. However, CCP §472(a) also specifies that the amended
pleading must be “…filed and served no later than the date for filing an
opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike.” (CCP §472(a); emph added.) 
The potential problem here is that the Defendants
named in the FAC are Edgar Madatyan; Elvis Madatyan; Glendale French Bakery,
Inc., dba Papillon International Bakery, a California corporation; and Liana
Yozalyan. The proof of service for the FAC indicates service by electronic mail
on Lewis Brisbois who appears to be counsel for Glendale French Bakery and
Liana Yozalyan, and it indicates electronic service on Shaghzo & Shaghzo
who appears to be counsel for Elvis Madatyan. The proof of service of the FAC
does not indicate service on Defendant Edgar Madatyan. Counsel for Plaintiffs
should address this issue at the hearing. If Plaintiffs’ counsel can address
this issue, the Court will likely find this demurrer and motion to strike moot
based on Plaintiffs’ filing of the FAC. 
As
stated in State Compensation Ins. Fund v. Superior Court:
“ ‘It is well established that an amendatory
pleading supersedes the original one, which ceases to perform any function as a
pleading.’ ” (Foreman & Clark Corp. v. Fallon, supra, 3
Cal.3d at p. 884, 92 Cal.Rptr. 162, 479 P.2d 362, quoting Meyer v.
State Board of Equalization (1954) 42 Cal.2d 376, 384, 267 P.2d
257.) Thus, an amended complaint supersedes all prior complaints. (Grell
v. Laci Le Beau Corp. (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1300, 1307, 87
Cal.Rptr.2d 358; Lee v. Bank of America (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th
197, 215, 32 Cal.Rptr.2d 388; 1 Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide:
Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2009) *1131 ¶
6:704, p. 6–177.) The amended complaint furnishes the sole basis for the cause
of action, and the original complaint ceases to have any effect
either as a pleading or as a basis for judgment. **93 (Anmaco,
Inc. v. Bohlken (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 891, 901, 16
Cal.Rptr.2d 675.)
 
Because there is but one complaint in a civil
action (Ford v. Superior Court (1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 338, 343,
109 Cal.Rptr. 844), the filing of an amended complaint moots a motion
directed to a prior complaint. (See Sylmar Air Conditioning v. Pueblo
Contracting Services, Inc. (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1049,
1054, 18 Cal.Rptr.3d 882 [filing of first amended complaint rendered moot
demurrer to original complaint].)
 
(State Compensation Ins. Fund v. Superior
Court (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1124, 1130-31.)
 
Further, the
parties are also reminded of their obligations under CCP §430.41(a), “…If an
amended complaint, cross-complaint, or answer is filed, the responding party
shall meet and confer again with the party who filed the amended pleading
before filing a demurrer to the amended pleading.”
 
The Court will
hear from Plaintiffs’ counsel as to the issue addressed above. The Court will
also hear from Defendants’ counsel on the service issue of the demurrer and
motion to strike.
