And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses to written discovery requests is as follows:

The court sustains Defendant's objections to RPDs 38-40, and 43-44 as vague and ambiguous. The court sustains Defendant's objections to RPDs 38-40, and 43-57 as overbroad. The court denies Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to RPDs 38-40, and 43-58. The court grants Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to RPDs 41-42.

The court will hear argument as to sanctions. The court is uncertain as to why the total number of 2019 Volkswagen Jettas sold, even those not suffering from any of the defects that Plaintiff's vehicle is suffering from, is relevant to the instant action.

The court orders Defendant to provide code-compliant further responses to RPDs 41-42 within 10 days of the instant hearing.
