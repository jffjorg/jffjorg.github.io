TENTATIVE RULING
Title of Motion
As a preliminary matter, the Court points out that eCourt
titles the motion on calendar for 2/23/2024 as a “Hearing on Motion to Compel
Further Discovery Responses.” However, Movant’s notice titles this as a “…Motion
to Compel Compliance With Document Production And For Issue, Termination and
Monetary Sanctions Against Plaintiff Visionary…”
Problems with Moving, Opposition, and
Reply Papers


Defendant moves under CCP § 2031.320(a) to compel
Plaintiff to comply and produce documents that Plaintiff was ordered to produce
on June 30, 2023. Opposition appears to concede it was ordered to produce documents.
In relevant part, the Opposition states, “On June 30, 2023, this Court ordered
Plaintiff to provide, without objections, all requested documents by August 1,
2023.” (Pl. Oppo. p. 3.)
“If a party filing a response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling under Sections 2031.210, 2031.220,
2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280 thereafter fails to permit the inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling in accordance with that party’s statement of
compliance, the demanding party may move for an order compelling compliance.”
(CCP §2031.320(a).)
Defendant’s motion is somewhat rambling, confusing,
and incoherent. 
Defendant appears to be seeking to compel compliance pertaining
to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, served on Plaintiff, based on further
responses granted by the Court on June 30, 2023 pertaining to Request for
Production of Documents, Set One. The Minute Order on June 30, 2023 with
respect to RPD, Set One, also stated, “Discovery documents are due by
8/1/2023.” (6/30/2023 Min. Order, p. 9.)
Based on Defendant’s motion, it is unclear what
Defendant is stating has not been produced, and it is also unclear what
specifically the Defendant wants the Court to order Plaintiff to do. 
RPD, Set One, appears to have 69 requests, but
Defendant does not make it clear to the Court as to which requests it has
issues with and what those issues are or how Plaintiff did not comply with each
request.
Defendant also argues “Plaintiff has produced
incomplete documents, and unfortunately the produced documents do not have a
Bate Stamp to identify which documents are in response to which request.
Defendant has done his best by taking screen shot of the folders produced and
attached to Rafik Ayvazi’s Declaration.” (Def. Mot. p.6.) 
As to this issue, the Court is unclear as to what
Defendant wants the Court to do, and the Court is unclear as to what legal
authority the Defendant is rooting its argument in. 
The Court notes the following, “Any documents or
category of documents produced in response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling shall be identified with the specific request number to
which the documents respond.” (CCP § 2031.280(a).) 
If Defendant is arguing that Plaintiff did not comply
with this requirement, then Plaintiff appears to need to do so. However, the
Court is unclear what the Defendant is talking about with respect to the Bate
Stamp issue. The Court surmises that the issues that Defendant is raising is
that there is no index showing which produced documents relate to which
requests for production, but will discuss this issue further at the hearing.
To add further confusion, the Opposition states, “All
responsive documents in Plaintiff’s possession, custody, and control were
produced on August 1, 2023.” (Pl. Oppo. p.3.) 
Though the Opposition states that Plaintiff complied
by August 1, 2023, the moving Defendant attached as Exhibit 3 to the Ayvazi
Declaration an email on September 15, 2023 in which Plaintiff’s counsel stated,
“Hi Rafik. Yes. I do intent to fully comply with the court order. Can I have
one additional week to review the order and comply?” (Ayvazi Decl.¶6, Ex. 3.) 
This email would seem to indicate that the Court’s
Order was not complied with by 8/1/2023, if Plaintiff was asking for an additional
week on 9/15/2023.
To add even further confusion, the Opposition cites
Exhibits by letter in the Melkonian Declaration but the Exhibits in the
Melkonian Declaration appear to be labeled 1 and 2.
The Reply accurately points out that the Opposition
was late. The Court agrees and finds that the Opposition was filed and served late;
however, it still considers the Opposition papers.
In Reply, it is still unclear as to what precisely Defendant
wants. The Reply argues that certain Folders/Exhibits, such as 3,9, and 24, did
not even exist until the opposition was filed, and that this indicates that
Plaintiff did not comply with the previous court order. 
Reply also notes various issues with requests 40 and
44. 
Defendant also moves for sanctions against Plaintiff
under CCP § 2031.320(c). 
As stated in CCP § 2031.320(b)-(c):
(b) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel compliance with a demand, unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), if a
party then fails to obey an order compelling inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).
 
(CCP §2031.320(b)-(c).)
 
As a preliminary matter, the Court is unclear as to why
Defendant moved for sanctions under 2031.320(c). It appears as if the sanctions
request here would fall under 2031.230(b) because this is Defendant’s first
motion to compel compliance, as opposed to its prior motion to compel further
responses. CCP §2031.230(c) appears to pertain to when a party failed to obey the
initial order compelling compliance, and the Court is confused how 2031.320(c)
would apply if this is Defendant’s first motion to compel compliance. 
 
The Plaintiff requests sanctions under § 2031.320(b).
 
The Court will hear argument as to sanctions. The Court
tentatively plans to deny all sanctions requests. Defendant’s motion is confusing
Plaintiff’s Opposition was late, and it appears as if it’s possible that
Plaintiff is not being fully forthright: Plaintiff stated he fully complied by
August 1, 2023; however, his email on 9/15/2023 seems to indicate differently. 
 
Further, if the Reply is accurate, certain documents were
not provided until the Opposition was submitted, which would indicate that all
documents were not provided on August 1, 2023.
 
The Court will hear argument as to sanctions and
Defendant needs to explain what this motion requests in a further order from
this Court.
