And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for sanctions filed by Plaintiff Cheryl Ollison. The motion seeks to preclude Defendant Pasadena Hospital Association LTD dba Huntington Hospital from paying monetary sanctions for its misuse of discovery in failing to comply with the Court's Order to provide responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's notice of motion is unclear and incorrect in its reference to CCP §2030.030, which deals with propounding interrogatories, not sanctions.

The Court notes that the Defendant failed to provide responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One within the 21-day period ordered by the Court, and that Plaintiff has not received responses to date. However, the Court finds that the Defendant's failure to provide responses was due to circumstances beyond its control, including the death of its former counsel and the need for its new counsel to become familiar with the case.

Based on these circumstances, the Court finds that it would be unjust to award sanctions to the Plaintiff. Therefore, the Court denies the Plaintiff's motion for sanctions.
