And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Elvis Madatyan against Plaintiffs Robert Torosian, Marina Fermiyan, and Aloyst Gregory Torosian. The demurrer seeks to sustain the demurrer to certain causes of action, while the motion to strike seeks to strike certain demands, including punitive damages and attorney fees. The Court notes that the First Amended Complaint was filed after the demurrer and motion to strike, but before the opposition deadline, which would normally moot the instant demurrer and motion to strike. However, the Court is concerned about the service issues with the proof of service of the First Amended Complaint, which does not indicate service on Defendant Edgar Madatyan. The Court will hear from Plaintiffs' counsel to address this issue and will also hear from Defendants' counsel on the service issue of the demurrer and motion to strike.
