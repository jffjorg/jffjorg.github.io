  RE:
 
plaintiff’s request for court judgment by
  default



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Zenayda Servin         
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Request for Court Judgment by Default 
Plaintiff Zenayda Servin (“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this
action on November 2, 2023, against defendants Luis A. Perez d/b/a Alameda
Motors and Felipe Perez d/b/a Fix and Go Auto Repair (“Defendants”). 
On December 7, 2023, the clerk entered the defaults of Defendants.  Thereafter, on January 9, 2024, Plaintiff
filed documents in support of a request for court judgment by default against
Defendants.  
The court notes several defects with Plaintiff’s request for court
judgment by default against Defendants. 
First, although Plaintiff filed declarations and a proposed judgment,
Plaintiff did not file a request for default judgment against Defendants on the
mandatory “Request for Entry of Default (Application to Enter Default)” on
Judicial Council form CIV-100 as required. 
(Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1800, subd. (a).) 
Second, although Plaintiff appears to request an award of interest,
Plaintiff did not submit a declaration adequately setting forth the calculation
of interest requested.  (Cal. Rules of
Ct., rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(3)l JUD-100, ¶ 6.)  
The court therefore denies plaintiff Zenayda Servin’s request for
court judgment by default against defendants Luis A. Perez d/b/a Alameda Motors
and Felipe Perez d/b/a Fix and Go Auto Repair, without prejudice to plaintiff
Zenayda Servin’s filing a revised set of default judgment documents required by
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  March 1, 2024
