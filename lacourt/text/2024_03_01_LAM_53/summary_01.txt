The plaintiff has not pleaded facts establishing that it complied with the Government Claims Act, and the First Amended Complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action. The protests submitted by the plaintiff do not constitute "claims as presented" and the claims filed by the plaintiff in June 2023 are untimely. The judge also denies the defendant's motion to strike as moot since the demurrer has been sustained. The judge orders the defendant to lodge and serve a proposed order of dismissal within 10 days of the date of the order.
