The court notes that (1) in connection with the first and second causes of
action, Plaintiff “requests an injunction to prevent Defendants from further
violating Government Code section[s] 4525, et seq. [and] 4529.12[,]” and (2)
the Government Claims Act “does not apply . . . to nonpecuniary actions, ‘such
as those seeking injunctive, specific or declaratory relief.’”  (FAC ¶¶ 42, 49; Canova v. Trustees of
Imperial Irrigation Dist. Employee Pension Plan (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th
1487, 1493.)  However, because the
requests for injunctive relief are vague and do not seek to enjoin any specific
future activity, the court finds that the primary purpose of these causes of
action is to recover damages and therefore Plaintiff must comply with the claim
presentation requirements to allege them against Defendant.  (Canova, supra, 150 Cal.App.4th
at p. 1493 [“In determining whether the Claims Act applies, the critical
question is whether the recovery of money or damages was the primary purpose of
[the plaintiff’s] claims”].)
