And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling states that regardless of whether the Controller is the proper entity for audits and refunds, the Los Angeles County Recorder does not need to be joined to obtain relief. The Judge also rules that the second cause of action, conversion, stands at this stage. The Judge notes that conversion is a tort, but the plaintiff's request for restitution is distinct from seeking damages.
