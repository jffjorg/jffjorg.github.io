The judge has ruled that the Controller's demurrer (a motion to dismiss the case) is overruled. The judge has also granted the plaintiff leave to amend its complaint to add a new cause of action. The plaintiff alleges that the Controller is responsible for collecting overcharged fees from county recorders and seeks refunds and injunctive relief. The judge has rejected the Controller's argument that it is immune from liability for the overcharged fees. The judge has also found that an injunction is available for audit and refund purposes. The case involves a dispute over fees for recording real estate instruments and the Controller's role in collecting and remitting those fees.
