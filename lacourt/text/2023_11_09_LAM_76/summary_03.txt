And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to change the venue to Santa Cruz County, finding that the motion is untimely. The Complaint was filed on April 11, 2022, and the defendants' time to respond was May 25, 2023, but they filed their motion on July 12, 2022. The Judge notes that the defendants may bring a motion to transfer the case to Santa Cruz County based on convenience of witnesses and ends of justice under Civ. Proc. Code, § 397, but this must be done within a reasonable time after the answer is filed. The Judge also grants the defendants' request for judicial notice of the Complaint filed in this action. Finally, the Judge orders the defendants to respond to the Complaint within 30 days.
