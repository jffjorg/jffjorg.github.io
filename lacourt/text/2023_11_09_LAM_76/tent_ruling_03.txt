ANALYSIS
Motion To Change Venue
Request For Judicial Notice
            Defendants’
request that the Court take judicial notice of the Complaint filed in this action
is GRANTED per Evid. Code, § 452(d)(court records).
 
Discussion
 
Defendants Bruce Canepa and Canepa Group,
Inc. move to change venue to Santa Cruz County pursuant to Civ. Proc. Code, §§ 395
and 396b(a).
 
            Plaintiff’s
argument that this motion to change venue is untimely is well-taken.
 
            The Complaint
was filed on April 11, 2022. Substituted service was effective on April 25, 2022.
Defendants’ time to respond to the Complaint was May 25, 2023. The parties stipulated
to an extension until June 24, 2022 for Defendants to respond. Defendants filed
their motion to change venue on July 12, 2022. 
 
(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 396a[2],
if an action or proceeding is commenced in a court having jurisdiction of the subject
matter thereof, other than the court designated as the proper court for the trial
thereof, under this title, the action may, notwithstanding, be tried in the court
where commenced, unless the defendant, at the time he or she answers, demurs,
or moves to strike, or, at his or her option, without answering, demurring, or moving
to strike and within the time otherwise allowed to respond to the complaint,
files with the clerk, a notice of motion for an order transferring the action or
proceeding to the proper court, together with proof of service, upon the adverse
party, of a copy of those papers. Upon the hearing of the motion the court shall,
if it appears that the action or proceeding was not commenced in the proper court,
order the action or proceeding transferred to the proper court.

. . .

(e) If the motion to transfer is denied, the court
shall allow the defendant time to move to strike, demur, or otherwise plead if the
defendant has not previously filed a response.


(Civ. Proc. Code, § 396b [bold emphasis added].)
 
            A motion for
change of venue pursuant to Civ. Proc. Code, § 396b is properly denied if it is
untimely. 
 
It also appears
that the motion for change of place of trial on the ground that Riverside County
was not a proper county was not made at the time of the filing of the answer and
demurrer. This motion was properly denied. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 395 and 396b.) 

(E. C. Livingston Co. v. Blythe Alfalfa Growers
Asso. (1956) 139 Cal. App.2d 161, 163-164.)
 
            As such, the
motion to change venue pursuant to Civ. Proc. Code, § 396b is DENIED. Defendants
are given 30 days to respond to the Complaint[3]. 
 
The Court notes that to the extent
that Defendants assert that the convenience of witnesses and ends of justice
would be promoted by a change of venue, they may bring a motion to transfer pursuant
to Civ. Proc. Code, § 397.
 
(c) [3:559.5] Timeliness: Although CCP § 397 contains no express time limitation, a motion
for change of venue based on convenience of witnesses must be made within a reasonable time after the answer
is filed. What constitutes a “reasonable” time rests largely in the trial court's
discretion. [Cooney v. Cooney (1944) 25 C2d 202, 208, 153 P2d 334, 338]
