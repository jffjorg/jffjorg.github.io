Ruling:      Petitioner J.G. Wentworth
Originations, LLC’s Petition for Approval for Transfer of Structured Settlement
Payment Rights is continued to permit Payee to receive financial and legal
advice.
 

 
On October 8, 2024, J.G. Wentworth
Originations, LLC (“Petitioner”) filed the operative First Amended Petition
(“FAP”) for Approval for Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment Rights pursuant
to California Insurance Code Section 10134 et seq.
 
The FAP alleges Samuel Moreno Jr.,
aka S.M. (“Payee” or “Transferor”) has agreed to sell the periodic sum payments
he received in a settlement agreement on a personal injury claim to Petitioner.
(FAP ¶¶3-4, 7, Ex. A.) Specifically, Payee Moreno entered into a Structured
Settlement Annuity Contract with Prudential Insurance Company of America as
follows:
 
1 lump sum payment of $25,000.00 on
August 25, 2021;
1 lump sum payment of $50,000.00 on
August 25, 2026;
1 lump sum payment of $75,000.00 on
August 25, 2031;
1 lump sum payment of $100,000.00
on August 25, 2036;
1 lump sum payment of $125,000.00
on August 25, 2041;
1 lump sum payment of $150,000.00
on August 25, 2046;
1 lump sum payment of $200,000.00
on August 25, 2051; and
1 lump sum payment of $496,913.37
on August 25, 2056. 
 
(FAP, at p. 5, Ex. C.)
 
            In a prior
transfer, Payee Moreno transferred a total of $150,000.00 in future lump sum
payments as follows in exchange for $100,000.00 at an Annual Discount Rate
(“ADR”) of 5.27 percent:
 
1 lump sum payment of $25,000.00 on
August 25, 2021;
1 lump sum payment of $50,000.00 on
August 25, 2026; and
1 lump sum payment of $75,000.00 on
August 25, 2031.
 
The proposed Transfer Agreement in
this instant case seeks to transfer $450,000.00 in future payments as follows
to Petitioner in exchange for $70,000.00 to Payee Moreno at an ADR of 8.65
percent:
 
1 lump sum payment of $100,000.00
on August 25, 2041;
1 lump sum payment of $150,000.00
on August 25, 2046; and
1 lump sum payment of $200,000.00
on August 25, 2051.
 
(FAP, ¶4, Ex. A.)
 
            According
to the California Disclosure Statement, those future payments have a discounted
present value equal to $155,147.70, calculated by applying the discount rate of
4.8 percent utilized by the Internal Revenue Service to value annuities in
probate proceedings. 
 
(FAP, at 10:19-21, Ex. B.)
 
Legal Standard
 
“[T]o ensure that a transfer of a structured settlement payment
has no adverse tax impact on any of the persons involved in a factoring
transaction, in January 2002, Congress amended the Internal Revenue Code by
adopting section 5891 to expressly sanction a tax-free transfer of structured
settlement payments.” (321 Henderson Receivables Origination LLC v. Sioteco
(2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1059, 1065.)“In California, the court approval process
is governed by the Structured Settlement Transfer Act, (hereinafter SSTA),
which requires: (1) disclosures to the transferor of the structured settlement
payment rights, (2) notice to the Attorney General, and (3) court approval.” (Id.)
“The court-approval process requires the factoring company to file a petition
in the county in which the transferor resides for approval of the transfer,
attaching copies of the petition, the transfer agreement, the disclosure form,
the annuity contract, any qualified assignment agreement and the structured
settlement agreement, a list of the names and ages of the transferor’s
dependents, notice of the court hearing date, and notice of a right to
respond.” (Id. at p. 1066.)
 
Discussion
 
Petitioner contends the terms of
the proposed California Purchase Contract (“Transfer Agreement”) between Payee Moreno
and Petitioner is fair and reasonable. As mentioned above, the proposed
Transfer Agreement seeks to transfer $450,000.00 in future lump sum payments to
be paid to Payee Moreno from his Structured Settlement Annuity Contract to
Petitioner in exchange for $70,000.00 at an ADR of 8.65 percent. (FAP, Ex. A.)  The Amounts Payee Moreno is transferring to
Petitioner is the right to receive future payments totaling $450,000 as
follows:
 
1 lump sum payment of $100,000.00
on August 25, 2041;
1 lump sum payment of $150,000.00
on August 25, 2046; and
1 lump sum payment of $200,000.00
on August 25, 2051.
 
Petitioner has provided the
proposed Transfer Agreement and disclosure form; disclosure statement for
California; and the Structured Settlement Annuity Contract with Prudential
Insurance Company of America (“Annuity Issuer”). (FAP, at p. 5, Exs. A-C.)
Petitioner also submitted the Statement of Professional Representation signed
by Payee Moreno attesting to his waiver of independent professional
representation. (Id. at p. 9, Ex. D.) Finally, Petitioner has lodged
with the Court, a copy of the underlying settlement agreement, which contains a
confidentiality clause. 
 
Here, Payee Moreno declares that he
plans to use the funds from the proposed transaction to purchase a new car and
do home improvement to fix/remediate the dry rot all around the wood in his
house. (Moreno Decl., ¶11.)
 
Pursuant to Insurance Code Section
10139.5(b), “When determining whether the proposed transfer should be approved,
including whether the transfer is fair, reasonable, and in the payee’s best
interest, taking into account the welfare and support of the payee’s
dependents, the court shall consider the totality of the circumstances,
including, but not limited to, all of the following:
(1) The reasonable
preference and desire of the payee to complete the proposed transaction, taking
into account the payee’s age, mental capacity, legal knowledge, and apparent
maturity level.
(2) The stated
purpose of the transfer.
(3) The payee’s
financial and economic situation.
(4) The terms of
the transaction, including whether the payee is transferring monthly or lump
sum payments or all or a portion of his or her future payments.
(5) Whether, when
the settlement was completed, the future periodic payments that are the subject
of the proposed transfer were intended to pay for the future medical care and
treatment of the payee relating to injuries sustained by the payee in the incident
that was the subject of the settlement and whether the payee still needs those
future payments to pay for that future care and treatment.
(6) Whether, when
the settlement was completed, the future periodic payments that are the subject
of the proposed transfer were intended to provide for the necessary living
expenses of the payee and whether the payee still needs the future structured
settlement payments to pay for future necessary living expenses.
(7) Whether the
payee is, at the time of the proposed transfer, likely to require future
medical care and treatment for the injuries that the payee sustained in
connection with the incident that was the subject of the settlement and whether
the payee lacks other resources, including insurance, sufficient to cover those
future medical expenses.
(8) Whether the
payee has other means of income or support, aside from the structured
settlement payments that are the subject of the proposed transfer, sufficient
to meet the payee's future financial obligations for maintenance and support of
the payee's dependents, specifically including, but not limited to, the payee's
child support obligations, if any. The payee shall disclose to the transferee
and the court his or her court-ordered child support or maintenance obligations
for the court's consideration.
(9) Whether the
financial terms of the transaction, including the discount rate applied to
determine the amount to be paid to the payee, the expenses and costs of the
transaction for both the payee and the transferee, the size of the transaction,
the available financial alternatives to the payee to achieve the payee's stated
objectives, are fair and reasonable.
(10) Whether the
payee completed previous transactions involving the payee's structured
settlement payments and the timing and size of the previous transactions and
whether the payee was satisfied with any previous transaction.
(11) Whether the
transferee attempted previous transactions involving the payee's structured
settlement payments that were denied, or that were dismissed or withdrawn prior
to a decision on the merits, within the past five years.
(12) Whether, to
the best of the transferee’s knowledge after making inquiry with the payee, the
payee has attempted structured settlement payment transfer transactions with
another person or entity, other than the transferee, that were denied, or which
were dismissed or withdrawn prior to a decision on the merits, within the past
five years.
(13) Whether the
payee, or his or her family or dependents, are in or are facing a hardship
situation.
(14) Whether the
payee received independent legal or financial advice regarding the transaction.
The court may deny or defer ruling on the petition for approval of a transfer
of structured settlement payment rights if the court believes that the payee does
not fully understand the proposed transaction and that independent legal or
financial advice regarding the transaction should be obtained by the payee.
(15) Any other
factors or facts that the payee, the transferee, or any other interested party
calls to the attention of the reviewing court or that the court determines
should be considered in reviewing the transfer.”
 
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5(b).)
 
The Court finds that under the
totality of the circumstances, the proposed Transfer Agreement is not fair and
reasonable. Payee Moreno declares that he is a 38 years old, single male with
no minor children and no child support obligations. (Moreno Decl., ¶8.) He
avers that he is currently experiencing a financial hardship due unemployment
and only receives $1,000.00 from Supplemental Security Income (“SSI”) and
$100.00 in Social Security Administration (“SSA”) monthly. (Id. ¶11.)
However, the declaration provides no information as to how long
Transferor/Payee has been unemployed and if he is actively looking for
employment. Similarly, Payee Moreno’s declaration merely states the
remediation work on his house “will be a very expensive fix that my insurance
will not cover” without stating how much it will cost to fix the dry rot all
around the wood in his home, how much the insurance is willing to cover, or if
there are any alternative insurance options he could obtain to fix the issue. Likewise,
Payee Moreno does not state what type of car he is looking to purchase, how
much it will cost to purchase said vehicle, whether the purchase will be
financed/leased/paid for outright, or any other details for the Court to
evaluate the reasonableness of the proposed transaction. The use of the word
“new” suggest that Payee Moreno already has a vehicle but he provides no
specifics as to whether this car is currently financed/leased/paid off, how
much maintaining this car costs him monthly (if at all), or whether there are any
issues with the car, which necessitates purchasing a new car. Additionally,
Payee Moreno does not state what his living expenses are and how much of his
SSI and SSA benefits contribute to these expenses. There is no indication from
the facts that Payee Moreno has considered how the proposed Transfer might affect
his SSI and SSA eligibility.
 
Also, Payee Moreno completed a
prior transfer transaction, which was approved on January 31, 2020 in Los
Angeles Superior Court case no. 19BBCP00482. (Moreno Decl., ¶9.) Payee Moreno
received $100,000.00 in exchange for transferring his rights to receive
$150,000.00 in future lump sum payments. (Id.) He provides no specifics
as to what the money was used for and how much of it remains, if any. The
remaining balance for guaranteed lump sum payments under the Annuity Contract
is $1,071,913.37, thus the proposed transaction would leave $621,913.37
remaining to be paid to Payee Moreno in guaranteed lump sum payments as
follows:
 
1 lump sum payment of $100,000.00
on August 25, 2036;
1 lump sum payment of $25,000.00 on
August 25, 2041; and 
1 lump sum payment of $496,913.37
on August 25, 2056.
 
 Lastly, Petitioner is required to pay up to
$1,500.00 for independent professional advice, thus Payee Moreno would not
suffer any financial harm in seeking such advice prior to transferring
$450,000.00 of future lump sum payments. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court
is inclined to deny Petitioner J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC’s Motion for
Approval for Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment Rights. The Court does
not find that Payee’s purported use of the funds to be reasonable. The Court
does not find that the amount ($70,000.00) Payee is expected to receive is fair
in light of Payee giving up the right to receive $450,000.00 in future payments.
The Court believes the Payee should obtain independent legal and financial
advice, at least some of which can be paid for by Petitioner. As such, the
Court continues the hearing to permit Payee to receive independent financial
and legal advice. The declaration of said professional advisor shall be
submitted to the Court. Finally, the Court encourages Mr. Moreno to consider
how this proposed transaction might affect his SSI and SSA eligibility; other
options that could supplement his meager income on a monthly or quarterly
basis; and other ways to finance his purchase of a new car and home
improvement, including loans.
