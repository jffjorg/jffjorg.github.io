Moving Parties:          Plaintiff Rodney Earl Morgan
 
Responding Party:      Defendants General Motors LLC 
HEARING: Motion To Compel the
Deposition of Defendant’s Person Most Qualified
 
            The Court considered the moving,
opposition, and reply papers.
 
RULING
 
The Court grants the Motion to Compel Deposition of Defendants PMQ
as to Categories 6, 9, 31-34, and 42,
as well as RPDs 1, 2, 4, 7-15, and 42. The Court denies the Motion to Compel
Deposition of Defendants PMQ as to all other Categories and RPDs.
 
BACKGROUND
 
            On October
27, 2022, Plaintiff Rodney
Earl Morgan filed the Complaint
alleging causes of action for breach of express warranty in violation of the
Song-Beverly Act and breach of implied warranty in violation of the
Song-Beverly Act against Defendants General Motors LLC and Penske
Cadillac Buick GMC.
            
            On May 29, 2024,
Plaintiff served a Notice of Deposition of Defendant’s Person Most Qualified
(PMQ) detailing 50 Matters for Examination requested and containing 46 Requests
for Production of Documents for deposition. 
            
On July 2, 2024, Defendant served its objections to
Plaintiff’s Notice of PMQ Deposition. Plaintiff attempted to meet and confer on
the same day, but Defendant did not respond.
 
            On August 9, 2024,
Plaintiff reached out to Defendant and noted that “GM’s objections evasively
stated it “may” produce its PMQ, and requested GM clarify if it was refusing to
produce a PMQ at all so that Plaintiff could proceed accordingly with a motion
if that was the case.” (Gonzales-Mccaulley Decl. ¶ 8.) Defendant did not
respond.
 
            On August 26, 2024,
Plaintiff attempted to meet and confer with Defendant regarding a date for the
deposition of Defendant’s PMQ.
 
            On August 30, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the instant motion.
 
            On September 23, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the Reply.
 
            On October 1, 2024,
Defendant filed the Opposition. (The Opposition was served on Plaintiff earlier
but was not filed by the Court until October 1 because of technical
difficulties.)
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450,
section (a) provides:  
 
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice.” 
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)  
 
The motion must “be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition…by a declaration stating that the petitioner has
contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (b)(2).) A court shall impose monetary sanctions if the motion
to compel is granted unless the one subject to sanctions acted with substantial
justification or other circumstances would make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. (Code. Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            Plaintiff requests
that the Court order Defendant to produce its PMQ for deposition and the
production of the requested documents.
 
Meet and Confer
 
“The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280 subd. (b).)
 
Defendant argues
that Plaintiff failed to satisfy the statutory requirement of a good faith meet
and confer effort before filing the motion to compel. (Code.
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450.) The burden is on
the moving party to demonstrate a reasonable and genuine attempt to resolve the
dispute informally without court intervention. (Stewart v. Colonial Western
Agency, Inc. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016–1017.) 
 
Defendant contends
that Plaintiff merely sent emails demanding deposition dates but did not engage
with Defendant’s well-founded objections to the deposition categories and
document requests. Defendant highlights that it offered its PMQ for deposition
on relevant categories and previously produced documents, but Plaintiff refused
to address the actual disputes informally. Defendant asserts that scheduling
dates alone does not constitute a good faith meet and confer when the real
issue involves the scope and content of the deposition notice.
 
Defendant concludes
that because Plaintiff failed to address these disputes informally or attempt
to resolve the objections, the motion to compel should be denied.
 
Plaintiff argues
that Defendant’s claim that Plaintiff did not meet and confer in good faith is
completely false. Plaintiff asserts that they made repeated attempts over
months to discuss the deposition with Defendant’s counsel but received no
response. Plaintiff began efforts to meet and confer as early as July 2, 2024,
reaching out multiple times to request alternative deposition dates and to
schedule a telephonic meeting to address Defendant’s objections regarding the
scope of the deposition. (Decl. Gonzales-McCaulley, Ex. 3.)
 
Plaintiff contends
that Defendant’s failure to respond or engage in any discussion left them with
no choice but to file the motion to compel. Plaintiff concludes that Defendant
acted in bad faith by disregarding all meet and confer efforts, and it was
therefore impossible for Plaintiff to resolve the dispute informally.
 
Plaintiff's
Counsel’s declaration shows multiple attempts to reach out to Defendant about
both scheduling the deposition and the scope of the deposition. (Decl.
Gonzales-McCaulley, Ex. 3.) Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff has
satisfied the meet and confer requirement.
 
Good Cause
 
Plaintiff argues
that the Discovery Act grants the right to take the deposition of any party,
including a designated PMQ, and mandates the production of requested documents.
The deposition notice served by Plaintiff complied with statutory requirements,
being served 43 days before the scheduled date, with specific matters for
examination clearly outlined. Despite these proper steps, Defendant has refused
to provide its PMQ for deposition or meaningfully engage in resolving the
dispute, ignoring repeated meet and confer efforts.
 
Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.450, if a deponent fails to appear or produce documents,
the moving party may seek an order compelling compliance. Plaintiff highlights
that Defendant’s conduct, refusing to produce its PMQ and evading substantive
responses, constitutes a misuse of the discovery process.
 
Plaintiff further
argues that the information sought is directly relevant to the claims under the
Song-Beverly Act. Specifically, the deposition will address issues central to
Plaintiff's claims, including the presence of defects in the vehicle, Defendant’s
inability to repair the vehicle after a reasonable number of attempts, and
whether Defendant willfully violated its obligations under the Act. Courts have
recognized that a manufacturer’s knowledge of ongoing issues and its
decision-making processes in response to consumer complaints are critical in
determining willful violations. (Krotin v. Porsche (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th
294, 302-03; Lukather v. General Motors, LLC (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th
1041, 1049.)  Evidence regarding
Defendant’s policies, procedures, and training on handling consumer complaints
is also relevant, as it may indicate a pattern of behavior or intent to hinder
consumers from seeking statutory remedies. (Jensen v. BMW of North America,
Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 136.)
 
Plaintiff
emphasizes that the requested information is reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. Courts interpret relevance broadly in discovery matters,
and the information sought will help establish Defendant’s knowledge, its
response to repair issues, and any willful violation of the Act. Plaintiff
concludes that Defendant’s refusal to produce its PMQ for deposition and
failure to provide alternative dates justify an order compelling compliance.
 
In opposition,
Defendant argues that discovery must be limited to relevant, targeted
information that pertains directly to the claims, defenses, and issues in
dispute. While Plaintiff seeks to compel a broad deposition of Defendant’s PMQ
and extensive document production, Defendant asserts that many of the requested
categories and documents are overly broad, irrelevant, and burdensome.
Defendant emphasizes that it has already produced relevant documents and agreed
to produce a PMQ on specific topics directly related to Plaintiff’s breach of
warranty claims.
 
Defendant contends
that Plaintiff’s requests for testimony and documents about general policies,
procedures, and statistics, such as Defendant’s “reduction of warranty claim
buybacks” or “repurchase statistics,” are irrelevant to the issue at hand:
whether Defendant failed to repair Plaintiff’s vehicle within a reasonable
number of attempts. Defendant argues that breach of warranty claims are
case-specific and tied to the consumer’s vehicle and its repairs. Testimony or
evidence about unrelated policies or complaints does not tend to prove or
disprove any material fact in this case.
 
Defendant argues
that courts must limit discovery when the burden, expense, or intrusiveness
clearly outweighs the likelihood of uncovering admissible evidence. (Code.
Civ. Proc., § 2017.020.)
Defendant stresses that Plaintiff’s overly broad requests constitute an abuse
of the discovery process, violating the principle that discovery should
facilitate litigation rather than create unnecessary burden or leverage.
 
Defendant further
asserts that Plaintiff has failed to show why the requested information is
essential or even relevant to his claims. The only issue in this case is
whether Defendant repaired Plaintiff’s specific vehicle under warranty.
Defendant has already agreed to produce a PMQ to testify on Category Nos. 1,
3-5, 7-8, 10, 13, 21-22, and 42, which includes repair history and
communications concerning Plaintiff’s vehicle, and has provided responsive
documents. Testimony about Defendant’s general internal policies or unrelated
consumer complaints, Defendant argues, has no bearing on this case and is
outside the scope of permissible discovery.
 
In conclusion, Defendant
asserts that Plaintiff’s requests are overly broad, irrelevant, and burdensome.
Defendant urges the court to deny Plaintiff’s motion to compel and limit
discovery to topics and documents directly related to the repairs of
Plaintiff’s specific vehicle.
 
In reply, Plaintiff
asserts that evidence regarding other vehicles, including consumer complaints,
internal policies, and procedures, is highly relevant to claims under the Act. Plaintiff
argues that evidence of other consumer complaints is admissible to show a
manufacturer’s knowledge of defects and inability to repair vehicles within a
reasonable number of attempts, which is crucial to proving “willful” violations
under the Act. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
967; Donlen v. Ford Motor Company (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th at 138.)
Plaintiff emphasizes that internal policies related to handling consumer
complaints, warranty claims, and repurchase decisions are critical to evaluating
whether Defendant acted reasonably and in good faith.
 
Additionally,
Plaintiff contends that internal procedures that obstruct or discourage redress
under the Act or rely on insufficient information to deny repurchases are
directly relevant to the claim of willful violation. Plaintiff argues that
questions regarding Defendant’s internal policies, as well as statistics and
practices related to repurchase decisions, are reasonably tailored to uncover
evidence relevant to willfulness. (See, Jensen v. BMW of N. Am., LLC,
(1995) 35 Cal. App. 4th 112, 136.)
 
Plaintiff further
asserts that Defendant cannot limit its responses to only Plaintiff’s vehicle.
Evidence about other vehicles, internal policies, and consumer complaints is
relevant to demonstrating Defendant’s broader knowledge and handling of
defects, which supports Plaintiff’s claim for civil penalties under the Act. (Lukather,
supra, 181 Cal.App.4th at 1050. Jensen, supra (1995) 35
Cal.App.4th 112, 136.) Because discovery standards are broader than trial
admissibility, Defendant must comply with Plaintiff’s deposition notice and
document requests as they are both relevant and reasonably particularized.
 
Since Defendant has
agreed to produce a PMQ to testify on Category Nos. 1, 3-5, 7-8, 10, 13, 21-22,
and 42, the Court will only analyze the objections to the other Categories.
 
Categories 2, 11-12, 14-20, 23-26, 41, 43-50: Defendants policies and procedures regarding
responding to complaints alleging defects.
Categories 6, 9, 42: The investigation into the complaint alleged regarding the Subject
Vehicle.
Categories 27-30: Defendants goals
related to buybacks and profitability.
Categories 31, 32, 33, 34: Policies and procedures regarding tracking similar
warranty repairs in vehicles of the same make, model, and year.
Categories 35-40: Information regarding the number of
repurchases/replacements/service contracts/reimbursements/discounts/new vehicle
purchase assistance/ Defendant offered since 2021.
 
            Categories
2, 11-12, 14-20, 23-26, 41, 43-50
 
            These categories have to do with Defendant’s policies and procedures regarding
complaints alleging defects and communications between Defendant and
Defendant-affiliated call centers. The Court finds that requests regarding
policies and procedures may be relevant to whether Defendant was willful in its
alleged failure to comply with the Act. (Krotin, supra 38 Cal.App.4th
294, 302-03; Lukather, supra, 181 Cal.App.4th 1041, 1049.) However,
because these requests are not limited to the same make, model, and year of the
subject vehicle, the Court finds them to be overbroad. (See, Calcor Space
Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223.) 
 
            Therefore, the Court denies the Motion to Compel
Deposition of PMK as to Categories 2, 11-12, 14-20, 23-26, 41, and 43-50.
 
            Categories
6, 9, 42
 
These categories
seek information regarding the investigation into the complaint regarding the
Subject Vehicle. Since these categories only request information regarding the
Subject Vehicle itself, the Court finds them to be relevant. Furthermore,
Defendant has failed to justify its objections. (Fairmont Ins. Co.
v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
 
            Therefore, the Court grants the Motion to Compel
Deposition of PMK as to Categories 6, 9, and 42.
 
            Categories
27-30
 
            These categories seek information regarding Defendants'
goals related to buybacks and profitability. Since these categories are not
limited to the same make, model, and year of the subject vehicle and do not
seek information relevant to Defendant procedures and policies but instead seek
information related to some vague notion of the Defendant’s goals, the Court
finds that these categories are not relevant to the instant case.
 
            Therefore, the Court denies the Motion to Compel
Deposition of PMK as to Categories 27-30.
 
            Categories
31-34
 
These categories
seek information regarding policies and procedures regarding tracking similar
warranty repairs in vehicles of the same make, model, and year. The Court finds
that these requests are relevant to whether Defendant was aware of the defect
that was allegedly affecting the subject vehicle. (Lukather, supra, 181
Cal.App.4th at 1050. Jensen, supra (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112,
136.) Furthermore, Defendant has failed to justify its objections. (Fairmont
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
 
Therefore, the
Court grants the Motion to Compel Deposition of PMK as to Categories 31-34.
 
 
Categories 35-40
 
These categories
seek information regarding
the number of repurchases, replacements, service contracts, reimbursements, discounts,
and new vehicle purchase assistance Defendant offered since 2021. Since these
requests are not limited to the same model and year of the subject vehicle and
seek information that would not help determine whether Defendant was willful in
their violation of the act, the Court finds these categories are not relevant.
 
Therefore, the
Court denies the Motion to Compel Deposition of PMK as to Categories 35-40.
 
Corresponding RPD’s
 
            Plaintiff requests the Court order Defendant to produce
the documents outlined in the deposition notice.
 
            RPDs
1,
7-11, 13: Information regarding the Subject Vehicle
            RPD
2: Defendant’s
warranty policy manual.
            RPDs
3,5,6:
Documents
regarding whether repairs should be covered by warranties and guidelines for
when a customer files a complaint.
            RPD 4: Defendant’s workshop manual.
            RPDs 12, 14-15: Documents
regarding the Deponent’s job description and all material given to Deponent.
            RPDs 16-20, 26-33, 42: Requests
for all documents regarding policies and procedures under the Act.
            RPDs 34-37: All documents
regarding Defendant's goals related to buybacks and profitability.
            RPDs 38-41,
46: All documents related to Defendant's statistics regarding repurchases,
service contracts, discounts, and long-term value calculations.
            RPD 43: All Technical Service
bulletins for vehicles of the same year, make, and vehicle model as the subject
vehicle. 
            RPDs 44-45: All
complaints, surveys, reports, summaries of the same year, make, and vehicle
model as the subject vehicle regarding any of the conditions, defects, or
nonconformities for which Plaintiff presented the subject vehicle. 
 
            RPDs 1, 7-11, 13
 
These RPDs seek documents
regarding the subject vehicle itself. Since these categories only request
information regarding the Subject Vehicle, the Court finds them to be relevant.
Furthermore, Defendant has failed to justify its objections. (Fairmont
Ins. Co., supra, 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
 
            Therefore, the Court grants the Motion to Compel
Deposition of PMK as to RPD’s 1,7-11, and 13.
 
            RPDs
2, 4
 
These RPDs seek documents
regarding Defendant’s warranty policy manual and workshop manual. The Court
finds this request relevant as the manual’s contents may indicate a pattern of
behavior or intent to hinder consumers from seeking statutory remedies. (Jensen,
supra, 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 136.) Furthermore, Defendant has failed to
justify its objections. (Fairmont Ins. Co., supra, 22 Cal.4th
245, 255.)
 
Therefore, the
Court grants the Motion to Compel Deposition of PMK as to RPDs 2 and 4.
 
RPDs 3, 5-6, 16-20, 26-33, 34-42, 44-45
 
These
RPDs seek a variety of information regarding Defendants policies and
procedures, goals, and customer complaints. While some of these requests may be
relevant, they all are overbroad as Plaintiff has not limited the requests to
only documents regarding the same make, model, and year of the subject vehicle.

 
Therefore, the
Court denies the Motion to Compel Deposition of PMK as to RPDs 16-20, 26-33, 34-37, 42,
and 44-45.
 
RPDs 12, 14-15
 
These
RPDs seek Documents regarding the Deponent’s job
description and all material given to Deponent in preparation for the
deposition. The Court finds this request is relevant as it shows the knowledge
of the Deponent and the weight one should put on Deponent’s statements. Furthermore,
Defendant has failed to justify its objections. (Fairmont
Ins. Co., supra, 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
 
Therefore, the
Court grants the Motion to Compel Deposition of PMK as to RPD’s 12, 14-15.
 
RPD 42
 
This RPD seeks all Technical Service Bulletins for
vehicles of the same year, make, and vehicle model as the subject vehicle. Since
this request is relevant to whether Defendant was willful in its alleged failure
to comply with the Act and because the request is tailored to vehicles of the
same year, make, and vehicle model as the subject vehicle, the Court
finds that it is relevant to the instant matter. (Krotin, supra 38
Cal.App.4th 294, 302-03; Lukather, supra, 181 Cal.App.4th
1041, 1049.) Furthermore, Defendant has failed to justify its objections. (Fairmont
Ins. Co., supra, 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
 
Therefore, the
Court grants the Motion to Compel Deposition of PMK as to RPD 42.
 
Trade Secrets
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's discovery requests seek overly
broad categories of information that include trade secret material. A trade
secret is defined as information, such as methods, techniques, or processes,
that derive independent economic value from not being generally known and are
subject to reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy. (McGuan v. Endovascular
Techs., Inc. (2013) 182 Cal.App.4th 974, 988-989.) 
 
Defendant asserts that the requested internal, confidential
documents would cause competitive harm and harm in the marketplace if
disclosed. Without a heightened showing of the necessity for this information
to prove Plaintiff’s case, Defendant contends that it should not be compelled
to produce such proprietary information. Defendant concludes that Plaintiff has
failed to demonstrate this heightened need, and therefore, production should be
denied.
 
In reply, Plaintiff argues that Defendant has failed to meet its
burden to establish good cause for a protective order. A party seeking such an order
must provide specific evidence, not conclusory statements, showing that the
burden, expense, or intrusiveness of discovery outweighs its likelihood of
leading to admissible evidence. (Emerson Elec. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (1997) 16 Cal.4th
1101, 1110.) Defendant has not done so.
 
While Defendant states they are going to file for a protective
order they are yet to do so. Therefore, the Court finds that Defendant has not
met its burden to establish good cause for a protective order.
 
Therefore, the Court grants the Motion to Compel Deposition of
Defendants PMQ as to Categories 6, 9, 31-34, and 42,
as well as RPDs 1, 2, 4, 7-15, and 42. The Court denies the Motion to Compel
Deposition of Defendants PMQ as to all other Categories and RPDs. 
Sanctions
The
court must impose monetary sanctions if a motion to compel is granted under
this section unless the one subject to sanctions acted with substantial
justification or other circumstances exist that would make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (Code. Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court impose sanctions on Defendant in the amount of $3,210.
However, given that the Court found that many of Plaintiff’s discovery requests
were overbroad, the Court finds that Defendant had substantial justification
for opposing the discovery.
  
Therefore, the Court Denies Plaintiff's requests for sanctions.

Moving Parties:          Plaintiff Rodney Earl Morgan
 
Responding Party:      Defendants Penske Cadillac Buick GMC 
HEARING: Motion To Compel
Deposition 
 
            The Court considered the moving,
opposition, and reply papers.
 
RULING
 
            The Court grants the
Motion to Compel Deposition as to Deposition Categories 1-5 and 15-21, as well as RPDs 1-4, 10, and 15. The
Court denies the Motion to Compel Deposition as to all other Categories and
RPDs.
 
BACKGROUND
 
            On October
27, 2022, Plaintiff Rodney
Earl Morgan filed the Complaint
alleging causes of action for breach of express warranty in violation of the
Song-Beverly Act and breach of implied warranty in violation of the
Song-Beverly Act against Defendants General Motors LLC and Penske
Cadillac Buick GMC.
            
            On July 11, 2024,
Plaintiff served Defendant Penske Cadillac with a Notice of Deposition of
Penske Cadillac’s Dealership Personnel. Plaintiff’s Notice of Deposition to Defendant’s
Personel identified 23 matters for examination and 15 requests for document
production.
 
            On August 12, 2024,
Defendant filed its objections to the deposition. Defendant agreed to produce personnel
for deposition as to Category Nos. 1-6 and 15-21 at a mutually agreeable time
and place.  Plaintiff attempted to meet
and confer the same day, but Defendant did not respond.
 
            September 20, 2024,
Plaintiff attempted to meet and confer again and received no response.
 
            On October 2, 2024,
Plaintiff attempted to meet and confer regarding dates for the deposition and
the scope of the deposition.
 
            On October 11, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion To Compel the Deposition of Defendant’s
Person Most Qualified.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450,
section (a) provides:  
 
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice.” 
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)  
 
The motion must “be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition…by a declaration stating that the petitioner has
contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (2).) A court shall impose monetary sanctions if the motion to
compel is granted unless the one subject to sanctions acted with substantial
justification or other circumstances would make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. (Code. Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Plaintiff requests
the Court compel Defendant to produce Advisor Reggie Shelton (#916789),
Technician #916176, and Technician #916817 for deposition on 23 categories,
and to produce response documents to RPD 1-4, 9-10, and 14-15. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
“The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280 subd. (b).)
 
Defendant argues
that Plaintiff failed to satisfy the statutory requirement of a good faith meet
and confer effort before filing the motion to compel. (Code.
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450.) The burden is on
the moving party to demonstrate a reasonable and genuine attempt to resolve the
dispute informally without court intervention. (Stewart v. Colonial Western
Agency, Inc. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016–1017.) 
 
Defendant contends
that Plaintiff merely sent emails demanding deposition dates but did not engage
with Defendant’s well-founded objections to the deposition categories and
document requests. Defendant highlights that it offered its staff for
deposition on relevant categories and previously produced documents, but
Plaintiff refused to address the actual disputes informally. Defendant asserts
that scheduling dates alone does not constitute a good faith meet and confer
when the real issue involves the scope and content of the deposition notice.
 
While the Court
agrees that demanding deposition dates is not meaningful to the meeting and
conferring, Plaintiff's Counsel’s declaration shows multiple attempts to reach
out to Defendant about both scheduling the deposition and the scope of the
deposition. (Decl. Gonzales-McCaulley, Ex. 3.) Therefore, the Court finds that
Plaintiff has satisfied the meet and confer requirement.
 
Good Cause
 
Plaintiff argues
that under the Discovery Act, they are entitled to depose Penske Cadillac's
Dealership Personnel and obtain requested documents because the deposition
notice was properly served and the information sought is directly relevant to
their breach of warranty claims under the Song-Beverly Act. Defendant’s failure
to comply with discovery obligations, including evasive responses and
non-appearance, warrants a court order to compel attendance and production.
 
Plaintiff asserts
that the deposition topics and documents relate to critical issues, including
substantial repair attempts on the subject vehicle, Defendant’s determinations
regarding repurchase eligibility, and whether Defendant acted willfully in
refusing to repurchase. (Krotin v. Porsche (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 294,
302-03; see Lukather v. General Motors, LLC (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 1041,
1049.) Courts have broadly construed discovery statutes to allow for any
information that might reasonably assist in evaluating the case, preparing for
trial, or proving a willful violation. 
 
Plaintiff argues Defendant
has failed to justify withholding discovery, and Plaintiff has made repeated
good faith attempts to resolve the matter informally. Therefore, Plaintiff
requests that the Court compel Defendant to produce its personnel for
deposition and provide the requested documents, as the information sought is
highly relevant, reasonable, and calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.
 
In opposition,
Defendant argues that discovery must be limited to relevant, targeted
information that pertains directly to the claims, defenses, and issues in
dispute. While Plaintiff seeks to compel a broad deposition of Defendant’s personnel
and extensive document production, Defendant asserts that many of the requested
categories and documents are overly broad, irrelevant, and burdensome.
Defendant emphasizes that it has already produced relevant documents and agreed
to produce its personnel on specific topics directly related to Plaintiff’s
breach of warranty claims.
 
In opposition,
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot invoke CCP Section 2025.450 to compel
testimony because Defendant served valid objections under CCP Section 2025.410.
Plaintiff failed to justify why the requested testimony and documents are
discoverable or essential to the claims or defenses in this breach of warranty
case. Defendant asserts that Plaintiff’s motion lacks factual analysis and
seeks overly broad, irrelevant information unrelated to repairs on Plaintiff’s
vehicle, which is the sole issue in this case.
 
Defendant emphasizes
that discovery must be limited when the burden, expense, or intrusiveness
outweighs its benefit.  Courts have
warned against discovery abuse, stressing that it should facilitate litigation,
not be used as a weapon. (Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997)
53 Cal.App.4th 216; see also Obregon v. Superior Court (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 424, 431.) Plaintiff’s expansive requests, including testimony
about internal policies and procedures regarding customer complaints or general
warranty investigations, are irrelevant to determining whether Defendant
repaired Plaintiff’s vehicle within a reasonable number of attempts. Defendant
argues that breach of warranty claims are specific to the vehicle in question
and that it has already produced relevant documents and agreed to provide personnel
on appropriate topics.
 
Defendant concludes
that Plaintiff’s motion is an improper overreach and should be denied, as the
requested testimony and documents fall outside the permissible scope of
discovery.
 
Deposition
Categories 
 
Plaintiff requests
the Court compel Defendant to produce Advisor Reggie Shelton (#916789),
Technician #916176, and Technician #916817 for deposition on 23 categories.
 
Categories 1, 6, 15, 16, 18-21: Information regarding the subject vehicle.
Categories 2-4, 17: Information regarding communications with Plaintiff or regarding the
subject vehicle.
Category 5: Information
regarding considerations for vehicle buybacks.
Categories 7-14, 22, 23: Information regarding policies not connected to
vehicle buybacks and not limited to the subject vehicle or vehicles of the same
make, model, and year.
 
            Categories
1, 6, 15, 16, 18-21
 
            These categories seek information regarding the subject vehicle itself.
Since these categories only request information regarding the Subject Vehicle,
the Court finds them to be relevant. Furthermore, Defendant has failed to
justify its objections. (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
 
            Therefore, the Court grants the Motion to Compel
Deposition as to categories 1, 6, 15, 16, and 18-21
 
Categories 2-4, 17
 
These categories
seek information regarding communications with Plaintiff or communications
regarding the subject vehicle. Since these are relevant to whether Defendant
had knowledge of the alleged Defect and are tailored to only communications
regarding the Plaintiff or subject vehicle, the Court finds these categories
relevant. Furthermore, Defendant has failed to justify its objections. (Fairmont
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
 
Therefore, the
Court grants the Motion to Compel Deposition as to categories 2-4 and 17.
Category 5
 
            Category 5 requests information regarding considerations
for whether the subject vehicle would be repurchased. Since this category is
related to dealer buybacks and is limited to the subject vehicle, the Court
finds it relevant. Furthermore, Defendant has failed to justify its objections. (Fairmont
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
 
            Therefore, the Court grants the
Motion to Compel Deposition as to Category 5.
 
Categories 7-14, 22, 23
 
These categories
seek information regarding policies not connected to vehicle buybacks and not
limited to the subject vehicle or vehicles of the same make, model, and year.
Since these categories are seeking policies and procedures not linked to vehicle
buybacks and not limited to the subject vehicle or vehicles of the same make,
model, and year of the subject vehicle, the Court finds these requests
overbroad and not relevant.
 
Therefore, the
Court denies the Motion to Compel Deposition as to categories 7-14, 22, and 23.
 
RPD’s
 
            Plaintiff requests the Court order Defendant to produce
the documents responsive to RPDs 1-4, 9-10 and 14-15
 
            RPDs
1, 2,
15: Documents related to the subject vehicle or
Plaintiff.
            RPDs
3, 4: Documents regarding
communications about the subject vehicle or Plaintiff.
            RPD 10:
Documents regarding policies
about compliance with the Act.
            RPDs
9, 14: Documents regarding policies
not connected to vehicle buybacks and not limited to the subject vehicle or
vehicles of the same make, model, and year.
 
.            RPDs 1, 2, 15
 
            These RPDs seek documents regarding the subject vehicle or Plaintiff.
Since these requests only request documents regarding the Subject Vehicle or
Plaintiff, the Court finds them to be relevant. Furthermore, Defendant has
failed to justify its objections. (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
 
Therefore, the
Court grants the Motion to Compel Deposition as to RPDs 1, 2, and 15.
 
            RPDs
3, 4
 
These RPDs seek
documents regarding communications with Plaintiff or communications about the
subject vehicle. Since these requests are relevant to whether Defendant had
knowledge of the alleged Defect and are tailored to only communications
regarding the Plaintiff or subject vehicle, the Court finds these categories
relevant. Furthermore, Defendant has failed to justify its objections. (Fairmont
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.) 
 
Therefore, the
Court grants the Motion to Compel Deposition as to RPDs 3 and 4.
 
RPD 10
 
RPD 10 seeks
documents regarding Defendants policies to ensure compliance with the Act.
Since this request seeks documents directly related to Defendants compliance with
the Act the Court finds the request to be relevant. Furthermore, Defendant has failed to justify its objections. (Fairmont
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
 
Therefore, the
Court grants the Motion to Compel Deposition as to RPD 10.
 
RPDs 9, 14
 
These RPDs request
documents related to policies not connected to vehicle buybacks and are not
limited to the subject vehicle or vehicles of the same make, model, and year.
Since these RPDs are seeking policies and procedures not linked to vehicle
buybacks and are not limited to the subject vehicle or vehicles of the same
make, model, and year of the subject vehicle, the Court finds these requests
overbroad and not relevant.
 
Therefore, the
Court grants the Motion to Compel Deposition as to RPD 9 and 14.
 
Trade Secrets
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's discovery requests seek overly
broad categories of information that include trade secret material. A trade
secret is defined as information, such as methods, techniques, or processes,
that derive independent economic value from not being generally known and are
subject to reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy. (McGuan v. Endovascular
Techs., Inc. (2013) 182 Cal.App.4th 974, 988-989.) 
 
Defendant asserts that the requested internal, confidential
documents would cause competitive harm and harm in the marketplace if
disclosed. Without a heightened showing of the necessity for this information
to prove Plaintiff’s case, Defendant contends that it should not be compelled
to produce such proprietary information. Defendant concludes that Plaintiff has
failed to demonstrate this heightened need, and therefore, production should be
denied.
 
In reply, Plaintiff argues that Defendant has failed to meet its
burden to establish good cause for a protective order. A party seeking such an
order must provide specific evidence, not conclusory statements, showing that
the burden, expense, or intrusiveness of discovery outweighs its likelihood of
leading to admissible evidence. (Emerson Elec. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (1997) 16 Cal.4th
1101, 1110.) Defendant has not done so.
 
The Court finds that Defendant has not provided specific evidence
showing that a protective order is necessary.
 
Therefore, the Court grants the Motion to Compel Deposition of
Defendants as to Categories 1-5 and 15-21, as
well as RPDs 1-4, 10, and 15. The Court denies the Motion to Compel Deposition as to all
other Categories and RPDs.
 
Sanctions
 
The
court must impose monetary sanctions if a motion to compel is granted under
this section unless the one subject to sanctions acted with substantial
justification or other circumstances exist that would make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (Code. Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court impose sanctions on Defendant in the amount of $2,760.00.
However, given that the Court found that many of Plaintiff’s discovery requests
were overbroad, Defendant had substantial justification for opposing this
discovery.
 
 
Therefore, the Court Denies Plaintiff's requests for sanctions.
