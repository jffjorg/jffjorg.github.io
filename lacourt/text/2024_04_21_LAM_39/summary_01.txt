And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees and costs. The Judge approves Plaintiff's counsel's rate of $460 per hour, but reduces the number of hours worked from 85.2 to 55, finding that some tasks took longer than necessary. The Judge awards $25,300 in attorneys' fees and $664.21 in costs. The Judge denies Defendant's suggestion that the Court award only $7,945 in attorneys' fees. The Judge also orders that the case be continued to May 21, 2024, for an Order to Show Cause re: Dismissal (Settlement).
