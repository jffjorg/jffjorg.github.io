BACKGROUND
            On March 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
complaint against American Honda Motor Co. and HODLA for violations of the
Consumer Legal Remedies Act, violation of Unfair Competition Law, violation of
False Advertising Act, and negligent misrepresentation resulting from alleged
misrepresentations regarding the purchase of a vehicle.  
            On May 3, 2023, Defendant HODLA’s
default was entered. (05/03/23 Request for Entry of Default.)
            On July 31, 2023, Defendant HODLA
filed an Answer. 
            On September 20, 2023, HODLA filed
this motion for relief from default. Plaintiff has filed an opposition, and HODLA
has filed a reply. 
 
DISCUSSION
            Defendant HODLA seeks to set aside
the entry of default pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473.
 
Legal
Standard
 “Section
473(b) provides for both discretionary and mandatory relief.¿ [Citation.]”¿ (Pagnini
v. Union Bank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 298, 302.)¿ An application for
relief under this section must be made no more than six months after entry of
the judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding from which relief is sought
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001)
94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) In addition, an application for relief under this
section “shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading
proposed to be filed herein, otherwise the application shall not be granted.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) Relief under this section is mandatory
when based on an attorney affidavit of fault; otherwise, it is discretionary. (Id.)
When relief from default and default judgment is the attorney’s fault, the
six-month period starts to run from the date of the entry of the default
judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, sub. (b); Sugasawara v. Newland (1994)
27 Cal.App.4th 294, 295.)¿¿ 
First, the motion is timely. Default was
entered on May 3, 2023, and Defendant Hodla filed this motion for relief on
September 20, 2023, within the six-month time period under section 473. 
Plaintiff argues that Defendant was
required to seek relief within 60 days of the entry of default. Code of Civil
Procedure section 585.5 states that “[W]hen a default or default judgment has
been entered without full compliance with Section 1812.10 or 2984.4 of the
Civil Code, or subdivision (b) of Section 395, the defendant may serve and file
a notice of motion to set aside the default or default judgment and for leave
to defend the action in the proper court. The notice of motion shall be served
and filed within 60 days after the defendant first receives notice of levy
under a writ of execution, or notice of any other procedure for enforcing, the
default judgment.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 585.5(b).) 
This section is not applicable here.
First, Plaintiff’s request for entry of default specifically states that this
action is not an action on a contract for goods or services subject to Civil
Code § 1801, et seq., nor a conditional sales contract subject to Civil Code §
2981 et seq., nor on an obligation for goods and services, loans, or extensions
of credit subject to Code Civ. Proc., § 395(b). (05/03/23 Request for Entry.)
As such, this section is not applicable. Further, this section does not limit
the time period for section 473(b), but rather provides an alternative means of
seeking relief when the request for default does not comply with the
requirements of applicable statutes.
Second, the motion is accompanied by an attorney affidavit of
fault. Counsel Robinett states that there was a miscommunication between
counsel’s office and the Controller for HODLA. Counsel states that he did not
respond to the Complaint, as he did not know if the dealership was served and
was not provided with a formal Proof of Service. As such, counsel did not
follow up with HODLA and did not check the court docket or contact Plaintiff’s
attorney. (Robinett Decl. ¶ 6.) Counsel states that this was a mistake and
miscommunication, and the request for default would not have been filed and entered
without this mistake. (Robinett Decl. ¶ 6.) 
Plaintiff argues that HODLA fails to show any excusable neglect
because it had actual notice of the complaint and the entry of default. However,
mandatory relief from entry of default is available if there is attorney
neglect, whether or not the attorney’s neglect is excusable. (Benedict v.
Danner Press (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 923, 927.) As Defendant HODLA has
submitted an affidavit of fault, the mandatory relief provision applies. 
            As such, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to set
aside/vacate the default. 
CONCLUSION
            The Motion for Relief from Default
is GRANTED. 
 
Moving party to
give notice.
 
            If counsel do not submit on the
tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than
in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
