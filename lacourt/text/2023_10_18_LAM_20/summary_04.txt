And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the motion for relief from default filed by Hodla Motors, LLC, dba Honda of Downtown Los Angeles. The motion was filed on September 20, 2023, within the six-month time period allowed by Code of Civil Procedure section 473. The motion is accompanied by an attorney affidavit of fault, which states that there was a miscommunication between counsel's office and the Controller for HODLA, leading to a mistake and neglect in responding to the complaint and failing to check the court docket or contact the plaintiff's attorney. The Judge finds that the motion is timely and that the mandatory relief provision applies, as the attorney's neglect is not excusable. As a result, the Court grants the motion to set aside the default and vacates the default.
