And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer of defendant Heriberto Plascencia to the first cause of action for race/national origin harassment in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) and the sixth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations were insufficient to state a cause of action for hostile work environment under FEHA because supervisors cannot be held individually liable for their personnel actions. The judge also found that the plaintiff's allegations were insufficient to state a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress because personnel management decisions, even if motivated by wrongful intent, are not outrageous conduct. The judge gave the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint. The court encourages counsel to submit on the tentative ruling and appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
