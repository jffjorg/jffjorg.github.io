  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s request for court judgment by
  default
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff O.E.C. Shipping Los
Angeles, Inc.  
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Request for Court Judgment by Default
Plaintiff O.E.C. Shipping Los
Angeles, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) requests that the court enter default judgment in
its favor and against defendant Bravo Sports (“Defendant”) in the total amount
of $53,091.40, consisting of $47,052 in damages, $3,597.24 in interest, $640.60
in costs, and $1,801.56 in attorney’s fees. 
The court notes two defects in
Plaintiff’s request for court judgment by default. 
First, Plaintiff has
not proven that it is entitled to damages in the amount of $47,052 with
competent evidence.  Plaintiff submits the declaration of Milad
Gholamnejad, which (1) attaches the invoice issued by Plaintiff to Defendant
showing a total amount due of $72,052, (2) states that Plaintiff exercised its
lien rights pursuant to the bill of lading and salvage sold the goods in the
amount of $25,000, and (3) states that Defendant has failed to pay for
Plaintiff’s services, thereby damaging Plaintiff in the amount of $47,052
(i.e., the remaining amount due on the invoice).  (Gholamnejad Decl., ¶¶ 5-8.)  However, while Gholamnejad states that they
“have personal knowledge of the matters set forth herein[,]” Gholamnejad did
not state facts establishing that they would have personal knowledge of the
matters set forth in their declaration. 
(Gholamnejad Decl., ¶ 1.) 
Gholamnejad did not, for example, state that they work for Plaintiff or
that Gholamnejad is the custodian of records for Plaintiff.  Moreover, while the court recognizes that
counsel for Plaintiff, Henry Hwang, states that Defendant owes to Plaintiff
$47,052, counsel did not establish that he has personal knowledge of that fact
in his declaration.  (Hwang Decl., ¶ 3.)  Thus,
the court cannot verify that Gholamnejad or counsel for Plaintiff have personal
knowledge of the facts stated in their supporting declarations.  
The court therefore finds that
Plaintiff has not met its burden to prove that it is entitled to damages
against Defendant in the amount of $47,052 with competent evidence.  (Sass v. Cohen (2020) 10 Cal.5th 861,
880 [“plaintiffs in default cases must still prove their damages to obtain
monetary recovery”].)  
Second, Plaintiff has not yet
dismissed Doe defendants 1-10.  (Cal.
Rules of Ct., rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(7) [party seeking default judgment must
file “[a] dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought”].)   Although Plaintiff filed a request for
dismissal on May 10, 2024, the request was rejected because “[t]he request must
be submitted on an updated Judicial Council form[.]”  (May 10, 2024 CIV-110, p. 1.)  Thus, the court cannot enter default judgment
in Plaintiff’s favor until Plaintiff dismisses the remaining Doe defendants. 
The court therefore denies
plaintiff O.E.C. Shipping Los Angeles, Inc.’s request for default judgment
against defendant Bravo Sports, without prejudice to plaintiff O.E.C. Shipping
Los Angeles, Inc.’s filing revised default judgment documents required by
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800 (including a proposed judgment on
Judicial Council form JUD-100) that cure these defects.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  June 20, 2024
