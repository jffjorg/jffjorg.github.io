[tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff and cross-defendant’s motion for
  summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication
 



 
Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary
Adjudication
On September 14, 2022, plaintiff and cross-defendant AEG Presents
Productions, LLC (“AEG”) filed the pending motion for summary judgment or, in
the alternative, summary adjudication, on the Second Amended Cross-Complaint
filed by defendant and cross-complainant Danny Wimmer Presents, LLC (“DWP”).
On December 5, 2022, the court issued an order staying this action
pending the Court of Appeal’s ruling on DWP’s appeal from the court’s August
25, 2022 order denying DWP’s special motion to strike and issuance of a
remittitur on that appeal.  (Dec. 5, 2022
Order, p. 6:1-3.)  AEG and DWP filed a
joint status report regarding the status of the appeal on June 10, 2024,
advising the court that the appeal is still pending.  (June 10, 2024 Joint Status Report, p.
2:1-6.) 
Thus, the court orders that the June 20, 2024 hearing on plaintiff and
cross-defendant AEG Presents Productions, LLC’s motion for summary judgment or,
in the alternative, summary adjudication, is taken off calendar, subject to
being rescheduled after the stay is lifted. 
 
The court directs the clerk to give notice of this ruling. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  June 20, 2024
