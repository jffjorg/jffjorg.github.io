MOTION
 
Plaintiff Christmas Brothers Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves to enforce the
settlement agreement entered into between Plaintiff and Defendants Alex Corral
(“Corral”), Vanessa Martinez, and Vanessa Michelle Co. (collectively, “Defendants”).  Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides that “[i]f parties to
pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the
presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case,
or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the
terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.) In ruling on a motion to
enter judgment, the court acts as a trier of fact. The court must determine
whether the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement. To do so, the
court may receive oral testimony in addition to declarations. (Kohn v.
Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)
 
The
issue on a motion to enforce settlement agreement under Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6 is whether the parties entered into a valid and binding
settlement agreement. (See Viejo v. Bancorp. (1989) 217 Cal.App.3d 200,
209, fn. 4 [“a court's power to make factual determinations under section 664.6
is generally limited to whether the parties entered into a valid and binding
settlement agreement”].)  In other words,
the only issue before the court is whether an agreement exists; not whether the
agreement has been breached.
 
Attached
as Exhibit “E” to the Declaration of Tina M. Alleguez is a copy of the
settlement agreement, fully executed by Plaintiff and Defendants, where
Defendant Corral was to pay Plaintiff $32,194.19 within twenty days of the
execution of the Agreement.  Corral
executed the agreement on October 11, 2023; the other defendants executed the
agreement on October 13, 2023, and Plaintiff executed the agreement on October
14, 2023.  (See Declaration of Tina M.
Alleguez, ¶ 8, Exhibit E.)  
 
Pursuant
to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Defendants agreed to pay a lump sum
of $32,194.19 on or before October 31, 2023. 
(See Declaration of Tina M. Alleguez, ¶ 9, Exhibit E.)   But
Defendants failed to do so.  (See
Declaration of Tina M. Alleguez, ¶ 11, Exhibit E.)  
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
            Therefore, the Court grants
Plaintiff’s motion to enforce settlement and the Court will enter the proposed
order lodged with the moving papers.  
 
            Further, Plaintiff shall prepare and
file a proposed Judgment on or before March 27, 2024, and the Court sets an
Order to Show Cause re Entry of Judgment on April 17, 2024 at 8:30 A.M. in  Department 207.  No appearance will be necessary if the
Judgment has been entered before April 17, 2024.  
 
            Further, Plaintiff shall provide
notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service regarding the
same.
