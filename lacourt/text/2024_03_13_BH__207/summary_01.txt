And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a motion to compel further responses to deposition questions by defendant and cross-complainant John Canning. The motion is based on Canning's argument that the attorney-client privilege does not apply to certain questions asked during the deposition of attorney Steven White, who represented plaintiff Michael Vaughan and Canning in different capacities.

The judge finds that the first two questions regarding the timing of attorney-client conversations are not protected by the privilege. However, the judge denies the motion to compel further responses to the remaining questions regarding White's withdrawal from representing Vaughan and any recommendations White may have made to Vaughan concerning legal representation.

The judge concludes that the attorney-client privilege was not waived by Vaughan and that the questions regarding White's withdrawal and recommendations are protected by the privilege. The judge grants Canning's motion to compel further responses to the first two questions, but denies the motion to compel further responses to the remaining questions.
