And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the PAGA settlement agreement and has found that there is good cause to approve the settlement as fair, just, and equitable. The settlement amount of $70,000 is reasonable considering the facts of the case, including the difficulties in proving off-the-clock claims and the possibility of defendant being in substantial compliance with meal periods. The court has also considered the factors set forth in Reed v. United Teachers Los Angeles and Nordstrom Commission Cases, including the arm's length bargaining, investigation and discovery, counsel's experience, and the percentage of objectors. The court grants the motion for approval of the PAGA settlement agreement.
