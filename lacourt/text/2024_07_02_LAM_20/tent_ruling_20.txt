 This is a wage and hour and PAGA suit.  Defendant Hof’s Hut Restaurants, Inc. seeks to compel arbitration of this matter based on an arbitration agreement executed as a component of Plaintiff’s employment.  Specifically, Defendant seeks an order: “(1) Compelling Plaintiff Jose Chavez [ ] to submit his Complaint . . . to binding arbitration pursuant to a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement as to Plaintiff’s cause of actions #1-4 and #6 as well as Plaintiff’s individual PAGA claim of cause of action #5; and (2) Staying all judicial proceedings pending the completion of arbitration and/or the resolution of the initial PAGA filing”.Plaintiff contends that he does “not oppose submitting his individual claims for damages and individual PAGA claim to arbitration. Rather, Plaintiff opposes Defendant HHR’s Motion to Compel Arbitration [ ] as to the request to stay Plaintiff’s non-individual PAGA claims. A stay of Plaintiff’s non-individual PAGA claims is not required, and further, a stay would frustrate the PAGA’s purpose, which is to expand, rather than minimize, enforcement of the Labor Code.” The only issue is whether the representative PAGA claim should be stayed.  This claim will be stayed pending the resolution of arbitration.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.4; see also Adolph v. Uber Techs., Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104, 1125.)  The Motion to Compel Arbitration is granted.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
