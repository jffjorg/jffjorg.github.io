And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a case arising from a fistfight during Halloween trick-or-treating in 2022. Randall Kaplan, a defendant, seeks summary adjudication of several issues related to Justin Gimelstob's Fourth Amended Cross-Complaint (4ACC). The issues include the alleged failure of Gimelstob's causes of action for Equitable Indemnity, tort in essence, and intentional interference with contractual relations. However, the Court finds that Gimelstob has already filed a request for dismissal of the entire action, making the summary adjudication motion moot. Consequently, the motion is denied, and the 4ACC will be dismissed. Counsel is notified of the decision, and the Court encourages parties to appear remotely via LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
