And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a wage and hour and PAGA suit. Defendant Hof's Hut Restaurants, Inc. seeks to compel arbitration of the matter based on an arbitration agreement executed as part of Plaintiff Jose Chavez's employment. The agreement requires Plaintiff to submit his individual claims for damages and individual PAGA claim to arbitration. However, Plaintiff opposes the request to stay his non-individual PAGA claims, arguing that a stay would frustrate the purpose of PAGA, which is to expand enforcement of the Labor Code. The judge has granted the Motion to Compel Arbitration, but has stayed the representative PAGA claim pending the resolution of arbitration. The judge has also encouraged counsel to appear remotely via LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
