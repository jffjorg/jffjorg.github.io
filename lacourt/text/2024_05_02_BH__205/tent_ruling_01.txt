  Case Number:  24SMCV00675    Hearing Date:   May 2, 2024    Dept:  205  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   JANET FARZAN,  Plaintiff, v.  THOMAS LATIMER, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  24SMCV00675     Hearing Date:  May 2, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   DEFENDANT THOMAS LATIMER’S    DEMURRER TO COMPLAINT   This is an unlawful detainer action.  Plaintiff Janet Farzan (“Landlord”) owns the property located at 1705 Carla Ridge Drive, Beverly Hills, California 90210 (“Property”).  Landlord rented the Property to Defendant Thomas Latimer (“Tenant”) for $35,000 a month.  Tenant failed to pay rent.  This action followed.     This hearing is on Tenant’s demurrer.  Tenant argues that (1) Plaintiff did not properly serve Defendant with the three day notice to pay rent or quit, and (2) there is uncertainty as to the amount owed by Defendant because Plaintiff failed to attach to her Complaint the written rental agreement and the three day notice to pay rent or quit, and the amount alleged to be owed in the Complaint is inconsistent with the amount alleged to be due in the three day notice to pay rent or quit.   On April 25, 2024, this Court granted Tenant’s motion to quash service of summons on the ground that Landlord used the improper form for proof of service.  The Court’s ruling moots the demurrer.  Accordingly, the Court overrules the demurrer as moot.      DATED:  May 2, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
