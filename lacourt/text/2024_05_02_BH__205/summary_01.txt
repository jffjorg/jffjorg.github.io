And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

"This is a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Thomas Latimer, who argues that the Plaintiff, Janet Farzan, did not properly serve him with the three-day notice to pay rent or quit, and that there is uncertainty as to the amount owed by him. However, the Court previously granted his motion to quash service of summons on the ground that the improper form was used for proof of service, which moots the demurrer. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled as moot."
