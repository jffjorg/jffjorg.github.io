The judge's tentative ruling is regarding a case between Maria Iniguez and American Honda Motor Company, Inc. The case is related to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and concerns the failure of the defendant to respond to written discovery requests. The plaintiff's counsel has filed motions to compel responses, while the defendant has filed motions for relief from waiver.

The judge has decided to take all motions off-calendar and advance and vacate the final status conference and trial date. The parties are ordered to meet and confer by telephone within 10 days and file a joint statement by February 20, 2024, informing the court whether the issues have been resolved or not. The parties are also ordered to include a new proposed trial date in the joint statement.

A case management conference is set for March 1, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., and the judge will re-set the motions for hearing at that time if necessary.
