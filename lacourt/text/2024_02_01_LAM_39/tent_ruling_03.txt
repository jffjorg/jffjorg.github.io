 Case Number:  22STCV19479    Hearing Date:   February 1, 2024    Dept:  39 Ann C. Hayman v.
Berger, Inc., et al.
Case No.
22STCV19479
Motion for Summary
Judgment
 
Plaintiff Ann C. Hayman
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Berger, Inc. (“Berger”) and Aveanna
Staffing Services, LLC (“Aveanna”) (collectively, “Defendants”) asserting
causes of action for conversion, negligence, and financial elder abuse.  Plaintiff alleges that she hired Defendants
to provide home health care services for her partner, and one of Defendants’
employees stole her personal possessions. 
The only causes of action remaining are claims for conversion and
negligence against Berger. 
 
Now, Berger moves for summary
judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication.  The Court has no tentative order on the
motion and orders counsel for both parties to appear, either remotely or
in-person, to discuss the issues.
