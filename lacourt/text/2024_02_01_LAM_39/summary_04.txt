Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' motion to set aside the default and default judgment entered against them. The motion was filed on January 9, 2024, and argues that the defendants were not served with the lawsuit and that the default judgment is void. The court has found that the process servers used for service of process listed the wrong gender for each individual defendant and that the defendants were not served personally. Additionally, the court has found that the default judgment is void because the plaintiff's counsel sought damages of $451,779.14 but sought a default judgment for "damages" in the amount of $495,643.60. As a result, the court has ordered the plaintiff and the plaintiff's counsel to return all levied funds to the defendants. The court has also ordered the parties to meet and confer on service and case management issues and has continued the case management conference to May 15, 2024.
