And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted in part and denied in part the motion for a further bill of particulars. The plaintiff, Ellen Pittleman, must provide a detailed statement of the items charged against the defendant, including the dates on which she provided services, the services provided, the amount of time spent, and the value of the services. The court has denied the motion in all other respects, as the existing bill of particulars lists the services performed and the date ranges on which they were performed. The plaintiff must serve the further bill of particulars within 30 days.
