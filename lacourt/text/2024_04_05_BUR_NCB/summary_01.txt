And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of Plaintiff, LIBERTY MUTUAL FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY, granting their motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment in the amount of $45,004.24. The dispute arises from Defendant, PERFECTION CABINETS, INC.'s failure to make monthly payments under a Stipulation entered into by the parties. The Stipulation provided for the dismissal of the action without prejudice, with the Court retaining jurisdiction to enforce the settlement's terms, including entering judgment. The Court finds that Defendant has defaulted on the terms of the Stipulation and therefore grants the Plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement and enter judgment.
