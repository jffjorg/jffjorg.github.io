And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by State Farm General Insurance Company, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, Auzat Insurance Agency, Inc., and Doug W. Auzat. The demurrer was filed to challenge the 1st, 3rd, and 4th causes of action in the complaint.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the 1st cause of action for breach of contract as alleged against State Farm Mutual and State Farm General. The judge concludes that Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to state a breach of contract claim against State Farm Mutual, and that State Farm General did not have an obligation to cover Plaintiff under the umbrella policy.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the 3rd cause of action for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (insurance bad faith) without leave to amend.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the 4th cause of action for declaratory relief without leave to amend. The judge concludes that Plaintiff is seeking to redress a past wrong and that the remedy of declaratory relief is not available in this case.

The judge has given Plaintiff 20 days to amend the 1st cause of action as alleged against State Farm Mutual and State Farm General.

The ruling is tentative and subject to change after the parties have an opportunity to respond and the court has considered the responses.
