The Court retained jurisdiction to make orders to enforce any and all terms of settlement, including judgment, pursuant to CCP § 664.6.On February 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment pursuant to the parties’ Stipulation for entry of judgment. The Court is not in receipt of an opposition brief.DISCUSSION            Plaintiff moves for an order setting aside the dismissal and entering judgment pursuant to the Stipulation.             The Stipulation was filed on October 14, 2022.  It states that the parties have agreed that Defendant will make 13 monthly settlement payments to Plaintiff, beginning October 20, 2022 and that the action will be dismissed without prejudice.  (Stipulation at ¶¶B-C.)  The Stipulation provides that the parties agreed that the Court shall retain jurisdiction over the action pursuant to CCP § 664.6 to enforce the settlement’s terms, including entering judgment to set aside the dismissal and entry judgment upon showing that Defendant was in default in its performance of the terms.  (Id. at ¶C.)  The Stipulation is signed by Plaintiff, Defendant, and the parties’ counsel.            The parties also entered the Stipulation re: Entry of Judgment.  (Mot. at Ex. 1.)  The Stipulation re: Entry of Judgment states that Judgment shall be entered in favor of Plaintiff for the principal ($39,649.91), interest ($19,471.98), and costs ($541.36) for the total sum of $59,663.24.  (Stipulation re: Entry of Judgment, ¶1.)  It states that Plaintiff shall hold the Stipulation in trust and not file it with the Court so long as Defendant pays the sum of $15,859 to Plaintiff by making payments of $1,200 per month beginning October 20, 2022 until the sum of $15,859 was paid.  (Id., ¶2.)  It states that in the event payment is not timely received, Plaintiff is entitled to file the Stipulation re: Entry of Judgment without notice and that the declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel is sufficient to establish the date of the default and the monies paid.  (Id., ¶¶6-7.)  Defendant waives all rights to a hearing upon entry of judgment and any statutory notice.  (Id., ¶10.)  The Stipulation re: Entry of Judgment is signed by the parties and their counsel.             Plaintiff’s counsel, Rodolfo Gaba, Jr., states that on October 1, 2023 and each month thereafter, Defendant has defaulted on the terms of the Stipulation by failing to make the scheduled payments thereon in the sum of $1,200 per month.  (Gaba Decl., ¶5.)  He states that on December 4, 2023, his firm sent defense counsel a written Notice of Default.  (Id., ¶6, Ex. 3.)  He states that, to date, Defendant has paid a total of $14,659 pursuant to the Stipulation.  (Id., ¶7.) He states that the Stipulation provides that upon default, Plaintiff is entitled to judgment in the sum of $45,004.24, inclusive of credits applied for payments made under the Stipulation.  (Id., ¶8.)  This amount was calculated by taking the $39,649.91 amount in principal, $19,471.98 amount in interest, $541.35 amount in costs, $0 in attorney’s fees, with a credit of $14,659 in payments received, for a total judgment amount of $45,004.24.  (Id., ¶9.)Based on the terms of the Stipulation and Defendant’s default by failure to make further payments pursuant to the monthly payment schedule, the Court finds there is substantive merit to granting the motion to enforce the Stipulation.Thus, the motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the Stipulation is granted.  CONCLUSION AND ORDERPlaintiff Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company’s motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment pursuant to the parties’ Stipulation for entry of judgment is granted in the amount of $45,004.24.
