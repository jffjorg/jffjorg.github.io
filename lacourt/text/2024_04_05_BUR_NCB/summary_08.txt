Summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by Ford Motor Company to the 5th cause of action for fraudulent concealment in the first amended complaint (FAC). The plaintiff, Maricela Rangel, alleges that Ford Motor Company concealed material facts about the defects in the vehicle, including the transmission defects, and failed to disclose the information to her. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for fraudulent concealment and that the claim is indistinguishable from the warranty claim and is thus barred. The judge sustains the demurrer to the 5th cause of action without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff will not be able to refile the claim. The ruling is based on the court's prior decision that the fraud claim is fully contained in the warranty contract and that both contractual and statutory remedies are available to the plaintiff.
