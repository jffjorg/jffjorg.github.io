And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Carmen Jimenez-Guzman's motions to compel the deposition of Defendant Smart & Final Stores, LLC's employees Arturo Colon, Jr., Joseph Perez, and Pablo Arreaga. The plaintiff alleges that she tripped and fell on a floor mat on Defendant's property in December 2020 and seeks to depose the employees to gather evidence. The Defendant opposes the motions, arguing that the employees are no longer with the company and that they have provided alternate dates for the depositions. The judge finds that the deposition of Pablo Arreaga is already scheduled and is therefore moot, and that the motions to compel the depositions of Colon and Perez are denied as they are no longer employees of the Defendant. The judge awards the plaintiff $500 in sanctions for the motion directed against Arreaga and $500 in sanctions for each motion directed against Colon and Perez, citing the Defendant's delay in providing information and its failure to disclose that the employees were no longer with the company. The total amount of sanctions awarded is $1,500.
