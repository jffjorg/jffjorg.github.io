And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses four discovery motions filed by Plaintiff Nicharaporn Chantraramat against Defendants Artur Hovespyan and Knarik Margaryan. The motions seek to compel responses to supplemental interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The Defendants failed to provide verified responses, citing a language gap and a lack of understanding of the importance of returning discovery verifications. The Plaintiff argues that the delay was nearly five months and seeks sanctions against the Defendants. The Court grants the motions, but reduces the amount of sanctions to $375 in attorney's fees and $61.65 in filing fees per motion. The Defendants are ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the total amount of $873.30 to the Plaintiff within 20 days of notice of this order.
