And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to strike portions of a complaint filed by Plaintiff Karen Tutkhalyan against Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA). The complaint alleges that Plaintiff was injured when LACMTA bus driver Jane Doe accelerated rapidly without giving Plaintiff time to secure himself while boarding the bus. LACMTA argues that there is no statutory authority for negligent entrustment or supervision against a public entity, citing California Government Code, § 815. However, Plaintiff argues that common carriers like LACMTA have a heightened duty of care and can be vicariously liable for the negligence of their employees. The Court finds that the allegations are sufficient to allege a claim for negligent entrustment or supervision against LACMTA and denies the motion to strike.
