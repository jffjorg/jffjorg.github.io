And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to strike paragraphs 28, 30, and 34 of the plaintiffs' first amended complaint, which seek punitive damages. The judge ruled that the allegations in the complaint do not show that the defendants acted with malice, oppression, or fraud, as required by Civil Code § 3294. The judge found that the allegations amount to negligence or gross negligence, but do not rise to the level of malice or oppression. The judge granted the motion with leave to amend, giving the plaintiffs 20 days to refile their complaint.
