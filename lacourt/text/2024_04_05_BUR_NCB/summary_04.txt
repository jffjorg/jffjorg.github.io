And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to dismiss the first cause of action in the complaint filed by the plaintiff is granted. The plaintiff, Michele A. Santopietro, alleges that a fraudulent transfer of title to a property was made, and she seeks to quiet title and recover damages for fraud. The defendant, Sandra D. Santopietro, moved to dismiss the first cause of action, arguing that the plaintiff failed to amend the complaint within the time allowed after the demurrer was sustained with leave to amend.

The judge notes that the plaintiff failed to file an amended pleading within the 20-day timeframe allowed after the demurrer was sustained, and the plaintiff's opposition to the demurrer was filed late. The judge declines to consider the plaintiff's opposition brief to the demurrer at this time. The judge concludes that the plaintiff has not shown that she did not receive notice of the demurrer order and has not filed a motion for reconsideration of the demurrer. Therefore, the judge grants the motion to dismiss the first cause of action from the complaint.
