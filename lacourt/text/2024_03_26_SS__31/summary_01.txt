And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery for the limited purpose of conducting expert discovery. The plaintiff originally represented himself in the lawsuit and only recently designated his expert witnesses. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that it is a ruse to completely reopen expert discovery. The court finds sufficient justification to re-open discovery, as the plaintiff's experts are necessary for him to prove his damages and the result of granting the request would not interfere with the trial calendar. The court orders the reopening of discovery to track with the current trial date of September 17, 2024.
