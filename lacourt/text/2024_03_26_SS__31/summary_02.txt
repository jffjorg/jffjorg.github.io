And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to compel defendant Brian Sanchez Rojas to respond to plaintiff Vincent Rossiello's special interrogatories is moot, as defendant has already served verified responses prior to the hearing. However, the judge has awarded plaintiff attorney fees and sanctions for defendant's failure to serve timely responses. The judge has ordered defendant to pay $685 in sanctions, including $625 in attorney fees and $60 in motion filing fees, within 20 days. The judge has also ordered plaintiff to give notice of the ruling. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit to the ruling, they must email the court with the case number and other required information.
