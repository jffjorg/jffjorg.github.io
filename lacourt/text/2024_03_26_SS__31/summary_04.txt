And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant's motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion was filed by Counsel, Margaret A. Sedy, who claims that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. However, the motion is denied because Counsel has failed to file proof of service demonstrating that all parties were properly served with the notice of motion and motion. The judge has ordered Counsel to file proof of service prior to the hearing on March 26, 2024, or the motion will be denied without prejudice. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the required information.
