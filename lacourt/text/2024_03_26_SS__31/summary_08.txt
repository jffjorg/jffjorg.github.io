The judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions, but grants monetary sanctions to Plaintiff. The judge finds that Plaintiff's failure to serve verified discovery responses was not willful or unwilling, and that Plaintiff has made appearances at hearings on this matter. The judge awards Defendant attorney's fees and costs, and imposes sanctions on Plaintiff in the amount of $490. The judge also orders Plaintiff to pay sanctions to Defendant within 10 days.
