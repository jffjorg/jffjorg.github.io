And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages from the complaint. The defendant had moved to strike the punitive damages on the grounds that the allegations in the complaint were conclusory and did not provide sufficient evidence to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge agreed with the defendant, finding that the allegations in the complaint were insufficient to state a claim for punitive damages. The judge also noted that the plaintiff did not oppose the motion, and therefore did not meet the burden of showing how the complaint could be amended to change the legal effect of the pleading. As a result, the judge granted the motion to strike punitive damages without leave to amend.
