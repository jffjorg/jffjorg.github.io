And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively granted a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Jesse L. Halpern, attorney for Plaintiff Santino Carey. The motion was filed due to public statements made by Carey that have affected the working relationship between the parties, making it impossible for Halpern to continue representing Carey. The motion was unopposed and was granted as the court found that there is sufficient time for Carey to seek new counsel or prepare for trial before the July 19, 2024 trial date. The court ordered Halpern to give notice of the ruling. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if no agreement is reached, the parties should be prepared to appear at the hearing to argue the motion.
