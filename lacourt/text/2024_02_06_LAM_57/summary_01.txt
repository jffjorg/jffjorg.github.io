And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Foonberg's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Carson. The Court found that Foonberg's delay in filing the cross-complaint was not sufficient evidence of bad faith. Foonberg's new counsel, Krieger, contacted Carson's counsel promptly after substituting in as counsel for Foonberg, and the delay was due to Foonberg's prior counsel's oversight in failing to recognize the basis of Foonberg's cross-claims. The Court also found that Carson has not shown any prejudice arising from the delay. The Court directed Foonberg to file and serve the proposed cross-complaint by February 13, 2024.
