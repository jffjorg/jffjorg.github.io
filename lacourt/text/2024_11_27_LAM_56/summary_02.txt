  - "The Court concludes, therefore, that while the deposition may be reasonably necessary for the litigation of Revel's cross-action, which is still pending and has yet to be resolved, the depositions were not necessarily incurred for the purpose of litigation or defense in Plaintiff's action, in which Revel is a prevailing party."

Summary:
The Judge issued a tentative ruling in a motion to tax and strike costs filed by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff seeks to recover costs claimed by the Defendant, which include costs related to depositions taken in connection with the Defendant's Cross-Complaint. The Judge concludes that while the depositions may be necessary for the litigation of the Cross-Complaint, they were not necessary for the purpose of litigation or defense in the Plaintiff's action. Therefore, the Judge strikes the Defendant's claimed costs related to the depositions in the amount of $4,472.50.
