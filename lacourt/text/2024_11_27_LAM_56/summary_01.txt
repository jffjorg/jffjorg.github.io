And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication of issues filed by the defendants, Bodega Latina Corporation and Mario Morales, and has denied the motion. The motion was based on the argument that a single incident of harassment is insufficient to create liability under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA).

The Court has determined that the Legislature has explicitly eliminated this argument, and that harassment cases are rarely appropriate for disposition on summary judgment. The Court has also found that there is a triable issue of fact on the claim for punitive damages.

The plaintiff, Norma Orozco, has alleged that she experienced three isolated incidents of sexual harassment during her employment with the defendants. The defendants have acknowledged the incidents but argue that they are not severe or pervasive. The Court has denied the plaintiff's first cause of action for hostile work environment based on sexual harassment, as well as her second cause of action for failure to prevent and/or remedy work environment harassment.

The Court has concluded that the defendants have not met their burden of showing that they are entitled to summary judgment or adjudication in their favor. The motion is therefore denied.
