Dept. 56



 
 
MOVING PARTY:  Plaintiff Eden Shaul (“Petitioner”)
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition papers were filed. 
Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at
least nine court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
            Petitioner, individually and as
guardian ad litem for minor claimants Adele Hamo (6) and Liam Hamo (6) (collectively,
“Minor Claimants”), and Plaintiff Lior Hamo, initiated this action against Defendants
Lori Pietruszka Sussman; Marvin Pietruszka; JAL2433, LLC; and SG California,
Inc. (collectively, “Defendants”).  This
action arises out of a landlord/tenant relationship.  The complaint alleges: (1) breach of implied warranty
of habitability; (2) breach of contract; (3) negligence; and (4) violation of
Los Angeles Municipal Code section 45.30; (5) fraud; (6) intentional
misrepresentation; and (7) constructive eviction.
 
Petitioner
filed the instant petitions to approve the compromise of disputed claim on
behalf of Minor Claimants (collectively, the “Petitions”).  
 
DISCUSSION
If
an action is pending and settlement is effected prior to trial, the minor’s
compromise must be approved by the court. 
(CCP § 372.)  A petition to
approve a minor’s compromise is governed by California Rules of Court (“CRC”), rules 7.950, et seq. and Probate Code sections 3500 and 3600 et seq.  The
trial court is authorized to approve and allow payment of reasonable expenses,
costs, and attorney fees in an action concerning the compromise of a minor’s
claim.  (Prob. Code, § 3601, subd. (a); Curtis v. Estate of Fagan (2000) 82
Cal.App.4th 270, 277-79; see also CCP § 373.5.)
 
Attorney’s Fees
Unless the court has approved the fee agreement in
advance, the court must use a reasonable fee standard when approving and
allowing the amount of attorney's fees payable from money or property paid or
to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person with a disability.  (CRC, r. 7.955(a).)  The court must give consideration to the
terms of the agreement between the attorney and minor’s representative and must
evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances existing at the
time the agreement was made.  (CRC, r.
7.955(a)(2).)  CRC Rule 7.955(b)(2) sets
out nonexclusive factors the court may consider in determining the
reasonableness of attorney’s fees in connection with a petition for minor’s
compromise.  Under CRC Rule 7.955(c), the
petition must include a declaration by the attorney addressing the factors set
forth in CRC Rule 7.955(b)(2) that are applicable to the matter that is before
the Court.
 
Here,
the Minor Claimants, by and through Petitioner, their guardian ad litem, have
agreed to settle their claims against Defendants in exchange for $1,000
each.  Upon approval, $330 of each
settlement payment will be allocated towards attorney’s fees, leaving a balance
of $670 to be disbursed to Petitioner for each minor claimant.
 
            The Court finds that the settlement
is fair and reasonable.  Further, the
Court considers the requested amount in attorney’s fees, which represents a 33%
contingency fee, to be fair and reasonable. 
For these reasons and because they are unopposed, the Court provisionally
GRANTS the Petitions, conditioned on Petitioner appearing (either remotely or
in person) at the hearing.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.

and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
