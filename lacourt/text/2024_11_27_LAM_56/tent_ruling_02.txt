(“Plaintiff”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant
REVEL
MANAGEMENT GROUP (“Revel” or “Defendant”)
 
The
Court has considered the moving and opposition papers.  No reply has been filed.  Any reply was required to have been filed and
served at least five court days prior to the hearing.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)
 
BACKGROUND
             This action arises out of a business
relationship.  On June 6, 2022, Plaintiff
initiated this action against Defendants Roberto Banuelos Jr. and Revel
(collectively, “Defendants”).  The First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) was filed on September 16, 2022.  
 
            On August 14, 2023, Defendants filed
a Motion for Summary Judgment with regard to the FAC, which was granted by the
Court in its entirety in an Order dated June 14, 2024.
 
            On February 15, 2024, Revel filed a
cross-complaint (“Cross-Complaint”) against Plaintiff, Alexandra del Salto and
The Muse Agency, LLC (collectively, “Cross-Defendants”).  Cross-Defendants each filed an answer to the
Cross-Complaint, and Revel filed demurrers to Cross-Defendants’ respective answers
to the Cross-Complaint.  On June 27,
2024, Cross-Defendants jointly filed their First Amended Answer to the
Cross-Complaint (“FAA”).  As a result,
Revel’s initial demurrer to Cross-Defendants’ respective answers was moot and
taken off the calendar.  Revel again
filed a demurrer to Cross-Defendants’ FAA.  On October 24, 2024, the Court overruled
Revel’s demurrer to the FAA.  
 
            On June 28, 2024, Defendants filed a
Memorandum of Costs.  On July 16, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion to Tax and Strike Costs (the “Motion”).  Revel filed an opposition to the Motion on November
12, 2024.  No reply has been filed.
 
DISCUSSION
            In general, the “prevailing party”
is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs for suit in any action or
proceeding.  (CCP § 1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th
599, 606; Scott Co. of Calif. V. Blount,
Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.) 
“Prevailing party” includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a
defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither
plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those
plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.  (CCP § 1032(a)(4).)
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 sets forth
the costs recoverable by the prevailing party.  To recover a cost, it must be reasonably
necessary to the litigation and reasonable in amount.  (Perko’s
Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (l992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.)  If the items appearing in a cost bill appear
to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show
that they were not reasonable or necessary.  (Ladas
v. California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761,
773-74.)  On the other hand, if the items
are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on
the party claiming them as costs.  (Id.) 

 
“[T]he mere filing of a motion to tax costs may be
a ‘proper objection’ to an item, the necessity of which appears doubtful, or
which does not appear to be proper on its face.”  (Nelson
v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131.)  “However, ‘[i]f the items appear to be proper
charges the verified memorandum is prima facie evidence that the costs,
expenses and services therein listed were necessarily incurred by the defendant
[citations], and the burden of showing that an item is not properly chargeable
or is unreasonable is upon the [objecting party].’”  (Id.
[quoting Oak Grove School Dist. V. City
Title Ins. Co. (1963) 217 Cal.App.2d 678, 699] [alterations in original].)
 
            Here, Defendant is a prevailing
party by virtue of the June 14, 2024 Order granting summary judgment in its
favor.  This is not disputed by Plaintiff
in his Motion.   
 
            Plaintiff seeks to tax and/or strike
Items 4(a), (b) and (c) of Defendants’ Memorandum of Costs on the basis that
these depositions were taken and used to support the filing of Revel’s
Cross-Complaint and are therefore, unnecessary to the litigation of Plaintiff’s
action.
 
Code
of Civil Procedure § 1033.5 explicitly allows for the recovery of costs related
to the taking, videotaping, and transcribing of necessary depositions.  (CCP, § 1033.5 (a)(3).)  The determination of whether such costs are necessary
is within the trial court’s discretion, and the burden of proof lies with the
party objecting to the costs to show that they were unnecessary or unreasonable.
 (County of Kern v. Ginn (1983) 146
Cal.App.3d 1107.)  
 
Here,
the Court notes that the depositions of the three witnesses claimed in
Defendants’ Memorandum of Costs all occurred after the filing of the
Motion for Summary Judgment.  (Declaration
of Kasey Diba in Support of Opposition to the Motion, ¶¶ 3-4; Declaration of
Mohamad Adwan in Support of Motion [Adwan Decl.”], ¶ 2.)  Thus, the depositions could not have been used as bases to support the filing
of the Motion for Summary Judgment which was eventually granted in Defendants’
favor.  Plaintiff also submits evidence
that Defendants largely used the subject depositions to support the filing of
the Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants. 
(Adwan Decl., ¶5, Exh. 5.)  
 
The
Court concludes, therefore, that while the deposition may be reasonably
necessary for the litigation of Revel’s cross-action, which is still pending
and has yet to be resolved, the depositions were not necessarily incurred for
the purpose of litigation or defense in Plaintiff’s action, in which Revel is a
prevailing party.  Accordingly, the Court
strikes Defendants’ claimed costs related to these depositions in the total
amount of $4,472.50.  
 
RULING
            Based on the foregoing, the Motion
is GRANTED.  The amount to be taxed is
$4,472.50
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
Dated this 27th day of November 2024
