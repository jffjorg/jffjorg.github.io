And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The court has tentatively ruled in favor of Pinnacle Appliance Distributors, Inc. (Pinnacle) in its motion for leave to file an amended cross-complaint. Pinnacle seeks to add a new cross-defendant, G&M Appliance Supply, Inc. (G&M), to its cross-complaint. The proposed amended cross-complaint alleges that Pinnacle entered into a purchase order agreement with G&M for the installation of certain appliances and seeks indemnity from G&M as well as from Pan-Pacific Mechanical, LLC and Webcor Construction, LP. There is no opposition to the motion and no claim of any prejudice. Therefore, the court grants Pinnacle's motion and allows it to file the amended cross-complaint within 10 days of this order."
