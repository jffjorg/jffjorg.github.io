English-text summary:

The Tentative Ruling grants Plaintiffs' motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $206,104.90. The Court finds that the hourly rate and hours claimed by Plaintiffs' attorneys are reasonable. The Court also finds that Defendant's offer under section 998 was insufficiently specific and did not cut off Plaintiffs' entitlement to costs. The Court awards Plaintiffs' attorney fees for work performed by Associate Counsel Kimberly Stein, including fees incurred before October 24, 2023. The Court notes that the settlement agreement between the parties provides for the recovery of attorney's fees by the prevailing party, and that the Civil Code and Code of Civil Procedure support the award of attorney's fees.
