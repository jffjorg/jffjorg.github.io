And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Ford Motor Company's motion for a protective order. The motion seeks to protect confidential information, including warranty manuals, customer care policies, and global contact center records. The judge has granted the motion, finding that Ford has shown good cause to protect this information. The judge has also approved Ford's proposed revisions to the protective order, which include clarifying who is subject to the order, prohibiting the receiving party from posting or advertising confidential information, and outlining the process for the return or destruction of Ford's documents upon conclusion of the case. The judge has not found any reason to disallow the proposed revisions, as they are not unreasonable, unduly burdensome, or prejudicial.
