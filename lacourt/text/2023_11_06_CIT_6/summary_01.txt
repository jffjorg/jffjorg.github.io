Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge issues a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to reconsider the court's order sustaining Mercury Insurance's demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint. The plaintiff alleges that Mercury Insurance caused her to suffer a heart attack and seeks to reconsider the court's order. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has not presented any new or different facts, circumstances, or law that would warrant reconsideration. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not provided a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce evidence earlier. The judge orders Mercury Insurance to provide notice and proof of service within five calendar days of the court's order and to submit a proposed judgment of dismissal within 15 calendar days of the court's order.
