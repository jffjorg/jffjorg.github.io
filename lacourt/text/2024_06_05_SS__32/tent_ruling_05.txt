BC714561




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Reconsideration




MOVING PARTY:


Cross-Defendants
  Gerald Michael Fitzgerald and Susan Fitzgerald




OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff
  David Whiteside



 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a premises liability
action based on an incident that occurred on October 23, 1999, when plaintiff
David Whiteside (Plaintiff) was thirteen months old. Plaintiff initially filed
a complaint against then defendants John Ivancic (John), Slavko Ivancic
(Slavko), Gerald Fitzgerald and Susan Fitzgerald on September 7, 2000 (LASC
Case No. BC236431). The initial action was voluntarily dismissed in 2002.
 
Plaintiff refiled the action
on July 17, 2018 against John and Slavko. On September 6, 2018, Slavko filed
his Answer, along with his Cross-Complaint against Gerald and Susan Fitzgerald.
Slavko died on November 13, 2018. Slavko’s estate was substituted in as a
defendant on July 22, 2022.
 
On July 25, 2023, the Court
granted a motion to dismiss as to defendants Slavko Ivancic and the Estate of
Slavko Ivancic.
 
On September 6, 2023, the
Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for new trial, reinstated the proceedings and
ordered Estate of Slavko Ivancic (“Estate”) to file a responsive pleading
within 30 days.
 
On September 21, 2023, John
Ivancic and The Estate of John Ivancic were dismissed without prejudice. (Min.
Order, 9/21/23.)
 
On December 14, 2023, the
Court overruled Estate of Slavko Ivancic’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint.
The Court ordered Estate of Slavko Ivancic to file a responsive pleading. (Min.
Order, 12/14/23.)
 
On January 16, 2024, Estate of
Slavko Ivancic filed an answer and a cross-complaint against Gerald Michael
Fitzgerald, Susan Fitzgerald, and Roes 1 to 25 for indemnity, contribution, and
declaratory relief.
 
On April 16, 2024, the Court
overruled the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendants Gerald Michael Fitzgerald and
Susan Fitzgerald (“Cross-Defendants”). (Min. Order, 4/16/24.) 
 
On April 25, 2024, Cross-Defendants
filed the instant motion for reconsideration of the April 16, 2024 demurrer order.
Plaintiff David Whiteside opposes, and Cross-Defendants reply. 
 
JUDICIAL
NOTICE
 
The
Court declines to rule on Cross-Defendants’ requests for judicial notice as
they have no effect on the ruling herein. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 provides, in pertinent
part:   
 
“(a) When an application for an order has been made to a
judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make an application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what order
or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law
are claimed to be shown.  
 
(b) A party who originally made an application for an order
which was refused in whole or in part, or granted conditionally or on terms,
may make a subsequent application for the same order upon new or different
facts, circumstances, or law, in which case it shall be shown by affidavit what
application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions
were made, and what new or different facts circumstances, or law are claimed to
be shown. For a failure to comply with this subdivision, any order made on a
subsequent application may be revoked or set aside on an ex parte
motion.   
… 
(e)¿This section specifies the court’s jurisdiction with
regard to applications for reconsideration of its orders and renewals of
previous motions, and applies to all applications to reconsider any order of a
judge or court, or for the renewal of a previous motion, whether the order
deciding the previous matter or motion is interim or final. No application to
reconsider any order or for the renewal of a previous motion may be considered
by any judge or court unless made according to this section.”  
 
(Code Civ. Proc. section 1008, subds. (a),
(b), (e).)   
 
A motion for
reconsideration under Section 1008 requires that the moving party present new
or different facts that were not previously considered by the Court. (New
York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-13.)
However, the burden under Section 1008 “is comparable to that of a party
seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence: the information
must be such that the moving party could not, with reasonable diligence, have
discovered or produced it at the trial.” (Id.; Even Zohar
Construction & Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61
Cal.4th 830, 833 [finding that Section 1008 imposes the special requirement of
having to not only show new or different facts, circumstances, or law, but also
to “show diligence with a satisfactory explanation for not presenting the new
or different information earlier…”].)¿¿A disagreement with a ruling is not a
new fact that will support the granting of a motion for reconsideration. (Gilberd
v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.)  
 
If the above
statutory requirements are met, reconsideration should be granted. However, a
court is not required to change its decision upon reconsideration. (Corns v.
Miller (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 195, 202.) Although parties may move for
reconsideration only as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, the
statute “do[es] not limit the court's ability, on its own motion, to reconsider
its prior interim orders so it may correct its own errors.” (Le Francois v.
Goel¿(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1107.)  
 
DISCUSSION
 
Cross-Defendants argue that the
Court’s ruling relied, sua sponte, on Code of Civil Procedure section
362. As a result, Cross-Defendants argue they were unable to effectively
address this section since it was not raised in the opposition papers. (Motion,
3–4.)[1] 
 
Cross-Defendants argue that Section
362 “is a code section about the retroactive application of the statutes of
limitations delineated in Title 2 … and thus, only referring to ‘actions
already commenced’ as of the year 1872. This interpretation is clarified
because section 377.41, enacted in 1992, specifically outlines the procedures
for a Court with ‘pending actions’ against a decedent where a party dies and
sets forth that proof of claims filing requirements in Probate Court in
accordance with Probate Code § 9000 must be proven to the Court.” (Motion at p.
2.) 
Cross-Defendants’ argument
regarding section 377.41 does not establish that section 366.2 applies here. As
the Court noted in its April 16, 2024 order, among other things, section 350
provides that “[a]n action is commenced, within the meaning of this Title, when
the complaint is filed.” In both the original motion and the motion to
reconsider, Cross-Defendants fail to provide authority that the one-year
statute of limitations in section 366.2 began to run when Slavko died, after
the complaint was already filed.
 
The crux of Cross-Defendants’
argument is rather that the Court erred in permitting the action to be
continued against the personal representative, relying on section 377.41. (See,
e.g., Motion at pp. 4-6.) However, that ruling was made by a different judicial
officer on July 22, 2022. (Min. Order, 7/22/24 [granting Plaintiff’s motion to
continue the action against the personal representative of decedent’s estate].)
Cross-Defendants do not explain how this motion to reconsider is timely or
procedurally proper.
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court DENIES Cross-Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration. 
 
Cross-Defendants shall provide notice and file a proof of
service of such.
