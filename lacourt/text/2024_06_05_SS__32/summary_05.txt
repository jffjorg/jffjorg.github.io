And here is the summary in English:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for reconsideration filed by Cross-Defendants Gerald Michael Fitzgerald and Susan Fitzgerald. The Court previously overruled the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendants. Cross-Defendants argue that the Court's ruling relied on Code of Civil Procedure section 362, which they claim is a code section about the retroactive application of the statutes of limitations. They argue that section 362 applies to pending actions already commenced as of the year 1872. However, the Court finds that Cross-Defendants fail to provide authority that the one-year statute of limitations in section 366.2 began to run when Slavko Ivancic died. The Court also notes that the ruling on section 377.41 was made by a different judicial officer on July 22, 2022. Therefore, the Court denies the motion for reconsideration.
