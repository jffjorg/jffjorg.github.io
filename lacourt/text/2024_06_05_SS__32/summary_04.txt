And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Tatyana Ivanova, moves for terminating sanctions or, in the alternative, a writ of execution and additional monetary sanctions against the defendant, Chen Family Trust, Co-Trustees Jack M. Chen and Shirley S. Chen, for failing to comply with a May 9, 2023 discovery order issuing $1,061.65 in sanctions. The court denies the request for terminating sanctions as it appears this motion is based solely on the defendant's failure to pay monetary sanctions. The court also denies the request for a writ of execution as the procedure has not been followed under Code of Civil Procedure section 699.510. Additionally, the court denies the request for additional monetary sanctions as the plaintiff fails to identify a statutory basis for further sanctions.
