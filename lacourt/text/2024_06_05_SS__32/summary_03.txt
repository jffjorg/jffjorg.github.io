And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has denied Plaintiff's Counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel due to a breakdown in communication. The Court finds that relieving counsel will likely prejudice Plaintiff's rights, particularly given the proximity to the trial date. Furthermore, Counsel failed to show reasonable steps to avoid prejudice to Plaintiff's rights and failed to confirm Plaintiff's address. Therefore, the Court denies the motion and orders Counsel to provide notice of the ruling and file proof of service.
