RULING
 



DEPT:

HEARING DATE:


June
  5, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


21STCV28026




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to be Relieved as Counsel




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Destiny Serna’s Counsel




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiff
Destiny Serna’s (Plaintiff) counsel of
record, Nathan Samooha (Counsel), moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff.
Counsel contends relief is necessary because there has been a breakdown in attorney-client
communication.
 
            No
opposition has been filed for this motion. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
To be granted relief as counsel, counsel must comply with California
Rules of Court (CRC) 3.1362. Even where grounds for termination exist,
attorneys seeking to withdraw must comply with the procedures set forth in
California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3.700 and are subject to
discipline for failure to do so. CRPC 3.700(B) lists various grounds for
mandatory withdrawal. 
 
An attorney's right to terminate the attorney-client relationship and
withdraw from a case is not absolute. (See Vann v. Shilleh (1975) 54
Cal.App.3d 192, 197; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.) The
decision whether to grant or deny an application for withdrawal is within the
court's discretion, and it does not abuse that discretion by denying the
application on the ground that the attorney's withdrawal would work injustice
upon a third party. (Hodcarriers, Bldg. and Common Laborers Local Union No.
89 v. Miller (1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 391.)
 
The rules have been liberally construed to protect clients. (Vann
v. Shilleh, supra, 54 Cal.App.3d 192.) An attorney, either with client's
consent or court's approval, may withdraw from a case when withdrawal can be
accomplished without undue prejudice to client's interests; however, an
attorney “shall not withdraw from employment until the member has taken
reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the
client, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for employment
of other counsel, complying with rule 3-700(D), and complying with applicable
laws and rules.” (CRPC 3.700(A)(2).) A lawyer violates his or her ethical
mandate by abandoning a client (Pineda v. State Bar (1989) 49 Cal.3d
753, 758 759), or by withdrawing at a critical point and thereby prejudicing
the client’s case. (CRPC 3.700(A)(2); Vann v. Shilleh, supra.)
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Counsel has filed forms MC-051 and
MC-052 and has lodged with the Court a copy of the proposed order on form
MC-053 as required.  (Cal Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362.)  Counsel states the instant
motion is filed for the following reason: “The basis for this motion is a
breakdown in communication between Plaintiff's counsel and Plaintiff.” (MC-052.) 
 
            Counsel has provided information for
all future proceedings in this case. However, the Court notes that the final
status conference is set for July 8, 2024, and trial is set for July 22, 2024. No
motion to continue trial has been filed in this case. Given the
proximity to the trial date, the Court finds that relieving counsel will likely
prejudice Plaintiff’s rights. Counsel does not set forth facts
showing that he has taken reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable
prejudice to the rights of Plaintiff. (See CRPC 1.16(d).) 
 
            Additionally, Counsel has been
unable to confirm Plaintiff’s address despite calling Plaintiff’s last known
telephone numbers. The Court finds this is insufficient. Counsel must make
other efforts to confirm the address, as listed in item 3b(2) of MC-052, or any
other method.  
 
Accordingly, the Court DENIES the motion to relieve
counsel.  
 
Counsel shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file
proofs of service of such.
