And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the plaintiffs' request to continue the hearing on their motion for an order permitting discovery under Civil Code Section 3295(c). The hearing was specially set for September 30, 2024, at the plaintiffs' request. The plaintiffs argue that the hearing should be reset for a later date to give the defendant, State Farm, an opportunity to respond to a declaration filed by the plaintiffs, but the court does not need to move the hearing to do so. State Farm has already filed objections to the declaration and the court will consider it despite being belatedly filed. The court is giving State Farm an opportunity to file a supplemental opposition to the motion to address the declaration. The judge admonishes the plaintiffs' counsel to be more careful, as the declaration should have been filed along with the motion, and their lack of attention to filing details has imposed burdens on State Farm and the court.
