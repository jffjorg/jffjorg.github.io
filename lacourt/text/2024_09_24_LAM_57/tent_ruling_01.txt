  Case Number:  20STCV48692    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  57 The Court is denying the ex parte application of Plaintiffs Hicham Zerhouni and Wafae Benchekroun ("the Plaintiffs") to continue the September 30, 2024 hearing on their Motion for an Order Permitting Discovery Under Civil Code Section 3295(c) ("the Section 3295(c) Motion").  The Court specially set the hearing on the Section 3295(c) Motion for September 30, 2024 at the Plaintiffs' request made in a previous ex parte application that they filed.   The Plaintiffs now argue that the hearing on the Section 3295(c) Motion should be reset for a later date to give Defendant State Farm Automobile Insurance Company ("State Farm") an opportunity to respond to the declaration of David Easton ("the Easton Declaration") that Plaintiffs submitted in support of the Section 3295(c) Motion.  The Plaintiffs referred to the Easton Declaration in their Section 3295(c) Motion, but failed to file it.  The Plaintiffs belatedly filed the Easton Declaration after State Farm filed its opposition to the Section 3295(c) Motion.  The hearing on the Section 3295(c) Motion does not need to be moved in order for State Farm to have an opportunity to respond to the Easton Declaration.  After all, State Farm already has filed evidentiary objections to the Easton Declaration, including that it was belatedly filed.   The Court will consider the Easton Declaration even though it was belatedly filed.  The Court is giving State Farm an opportunity to file a supplement opposition to the Section 3295(c) Motion to address the Easton Declaration and make arguments about the Easton Declaration not advanced in the evidentiary objections to it.   State Farm can file the supplemental opposition the morning of the hearing on September 30, 2024 and bring copies of it to the Court at the hearing.The Court admonishes counsel for Plaintiffs to be more careful.  The Easton Declaration obviously should have been filed along with the Section 3295(c) Motion.   Counsel's lack of attention to important filing details has imposed burdens on State Farm and the Court.
