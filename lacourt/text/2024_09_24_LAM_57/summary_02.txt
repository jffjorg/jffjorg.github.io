And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion for a new trial, denying the motion. The defendants had argued that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to justify the Court's statement of decision, but the Court has found that the evidence does support its decision. Specifically, the Court has found that the defendants failed to provide sufficient evidence to rehabilitate Adam Lowe's credibility, and that the Court's assessment of Lowe's credibility was not capricious. The Court has also found that the defendants' critique of Daniel Bax's testimony misses the mark, and that the Court's review of the evidence from the Electronic Data Recorder (EDR) and expert testimony supports the statement of decision. Finally, the Court has found that the evidence presented at trial supports its finding that the defendants breached their obligation under the policy by withholding material information from State Farm.
