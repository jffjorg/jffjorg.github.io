Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service of summons and petition filed by Chao Jiang, the defendant. Jiang claims that the service was improper because he does not live at the address where the summons and petition were served, and that the address is not his usual place of business or usual mailing address. The Court finds that the Plaintiff, Haier Financial Factoring (Chongqing) Co. Ltd., has not met its burden of proof to establish the facts of jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. As a result, the motion to quash is granted, and the petition for recognition and enforcement of a foreign-country money judgment is taken off calendar.
