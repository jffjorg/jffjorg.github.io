 Case Number:  23PSCV00259    Hearing Date:   October 8, 2024    Dept:  H ORDER
ON DEFAULT JUDGMENT APPLICATION
Plaintiff Straight Forwarding, Inc.’s Application
for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.


Background
Plaintiff
Straight Forwarding, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
Plaintiff provides logistic services, including arranging
shipment of freight and providing storage/warehouse services for its customers.
Commencing in or about October 2022, Plaintiff and Global Sales Channel Group
Inc. (“Global”) agreed that Plaintiff would handle certain shipments for Global
arriving in Los Angeles in exchange for a fee and reimbursement of expenses and
costs. Plaintiff sent Global invoices totaling $30,765.84, but Global has
failed to pay. On or about October 1, 2022 Ou issued Check No. 1055 for $10,000.00
to Plaintiff on Global’s account, but it bounced. On October 28, 2022,
Plaintiff received Check No. 1061 for $6,300.47 on Global’s account, which was
post-dated for November 22, 2022. Defendants asked Plaintiff not to deposit Check
No. 1061 until November 22, 2022, but requested that Plaintiff release their
shipment in the interim. Plaintiff complied, but Check No. 1061 also bounced
when Plaintiff deposited it.
On
July 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed an “Amendment to Complaint,” wherein Haidong Ou
aka Alan Ou (“Ou”) was named in lieu of Doe 1.
On
August 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint, asserting causes of
action against Global and Does 1-50 for (1) breach of contract, (2) open book
account, (3) account stated, and (4) fraud based on bad check.
On
March 9, 2024, the Clerk entered default against Global. On June 13, 2024, the
Clerk entered default against Ou.
Pending
before the Court is Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment.

 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
Application for Default Judgment is denied without prejudice. The
following defects are noted: 
1.       Plaintiff
has not provided the court with a brief summary of the case, as per California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(1).


2.       Plaintiff’s
Accounting Manager and person most knowledgeable, Jane Xu  (“Xu”), references invoices purportedly sent
to Global as having been attached as Exhibit A to her declaration. Xu also
references Checks Nos. 1055 and 1061. There are no exhibits attached to Xu’s
declaration.

3.       It
is unclear to the Court how Global is liable for $47,066.31, or how Ou is liable
for $16,300.47 of this amount. Plaintiff has alleged that Global owes it
$30,765.84. (FAC, ¶ 20.) Plaintiff has also alleged that Ou issued and signed
Check No. 1055 for $10,000.00 and that this bounced. (Id., ¶ 24.)
Plaintiff has not made any other allegations specific to Ou. Plaintiff is directed
to brief this issue for the Court.
Accordingly,
the Court denies Plaintiff’s application without prejudice and directs
Plaintiff to submit a revised default judgment packet that addresses the
aforementioned issues.
