And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the application of Kevin M. Pugliese to appear as pro hac vice counsel for Plaintiffs Custom Alloy Sales, Inc. and Endurance American Specialty Insurance Company without prejudice. The Court found that the proof of service accompanying the application was incomplete, as it did not include service of the application on the State Bar of California at its San Francisco office. Additionally, the Court did not see any reference to a fee having been paid to the State Bar. The denial of the application is without prejudice, meaning that Pugliese may reapply in the future if the deficiencies in the application are corrected.
