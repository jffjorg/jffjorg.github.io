And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendants' motion to reclassify the unlimited civil case to a limited civil case for all purposes. The defendants failed to show good cause for not seeking reclassification earlier. The court finds that the defendants' motion was filed too late, as they had already had an opportunity to respond to the complaint and conduct discovery. The court is inclined to set an order to show cause on November 15, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. and will hear further from the parties at the hearing.
