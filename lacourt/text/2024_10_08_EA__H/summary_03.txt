And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The ruling notes three defects in the plaintiff's application: (1) the lack of a brief summary of the case, (2) the failure to attach exhibits to the declaration of the plaintiff's accounting manager, and (3) the unclear liability and damages owed by the defendants. The judge directs the plaintiff to address these issues and submit a revised default judgment packet.
