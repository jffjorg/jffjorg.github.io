And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying an ex parte application to unseal a petition for approval of a claim or action related to a settled personal injury case. The plaintiff, Marvin Kay, had filed the application to gain access to information about the case, which was handled by an attorney who passed away. The judge denies the application because the petition was not filed under seal, and therefore, the plaintiff's counsel can access it through the docket. Additionally, the defendants have agreed to stipulate that the case settled for over $4 million, making the application moot. The judge orders the plaintiff's counsel to provide notice and file proof with the court.
