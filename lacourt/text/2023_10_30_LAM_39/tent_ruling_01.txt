  Case Number:  22STCV32849    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2023    Dept:  39 Marvin Kay v.
Gregory A. Yates, et al.
Case No.
22STCV32849
Ex Parte
Application to Unseal Pleading
 
            Plaintiff
Marvin Kay (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Gregory A. Yates; Gregory A.
Yates, P.C.; Steve Vartazarian; and the Vartazarian law Firm (collectively,
“Defendants”),  asserting causes of
action for breach of contract and conversion. 
Plaintiff alleges as follows:
 
            Edward
Steinbrecher (“Steinbrecher”) was an attorney who maintained a practice, Edward
Steinbrecher, P.C. (the “practice”). 
(Complaint, ¶ 1.)  Steinbrecher
passed away, and in May 2019, the probate court appointed Plaintiff to be the
practice administrator for the practice. 
(Ibid.)  At the time of his death,
Steinbrecher was handling a personal injury case on behalf of the plaintiff:
Anthony Miramontes v. United Parcel Services, Inc., et al., Case No. BC661807
(the “Miramontes case”).  (Complaint, ¶
10.)  Prior to his death, Steinbrecher
had spent approximately 4,000 hours on the case.  (Complaint, ¶ 13.)  Plaintiff and Gregory A. Yates, Esq.
negotiated an agreement under which Yates would handle the Miramontes case, and
Plaintiff would be paid a portion of the attorney’s fees earned by Yates.  (Complaint, ¶ 14 & Exh. B.)  Specifically, the agreement included “a
sliding scale” up to the agreed upon value of Steinbrecher’s work, which was $4
million (based upon the 4,000 hours at a rate of $1,000 per hour).  (Complaint, ¶¶ 14-15.)  Plaintiff alleges that the Miramontes case
settled, but that Defendants did not pay Plaintiff the required attorney’s
fees.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 19-25.)  This action for breach of contract and
conversion followed.
 
            Plaintiff
filed an ex parte application to unseal the petition for approval of claim or
action or disposition of proceeds of judgment for a minor in Case Number
BC661807.  The Court denies this
application for two reasons.  First, the
petition, which was filed on October 28, 2021, was not filed under seal, so
Plaintiff’s counsel can access it through the docket in Case Number
BC661807.  The Court’s order, dated
December 1, 2021, which lists the settlement and disbursal amounts, is not
under seal.  Therefore, this application
is moot.  Second, Defendants in this case
have agreed to stipulate that Case Number BC661807 settled for over $4 million.
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the ex parte application is denied.  Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide notice and
file proof of such with the Court.
