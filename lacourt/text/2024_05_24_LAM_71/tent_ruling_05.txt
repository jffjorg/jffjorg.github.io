[1] The Court notes Sandoval does not demur to the 2nd
cause of action for revenge porn, alleged against Madix.


[2] The Court notes Sandoval’s citation to Drennan
is incorrect; Drennan was published in Cal.App.4th,
not Cal.App.2d.  (See
Demurrer, pgs. 4-5.)  Relatedly, Plaintiff’s
citation to People v. Lyon is incorrect; Lyon was published in
Cal.App.5th, not Cal.5th.  (See
Opposition, pg. 5.)  The Court advises
both parties to double check their citations before filing their papers with
the Court.
