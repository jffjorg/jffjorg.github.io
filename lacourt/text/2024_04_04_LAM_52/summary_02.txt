And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, CoriAndre Crane, moves to compel defendants Abraham Melchor Espinoza and Olivia Valentin to respond to interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admissions. The plaintiff argues that the defendants failed to timely respond to authorized discovery, and therefore waived any objections. The court finds that the plaintiff has established grounds for ordering the defendants to respond to the interrogatories and requests for production. The court orders the defendants to serve verified responses to the interrogatories and requests for production within 30 days, and to produce all responsive documents concurrently with their written responses. The court also orders the defendants to pay $1,940 in sanctions.
