ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On August 15, 2023, Plaintiff BFS
Group of California, LLC, formerly known as BMC West, LLC, (“Plaintiff”) filed
an action against Defendants Global Home Design & Development, Inc.
(“Global Home”), Zhirayr Jerry Lusikyan (“Lusikyan”), individually and dba
Global Home, Narine Fstkchyan, individually and as trustee of the Narine
Separate Property Trust, Harut Fstkdayam, Hagop Fstkdayam, and the North River
Insurance Company (“Defendants”) for breach of contract; quantum meruit;
account stated; foreclosure of Mechanic’s Lien; enforcement against on Mechanic
Lien’s Lien Release Bond; Recovery on Contractor’s License Bond; and Recovery
on Personal Guaranty. 
 
The Complaint alleges that on or
around January 23, 2023, Plaintiff and Defendants Global Home and Lusikyan
entered into a written contract Credit Application (“Contract”), “the purpose
of which was to allow Global Home and Lusikyan to purchase building materials
from Plaintiff on a credit basis for various projects for which Global Home and
Lusikyan would perform construction services, including the private work of
improvement of their property located at 6525 Varna Avenue, Van Nuys, CA 91401.”  (Complaint, ¶ 15.)  Plaintiff alleges that on or about March 9,
2023, Global Home and Lusikyan breached their Contract by failing to pay the
sum then due and owing to Plaintiff in the amount of approximately $23,771.45,
and by requiring Plaintiff to provide equipment and materials without
compensation. (Complaint, ¶ 18.)  
 
On October 12, 2023, default was entered against
Defendants Global Home and Lusikyan (individually and dba Global Home). 
 
On November 29, 2023, default was entered against Defendant
Harut Fstkdayam. 
 
On June 25, 2024, Plaintiff’s dismissed the action as to
The North River Insurance Company only. (6/25/24 Request for Dismissal.) 
 
On July 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion
for Order for Judgment Pursuant to Stipulation. On August 15, 2024, the Court
denied the motion without prejudice, finding that Plaintiff failed to attach
the fully executed stipulation and default notice referenced in the accompanying
declarations. (8/15/24 Order.) 
 
On August 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion for Order to Enter Judgment Against the Defendants Pursuant
to Stipulation (the “Motion”), which includes the fully executed stipulation
and default notice referenced in the accompanying declarations. (Motion, Exhs.
A, B.)
 
No Opposition was filed.  

 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure, section 664.6: 
 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the
parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for
settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties,
the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement
until performance in full of the terms of the settlement. 
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed by
a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
 
(1) The party. 
(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
(3) If an insurer is defending and indemnifying a party
to the action, an agent who is authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on
the party’s behalf. This paragraph does not apply if the party whom the insurer
is defending would be liable under the terms of the settlement for any amount
above the policy limits.” 
 
III.             
Discussion

 
Plaintiff moves for an
order for judgment pursuant to the stipulation against Defendants. The Stipulation
for Future Entry of Judgment (the “Stipulation”) filed by Plaintiff was signed by
Defendants Global Home and Zhirayr Jerry Lusikyan, individually and dba Global
Home, and Plaintiff on March 26, 2024. (Motion, Exh. A, p. 5.) Accordingly, the
Court considers the Motion as brought by Plaintiff and against Defendants
Global Home and Lusikyan, individually and dba Global Home, only.
 
The Stipulation provides
the matter would be settled for a total sum of $38,270.24 to be paid by
Defendants at a rate of $4,252.25 per month, beginning April 30, 2024 and
continuing each month thereafter until December 31, 2024. (Motion, Exh. A, ¶¶ 1-2.)
The Stipulation provides specific monthly deadlines for each installment
payment as well as the specific mode of payment. (Motion, Exh. A, ¶¶ 2, 4.) Additionally,
the Stipulation states there is no grace period for the installment payments. (Motion,
Exh. A, ¶ 3.) 
 
The Stipulation further provides
that failure to make a timely payment constitutes a default and, in the event
of default, the unpaid balance will become immediately due, and Plaintiff’s
counsel may immediately appear ex parte, without providing notice in order to
obtain judgment. (Motion, Exh. A, ¶ 6.) The Stipulation then states “the Court
may then issue the Judgment, which shall describe the amount due, and which
shall permit [Plaintiff] to immediately enforce the terms thereof and collect
the sums owed from [Defendants], including $38,130.24 less payments received.”
(Motion, Exh. A, ¶ 6.) 
 
Here, the Court finds the Stipulation
to be valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. Plaintiff
submitted evidence Plaintiff and Defendants Lusikyan and Global Home entered
into a Stipulation on or about March 26, 2024. (Motion, Exh. A, p. 5.) Pursuant
to the Stipulation, Defendants agreed to pay Plaintiff $38,130.24 less payments
received in the event of default, which could be proven solely by a declaration
from Plaintiff’s counsel. (Motion, Exh. A, ¶ 6.) Plaintiff submitted a
declaration from Plaintiff’s counsel pursuant to the Stipulation. (Oh Decl.) While
Plaintiff dismissed The North River Insurance Company from the action on June
25, 2024, the Court retained jurisdiction on the matter as this was only a
partial dismissal and the action against Defendants Lusikyan and Global Home is
still before this Court. (See Casa De Valley View Owner’s Assn. v. Stevenson
(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 1182, 1192.) Plaintiff submitted evidence Defendants
failed to perform under the Stipulation as promised, and Plaintiff’s counsel
attempted to contact Defendants regarding the default to no avail. (Oh Decl. ¶
4; Motion, Exh. B.) 
 
  Further,
Plaintiff provides evidence that The North River Insurance Company issued a
payment of $7,500 “for the full amount of the penal sum of the Contractors’
License Bond,” and Plaintiff “applied this partial payment towards reducing the
principal amount owed by Defendants.” (Oh Decl., ¶ 6; Manley Decl., ¶ 8.) As of
the date this Motion was filed, however, Plaintiff had not received any payments
from Defendants or any communication stating Defendants will pay any amount. (Manley
Decl., ¶¶ 6-7; Oh Decl., ¶¶ 3, 5.) Accordingly, Plaintiff submitted evidence
Defendants breached the Stipulation, and Plaintiff is entitled to an order
enforcing the Stipulation and entering judgment against Defendants Lusikyan and
Global Home Design & Development, Inc. 
 
Plaintiff requests that a
judgment of $30,770.24, based on the principal amount of $38,270.24 less
payment received in the amount of $7,500, be entered against Defendant. (Motion,
p. 6; Manley Decl., ¶¶ 8-9; Oh Decl., ¶ 6.) However, the Court notes
Plaintiff’s calculation for the Judgment differs slightly from the calculation
listed in the definite terms of the Default section of the Stipulation, which
states that the Judgment shall be “$38,130.24 less payments
received.”  (Motion, Exh. A, ¶ 6.) 
 
However, Plaintiff’s motion does not satisfy the Notice
Requirements of Code of Civil Procedure § 1005(b) since Hagop Fstkdayam and
Narine Fstkdayam have not been served with the Motion.  
 
IV.

Motion for Order for Judgment Pursuant to Stipulation is CONTINUED to DECEMBER
4, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse, to allow Plaintiff time to serve all parties.
