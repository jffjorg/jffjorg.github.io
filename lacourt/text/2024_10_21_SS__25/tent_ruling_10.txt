 
BACKGROUND
 
            On
January 3, 2024, Plaintiff Creditors
Adjustment Bureau filed the Complaint against Defendants The Times Media
Distributing, Inc. aka The Times Media Distributing Inc dba TDS Delivery
Services and Does 1-10 for breach of contract, open book account, account
stated, and reasonable value. 
 
            On
August 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motions to Compel Responses to
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set
One, and Request for Monetary Sanctions.  On October 11, 2024, at 3:25 pm, Defendant
filed its oppositions. On October 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed its replies. 
            
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Plaintiff
moves for an order compelling Defendant to serve responses to the Plaintiff’s
Request for Production of Documents, Set One and Special Interrogatories, Set
One which were served on May 17, 2023. Plaintiff also requests sanctions in the
amount of $1,560.00 for each motion. 
 
 
OPPOSITION

 
            Defendant
argues that it has served responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories and
Plaintiff’s Production of Documents rendering these motions moot. Further,
Defendant argues that sanctions should be denied because there was substantial
justification as the client’s principal’s son was hospitalized and was unable
to help defense counsel in preparing the necessary response. Moreover, in
August 2024, due to defense counsel’s error and the transferring from unlimited
to limited jurisdiction, counsel lost track of the discovery responses. 
 
REPLY
 
            Plaintiff
argues that Defendant’s opposition is untimely and should be rejected.
Moreover, Plaintiff argues that service of overdue responses does not render
the motion moot and monetary sanctions are warranted. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Motion to Compel Initial 
            Plaintiff
moves for an order compelling Defendant to serve responses to the Plaintiff’s
Request for Production of Documents, Set One and Special Interrogatories, Set
One which were served on May 17, 2023. Plaintiff also requests sanctions in the
amount of $1,560.00 for each motion. 
 
A.                                       
Legal Standard 
 
A party must respond to
interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories or requests for production of
documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party
may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) The party also
waives the right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or
work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) No meet and confer efforts are required before
filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.)
 
Code of Civil
Procedure, Section 203 l .300(a) states that the failure to serve a timely
response to this discovery results in a waiver of any objections, including
ones based on attorney-client privilege or work product. Furthermore, C.C.P.
Section 2031.300 states as follows: (b) The party making the demand may move
for an order compelling response to the inspection demand. ( c) The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a response to an inspection demand, unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails
to obey an order compelling a response, the court may make those orders that
are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, and evidence sanction,
or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 ( commencing with Section 2023.010).
Additionally, Code of Civil Procedure, Section 2023.010 states, in pertinent
part, as follows: Misuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited
to, the following: (d) Failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of
discovery. C.C.P. Section
2023.030 provides for monetary sanctions where the court finds misuse of
discovery.
 
1.                 
Timeliness 
 
            Under
C.C.P. §1005(b), “all moving papers ... shall be served and filed at least
sixteen (16) court days before the hearing." Furthermore, "[a]ll
papers opposing a motion so noticed shall be filed with the court and a copy
served on each party at least nine court days, and all reply papers at least
five court days before the hearing.” 
 
            Here,
Defendant filed its opposition on October 11, 2024, which was six court days
before the hearing. Thus, the opposition was untimely by three court days.
However, the Court in its discretion will consider the opposition. 
 
2.                 
Merits
 
            On May 17,
2024, Plaintiff served Special Interrogatories, Set One and Request for
Production and Inspection of Documents, Set One on Defendant The Times Media
Distributing, Inc. aka The Times Media Distributing Inc dba TDS Delivery
Services by mail and email. (Aposhian Decl. ¶ 3.) Responses were due on June
21, 2024. (Id.) Defendant sought a two-week extension. (Aposhian Decl. ¶
4.) The deadline for the discovery request was moved to July 8, 2024. (Id.)
On July 7, 2024, Defendant's counsel asked for an additional (2) two-week
extension. On July 11, 2024, Plaintiff responded to Defendant's counsel that
discovery responses are overdue, and all objections are waived. However,
Plaintiff partially granted Defendant's extension request and demanded that
Defendant send objection-free responses by close of business on July 17, 2024,
otherwise discovery motions would be filed. (Id.) On July 11, 2024,
Defendant's counsel emailed Plaintiff informing Plaintiff that the responses
would be received on July 15, 2024. On the same day, Plaintiff again reiterated
that if timely and meaningful responses were not received by July 17, 2024,
Plaintiff would move forward with Motions to Compel. (Id. at ¶ 5.) Plaintiff
waited an additional two (2) weeks beyond the due date to allow Defendant to
provide responses. 
 
            However, on
October 11, 2024, Defendant filed its verified responses to both discovery
requests. (Simons Decl. ¶ 6; Ex. A; Aposhian Decl. ¶ 3.) Although Plaintiff
argues that the responses are insufficient, this is beyond the scope of these
Motions to Compel Initial. Nevertheless, Plaintiff may file a Motion to
Compel Further.  
 
            Accordingly,
the Court DENIES the Motions to Compel Defendant’s Responses to Request for
Production of Documents, Set One and Special Interrogatories, Set One as MOOT. 
 
 
3.                 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions be awarded in the amount of $1,560.00 for each Motion to Compel in
favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant and Defense Counsel, jointly, for
misuse of discovery. 
 
Although
Defendant argues that the delay was caused by its client’s principal’s
unavailability and attorney mistake, monetary sanctions are warranted against
Defense Counsel only. For instance, Defense Counsel failed to notify
Plaintiff’s counsel of the principal’s unavailability since July 2024 even
though he had requested multiple extensions and agreed to submit the responses
on July 15, 2024.  Defense Counsel waited
until six days before the hearing to inform Plaintiff about the prior
unavailability. 
 
Nevertheless,
the Court finds the amount requested, $1,560.00 for each Motion to Compel to be
excessive because they are nearly identical and straightforward. Thus, the
Court GRANTS sanctions in a reduced amount to $750 in total. 
 
III.       Conclusion 
 
            In all, the Court DENIES the Motion to Compel
Requests for Production of Documents and Motion to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One as MOOT. 
 
 The Court GRANTS Monetary Sanctions in the
reduced total amount of $750. Defendant’s counsel is
ordered to pay Plaintiff $750 within 30 days of this Court’s order. 
 

Moving party is to give notice of
ruling.
