And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel discovery responses from the defendant. The plaintiff, Creditors Adjustment Bureau, had filed motions to compel the defendant's responses to its discovery requests, including requests for production of documents and special interrogatories. The defendant, The Times Media Distributing, Inc., had opposed the motions, arguing that it had served responses to the discovery requests and that the plaintiff's requests were untimely. The judge has denied the motions to compel as moot, since the defendant has now served its responses to the discovery requests. However, the judge has granted sanctions in the amount of $750 against the defendant's defense counsel, finding that the counsel's failure to notify the plaintiff's counsel of the client's unavailability and attorney mistake constituted misuse of the discovery process.
