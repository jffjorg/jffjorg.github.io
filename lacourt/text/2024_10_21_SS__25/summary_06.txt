And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is ruling on a motion filed by Defendant's counsel, Kerry M. McMahon, to be relieved as counsel. The motion is granted. The judge finds that counsel has substantially complied with the requirements of California Rules of Court 3.1362, including serving the requisite documents on all parties and the client. The breakdown in communication with the client, Marcus Cordell Jones Jr., has made it unreasonable for counsel to continue representing him. The judge orders that the relief is not effective until proof of service of the order on the client is filed in the action. Until then, counsel continues to be counsel of record.
