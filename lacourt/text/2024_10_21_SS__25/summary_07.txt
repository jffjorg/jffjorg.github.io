The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of BFS Group of California, LLC v. Global Home Design & Development Inc, et al. The case involves a breach of contract and a motion for order for judgment pursuant to stipulation. The stipulation was signed by the parties on March 26, 2024, and provides for a total sum of $38,270.24 to be paid by the defendants at a rate of $4,252.25 per month, starting from April 30, 2024. The stipulation also provides for specific monthly deadlines and modes of payment.

The judge finds the stipulation to be valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's motion does not satisfy the notice requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1005(b) since two of the defendants, Hagop Fstkdayam and Narine Fstkdayam, have not been served with the motion.

The judge orders the motion to be continued to December 4, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse, to allow the plaintiff time to serve all parties. The judge also advances an order to show cause re: failure to file proof of service to the same date and time.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further briefing and oral argument.
