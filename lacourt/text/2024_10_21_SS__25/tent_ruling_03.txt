On December 21, 2022, Plaintiff Ely
Sandoval (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against Defendant William Zimmer (Defendant)
alleging one cause of action for Motor Vehicle Negligence related to a motor
vehicle collision on January 2, 2021 involving Plaintiff and Defendant at or
near the vicinity of 18561 Soledad Canyon Road, City of Santa Clarita, County
of Los Angeles, State of California 91351.
 
On June 20, 2024, after failure of
both Plaintiff and Defendant to appear at the scheduled hearing, the Court dismissed
Plaintiff’s Complaint without prejudice.
 
On September 24, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Dismissal.
 
Plaintiff has not complied with
Code of Civil Procedure § 1005 (b). 
 
MOVING PARTY’S
POSITION
 
Plaintiff moves for an order vacating the dismissal entered on June 20,
2024 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b).  Plaintiff contends
that the failure to appear at the June 20, 2024 hearing was due to Plaintiff’s
counsel making an inadvertent calendaring error as to the hearing date. 
Plaintiff’s counsel argues that this error resulted because his law office had
been heavily affected by Covid-19 and suffered a major break-in, including
damage to computers that interfered with his ability to timely calendar and
locate files for this case. 
 
No opposition has
been received.
 
 
 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.   
Legal Standard
 
Judges must vacate dismissals,
default entries, and default judgments “whenever (1) an application is made no
more than six months after entry of judgment, (2) the application is accompanied
by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect, and (3) the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
neglect in fact caused the dismissal or entry of default.”¿ (Benedict v.
Danner Press (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 923, 927, Wagner v. Wagner (2008)
162 Cal.App.4th 249, 258.)
 
B.    
Discussion
 
The motion was timely filed on
September 24, 2024, within the six-month statutory period.
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel Frank Canter (“Counsel”) has established by his declaration that the June
20, 2024 dismissal was entered due to his excusable neglect in failing to
properly calendar. Counsel noted that this calendaring error occurred because Covid-19
heavily affected his law office and a
major break-in occurred at his law office in September 2023, including damage
to computers that interfered with his ability to timely calendar and locate
files for this case. Plaintiff’s resulting failure to appear caused the
June 20, 2024 dismissal. (Decl. Canter ¶¶ 15-18). Therefore, pursuant to the
mandatory provision of the Code of Civil Procedure § 473, subdivision (b), the
court finds that Plaintiff Ely Sandoval has established a right to relief. 
However, plaintiff has not complied with Code of Civil
Procedure § 1005 (b). Under C.C.P. §1005(b), “all moving papers ... shall be
served and filed at least sixteen (16) court days before the hearing." 
 
Here, plaintiff has not filed proof of service in compliance
with Code of Civil Procedure §
1005 (b). 

 
Conclusion 
            
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal is
CONTINUED TO DECEMBER 4, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring
Street Courthouse, to allow plaintiff
to file proof of service of the moving papers in compliance with Code of Civil
Procedure § 1005 (b). 
 
At least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing, Plaintiff must
file and serve supplemental papers addressing the issues discussed herein.  
 
Failure to do so may result in the motion being placed off calendar or
denied.   
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
