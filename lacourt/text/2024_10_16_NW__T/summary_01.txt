And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Susan Helgager's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The motion was filed on September 12, 2024, and sought to add a request for punitive damages based on newly discovered facts. Defendant Sloan Valve Company opposed the motion, arguing that the request for punitive damages was not merited and that there was an inexcusable delay in seeking the amendment. However, the judge found that there was no inexcusable delay and that the defendant failed to show any prejudice or additional costs that would be incurred as a result of the amendment. The judge also noted that the defendant's motion to strike the declaration of Yepp was not properly filed and served, and therefore did not consider it as a motion. The second amended complaint shall be filed within 10 days.
