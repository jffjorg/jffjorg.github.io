The court also granted the defendant's motion to strike certain factual allegations, including those that are irrelevant, false, or improper, and the plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees. The court noted that the plaintiff failed to identify the address/location of the property at issue and that the pleading element as to causation and damages is not asserted in the First Amended Complaint. The court exercised its discretion to allow amendment based upon its liberal policy of allowing amendment at least once, and granted leave to amend as to both the demurrer and motion to strike.
