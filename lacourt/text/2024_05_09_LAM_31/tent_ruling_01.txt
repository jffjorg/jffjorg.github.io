MOTIONS
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY 



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiffs
NBZ Investments, LLC, et al.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Castle
Mortgage Corporation
 
 
On May 5, 2023, Plaintiffs, NBZ Investments, LLC, and Neda
and Behzad Zaman, filed motions to compel Defendant, Castle Mortgage
Corporation, to provide further responses to Plaintiffs’ Request for Production
of Documents, Set Two, and Special Interrogatories, Set Two.  On October 6, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion
to compel Defendant’s further responses to Requests for Admission, Set Two.
 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further response to Request for
Production for Documents Set Two, was heard on January 26, 2024.  Because the parties ad not participated in an
Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) prior to the hearing.  The court also noted that the parties had yet
to participate in an IDC with respect to Plaintiffs’ motions to compel further
responses to Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Admission.  Accordingly, the court continued all three
motions to February 16, 2024 allow the parties to participate in an IDC.  
 
On February 1, 2024, the parties participated in an
IDC.  The issues were not resolved.  The court ordered the parties to meet and
confer and to file a status update. Thereafter, the parties meet and conferred
on three occasions.  On March 12, 2024,
the parties filed a Notice of Outcome requesting a continuance of the
motions.  Pursuant to the Notice of
Outcome, on April 2, 2024, the court continued the hearings to May 9, 2024.
 
The parties have not updated the court on the status of the
discovery dispute.  The court is not
aware of the discovery that remains at issue. 
Accordingly, the court will continue the motions to June 12, 2024.  If the discovery issues have been resolved,
the parties are to file an status update no later than five court days before
the June 12 hearing.  If the discovery
issues remain unresolved, the court sets the following briefing scheduling:
 
Moving party is to file an updated brief and separate
statement outlining the discovery at issue no later than May 20, 2024.  Responding party may file an opposition no
later than May 31, 2024.  Moving party
may file a reply no later than June 6, 2024.
