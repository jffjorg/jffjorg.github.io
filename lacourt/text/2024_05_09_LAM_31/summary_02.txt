And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel defendant to comply with the court's November 30, 2023 order. The court found that the defendant had already served verified responses on November 13, 2023, and that the plaintiff's motion to compel was therefore moot. The court also found that the plaintiff had waived his right to compel a further response, as more than 45 days had passed since the defendant served the verified responses. As a result, the court has denied the plaintiff's request for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions against the defendant.
