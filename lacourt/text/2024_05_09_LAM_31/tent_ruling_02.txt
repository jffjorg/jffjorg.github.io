MOTION
TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH NOVEMBER 30, 2023 ORDER AND REQUEST FOR MONETARY
SANCTIONS



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
A. U. C.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Aroldo
Marroquin
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On October
31, 2023, Plaintiff, A. U. C., filed a motion to compel Defendant, Aroldo
Marroquin, to provide responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One.  While the motion was
pending, Defendant served responses which included objections.  Neither party apprised the court that
responses had been served.  On November
30, 2023, the court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel.  The court ordered Defendant to provide objection-free
responses within 30 days of the date of the court’s order.  Thereafter, Plaintiff inquired as to whether
Defendant would be providing objection-free responses.  Defendant has not provided supplemental
responses.
 
            On April
15, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel Defendant to comply with the
court’s November 30, 2023 order. 
Alternatively, Plaintiff requests terminating sanctions in the form of
striking Defendant’s answer and entering an order rendering a judgment by
default.  Plaintiff also requests monetary
sanctions against Defendant.
 
            Defendant
filed an opposition.  Plaintiff replied. 
                                                     
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
 
            “If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: . . . (B) The party making the demand may move for
an order compelling response to the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (b).)  “If a party then fails to
obey the order compelling a response, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.320, subd. (c).)
 
IV.       DISCUSSION 
 
            The
procedural background of this motion complicates the court’s ruling.  It is undisputed that Defendant served verified
responses to the production demands on November 13, 2023.  (See Medvei Decl., Ex. 2.)  Without knowing that responses had been
served, this court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to Request
for Production on November 30, 2023.  Plaintiff
took issue with Defendant’s responses and now seeks to compel Defendant’s
compliance with the court’s November 30, 2023.  Based on the November 13, 2023 service,
Plaintiff’s motion to compel was mooted.  Plaintiff should have brought a motion to
compel further.  Moreover, notice
of the motion to compel further must be given within 45 days of service of the
verified response, otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel
a further response.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)¿ More than 45
days have passed since Defendant served his verified responses.  Plaintiff has therefore waived his right to
compel a further response.  Given the
foregoing, the court declines to impose terminating sanctions or additional
monetary sanctions against Defendant.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The motion is
DENIED.  
 
The request
for terminating sanctions is DENIED. 
 
The request
for monetary sanctions is DENIED.
 
Defendant to give notice.
