And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to deem admitted the matters specified in the Requests for Admission (RFA) sets one, one/two, three, and four. The defendant failed to timely respond to these requests, and the plaintiff has provided declarations indicating that the defendant's deadline to respond was July 22 and August 1, 2024. The defendant subsequently filed erroneous responses to the RFAs, which the court found insufficient to demonstrate that the defendant served the plaintiff with the responses.

The court has also granted the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions and ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff $250 within thirty days of notice of the court's orders. The court notes that the plaintiff is self-represented and has not incurred attorneys' fees, and that the motions and declarations are substantially identical to one another, further reducing the reasonable amount of time the plaintiff spent preparing them.
