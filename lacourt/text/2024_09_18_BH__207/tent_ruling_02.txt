[1] The Court notes that because business entities must
be represented by counsel, the Court may not consider any opposition filed by
Defendant Obaida Batal MD in pro per on behalf of Body By Batal Cosmetic
Surgery Center. (See CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004)
120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1147-1152.)Â 
However, because the discovery was propounded on Defendant Obaida Batal
MD only, who also responded on his own behalf, the Court considered the merits
of the opposition.
