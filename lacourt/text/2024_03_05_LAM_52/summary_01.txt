And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's motion for approval of the settlement of the representative PAGA action without prejudice. The Judge finds that the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable, with the parties reaching the agreement at mediation and allocating 35% of the gross settlement fund to attorney fees. However, the Judge notes that the settlement only addresses the claims against Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. and does not dispose of the entire action, as the complaint also names Larry Marsh as a defendant. The Judge will not enter the proposed judgment, citing the principle that there can only be one final judgment in an action that disposes of all the causes of action pending between the parties.
