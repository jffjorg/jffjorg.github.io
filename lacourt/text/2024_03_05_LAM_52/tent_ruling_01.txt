  Case Number:  22STCV17283    Hearing Date:   March 5, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Natalie N. Martinez’s
Motion for Approval of Representative Action Settlement
Plaintiff
Natalie N. Martinez moves for approval of settlement of this action under the
Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA). 
Labor
Code § 2699(l)(2) provides, “The
superior court shall review and approve any settlement of any civil action
filed pursuant to” PAGA.  Courts review
and approve PAGA settlements to “ensur[e] that any negotiated resolution
is fair to those affected.”  (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 549.)  
The
proposed settlement is fair and reasonable. 
Plaintiff is represented by experienced counsel at Bibiyan Law Group,
P.C.  (Bibiyan Decl., ¶¶ 3-13.)  Plaintiff’s counsel investigated the case and
spent over 750 hours litigating this action. 
(Id., ¶¶ 14, 21-24.)  The
parties reached the settlement at mediation before mediator Mark Rudy,
Esq.  (Chang Decl., ¶ 14.)  The gross PAGA settlement amount of $2,000,000
represents a fair compromise.  Allocating
35% of the gross settlement fund to attorney fees is typical in PAGA settlements
and is fair in this case.
One
issue, however, prevents the court from entering judgment.  The settlement is only between plaintiff
Natalie N. Martinez and defendant Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc.  (Chang Decl., Ex. 1.)  The complaint in this action, however, names
another defendant: Larry Marsh.  Plaintiff
has not requested dismissal of Larry Marsh. 
The settlement and proposed judgment only refer to Marsh as one of the
“Released Parties.”  
The
proposed judgment therefore would not dispose of the entire action.  “‘Ordinarily, there can be only one final
judgment in an action and that judgment must dispose of all the causes of
action pending between the parties.’ ”  (H.D.
Arnaiz, Ltd. v. County of San Joaquin (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1357, 1366.)  A several judgment can be proper under some
circumstances.  (See Oakland Raiders
v. National Football League (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 572, 577-578.)  Liability is generally presumed to be joint,
not several.  (Civ. Code, § 1431.)  The
parties have not established that a several judgment against only Dick’s
Sporting Goods, Inc. would be proper.  The
court therefore will not enter the proposed judgment pursuant to this motion.  
Plaintiff
Natalie N. Martinez’s motion for an order approving the settlement of this
representative PAGA action is denied without prejudice.
