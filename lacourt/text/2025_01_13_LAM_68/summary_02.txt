And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to quash the deposition subpoena and seeking a protective order for Jerry Allyn Whittemore, a designated corporate representative of The Neslemur Company. The court finds no legal or evidentiary support for the Petitioner's claim that Whittemore is a corporate representative and therefore no basis to quash the deposition subpoena or issue a protective order. The court also finds no evidence that Respondents' counsel violated professional standards in their communication with Whittemore. The court defers to the New Jersey trial court for determination of the admissibility of witness testimony or documents generated from conversations with Whittemore.
