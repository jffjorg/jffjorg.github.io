The judge has considered the factors relevant to granting a continuance, including the proximity of the trial date, the length of the requested continuance, and the availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion. The judge has also taken into account the fact that the trial has already been continued three times and is now extensively delayed.

The judge has determined that a brief continuance to August 5, 2024, is warranted due to the need for additional time to prepare for trial. However, the judge has emphasized that no further continuances will be allowed absent extraordinary circumstances or stipulation of all parties.
