And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on the motions to compel further responses to discovery requests filed by the defendants. The parties have been engaged in a dispute over the accounting aspects of the partition action, and the defendants have claimed that the plaintiff's responses to their discovery requests were inadequate.

The judge notes that the purpose of a separate statement in a discovery motion is to make it easier for the court to rule on the motion, not to regurgitate arguments and points from the briefs. The judge is unable to determine which requests the defendants are seeking further responses to, due to the lengthy separate statements filed by the defendants.

The judge grants the motions to compel further responses to requests for admission (RFAs) 19, 20, and 60-62, and orders the plaintiff to provide a second amended response to each request. The judge also orders the parties to meet and confer further, specifically with regards to the motions to compel further responses to special interrogatories and inspection demands.

The judge continues the hearing to April 17, 2024, and orders the moving party to provide a truncated separate statement on or before April 12, 2024. The judge also notes that the issue of sanctions will be discussed at the continued hearing.
