  CASE NO.: 21STCV02631
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST
  FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT; DISMISSING ACTION
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
September 19, 2023



 
On January 18, 2022, Plaintiff Harry Jones filed a first
amended complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant Cobalt Construction Company.  The Court entered default against Defendant on
June 7, 2022.  On July 29, 2022 and April
11, 2023, the Court denied without prejudice Plaintiff’s requests for entry of default
judgment.  On July 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed
this request for entry of default judgment. 
This request is not significantly different from the prior requests.
Plaintiff seeks a judgment of $3,011,659.54, consisting
of $1,000,000.00 in actual damages, $2,000,000.00 in punitive damages, $10,300.00
in attorney fees, and $1,359.54 in costs.
“‘Plaintiffs in a default judgment proceeding must prove
they are entitled to the damages claimed.’ 
[Citation].”  (Kim v. Westmoore
Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 288.)  “[T]he plaintiff must affirmatively establish
his entitlement to the specific judgment requested.” (Id. at p. 287.)
Plaintiff’s $3,000,000.00 in damages consists of emotional
distress damages of $151,778.00 for disability discrimination; emotional distress
damages of $151,778.00 for failure to accommodate disability; emotional distress
damages of $ $151,778.00 for failure to engage
in an interactive process; emotional distress damages of $ $151,778.00 for failure to prevent discrimination; emotional
distress damages of $151,778.00 for wrongful termination; lost income of $241,110.00;
and $2,000,000.00 in punitive damages.  (Brief
at p. 9.)
Plaintiff provides a copy of his paystub from November
19, 2018 through November 25, 2018, reflecting $1,710.00 in weekly earnings and
$79,840.00 year-to-date.  (Jones Decl., Ex.
C.)  Plaintiff declares that after his April
19, 2019 termination, he was unable to secure employment elsewhere until January
2022.  (Jones Decl. ¶¶ 11, 15-16.)  Plaintiff has therefore provided evidence of lost
income damages of $241,110.00 for the 141 weeks between his termination and his
new employment.  (See Brief at p. 6.)
Plaintiff’s statement that he suffered “emotional distress,
mental anguish, shame, and humiliation . . . anxiety, depression, insomnia, and
loss of appetite . . . significant difficulties paying my bills, and problems in
my marriage” (Jones Decl. ¶ 13) is insufficient to support a total of $758,890.00
in compensatory damages for emotional distress. 
(See Brief at pp. 8-9.)  The request
for five awards of $151,778.00 for emotional distress is also improper.  “Regardless of the nature or number of legal theories
advanced by the plaintiff, he is not entitled to more than a single recovery for
each distinct item of compensable damage supported by the evidence.  [Citation.] 
Double or duplicative recovery for the same items of damage amounts to overcompensation
and is therefore prohibited.  [Citation.]”  (Tavaglione v. Billings (1993) 4 Cal.4th
1150, 1158-1159; see CACI 3905A.)
Additionally, Plaintiff’s emotional distress damages
are “damages for personal injury.”  (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 425.11, subd. (b).)  There is no evidence that Plaintiff served a Statement
of Damages for the FAC on Defendant before entry of default.  (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 425.11, subd.
(c).)
Plaintiff seeks $2,000,000.00 in punitive damages.  (Brief at pp. 2, 9.)  The amount of punitive damages must reasonably
relate to the amount of actual damages.  (Uzyel
v. Kadisha (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 866, 924.)  “An award of punitive damages hinges on three
factors: the reprehensibility of the defendant’s conduct; the reasonableness of
the relationship between the award and the plaintiff’s harm; and, in view of the
defendant’s financial condition, the amount necessary to punish him or her and discourage
future wrongful conduct.”  (Kelly v. Haag
(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 910, 914.)
Like with his prior two requests, Plaintiff provides
a copy of a report from Glassdoor that shows that Defendant receives approximately
$100 to $500 million in annual revenue and employees upwards of 200 employees.  (Bazerkanian Decl. ¶ 18 & Ex. K.)  Plaintiff again does not demonstrate personal
knowledge of or establish a foundation for the content contained in this exhibit.  Thus, the Court cannot conclude whether $2,000,000.00
in punitive damages is reasonable.  Additionally,
there is no evidence that Plaintiff served a Statement of Damages on Defendant for
the FAC prior to entry of default.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 425.115, subd. (f).)
Plaintiff requests $10,300.00 in attorney fees authorized
by statute.  Counsel provides a copy of billing
records.  (Bazerkanian Decl., Ex. L.)  This amount appears reasonable.
Plaintiff seeks $1,359.54 in costs.  Plaintiff provides counsel’s Itemized Costs Statement.  (Bazerkanian Decl. ¶ 20 & Ex. M.)  As noted in the prior two orders, at least $65.46
of the itemized costs is for “Postage, printing, report,” which are not statutorily
allowable costs.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subd. (b)(3).)  The Court cannot determine
which are the costs in the Itemized Costs Statement that Plaintiff is seeking to
recover and whether the requested amount is allowable.
The request for entry of default judgment is DENIED.
The Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of Default Judgment
is discharged.
The Court’s July 18, 2023 Order warned Plaintiff that
if he was unable to obtain a default judgment, the Court may dismiss the action.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 583.410, 583.420, subd.
(a)(2)(B); California Rules of Court, rule 3.1340(a)-(b).)  Plaintiff has filed multiple applications for
entry of default judgment, but he has made no effort at all to amend the application
consistent with the Court’s prior orders. 
The Court provided detailed directions on what required amendment, but Plaintiff
made no amendments addressing these deficiencies.
Accordingly, the Court orders this action DISMISSED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
