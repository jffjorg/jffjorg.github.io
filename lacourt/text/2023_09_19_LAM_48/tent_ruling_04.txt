[1] The
court notes the moving party’s citation to the Code of Hammurabi circa 2000
B.C. on the subject of punitive damages. 
That code imposed “[p]enalties for malpractice [by health care providers
as follows]: . . .  a doctor who killed a
rich patient would have his hands cut off, while only financial restitution was
required if the victim was a slave.” The Court believes that punitive damages
have evolved such that 4000-year-old precedent is unhelpful.  See https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-middle-east/hammurabi#Hammurabi
But the Court does appreciate the historical discussion.
