And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Thomas D. Long issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Harry Jones' request for entry of default judgment against Defendant Cobalt Construction Company. The Plaintiff had filed a first amended complaint against the Defendant on January 18, 2022, and the Court had entered default against the Defendant on June 7, 2022. However, the Plaintiff's requests for entry of default judgment had been denied twice previously, and the Plaintiff had failed to amend the application consistent with the Court's prior orders. The Plaintiff sought a judgment of $3,011,659.54, consisting of $1,000,000.00 in actual damages, $2,000,000.00 in punitive damages, $10,300.00 in attorney fees, and $1,359.54 in costs. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's damages were not adequately supported by evidence, and the amount of punitive damages was not reasonable. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff had failed to serve a Statement of Damages on the Defendant, as required by law. As a result, the Judge denied the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment and dismissed the action without prejudice.
