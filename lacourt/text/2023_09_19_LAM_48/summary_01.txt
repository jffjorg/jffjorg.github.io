The Judge also found that the Plaintiff had failed to serve a Statement of Damages on the Defendant, as required by law. As a result, the Judge denied the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment and dismissed the action without prejudice.

## English Summary

The Judge is denying the Plaintiff's request for a default judgment against Cobalt Construction Company.  This is the third time the Plaintiff has made this request, and the Judge has previously issued warnings about potentially dismissing the case if a default judgment was not obtained.

The Plaintiff is seeking over $3 million in damages, including lost income and emotional distress.  However, the Judge found the evidence insufficient to support the claimed damages, particularly for emotional distress.  

The Judge also found issues with the Plaintiff's request for punitive damages, citing a lack of evidence to support the amount.  The Plaintiff also failed to properly serve a Statement of Damages for the case, which is required by law.


The Judge is dismissing the case without prejudice, meaning the Plaintiff can refile it.  However, the Plaintiff must address the issues raised by the Judge in their previous rulings before the case can proceed.

And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment and dismissing the action without prejudice. The Plaintiff, Harry Jones, filed a first amended complaint against the Defendant, Cobalt Construction Company, and was entered in default on June 7, 2022. The Plaintiff has filed multiple requests for entry of default judgment, but the Judge has denied each request due to the Plaintiff's failure to provide sufficient evidence to support his claims.

The Plaintiff is seeking damages of $3,011,659.54, including $1,000,000.00 in actual damages, $2,000,000.00 in punitive damages, $10,300.00 in attorney fees, and $1,359.54 in costs. However, the Judge has found that the Plaintiff's claims for emotional distress damages are insufficient, and that the amount of punitive damages is not reasonable.

The Judge has also found that the Plaintiff has failed to serve a Statement of Damages on the Defendant as required by law, and that the Plaintiff's failure to provide sufficient evidence of his damages is a fatal flaw in his case. As a result, the Judge has dismissed the action without prejudice, allowing the Plaintiff to re-file his case if he can provide sufficient evidence to support his claims.
