  CASE NO.: 23STCV00923
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO STRIKE
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
September 19, 2023



 
On
January 17, 2023, Plaintiff DeLois Jacobs filed this action against Defendant Public
Counsel.  On March 3, 2023, Defendant filed
a motion to strike.
The
court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion: (1) strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of California,
a court rule, or an order of the court.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 436, subds. (a)-(b).)
Defendant
moves to strike allegations related to punitive damages (Complaint ¶¶ 30, 41, 53,
59, 71, 79, 87, 108, and Prayer for Relief ¶ 5).  A plaintiff can recover punitive damages in tort
cases where “the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice.”  (Civ. Code § 3294, subd. (a).)  “The mere allegation an intentional tort was committed
is not sufficient to warrant an award of punitive damages.  [Citation.] 
Not only must there be circumstances of oppression, fraud or malice, but
facts must be alleged in the pleading to support such a claim. [Citation.]”  (Grieves v. Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d
159, 166, fn. omitted.)
Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant “discriminated and retaliated against Plaintiff by terminating
her employment for exercising Plaintiff’s right to request medical leave as an accommodation
of Plaintiff’s disability and/or medical condition.”  (Complaint ¶ 22; see Complaint ¶ 25.)  However, “wrongful termination, without more,
will not sustain a finding of malice or oppression.”  (Scott v. Phoenix Schools, Inc. (2009)
175 Cal.App.4th 702, 717.)  Plaintiff alleges
no other facts to support a finding of oppression, fraud, or malice.  The allegations about “despicable conduct carried
on by the Defendants with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights of Plaintiff”
and conduct that “subjected Plaintiff to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious
disregard of Plaintiff’s rights” are conclusory.
The
motion to strike is GRANTED with 30 days’ leave to amend.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
