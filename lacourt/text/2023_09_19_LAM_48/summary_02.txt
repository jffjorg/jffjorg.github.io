And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer filed by IPL Inc. against Commercial Waste Services, Inc. (CWS). The demurrer was filed in response to CWS's complaint alleging breach of contract and breach of implied warranty. IPL argued that the action is barred by res judicata and the parties' settlement agreement. The Judge found that IPL's demurrer was improper and that the action is not barred by res judicata. The Judge also found that IPL's request for judicial notice was granted, but that the settlement agreement was not judicially noticeable. The Judge therefore overruled the demurrer and ordered IPL to file an answer within 10 days.
