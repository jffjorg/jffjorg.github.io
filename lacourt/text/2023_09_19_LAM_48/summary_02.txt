And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer filed by IPL Inc. against Commercial Waste Services, Inc. (CWS). The demurrer was filed in response to CWS's complaint alleging breach of contract and breach of implied warranty. IPL argued that the action is barred by res judicata and the parties' settlement agreement. The Judge found that IPL's demurrer was improper and that the action is not barred by res judicata. The Judge also found that IPL's request for judicial notice was granted, but that the settlement agreement was not judicially noticeable. The Judge therefore overruled the demurrer and ordered IPL to file an answer within 10 days.

## English Summary

In this case, Commercial Waste Services, Inc. (CWS) sued IPL Inc. for breach of contract and breach of implied warranty due to defective recycling and trash bins they purchased from IPL. IPL countered by filing a demurrer, arguing that the case was barred by res judicata (a previous lawsuit) and a settlement agreement.

The judge, after reviewing the arguments and relevant documents, ruled that IPL's demurrer was **overruled**. The judge found that the previous lawsuit between CWS and IPL, which involved unpaid invoices for the same bins, did not preclude CWS from bringing this new lawsuit based on the bins' defects. 

The judge also determined that a 2020 settlement agreement between CWS, IPL, and another company was not applicable to this case because it was not mentioned in CWS's complaint.


Therefore, the case will proceed, and IPL must now file an answer to the complaint.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by IPL Inc. in a lawsuit brought by Commercial Waste Services, Inc. (CWS). The lawsuit alleges breach of contract and breach of implied warranty.

IPL argued that the lawsuit is barred by res judicata and a settlement agreement. However, the judge found that the settlement agreement is not judicially noticeable because the complaint does not refer to it. Additionally, the judge ruled that IPL is improperly relying on the contents of the settlement agreement and its interpretation.

The judge also granted IPL's request to take judicial notice of the complaint and dismissal with prejudice filed by IPL in a federal lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. However, the judge found that the federal lawsuit is not relevant to the current lawsuit because it involves different causes of action and breaches.

Ultimately, the judge overruled IPL's demurrer and ordered IPL to file an answer within 10 days.

---

This tentative ruling by Judge Thomas D. Long concerns the case 22STCV21658 between Commercial Waste Services Inc. (CWS) and IPL Inc. IPL filed a demurrer, arguing that the action is barred by res judicata and the parties' settlement agreement. However, CWS disputes IPL's ability to defend itself due to its forfeited status with the California Secretary of State.

The court rules that the demurrer is overruled and IPL must file an answer within 10 days. IPL's request for judicial notice and CWS's request for judicial notice are denied as irrelevant. Res judicata does not bar this action, as the dismissal of IPL's claims for unpaid invoices in a previous case is not a final decision on the merits of CWS's claims. The court cannot take judicial notice of the settlement agreement as it is not mentioned in the complaint.

The ruling also mentions that IPL is seeking to adjudicate issues on demurrer that are better suited for summary judgment or trial. If all parties submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the court are required unless a companion hearing is on the calendar.
