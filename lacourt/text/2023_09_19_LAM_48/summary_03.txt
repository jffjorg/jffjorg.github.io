Summary:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the complaint with 30 days' leave to amend. The court finds that the alter ego allegations lack supporting facts and that the contract claims against non-parties are not properly brought. The court also sustains the demurrer to the fraud causes of action for lack of specificity. The motion to strike is granted in part and denied in part. The court grants the request to strike the prayer for punitive damages and denies the request to strike the entire prayer for relief.
