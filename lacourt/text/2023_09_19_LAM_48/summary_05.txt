## English Text Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of Public Counsel, granting their motion to strike the plaintiff, DeLois Jacobs's, allegations seeking punitive damages.  

The judge finds that Jacobs's allegations of wrongful termination due to her request for medical leave are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge explains that "wrongful termination, without more, will not sustain a finding of malice or oppression," and that mere allegations of an intentional tort are not enough. 

The judge notes that Jacobs failed to allege any facts supporting oppression, fraud, or malice beyond the wrongful termination claim. The judge also found the plaintiff's allegations of "despicable conduct" and "conscious disregard" for her rights to be conclusory, meaning they are merely statements of opinion rather than supported by factual evidence.

Therefore, the judge granted the motion to strike the punitive damages allegations, but allowed Jacobs 30 days to amend her complaint and potentially provide additional supporting evidence.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Thomas D. Long, has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's motion to strike allegations related to punitive damages in the complaint filed by the Plaintiff, DeLois Jacobs.

## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling to grant Public Counsel's motion to strike portions of DeLois Jacobs' complaint regarding punitive damages. The judge found that Jacobs' allegations of discrimination and retaliation, while potentially supporting a wrongful termination claim, do not provide enough factual basis to justify punitive damages.  

The judge emphasizes that simply alleging intentional wrongdoing is not enough to support a claim for punitive damages.  Jacobs must provide specific facts demonstrating oppression, fraud, or malice on the part of Public Counsel.  The current complaint lacks such specific factual allegations, rendering the punitive damages claims insufficient.  

The judge is granting the motion to strike, giving Jacobs 30 days to amend her complaint and provide stronger support for her punitive damages claim.

**Event:** Tentative Ruling on Motion to Strike

---

Judge Thomas D. Long has issued a tentative ruling in the case of DeLois Jacobs v. Public Counsel, granting Defendant's motion to strike allegations related to punitive damages. Plaintiff DeLois Jacobs filed the action on January 17, 2023, alleging that Defendant discriminated and retaliated against her. Defendant filed a motion to strike certain allegations on March 3, 2023.

In the tentative ruling, the judge states that a plaintiff can recover punitive damages in tort cases only if the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. The judge found that Plaintiff's allegations of wrongful termination do not support a finding of oppression, fraud, or malice. Plaintiff's additional allegations of "despicable conduct" and conduct that "subjected Plaintiff to cruel and unjust hardship" were deemed conclusory and insufficient to support punitive damages.

The judge grants Defendant's motion to strike allegations related to punitive damages, with a 30-day leave for Plaintiff to amend the complaint. The ruling becomes final unless a party submits an objection or if all parties submit on the tentative ruling.
