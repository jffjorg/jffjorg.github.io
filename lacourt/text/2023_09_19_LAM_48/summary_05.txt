## English Text Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of Public Counsel, granting their motion to strike the plaintiff, DeLois Jacobs's, allegations seeking punitive damages.  

The judge finds that Jacobs's allegations of wrongful termination due to her request for medical leave are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge explains that "wrongful termination, without more, will not sustain a finding of malice or oppression," and that mere allegations of an intentional tort are not enough. 

The judge notes that Jacobs failed to allege any facts supporting oppression, fraud, or malice beyond the wrongful termination claim. The judge also found the plaintiff's allegations of "despicable conduct" and "conscious disregard" for her rights to be conclusory, meaning they are merely statements of opinion rather than supported by factual evidence.

Therefore, the judge granted the motion to strike the punitive damages allegations, but allowed Jacobs 30 days to amend her complaint and potentially provide additional supporting evidence.
