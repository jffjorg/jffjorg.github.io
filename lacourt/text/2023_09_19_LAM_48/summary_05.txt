And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike allegations related to punitive damages from the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant discriminated and retaliated against them by terminating their employment, but the allegations do not support a finding of oppression, fraud, or malice. The judge finds that the allegations are conclusory and do not provide sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The motion to strike is granted with 30 days' leave to amend.
