And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Healthcare Ally Management of California, LLC v. Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, LLP. The case concerns a dispute over alleged misrepresentations made by Aetna, an insurance company, on behalf of Defendant. The Court has overruled Defendant's demurrer to Plaintiff's second amended complaint, which alleges negligent misrepresentation and promissory estoppel.

The Court found that Defendant's demurrer was unavailing because the claims at issue are not preempted by ERISA, a federal law that governs employee benefit plans. The Court cited several cases, including Morris B. Silver M.D., Inc. v. International Longshore & Warehouse Union – Pacific Maritime Association Welfare Plan, which held that state law claims are not preempted by ERISA where they are not related to the terms or conditions of a welfare plan.

The Court also found that the representations made by Aetna on behalf of Defendant are binding on Defendant, and that the Plaintiff's claims are not based on the ERISA plan. Therefore, the Court has overruled Defendant's demurrer and allowed the case to proceed.
