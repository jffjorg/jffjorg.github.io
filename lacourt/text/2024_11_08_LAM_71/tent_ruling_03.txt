[1] The Court notes §430(e) is not a valid citation to the
C.C.P.; the proper citation for a demurrer by a defendant is to C.C.P. §430.10.


[2] The Court notes Defendant’s demurrer is not directed
to specified causes of action.  If there
are several causes of action in the complaint, a demurrer to the entire
complaint may be overruled if any cause of action is properly stated. (Warren
v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 24, 36.)  Defendant is directed to consult The Rutter
Group California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial, Chapter 7, §98,
and CRC, Rule 3.1320(a) for the proper formatting of demurrers.
