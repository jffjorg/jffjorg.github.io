 Hearing Date:  November 8, 2024



 
Defendant Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, LLP’s demurrer
to Plaintiff Healthcare Ally Management of California, LLC’s second amended complaint
is overruled.
 
Defendant Stroock
& Stroock & Lavan, LLP (“Stroock”) (“Defendant”) demurs to Plaintiff Healthcare
Ally Management of California, LLC’s (“HAMOC”) (“Plaintiff”) second amended complaint
(“SAC”) on the grounds that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action according to Bristol SL Holdings, Inc. v. Cigna Health &
Life Insurance Co. (9th Cir. 2024) 103 F.4th 597.  (Notice of Demurrer, pg. 1; C.C.P. §430(e).)[1] 
 
Request for
Judicial Notice
          Defendant’s 9/4/24 request for
judicial notice of the opinion issued in Healthcare Ally Management of California,
LLC v. Arup USA, Inc. (C.D. Cal. Aug. 26, 2024) No.
2:23-cv-05876-JLS (D-RJN, Exh. A), is granted.
          Defendant’s 11/1/24 request for
judicial notice of the (1) opinion issued in Keith Feder, M.D., Inc. v. National
Railroad Passenger Corp. (C.D. Cal. Oct. 29, 2024) No. 2:24-cv-8084-RGK (D-RJN,
Exh. A); and (2) Appellant’s Opening Brief in Bristol SL Holdings, Inc. v.
Cigna Health & Life Insurance Co. (9th Cir. Apr. 17, 2023) No. 23-55019
(D-RJN, Exh. B), is granted, however the Court does not consider the truth of
the matters asserted in D-RJN, Exh. B.
 
Meet and Confer
Before filing a
demurrer, the demurring party must meet and confer in person, by
telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading to
attempt to reach an agreement that would resolve the objections to the pleading
and obviate the need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a), emphasis added.)
The demurring party shall
file and serve with the demurrer a declaration stating either of the following:
(A) The means by which the demurring party met and conferred with the party who
filed the pleading subject to demurrer, and that the parties did not reach an
agreement resolving the objections raised in the demurrer. (B) That the party
who filed the pleading subject to demurrer failed to respond to the meet and
confer request of the demurring party or otherwise failed to meet and confer in
good faith.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(3),
emphasis added.)
Defendant’s counsel failed
to submit a meet and confer declaration in violation of C.C.P. §430.41(a).  However, failure to sufficiently meet and
confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(4); Dumas v. Los Angeles
County Board of Supervisors (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 348, 355; Olson v.
Hornbrook Community Services District (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 502, 515.)  Therefore, the Court will consider Defendant’s
demurrer.
 
Procedural Background
          Plaintiff filed its initial Complaint
on June 9, 2022, against Defendant. 
          On July 14, 2022, Defendant removed
the instant case to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of
California, Western Division (“C.D. Cal.”). 
(7/15/22 Notice of Removal.)
          On February 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the operative SAC alleging three causes of action against Defendant: (1)
negligent misrepresentation; (2) promissory estoppel; and, in the alternative,
(3) recovery of benefits under 29 U.S.C. §1132(a)(1)(B).
On July 12, 2023, C.D.
Cal. remanded the instant matter to this Court. 
(7/18/23 Notice of Remand.)  The
Court ruled on Defendant’s motion to dismiss, granting the motion without leave
to amend as to the ERISA claim and remanded the state law claims to this Court.  (7/18/23 Notice of Remand at pg. 2 of 22.)  Therefore, only the 1st and 2nd causes of
action remain.
Defendant filed the
instant demurrer on September 3, 2024.  Plaintiff filed its opposition on October 28,
2024.  Defendant filed its reply on November
1, 2024.
 
Summary of
Allegations
Plaintiff alleges
this action arises from Defendant’s failure to make proper payments and/or
underpayments to La Peer Surgery Center (“Medical Provider”).  (SAC ¶12.) 

Plaintiff alleges
that on June 17, 2015, Medical Provider entered into an agreement with it.  (SAC ¶1.) 
Plaintiff alleges the agreement provided that Medical Provider could
assign any past, present, or future unpaid or underpaid bills to Plaintiff by
sending it a copy of the unpaid or underpaid bill.  (SAC ¶1.) 
Plaintiff alleges the agreement also provided that once an underpaid or
unpaid bill was assigned to Plaintiff, it had the right to take any legal
action necessary including the filing of a lawsuit to attempt to recover an
unpaid or underpaid bill.  (SAC ¶1.)  
Plaintiff alleges on
July 17, 2019, Patient received a surgical procedure from Medical
Provider.  (SAC ¶33.)  Plaintiff alleges that on July 12, 2019,
Medical Provider’s employee, Yuriko H., obtained representations from Aetna and
Defendant’s representative, Sara, regarding the way Medical Provider would be
paid for services to determine whether or not to provide services.  (SAC ¶34.) 
Plaintiff alleges Medical Provider asked: what is the Patient’s
responsibility versus Defendant’s responsibility for paying for medical
services?  (SAC ¶34.)  
Plaintiff alleges
that Aetna on behalf of Defendant represented to Medical Provider that
Patient’s deductible is and was $1,000.00 and Patient’s maximum out of pocket
(“MOOP”) expense is and was $4,000.00 and that to date for that calendar year
Patient had paid $4,000.00.  (SAC ¶35.)  
Plaintiff alleges Medical
Provider asked: does Defendant pay based on usual, reasonable, customary and
allowed (“UCR”) for procedure codes 45378, 43239, J21.0, R19.4, R12 and other
similar codes within the same family? 
(SAC ¶36.)  
Plaintiff alleges Aetna
on behalf of Defendant represented to Medical Provider that for services in
connection with procedure codes 45378, 43239, J21.0, R19.4, R12, Defendant pays
the UCR rate.  (SAC ¶37.)
Plaintiff alleges Medical
Provider asked: does Defendant use a Medicare Fee Schedule to pay for procedure
codes 45378, 43239, J21.0, R19.4, R12? 
(SAC ¶38.)
Plaintiff alleges Aetna
Life Insurance Co. (“Aetna”) on behalf of Defendant represented to Medical
Provider that for services in connection with procedure codes 45378, 43239,
J21.0, R19.4, R12, Defendant’s payment would not be based on the Medicare Fee
Schedule.  (SAC ¶39.)
Plaintiff alleges on
information and belief that Aetna is and was Defendant’s agent and
representative in connection with stating the manner of payment for medical
services and providing other administrative services relating to the Patient’s
and Defendant’s health plan.  (SAC ¶3.)
Plaintiff alleges
Defendant further represented that no authorization required was for the
procedure codes.  (SAC ¶40.)
Plaintiff alleges all
the information obtained was documented by Medical Provider as part of Medical Provider’s
office policy and practice.  (SAC
¶41.)  Plaintiff alleges at no time prior
to the provision of services to Patient by Medical Provider was Medical
Provider advised that Patient’s policy or certificate of insurance was subject
to certain exclusions, limitations or qualifications, which might result in
denial of coverage, limitation of payment or any other method of payment
unrelated to the UCR rate.  (SAC
¶42.)  
Plaintiff alleges Aetna
on behalf of Defendant did not refer to any other portion of Patient’s plan
that would put Medical Provider on notice of any reduction in the originally
stated payment percentage.  (SAC ¶43.)
Plaintiff alleges
that despite having Aetna make these representations on its behalf, Defendant
and Aetna knew that they would not be paying Medical Provider at the UCR rate.  (SAC ¶44.) 
Plaintiff alleges despite having Aetna make these representations on its
behalf, Defendant and Aetna knew that they would be paying Medical Provider at
a Medicare rate.  (SAC ¶44.)
Plaintiff alleges
Medical Provider was never provided with a copy of Patient’s plan or even a
portion of Patient’s plan by Defendant or Patient, and as a result, Medical
Provider could not even make itself aware of any reduction of the payment
amount.  (SAC ¶45.)
Plaintiff alleges Medical
Provider relied and provided services solely based on Aetna’s representations,
promises, and statements on behalf of Defendant.  (SAC ¶46.) 
Plaintiff alleges the statements had no relation to Defendant and
Patient’s plan document, as the statements may or may not have been based in
the Defendant or Patient’s plan documents but bore no consideration when
Medical Provider agreed to provide medical services.  (SAC ¶46.) 
Plaintiff alleges Medical Provider took Aetna’s representations on
behalf of Defendant at face value and provided services based solely on those
promises and representations.  (SAC ¶46.)
Plaintiff alleges on
September 30, 2021, Medical Provider assigned Patient T.M.’s (“Patient”)
underpaid/unpaid bill including the right to file a lawsuit to Plaintiff by
sending via email a copy of Patient’s underpaid/unpaid bill to Plaintiff.  (SAC ¶1.) 
Plaintiff alleges Patient is a member and enrollee of Defendant’s health
insurance policy.  (SAC ¶1.)  
 
Summary of
Demurrer
Defendant demurs to the SAC on the basis it is preempted by ERISA.  (Demurrer, pg. 5.)[2]
 
Failure to State a Cause of Action
          Entire SAC
          Defendant’s argument
that its demurrer to Plaintiff’s SAC on the basis that all state claims are
preempted by ERISA is unavailing and unsupported by California case law.  In Morris B. Silver M.D., Inc. v. International Longshore
& Warehouse Union – Pacific Maritime Association Welfare Plan (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 793, the
Court of Appeal distinguished cases, like the instant one, from others subject
to ERISA preemption.  The Morris B. Silver Court stated:
Because
third-party providers are not parties to the bargain “struck in ERISA” between
plaintiffs and employers, the court in [Memorial Hospital System v. Northbrook Life
Insurance Co.
(5th Cir. 1990) 904 F.2d 236, the leading case holding a hospital’s claim for
deceptive and unfair practices arising from representations regarding coverage
was not preempted and articulating a two-factor test] could not “believe that
Congress intended the preemptive scope of ERISA to shield welfare plan
fiduciaries from the consequences of their acts toward non-ERISA health care
providers when a cause of action based on such conduct would not relate to the
terms or conditions of a welfare plan, nor affect—or affect only
tangentially—the ongoing administration of the plan.”
 
(Morris B. Silver M.D., Inc. v. International Longshore &
Warehouse etc. (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 793, 805, quoting Memorial Hospital
System v. Northbrook Life Insurance Co. (5th Cir. 1990) 904 F.2d 236, 249-250.)  The Morris B. Silver Court adopted the test enumerated
in Memorial
Hospital System
and concluded the Plaintiff’s contract and quasi-contract claims were not
preempted because the claims were “predicated on a garden-variety failure to
make payment as promised for services rendered.”  (Morris B. Silver M.D., Inc., 2
Cal.App.5th at pg. 807.)  The Morris B. Silver Court
acknowledged that “the claims would not exist but for an ERISA plan and are
predicated on somebody’s interpretation of the plan. But the fact an ERISA plan
is an initial step in the causation chain, without more, is too remote of a
relationship with the covered plan to support a finding of preemption.”  (Id., citing Dishman v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America (9th Cir. 2001) 269 F.3d 974, 984
[“Obviously, at some level Dishman’s tort claim relates to the plan. That
cannot be denied. But that cannot be the end of the analysis, either, for as we
know, ‘[p]re-emption does not occur . . .  if the state law has only a tenuous, remote,
or peripheral connection with covered plans, as is the case with many laws of
general applicability.’”].)
          Here, as in Morris B. Silver, Plaintiff alleges that Aetna
on behalf of Defendant represented and promised that payment is based on UCR
and not Medicare as the basis for its claims for promissory estoppel and
negligent misrepresentation.  (SAC
¶¶36-39.)  The representations alone can
and do serve as the basis for Plaintiff’s claims.  (SAC ¶46.)
          Defendant’s reliance on Bristol SL
Holdings, Inc. v. Cigna Health & Life Insurance Co. (9th Cir. 2024) 103 F.4th 597 is
unavailing for several reasons.  First, Morris B. Silver is binding on this Court,
whereas Bristol is not.  Second, the claims at issue in Bristol are distinguishable from those
asserted in the SAC.  Bristol discusses state law contract
claims; the instant case discusses misrepresentation and tort claims.  (Bristol SL Holdings, Inc. v. Cigna Health & Life Insurance
Co. (9th Cir. 2024)
103 F.4th 597, 602.)  Finally, the
plaintiff in Bristol admitted that it needed the ERISA plan to have a claim.  (Id. at pg. 603.)  Here, the
Plaintiff specifically alleges that its state law claims are not in any way
based on the ERISA plan.  (SAC ¶46 [“Medical
Provider relied and provided services solely based on Aetna’s representations,
promises and statements”].)
          Accordingly, Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s SAC is overruled.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s SAC is overruled.
Moving Party to give notice.
