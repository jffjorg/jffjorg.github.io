  Case Number:  22STCV34211    Hearing Date:   September 18, 2024    Dept:  57 Pending before the Court are four motions of Defendant CHA Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center ("CHA") to compel Plaintiff to respond to discovery that CHA propounded.  The discovery in question are Requests for Production of Documents, Form Interrogatories, and two sets of Special Interrogatories.  Plaintiff's oppositions to the four motions stated that responses would be forthcoming. But as of the filing date of CHA's omnibus reply in support of the motions, Plaintiff had not responded to any of the discovery.  If that remains the case as of the hearing on the motions, then the Court will grant all four of CHA's motions and order Plaintiff to respond by September 30, 2024.  Even if Plaintiff has provided responses that comply with the Code of Civil Procedure, the Court still will grant the motions to the extent it asks the Court to impose sanctions on Plaintiff and her counsel in the form of CHA's reasonable attorney's fees and costs it incurred in filing the motions.  The amount of the sanctions is $622.50 for each motion.  Sanctions are warranted here because there is no substantial justification for Plaintiff's failure to respond to the discovery that CHA propounded.
