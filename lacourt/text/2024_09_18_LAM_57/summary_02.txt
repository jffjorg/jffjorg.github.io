And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Sammy Eghbalieh's motion to strike the prayer for an award of punitive damages on the claim for breach of fiduciary duty in Wendy Ann Walker's First Amended Cross-Complaint. The judge believes that the allegations in Paragraph 90 of the cross-complaint, if found to be true, would support an award of punitive damages because they reflect malicious, oppressive, and fraudulent conduct on Eghbalieh's part. The judge is requiring Eghbalieh to file an answer to the cross-complaint by October 2, 2024.
