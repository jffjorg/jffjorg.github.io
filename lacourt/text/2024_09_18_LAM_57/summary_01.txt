And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering four motions filed by CHA Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center (CHA) to compel the plaintiff to respond to discovery requests. The discovery requests include Requests for Production, Form Interrogatories, and Special Interrogatories. The plaintiff had opposed the motions, stating that responses would be forthcoming, but as of the filing date of CHA's omnibus reply, the plaintiff had not responded to any of the discovery. If the plaintiff still has not responded by the hearing date, the court will grant all four of CHA's motions and order the plaintiff to respond by September 30, 2024. Additionally, the court will grant the motions to the extent that it asks the court to impose sanctions on the plaintiff and her counsel, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in filing the motions. The amount of the sanctions is $622.50 for each motion. The court finds that there is no substantial justification for the plaintiff's failure to respond to the discovery and therefore imposes sanctions.
