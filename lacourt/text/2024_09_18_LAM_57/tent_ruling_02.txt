 Case Number:  24STCV00881    Hearing Date:   September 18, 2024    Dept:  57 Sammy Eghbalieh has moved to strike the prayer for an award of punitive damage on the claim for breach of fiduciary duty in the First Amended Cross-Complaint ("FACC") of Wendy Ann Walker.  The Court is denying Eghbalieh's motion.  In the Courts view, the allegations in Paragraph 90 of the FACC, if found to be true, would support an award of punitive damages on the breach of fiduciary duty claim because the allegations reflect malicious, oppressive, and fraudulent conduct on Eghbalieh's part that is a necessary predicate for such an award.  Paragraph 90 supplies the allegations that the Court found lacking in Walker's initial Cross-Complaint when the Court granted Eghbalieh's motion to strike the prayer for an award of punitive damages on the breach of fiduciary claim in that earlier pleading of Walker's.  Eghbalieh ia directed to file an answer to the FACC by October 2, 2024.
