Ibrahim,  in pro per (“Plaintiff”) RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant David P. Girgis  (“Defendant”) NOTICE: OK   RELIEF REQUESTED: An order compelling Defendant to  provide responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories,  Requests for Admission (“RFAs”), and Requests for Production of Documents  (“RFPs”), Set One. Plaintiff also seeks $10,575.00 in monetary sanctions to be  imposed against Defendant and his counsel.   TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is off-calendar as moot.  The Court declines to issue monetary sanctions.   BACKGROUND   This is a defamation action,  wherein Plaintiff alleges that Defendant made false defamatory statements about  Plaintiff’s sexual orientation to members of their church. (Compl. ¶¶ 18–37.)   On 11/29/23, Plaintiff filed his  complaint, alleging against Defendant the following causes of action: (1) Libel;  (2) Slander; (3) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress; and (4) Intentional  Infliction of Emotional Distress. On 1/22/24, Defendant filed his answer.   On 3/22/24, Defendant served the  subject initial discovery requests on Plaintiff. (Decl. of Michael M.  Ashmadshahi ¶ 2.)[1]  On 5/17/24, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel Defendant’s responses  thereto. On 11/26/24, Defendant filed his opposition. No reply has been filed  to date.    ANALYSIS   A propounding party may move for an  order compelling a response to interrogatories if the responding party fails to  serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, subd.  (b); 2030.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve  a timely response “waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings  under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless  the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd.  (a).)   A propounding party may move for an  order compelling a response to a request for production of documents if the  responding party fails to serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ.  Proc. §§ 2031.300, subd. (b); 2031.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding  party who fails to serve a timely response “waives any objection to the demand,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless  the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd.  (a).)   A propounding party may move for an  order deeming the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters  specified in the requests be deemed admitted if the responding party fails to  serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2033.280, subd.  (b); 2033.250, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve  a timely response “waives any objection to the requests, including one based on  privilege or on the protection for work product” unless the Court grants it  relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall  make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for  admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a  proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial  compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Id. at subd. (c).)   Here, as Plaintiff electronically served  Defendant with the subject discovery requests by on 3/22/24, the last day for Defendant  to respond was 4/24/24. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).) Despite being granted two  extensions to serve his responses, Defendant failed to provide the responses by  the filing date of the instant motion. (Id. at ¶¶ 14–18.)   In opposition, Defendant’s current  counsel declares that his law firm was substituted into the case after  Defendant’s former counsel was incapacitated due to a stroke, eventually  passing away. (Decl. of Grant A. Carlson ¶ 4.) Counsel further declares that the instant  motion should be denied because Defendant served his full responses to the  subject discovery requests on 8/21/24. (Id. at ¶ 6.)   The Court notes that Plaintiff has  failed to file any reply. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the  instant motion is moot, including the issue of monetary sanctions.   CONCLUSION    The motion is off-calendar as moot. The Court declines to  issue monetary sanctions. **** Case Management Conference remains on Calendar******
