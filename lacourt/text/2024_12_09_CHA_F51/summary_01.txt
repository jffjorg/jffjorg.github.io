And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a motion to compel discovery responses filed by the plaintiff, Georges N. Ibrahim. The motion was filed on May 17, 2024, and seeks to compel the defendant, David P. Girgis, to provide responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for admission, and requests for production of documents. The plaintiff also seeks $10,575.00 in monetary sanctions against the defendant and his counsel.

The judge finds that the motion is moot because the defendant has since served his full responses to the discovery requests. The judge also declines to issue monetary sanctions.

The case involves a defamation action in which the plaintiff alleges that the defendant made false defamatory statements about the plaintiff's sexual orientation. The defendant failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests, and the plaintiff filed the motion to compel responses. The defendant's current counsel claims that the defendant's former counsel was incapacitated due to a stroke and eventually passed away, which may have contributed to the delay in serving responses.

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion is off-calendar as moot, and the court declines to issue monetary sanctions.
