RAYMOND GHERMEZIAN,
  A PROFESSIONAL LAW CORPORATION,
                        Plaintiff,
            vs.
MYNOR DAVID JIMENEZ, et al.,
                        Defendants.


Case No.:

Hearing Date:

Hearing Time:

[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
STATUS
  CONFERENCE REVIEW OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT PACKAGE 




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



            
On July 11, 2024, the Court issued a minute order in this action
providing, inter alia, that “[a]s soon as the default is entered
regarding Avalon, thereafter Plaintiff will submit a default judgment package
regarding the four defaulted defendants…Status Conference Review of default
judgment package is scheduled for 09/12/24 at 10:00 AM in Department 50 at
Stanley Mosk Courthouse.” 
On September 6, 2024, Plaintiff Raymond Ghermezian, a Professional Law
Corporation (“Plaintiff”) filed a “Declaration of Raymond Ghermezian, Esq. in
Support of Default Judgment, and Distribution and Discharge on Interpleader.” 
As an initial matter, it does not appear that Plaintiff filed any request
for default judgment. Plaintiff’s declaration filed on September 6, 2024, also
does not appear to specify if Plaintiff seeks default judgment against any
defendant(s). Pursuant to California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1800, subdivision (a), “[a] party seeking a default judgment on
declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry of Default
(Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100)…” 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800,
subdivision (a) further provides that “[t]he
following must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: (1) Except in unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying
the parties and the nature of plaintiff’s claim; (2) Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the
judgment requested; (3) Interest computations as necessary; (4) A memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) A declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against
whom judgment is sought; (6) A proposed form of judgment; (7) A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or
an application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a
showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) Exhibits as necessary; and (9) A request for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the
agreement of the parties.” 
Based on the foregoing, the Court continues the status
conference review of default judgment package to _____________, 2024 at 10:00 a.m.
in Dept. 50. On or before _____________, 2024, Plaintiff shall file and serve a default
judgment package.
