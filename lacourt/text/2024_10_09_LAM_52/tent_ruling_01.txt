  Case Number:  22STCV21576    Hearing Date:   October 9, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Shaul Havivy’s Motion to
Tax Costs
Plaintiff
Shaul Havivy moves to tax all costs claimed in the memorandum of costs by
defendant Nicole Gutierrez.  Defendant
served and filed a memorandum of costs (summary) on Judicial Council form
MC-010.  The memorandum of costs lists,
in full: $472.70 in filing and motion fees, $1,708.25 in deposition costs, and
$301.60 in fees for electronic filing or service.
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, the prevailing party is entitled to
recover costs.  (§ 1032(b).)  Section 1033.5, subdivision (a) sets forth a
list of allowable costs.  Section 1033.5,
subdivision (b) lists costs that are not allowable.  If the items on a memorandum of costs appear
proper on their face, the prevailing party has produced prima facie evidence
the costs were reasonable and necessary (Seaver
v. Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557 (Seaver); Doe v. Department of Children & Family Services (2019) 37
Cal.app.5th 675, 693), and the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to
show otherwise.  (Sanford v. Rasnick (2016)
246 Cal.App.4th 1121, 1128; Benach
v. County of Los Angeles (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 836, 855 [if the claimed
costs are expressly allowable, “ ‘the burden is on the objecting party to show
them to be unnecessary or unreasonable’ ”].) 
“[I]t is not enough for the losing party to attack the submitted costs
by arguing that he thinks the costs were not necessary or reasonable.  Rather, the losing party has the burden to
present evidence and prove that the claimed costs are not recoverable.”  (Seaver,
at p. 1557.)  
Defendant
may recover all costs claimed in her memorandum of costs.  Filing fees of $472.70 are facially
recoverable.  “Filing, motion, and jury
fees” are recoverable.  (CCP §
1033.5(a)(1).)  The amount of these fees
is reasonable.  The first appearance fee
alone is $435.  
Plaintiff
does not meet his burden of showing these costs are not recoverable.  He argues the expenses were unreasonable because
“Plaintiff made numerous attempts to settle this matter without the filing of a
lawsuit,” and “Defendant caused this litigation by blatantly stealing money
from the Plaintiff, and then giving him no alternative than to file a lawsuit.”  (Motion, p. 4.)  Once plaintiff filed the lawsuit, filing an
answer (among other papers) was necessary and reasonable.  Defendant prevailed in this action because
plaintiff recovered nothing from her.  Plaintiff
may not file a lawsuit, lose, and then object to defendant’s costs because the whole
lawsuit was purportedly unnecessary.
Defendant
may recover the $1,708.25 in deposition costs she claims.  The prevailing party may recover the costs of
“[t]aking, video recording, and transcribing necessary depositions, including
an original and one copy of those taken by the claimant and one copy of
depositions taken by the party against whom costs are allowed.”  (CCP § 1033.5(a)(3)(A).)  Plaintiff acknowledges that two depositions
were taken in this action: plaintiff and defendant.  Defendant claims a reasonable amount of
expenses for taking one deposition and obtaining a transcript of the other
deposition.  
Plaintiff
does not meet his burden of showing defendant cannot recover these costs.  Plaintiff argues deposing him was unnecessary
because the transcript “was not used at trial to impeach the Plaintiff.  No new or relevant information was gained by
taking the deposition that was not already contained in Plaintiffs Complaint
and in his written responses to discovery propounded by Plaintiff.”  (Motion, p. 4.)  Defendant could not know that in
advance.  Deposing the plaintiff is among
the most basic discovery necessary in every lawsuit.  
Finally,
defendant may recover $301.60 in electronic filing or service fees.  “Fees for the electronic filing or service of
documents” are recoverable.  (CCP §
1033.5(a)(14).)  Defendant served and filed
at least 10 separate papers in this action. 
She claims a reasonable amount of electronic filing and service
fees.  
Plaintiff
does not meet his burden of showing defendant cannot recover her fees for
electronic filing or service.  Plaintiff
argues this item “appears to be for the filing fee for Defendant’s
Cross-Complaint for Declaratory relief,” for which she “was not the prevailing party.”  Though defendant recovered nothing on her
cross-complaint, she is still the prevailing party.  “[W]hen
neither the plaintiff nor the defendant who has filed a cross-complaint
prevails, the defendant is the prevailing party entitled to costs.”  (McLarand, Vasquez & Partners, Inc. v.
Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1450, 1454.)  Moreover, unsuccessful efforts are not
per se unreasonable or unnecessary.  (Simers v.
Los Angeles Times Communications LLC (2024) 104 Cal.App.5th 940,
947; Rozanova
v. Uribe (2021) 68 Cal.App.5th 392, 399; State Farm
General Insurance Company v. Lara (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 197, 218.)  
Disposition    
            Plaintiff Shaul Havivy’s motion to
tax costs is denied.  Defendant
Nicole Gutierrez shall recover all $2,482.55 in expenses claimed in her
memorandum of costs.
