And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for determination of good faith settlement by defendants Judith Sixtos and Jesus Sixtos without prejudice. The defendants have not shown adequate proof of service on all non-settling defendants, which is required under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6(a). Specifically, the proof of service only shows service on counsel for plaintiffs and counsel for two of the non-settling defendants, but not on the other three non-settling defendants. The judge notes that the settling defendants must provide notice of their motion to all parties in the action, and that the motion will be denied until they provide the required notice.
