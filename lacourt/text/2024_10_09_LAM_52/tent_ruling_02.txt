 Case Number:  23STCV06798    Hearing Date:   October 9, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendants Judith Sixtos and Jesus Sixtos’s Motion
for Determination of Good Faith Settlement
Defendants Judith Sixtos and Jesus Sixtos move for an order
determining good faith settlement under Code of Civil
Procedure section 877.6(a).  When only
some of multiple defendants alleged to be jointly liable settle a case, the
settling parties may apply to the court for a determination of good faith
settlement.  (Ibid.)  A determination of good faith “shall bar any
other joint tortfeasor or co-obligor from any further claims against the
settling tortfeasor or co-obligor for equitable comparative contribution, or
partial or comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or
comparative fault.”  (Id., subd.
(c).)  “The party asserting the lack of
good faith shall have the burden of proof on that issue.”  (Id., subd. (d).)  
The
settling defendants have not shown adequate proof of service on all nonsettling
defendants.  Settling defendants are
entitled to a hearing on their motion “upon giving notice in the manner
provided in subdivision (b) of Section 1005.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (a)(1).)  Moving papers must be served on all parties who have appeared in the
action.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1005,
1014.)  The proof of
service attached to this motion shows service only on counsel for plaintiffs and
counsel for two of the nonsettling defendants, Saul Diaz and Maria Adela
Diaz.  Not including the two defendants
whom plaintiffs dismissed (Re/Max LLC and Raymond Santos), there are three other
nonsettling defendants: (1) Realty Masters and Associates Inc., (2) Juan Valdez,
and (3) Julia Lopez Valente.  Judith
Sixtos and Jesus Sixtos must provide notice of their motion for determination
of good faith settlement to all parties in the action.  
Defendants Judith Sixtos and Jesus Sixtos’s motion for
determination of good faith settlement is denied without prejudice.
