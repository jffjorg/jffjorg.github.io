And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling by a judge addresses several motions related to a lawsuit between plaintiff Simmons Unlimited, LLC and defendants Dejanee Riley Izydorczyk, Gabriella McNeill, and Deja Riley Athletics, LLC. The plaintiff is a brand manager who entered into an agreement with Riley to provide services, but Riley terminated the agreement and refused to pay commissions. The defendants have filed a cross-complaint alleging misrepresentations by the plaintiff. The judge has denied motions by the defendants to quash subpoenas for financial documents, stating that the documents are relevant to the plaintiff's claims. The judge has also granted a motion to seal certain exhibits containing sensitive business information. The judge notes that court records are presumed to be open to public review, but may be sealed if an overriding interest supports sealing and no less restrictive means exist to achieve the interest.
