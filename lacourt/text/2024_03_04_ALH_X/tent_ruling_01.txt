CLEAR POINT CAPITAL, LLC, and DOES 1-10, inclusive.     CASE NO.:                 23AHCV01455                  MOTION  TO EXPUNGE LIS PENDENS    MOVING PARTY:               Defendant Clear Point Capital, LLC   RESPONDING PARTY:      Plaintiff  T’s and Sons’ LLC   SERVICE:                              Filed February 13, 2024   OPPOSITION:                       Served February 26, 2024   REPLY:                                   No reply filed.     RELIEF  REQUESTED                 Defendant moves to expunge lis  pendens recorded against the Subject Property.    BACKGROUND                This case arises out of Plaintiffs T’s and  Sons’ LLC’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendant Clear Point Capital, LLC  (“Defendant”) breached an agreement to sell property located at 309 Oaklawn  Avenue, South Pasadena, California (“Subject Property”) to Plaintiff. Plaintiff  filed its complaint on June 27, 2023.    TENTATIVE RULING               Defendant’s motion to expunge lis pendens for the Subject  Property is GRANTED.   REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE   Defendant’s request for judicial notice is GRANTED as to Exhibit B  pursuant to Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (c).   LEGAL STANDARD               “A party who  asserts a claim to real property can record a notice of lis pendens, which  serves as notice to prospective purchasers, encumbrancers and transferees that  there is litigation pending that affects the property.” (J & A Mash  & Barrel, LLC v. Superior Court of Fresno County (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th  1, 15 (“J & A Mash”.) “ ‘A party to an action who asserts a real  property claim may record a notice of pendency of action in which that real  property claim is alleged,’ commonly known as a lis pendens. (§ 405.20.) Such a party is a “ ‘[c]laimant’ ” for purposes  of the lis pendens statute. (§ 405.1.) Once recorded,  any party with an interest in the property can move to expunge the lis pendens  pursuant to the procedure set forth in section 405.30.” (Id.  at p. 16.)    DISCUSSION               Defendant  moves to expunge lis pendens recorded against the Subject Property. On June 27,  2023, Plaintiff filed the present action alleging two causes of action for  specific performance and breach of contract. On June 28, 2023, Plaintiff  recorded a lis pendens for the Subject Property. (RJN Exhibit B.) Defendant  specifically bases the present motion on the grounds that Plaintiff is not able  to establish probable validity of its claims.    “A comment to section 405.30 identifies four bases upon which  expungement may be sought: (1) the lis pendens is void and invalid (§ 405.23), (2) the action as pleaded does not contain a  real property claim (§ 405.31), (3) the claimant fails to  establish the probable validity of the claim (§ 405.32), and (4)  monetary relief provides an adequate remedy (§ 405.33).” (J &  A Mash, supra, 74 Cal.Ap.5th at p. 16.)               Defendant  provides that in April of 2023, it initially entered into escrow to purchase  the Subject Property wholesale with the intent of selling it to another buyer.  (Williams Decl. ¶ 2.) Defendant provides that  on April 16, 2023, it received an all-cash offer with no contingencies from  Plaintiff’s managing member for a purchase price of $1,900,000.00. (Id. ¶  4.) Defendant accepted the offer on April 17, 2023. (Id. ¶ 7.)  Afterwards, Plaintiff, in accordance with the agreement, provided a  verification of funds showing sufficient funds in Plaintiff’s bank account for  the purchase. (Id. ¶ 8.) However, afterwards, Plaintiff provided another  verification of funds that demonstrated that it did not have sufficient funds  to make the cash payment. (Id. ¶ 9.)                Escrow was initially set to close on May 5, 2023, but the  deadline was extended twice with a final date set for June 20, 2023. (Williams  Decl. ¶ 10.) Defendant provides it performed under the contract by executing  closing documents. (Id. ¶ 11.) Defendant provides that Plaintiff was  never able to close escrow because it did not have sufficient cash and was not  able to obtain financing. (Id. ¶ 13.) Defendant provides that on June  20, 2023, it sent Plaintiff a demand to close escrow within three days or face  cancellation of the agreement. (Id. ¶ 15.) After the three-day period  elapse without close of escrow, Defendant cancelled the agreement. (Id. ¶  16.)                The  essential elements of a breach of contract are: (1) the contract, (2)  plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s  breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff. (Green Valley  Landowners Assn. v. City of Vallejo (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th. 425, 433.)               “[T]he court  is required to expunge a lis pendens ‘if the court finds that the claimant has  not established by a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the  real property claim.’ ” (Kirkeby v. Superior Court (2004) 33 Cal.4th  642, 651.) “Unlike other motions, nonmoving parties must demonstrate the  existence or probable validity of their real property claims. [Citation.]  Probable validity ‘means that it is more likely than not that the claimant will  obtain a judgment against the defendant on the claim.’ ” (§ 405.3.) (De  Martini v. Superior Court of San Mateo County (2024) 317 Cal.Rptr.3d 441,  448.)                Here,  Plaintiff bears the burden to establish probable validity. Thus, although  Defendant’s exhibits set the groundwork for this court, Plaintiff ultimately  must demonstrate that it is “more likely than not” that it will obtain  judgment. In opposition, Plaintiff broadly contends that it did not breach  because it was always able to pay the agreed-upon price and that Defendant was  actually the party who breached the agreement.                Plaintiff’s  arguments, however, fail. Plaintiff bears the burden here, and in support of  its opposition, Plaintiff attaches no exhibits or evidence. Plaintiff’s only  evidentiary support is the declaration of Mahammed Taufiq, who provides that he  did have funds sufficient to purchase the property. (Taufiq Decl. ¶ 5.) However, that is not sufficient to  establish “that it is more likely than not that the claimant will obtain  a judgment against the defendant on the claim.” (Code Civ. Proc. §  405.3.)                Code of  Civil Procedure section 405.38 provides: “The court shall direct that the party  prevailing on any motion under this chapter be awarded the reasonable  attorney’s fees and costs of making or opposing the motion unless the court  finds that the other party acted with substantial justification or that other  circumstances make the imposition of attorney’s fees and costs unjust.” “Trial  courts should liberally impose these sanctions upon any who file fraudulent  transfer actions and record notices of lis pendens before uncovering credible  evidence of fraud.” (Huntington World, Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 22  Cal.App.4th 67, 74.)                Here, because Defendant has  not requested sanctions, the court finds it would be unjust to impose sanctions  without notice of this issue.    CONCLUSION               Defendant’s motion to expunge lis pendens for the Subject  Property is GRANTED.               Moving  party to give notice                   Dated:   March 4, 2024                                               ___________________________________                                                                                     Joel  L.
