And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages. The defendants' motion was filed on January 5, 2024, and the plaintiffs' opposition was filed on February 20, 2024. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge concludes that the plaintiffs' allegations of trespass/encroachment on property and unconsented construction do not demonstrate malice or fraud, which are required to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge grants the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages with 20 days leave to amend.
