And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Joel L. Lofton in a case involving T's and Sons' LLC (Plaintiff) and Clear Point Capital, LLC (Defendant). The case concerns a dispute over a property located at 309 Oaklawn Avenue in South Pasadena, California. The Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that the Defendant breached an agreement to sell the property to them. The Defendant moved to expunge the lis pendens recorded against the property, arguing that the Plaintiff failed to establish the probable validity of their claims.

The court found that the Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish the probable validity of their claims, and therefore granted the Defendant's motion to expunge the lis pendens. The court also noted that the Plaintiff's arguments were insufficient and failed to demonstrate that it was "more likely than not" that they would obtain judgment against the Defendant.

The court further noted that the Defendant's exhibits provided a clear record of the events leading up to the cancellation of the agreement, including the Plaintiff's failure to provide sufficient funds for the purchase. The court concluded that the Defendant's motion was granted and ordered the Plaintiff to give notice.
