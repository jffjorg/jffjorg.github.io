And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the motion to quash service of summons on the complaint filed by defendants Lewis Sharp, Thomas Beauchamp, Surge Private Equity LLC, and Surge Global Bakeries GP LLC. The defendants argued that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over them because they had no contacts with California. However, the judge found that Surge Equity, a Texas LLC, had purposefully availed itself of the benefits of the forum state, California, through its activities and contacts with the state. The judge also found that Lewis Sharp and Thomas Beauchamp, as agents of Surge Equity, had deliberately directed the subsidiary's activities in California and had sufficient contacts with the state to establish personal jurisdiction.

The judge noted that the Asset Purchase Agreement and Partnership Agreement were relevant to the case, but did not find that they established exclusive jurisdiction in Texas. The judge also found that the principal/agent theory applied to Surge Equity and its agents, and that the court had jurisdiction over them.

The defendants' motion to quash service of summons was denied, and the case will proceed.
