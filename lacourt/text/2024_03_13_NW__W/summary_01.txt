And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted three motions by the defendants, Joe Potchanard Chauvapun, M.D., Urgentpoint, Inc., and Urgentpoint Health, P.C., to compel discovery.

Firstly, the judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel West Health, Inc. and West Health, Inc.'s former counsel to provide the last known addresses and telephone numbers of former West Health, Inc. employees who cared for the decedent, John Francis McLaughlin, during his admission to West Health. The judge has also granted the defendants' motion to take the depositions of these employees after the discovery cut-off date.

Secondly, the judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel the production of documents requested in their deposition subpoena and notice of deposition of the person most knowledgeable at West Health, Inc. The judge has also granted the defendants' request for a second deposition session to take place after the discovery cut-off date.

Thirdly, the judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of Lisa McEntyre, who was assigned to perform rounds on Mr. McLaughlin during his admission to West Health. The judge has also granted the defendants' request to take Ms. McEntyre's deposition after the discovery cut-off date.

The judge has denied the defendants' request for sanctions against West Health, Inc.'s counsel, Joel Douglas, and against Lisa McEntyre's counsel, Joel Douglas, as both parties acted with substantial justification.

The judge has also indicated that the court may consider a request to continue the trial date to allow the orderly completion of discovery.
