SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a landlord tenant dispute
regarding property located at 13547 Osborne Street in Arleta, California. On
11/4/19, Plaintiff Jamal Salim Nasrallah (Plaintiff) filed this action alleging
causes of action for: (1) forcible entry and (2) forcible detainer against
Padita Ayana and Parawan Ayana. 
 
On 5/10/22, default was entered against Padita Ayana.  Also on 5/10/22, Plaintiff filed a Doe
Amendment naming Padita Ayana as Trustee of the Parawan Ayana Living Trust.  On 5/11/22, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request,
the Court entered a dismissal without prejudice of Parawan Ayana. (See 5/11/22
Minute Order).  On 6/6/22, the Court
entered an order pursuant to the stipulation of the parties setting aside the
default entered against Padita Ayana. 
 
On 12/7/22, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint
which again asserted causes of action for: (1) forcible entry and (2) forcible
detainer.  On 2/28/23, the Court
sustained, in part, Padita Ayana’s demurrer to the First Amended Complaint and
granted Padita Ayana’s motion to strike portions of the First Amended
Complaint, both with leave to amend. (See 2/28/23 Minute Order). On 4/4/23,
Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint for forcible entry against Padita
Ayana, individually (Padita), and as Trustee of the Parawan Ayana Living Trust
(Trustee) (collectively, Defendant).  On
7/25/23, Defendant’s motion to strike portions of the Second Amended Complaint
was denied.  
 
On 8/15/23, Padita served Plaintiff with Requests for
Admissions, Set 1, making responses due 9/18/23.  (Petrosyan Decl. ¶¶4-5, Ex.A).  Despite being granted multiple extensions of
time to respond, Plaintiff has failed to serve responses to the subject
discovery.  (Petrosyan Decl. ¶¶6-11,
Ex.B-F).    
 
Therefore, on 11/9/23, Padita filed (served on 11/7/23) the
instant motion seeking an order deeming Requests for Admissions, Set 1, served
on Plaintiff deemed admitted. 
Additionally, Defendant Padita Ayana seeks an order imposing sanctions
against Plaintiff and/or his attorney of record in the amount of $460.00.
 
On 6/3/24, 8 days late, Plaintiff filed (served 6/2/24) an
opposition to the motion.  CCP 1005(b).
 
ANALYSIS
 
The late opposition to the motion attaches responses,
without objections, to the subject Requests for Admissions.  (See Opposition, Ex.1).  The service of responses to the subject
Requests for Admissions on 6/2/24, prior to the hearing on the motion, precludes
the Court from deeming the matters admitted. 
CCP 2033.280(c); St. Mary (2014) 223 CA4th 762, 775-776.  However, the imposition of sanctions on
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel is still mandatory due to their failure to
comply with their discovery obligations. 
CCP 2033.280(c); See also CCP 2023.010(d).  The Court finds that the $460.00 in sanctions
requested against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, Bryan Castorina, to be
reasonable.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The request to deem Requests for Admissions, Set 1, is
denied.  The  request for sanctions is granted.  Sanctions are imposed jointly and severally
against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s attorney, Bryan Castorina, in the amount of
$460.00.  Sanctions are payable within 30
days.
