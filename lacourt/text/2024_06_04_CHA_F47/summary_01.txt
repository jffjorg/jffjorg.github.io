And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to deem the requests for admissions, set 1, served on the plaintiff deemed admitted. However, the judge has granted the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff and/or his attorney of record in the amount of $460.00. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to comply with his discovery obligations warrants the imposition of sanctions.
