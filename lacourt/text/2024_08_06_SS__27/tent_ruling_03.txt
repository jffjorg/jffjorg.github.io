Hearing Date: 8/6/24¿ 
CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV11103 CRISTINA VACA vs
COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION 
Moving Party: Defendant Costco 
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: MOTION TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF’S
INDEPENDENT MEDICAL EXAMINATION IS DENIED.
 
On July 10, 2024,
Defendant Costco filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s independent medical
examinations (IME) with Dr. Thomas Grogan. That same day, Defendant filed a
Notice of Withdrawal of its motion for an independent medical examination
while, at the same time, requesting that the hearing continue to address the
IME with Dr. Thomas Grogan. 
On July 11, 2024,
Defendant filed another notice of withdrawal stating that the IME with Dr. Marcel
Ponton should have remained on calendar and the IME with Dr. Grogan should have
been withdrawn. Counsel indicated plans to refile the motion to compel the IME
with Dr. Ponton and request that this hearing remain on calendar.
The only motion filed
is a Motion to Compel Plaintiff's IME with Dr. Grogan, submitted on July 10,
2024. In its July 11, 2024 declaration, Defendant indicated it does not wish to
proceed with this motion. Additionally, while Defendant mentioned a forthcoming
Motion to Compel Plaintiff's IME with Dr. Marcel Ponton, no such motion has
been submitted. The Court hereby takes the motion to Compel a IME with Dr.
Grogan off the calendar given the confusing withdrawals note above.  Should Defendant intend to compel Plaintiff
to undergo a neuropsychological examination, Defendant may file a new motion
for that purpose.
