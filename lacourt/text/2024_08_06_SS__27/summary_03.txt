And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's independent medical examination with Dr. Thomas Grogan. The defendant filed the motion on July 10, 2024, and then withdrew it on July 11, 2024, but later indicated it did not wish to proceed with the motion. The court has taken the motion off the calendar due to the confusing withdrawals. If the defendant intends to compel the plaintiff to undergo a neuropsychological examination, it may file a new motion for that purpose. The parties are advised to submit to the tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
