The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to continue trial filed by Plaintiff Carlos Mario Velasquez. The Plaintiff had requested to continue the trial by at least 120 days from the original trial date of September 18, 2024. However, the Court notes that the Plaintiff had previously submitted an ex parte application to continue trial on July 15, 2024, which was granted and resulted in the trial date being changed to January 16, 2025. Therefore, the present motion is considered moot and is denied. The parties are advised to arrange to appear remotely or in person at the hearing on August 6, 2024, unless they submit to the tentative ruling via email.
