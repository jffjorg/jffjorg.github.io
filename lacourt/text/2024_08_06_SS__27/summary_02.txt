And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, issued a tentative ruling on a motion to continue trial in the case of Christopher Vincent Verrette vs. Myers & Sons Hi-Way, Hi-Way Safety Rentals, and Alejandro Lopez. The motion was unopposed and the Judge denied the request to continue the trial. The Judge found that the request was not justified as the expert opinions of the parties' neurologists were not significantly different, and the case has already been continued three times. The parties had approximately two years to conduct discovery and be ready for trial. The Judge also noted that if opposing experts frequently disagree, trials would be unnecessarily prolonged.
