And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, California Pizza Kitchen, Inc. The plaintiff, Odet Gandipimyan, alleges that she slipped on an oily substance at the defendant's restaurant on March 17, 2019, and that the defendant had notice of the dangerous condition. The defendant argues that it did not have notice of the condition and that the plaintiff cannot demonstrate the existence of a triable issue of material fact. The Judge finds that the defendant has met its initial burden of demonstrating that it did not have actual or constructive notice of the alleged dangerous condition, and that the plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion. Therefore, the Judge grants the motion for summary judgment and dismisses the plaintiff's claims for premises liability and negligence.
