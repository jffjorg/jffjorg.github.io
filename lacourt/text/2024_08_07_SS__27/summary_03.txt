And here is a summary in English text:

Judge Lee S. Arian's tentative ruling denies the motion for relief from admission filed by plaintiff Carin Dickmeyer. The motion was filed after the court granted relief as counsel to Marielys Acosta, who had filed a motion to be relieved as counsel, and deemed Defendant Keck Medical Center of USC's request for admissions (RFAs) admitted against the plaintiff. The court finds that the plaintiff has not shown that the admission was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, as required under Code of Civil Procedure Section 2033.300. The plaintiff's allegations of her attorney's incompetence or deliberate refusal to cooperate do not constitute a mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The court will not permit the withdrawal of the RFAs, and the motion is denied.
