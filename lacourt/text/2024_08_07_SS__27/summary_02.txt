English-text summary:

The judge granted the City of Alhambra's motion for summary judgment, ruling that the City had no notice of the alleged dangerous condition of the Breezeway, which caused the plaintiff, Lisa Wiltrout, to fall and fracture her ankle. The City submitted evidence that it did not have actual or constructive notice of the condition, including a declaration from Chris Kustra, the claim director, and testimony from Rick Vergara, a public works inspector. The plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact that the City had notice of the condition, and the judge found that the City's inspection program was reasonable.
