DISCUSSION
 
Motion for Order
Compelling Joinder of Omitted Heirs
 
            Defendants move for an order
requiring Plaintiff to join omitted heirs, or, in the alternative, to stay the
action pending joinder of those heirs. 
 
            Code of Civil Procedure section
377.60 identifies the parties who have standing to bring a wrongful death
claim. Although the statute does not expressly state that all claimants must be
joined in a single action, there is an extensive body of authority describing
wrongful death actions as “joint, single, and indivisible.” (Valdez v. Smith
(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 723, 726; Smith v. Premier Alliance Ins. Co. (1995)
41 Cal.App.4th 691, 697 fn. 8; Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 801, 807.) The Court “has jurisdiction to try a wrongful death
action even absent joinder of one or more heirs of the decedent.” (Ruttenberg,
supra, 53 Cal.App.4th at 808, citing Sanders v. Fuller (1975) 45
Cal.App.3d 994, 999.) A non-joined heir is not an “indispensable party” to a
wrongful death action, but omitted heirs are “necessary parties” and the
plaintiff has a mandatory duty to join all known omitted heirs. (Ruttenberg,
supra, 53 Cal.App.4th at 808, citing Sanders, supra, 45 Cal.App.3d
at 999-1000; 1002-1003.) An heir who refuses to participate in the suit as a
plaintiff may be named as a nominal defendant to ensure all heirs are before
the Court in the same action. (Id.) 
 
An heir who does not join in the action may not ordinarily bring a
subsequent suit against the tortfeasor unless the tortfeasor had knowledge of
the existence of the heir at the time of resolution of the first action. (Valdez
v. Smith (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 723; 726-27 [tortfeasor who knew of omitted
heirs was estopped from applying the one-action rule to bar a subsequent claim
by an omitted heir after settlement of the original action].) A tortfeasor
wishing to avail itself of the one action rule bears the responsibility of
causing a known heir to be joined in the action or seeking abatement of the
action until that heir is joined. (Valdez, supra, 166 Cal.App.3d at
728.) 
 
Defendants contend that they have learned of other heirs who have been
omitted from this action and bring this motion to fulfill their obligations
under the one action rule. Defendants state that Plaintiff’s response to
Defendants’ special interrogatories identified six other heirs of Lorraine Cano
who have not joined in this action, five of whom are still alive. (Declaration
of Diego Magaña ISO Mot. Exh. C No. 1.) Defendants therefore request an order
requiring Plaintiff to join these heirs or abate the action until these heirs
have been joined. Plaintiff has not responded to this motion. The Court finds
Defendants have demonstrated the existence of other heirs to Lorraine Cano who
must be joined as to the wrongful death claim.
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion for Order Compelling Joinder of Omitted
Heirs is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to join all omitted heirs identified in
her responses to Defendants’ Special Interrogatories. The Court further orders
this action stayed until those heirs are joined. 
 
The Court sets a Status Conference Re: Joinder of Heirs for June 13, 2024,
at 8:30 AM.
 
Demurrer and Motion to
Strike Second Amended Complaint
 
            In
light of the Court’s ruling abating this action pending joinder of the
remaining heirs, Defendants’ Demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint and
accompanying Motino to Strike are CONTINUED to June 13, 2024, for rescheduling
purposes only 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion for Order Compelling Joinder of Omitted
Heirs is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to join all omitted heirs identified in
her responses to Defendants’ Special Interrogatories. The Court further orders
this action stayed until those heirs are joined. 
 
The Court sets a Status Conference Re: Joinder of Heirs for June 13, 2024
at 8:30 AM.
 
            Defendants’
Demurrer and Motion to Strike the Second Amended Complaint are CONTINUED to
June 13, 2024, at 8:30 AM for rescheduling purposes only. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
