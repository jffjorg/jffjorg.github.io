And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The defendant City of Inglewood has moved for summary judgment on the grounds that it did not own, operate, or control the metal plate that caused the plaintiff's fall. The court finds that the defendant has brought forth sufficient evidence to show that it had no control over the metal plate. The plaintiff argues that the defendant had control over the metal plate based on permits issued by the city's engineering department and the placement of barricades on top of the metal plate. However, the court finds that these actions do not constitute control over the metal plate. The court also finds that the defendant had no authority, duty, or responsibility to control or inspect the metal plate. Therefore, the court grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment and dismisses the plaintiff's case.
