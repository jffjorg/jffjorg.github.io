And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge grants the motions to compel filed by the Defendants, Hermine Shmavonyan and Smbat Shmavonyan, requiring the Plaintiffs, Del Lisenbee and Jessie Garcia, to provide verified responses to the discovery requests served on them. The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs failed to serve the verified responses and therefore grants the motions. The Judge also denies the request for sanctions filed by the Defendants, citing substantial justification for the failure to provide timely responses.
