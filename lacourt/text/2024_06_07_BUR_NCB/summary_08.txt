```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court denies Plaintiff's motion to vacate the prefiling order and remove him from the vexatious litigant list. The Court finds that Plaintiff has not established his burden in showing that the ends of justice would be served by dissolving the prefiling order or that there was a material change in the facts upon which the order was entered. The Court also finds that Plaintiff has not shown with substantial evidence that he has mended his ways or conduct. Plaintiff's argument that he has not filed any new lawsuits since 2019 is not enough to show a material change in the facts. The Court also notes that Plaintiff's recent filing of a small claims lawsuit indicates that he has not given up his habit of filing lawsuits.
