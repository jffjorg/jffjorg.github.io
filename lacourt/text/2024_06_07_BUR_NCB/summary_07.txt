significant statements:
  - "There are several factors that must be pled with particularity, including: (1) defendants had responsibility for meeting the basic needs of the elder or dependent adult, such as nutrition, hydration, hygiene or medical care; (2) defendants knew of conditions that made the elder or dependent adult unable to provide for his or her own basic needs; (3) defendants denied or withheld goods or services necessary to meet the elder or dependent adult's basic needs, either with knowledge that injury was substantially certain to befall the elder or dependent adult (if the plaintiff alleges oppression, fraud or malice) or with conscious disregard of the high probability of such injury (if the plaintiff alleges recklessness); and (4) the neglect caused the elder or dependent adult to suffer physical harm, pain or mental suffering."
  - "The Court concludes that the complaint does not rise to the level of showing that Addiego Defendants had a caretaking or custodial relationship with Plaintiff. While Addiego Defendants may have been Plaintiff’s podiatrist/doctor and provided wound care to Plaintiff, Plaintiff has not alleged specific facts against Addiego Defendants showing that they undertook caretaking or custodial duties with ongoing responsibilities of Plaintiff’s basic needs that an able-bodied and fully competent adult would be capable of managing without assistance."
