[1] Antranik Kevorkian filed an action on August 22, 2016
against Defendant County of Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department in Case No.
EC065694 (“Sheriff Action”). In the Sheriff Action, Plaintiff filed a
motion under CCP § 391.8 for an order vacating the prefiling order and removing
Plaintiff from the vexatious litigant list issued pursuant to CCP § 391.7(a) in
the Hastings Action on February 26, 2021. 
The matter came for hearing on March 25, 2021 and the Court denied
Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the prefiling order and remove him from the
vexatious litigant list, finding that Plaintiff improperly filed the motion in
the Sheriff Action and that the motion should have been filed in the Hastings
Action.  


[2] CCP § 533 states: “In any action, the court may on
notice modify or dissolve an injunction or temporary restraining order upon a
showing that there has been a material change in the facts upon which the
injunction or temporary restraining order was granted, that the law upon which
the injunction or temporary restraining order was granted has changed, or that
the ends of justice would be served by the modification or dissolution of the
injunction or temporary restraining order.”  


[3] CCP § 391 defines
“Litigation” to mean any civil action or proceeding, commenced, maintained or
pending in any state or federal court. 
(CCP §391(a).)  A “litigation”
also includes an appeal or civil writ proceeding filed in an appellate
court.  (Garcia v. Lacey (2014)
