Summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for terminating sanctions filed by Plaintiff Aram Bagramyan against Defendants FMB Development, LLC and Ilan Kenig. The motion was unopposed, and the judge found that the Defendants had failed to comply with a court order to provide discovery responses. The judge also found that the Defendants had abandoned the litigation and had not provided updated contact information. As a result, the judge ordered the answer to be stricken and default to be entered. The judge noted that terminating sanctions, including striking pleadings and dismissing an action, are justified when a party fails to comply with discovery rules and that there is a history of abuse. The judge cited several cases to support this ruling, including Van Sickle v. Gilbert, Link v. Cater, and Brown v. Sup. Ct.
