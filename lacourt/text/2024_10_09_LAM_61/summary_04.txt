  - To maintain a tort claim against a director in his or her personal capacity, a plaintiff must first show that the director specifically authorized, directed or participated in the allegedly tortious conduct.

Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant Jason "Dede" Flemming's demurrer and motion to strike Portions of the First Amended Complaint. The demurrer argues that the complaint does not allege facts that are legally sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Flemming personally. The Judge finds that the complaint alleges more than mere nonfeasance resulting in financial harm to a party contracted with the company and that Flemming's personal involvement and participation in corporate actions that negligently caused the death of Kelly Galloway are sufficient to support liability against him.

The motion to strike argues that the prayer for punitive damages is inadequate because it does not allege conduct that would form a basis for a finding of malice, oppression, or fraud. The Judge finds that the complaint alleges facts that could support a finding of malice or oppression, including Flemming's approval of company policies that increased the risk of deadly medical crises and his role in the music festival's administration.

The Judge concludes that the demurrer and motion to strike are OVERRULED and DENIED, respectively.
