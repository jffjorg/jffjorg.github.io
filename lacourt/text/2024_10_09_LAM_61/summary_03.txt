And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants (AASP, Inc., Jay Hoon Lee, Jae So Lim, and Jennyfer Oh) to the complaint filed by the plaintiff (Sunnyside Cremation and Funeral, Inc.). The demurrer was filed in response to the court's prior ruling overruling the defendants' prior demurrer. The judge has found that the demurrer is improper and that the defendants have not presented any new arguments or facts that would warrant dismissal of the plaintiff's claims. The judge has also found that the plaintiff's complaint is sufficient as against the demurrer and that the defendants' arguments are without merit. The judge has therefore overruled the demurrer and allowed the plaintiff's claims to proceed.
