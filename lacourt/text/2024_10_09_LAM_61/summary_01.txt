Significant Statements:
  - "The standard for granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."
  - "The duty that gives rise to tort liability is either completely independent of the contract or arises from conduct which is both intentional and intended to harm."
  - "The required elements for fraudulent concealment are (1) concealment or suppression of a material fact; (2) by a defendant with a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff; (3) the defendant intended to defraud the plaintiff by intentionally concealing or suppressing the fact; (4) the plaintiff was unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he or she did if he or she had known of the concealed or suppressed fact; and (5) plaintiff sustained damage as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, which argued that the plaintiffs' claims for fraud and negligent repair are barred by the economic loss rule. The judge found that the economic loss rule does not apply to the fraud claim because the plaintiffs alleged that the purchase of the vehicle was the result of fraudulent concealment. The judge also found that the plaintiffs adequately alleged a duty to disclose and that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to support the claims. The judge noted that the defendants' arguments were based on non-binding federal district cases and that the court must apply California law. The judge also pointed out that the truth or falsity of the plaintiffs' damage allegations is not the proper subject of a motion on the pleadings.
