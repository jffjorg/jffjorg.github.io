have consolidated their exhibits into a single administrative record
(“AR”).  The following citations reflect
both the exhibit number and AR pagination. 
Aguirre requests judicial notice of (1) the history of
Pac-12 from its website (RJN Ex. 1), (2) press releases announcing the Pac-12 departures
of the following universities: UCLA (RJN Ex. 2), University of Southern
California (RJN Ex. 3), University of Colorado (RJN Ex. 4), University of
Washington (RJN Ex. 5), University of Oregon (RJN Ex. 6), University of Arizona
(RJN Ex. 7), Arizona State University (RJN Ex. 8), University of Utah (RJN
Ex.  9), University of California at
Berkeley (RJN Ex. 10), and Stanford University (RJN Ex. 11), and (3) a Wall
Street Journal article “The Nightmare Travel Days Coming for USC and UCLA
Athletes” dated August 16, 2022 (RJN Ex. 12). 

Aguirre cites these articles as containing facts
subject to immediate and accurate determination under Evid. Code sections
452(g) and (h).  RJN, pp. 3-4.  The facts contained in these articles are not
so universal as to not be reasonably subject to dispute.  However, the court can and does judicially
notice the media attention associated with UCLA’s move to the Big Ten but not
the truth of the articles’ content.  The
requests to judicially notice RJN Exs. 1-11 are granted only on that basis.  The request to judicially notice RJN Ex. 12 is
denied.


[4] Aguirre
notes that UCLA sent another set of records consisting of news clippings
responsive to a CPRA request Aguirre made on September 15, 2022, not the CPRA
requests at issue.  Aguirre Decl., ¶25.  Regents respond that there was no such
September 15 request.  Alexakis Decl.,
¶58.  See Opp. at 11.

Aguirre states that the production took almost a year: “Almost One Year Later,
UCLA Produced 68 Records…most of which were heavily redacted.”  Pet. Op. Br. at 13.  This is incorrect.  With the exception of a single page, UCLA
released all records within 90 days. 
UCLA’s provision of the equivalent of a Vaughn Index on October 20, 2023
did not extend the time of production. 
All the redacted records had been previously provided.  Alexakis Decl., ¶57.


[6] In
reply, Aguirre argues that UCLA failed to comply with section 7922.540(a) and
(b), which requires that a notice of denial be in writing and set forth the
names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial.  Reply at 3-4.  
Each release of records was accompanied by a cover letter,
signed by Alexakis or his supervisor, Baldridge, including their respective
titles.  Alexakis Decl., ¶¶ 31, 42,
45, 49 (AR 1448, 1529, 5258, 5259, 5334-35. 
On October 17, 2022, Banbridge produced the last batch of documents
to Aguirre, subject to the attorney-client privilege, the deliberative process
privilege, and exclusion of drafts not retained in the normal course of
business.  Alexakis Decl., ¶49, Ex. 39
(AR 5334).  Alexakis made the exemption
determinations.  Severson Decl., ¶19, Ex.
25 (AR 520).  UCLA substantially complied
with section 7922.540.

Aguirre’s opening brief recites the law relevant to the deliberative process
privilege (Pet. Op. Br. at 16) but does not rely on it to challenge any
document withheld as exempt.
