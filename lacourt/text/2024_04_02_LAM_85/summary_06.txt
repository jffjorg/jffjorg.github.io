And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling concerns the Chaos v. Regional Center case, in which Chaos filed a Petition on March 7, 2023. The Petition was actually a Notice of Appeal on a Judicial Council form. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) made an administrative decision, noting that the settlement agreement between Chaos and LAUSD was private and confidential. The ALJ could not consider the substance of the agreement. Regional Center has raised concerns about necessary and indispensable parties, but the relevance of this point is unclear. Additionally, the judge notes that California Welfare and Institutions Code section 4712.5 was amended as of March 1, 2023, extending the time to file an appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction from 90 days to 180 days. The judge intends to clarify the nature of the settlement agreement and resolve the disputes surrounding it.
