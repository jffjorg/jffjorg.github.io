  Case Number:  22STCP01795    Hearing Date:   April 2, 2024    Dept:  85 
 
Adam Englander v.
Golden Valley Municipal Water District, 22STCP01795

 
Tentative decision on motion
for award of (1) attorney’s fees: granted; (2) costs:   memorandum of costs required



 
            
            Petitioner
Adam Englander (“Englander”) seeks an award of $33,300 in attorney’s fees and
$3,566.30 in costs against the Respondent Golden Valley Municipal Water
District (“District”).  
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and renders
the following tentative decision. 
            
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Petition
            Petitioner
Englander filed the Petition on May 10, 2022 alleging a cause of action for
mandamus for violation of the CPRA in pertinent part as follows.
            The
District was created in March 1970 with all five elected board (“Board”)
members consisting of members of the Ralphs family.  To date, the Ralphs family controls the
District.  
            On
November 5, 2021, Englander visited District headquarters to request access to
agendas and supplemental agenda materials. 
During his wait for the production of these materials, District Office
Manager and Board member Patricia Edwards (“Edwards”) asked Englander to leave
and threatened to have him arrested for trespass if he did not do so.
            The
District called the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (“LASD”) to remove
Englander from the office.  Two deputies
arrived and talked with Englander and Edwards. 
Edwards eventually agreed that Englander could review files, but the
deputies would remain until he left. 
Englander was allowed to review only three copies of Board meeting
minutes from 2020 and 2021.  When
Englander left, the LASD deputies advised him to inform LASD in advance if he
wanted to come back to inspect more documents so that deputies could also be
present. 
            On
November 19, 2021, Englander sent the District a CPRA email request for 21
categories of documents (“November 19 Requests”).  The requested documents included agendas,
supplemental agendas, election-related documents, communications between
District staff and Board members, and District agreements with consultants,
lobbyists, and law firms since 2010. 
Englander asked for examination on December 3, 2021.
            On
December 2, 2021, Edwards emailed Englander that the District would allow him
inspect the documents at the District office the next day.  Englander arrived on December 3, 2021 with a
photocopying service to scan all produced materials.  Edwards informed him that the produced
documents included all responsive documents.
            On
December 7, 2021, the photocopying service sent Englander a copy of all scanned
documents.  Englander reviewed the
records and it was clear that not all responsive documents were produced.  The District did not produce any agendas or
supplemental agenda documents, communications between Board members, or
contracts and invoices from any lobbyist, law firm, or consultant.  The District did not provide any reason for
withholding these documents.  
            On
December 22, 2021, Englander asked Edwards for a request-by-request breakdown
of produced and withheld documents.  On
January 5, 2022, Edwards responded that Englander had received everything the
District office had on December 3, 2021. 
Englander’s further attempts to contact the District’s counsel received
no response.
            Englander
seeks (1) a writ of mandate compelling the District to comply with the CPRA by
producing all documents responsive to the November 19 Requests, (2) declaratory
relief that the District violated the CPRA, and (3) attorney’s fees and costs.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
July 27, 2022, the District filed an Answer.
            On
November 28, 2023, the court granted the Petition and ordered the District to
conduct a further search for records responsive to the November 19 Requests.  The court found that Englander is the
prevailing party and entitled to attorney fees.
 
            B. Applicable Law
            Government Code
section 7923.115 (“section 7923.115”), formerly Govt. Code section 6259,[1] provides
in part: “If the requester prevails in litigation filed pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall award court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to
the requester.”  §7923.115(a).  The costs and fees shall be paid by the
public agency of which the public official is a member or employee and shall
not become a personal liability of the public official.  Id.
            The
attorney’s fee provision of the CPRA should be interpreted in light of the
overall remedial purpose of the Act to broaden access to public records.  Community Youth Athletic Center v. City of
National City, (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1447.  Indeed, the purpose of the attorney’s fees
provision is to provide protections and incentives for members of the public to
seek judicial enforcement of their right to inspect public records subject to
disclosure.  Id.  The use of the word “shall” in a fee statute
means the award is mandatory and, as such, an award of fees to prevailing
petitioner in a CPRA action is mandatory. 
Belth v. Garamendi, (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 896, 899-900.  
            Generally,
the plaintiff prevails for purposes of attorney’s fees under the CPRA “when he
or she files an action which results in defendant releasing a copy of a
previously withheld document.”  Id.
at 898.  Cases denying attorney’s fees to
a plaintiff under the CPRA have done so because “litigation did not cause the
[agency] to disclose any of the documents ultimately made available…”  Motorola Communication & Electronics,
Inc. v. Department of General Services, (“Motorola”) (1997) 55 Cal.
App. 4th 1340, 1351; Rogers v. Superior Court, (1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th
469, 483.  
            The
petitioner bears the burden of proof as to the reasonableness of any fee claim. 
CCP §1033.5(c)(5).  This burden requires competent evidence as to the
nature and value of the services rendered.  Martino v. Denevi, (“Martino”)
(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.  “Testimony of an attorney as to the
number of hours worked on a particular case is sufficient evidence to support
an award of attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed time records.” Id. 
“‘The reasonable market value of the attorney's
services is the measure of a reasonable hourly rate.  [Citations.] This standard applies
regardless of whether the attorneys claiming fees charge nothing for their
services, charge at below-market or discounted rates, represent the client on a
straight contingent fee basis, or are in-house counsel. 
[Citations.]’”  Center For Biological Diversity v. County of San
Bernardino, (“Center”) (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 619. 
            A
plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima facie evidence that the
costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily incurred.  See Hadley
v. Krepel, (“Hadley”) (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.  “In
challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are
claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific
items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the
evidence.  General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative,
or unrelated do not suffice.”  Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez, (“Lunada”),
(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488. 
            In
determining whether the requested attorney’s fees are reasonable, the court’s “first step
involves the lodestar figure—a calculation based on the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
lawyer’s hourly rate.  The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on
consideration of facts specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.”  Gorman v.
Tassajara Development Corp., (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774 (“Gorman”). 
In adjusting the lodestar figure, the court may consider the nature and difficulty
of the litigation, the amount of money involved, the skill required and
employed to handle the case, the attention given, the success or failure, and
other circumstances in the case. EnPalm LLC v. Teitler, (2008) 162
Cal.App.4th 770, 774; see also PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler,
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.

Statement of Facts[2]
            1.
Tasks Performed
Englander made his first CPRA request on November 5,
2021.  Manoukian Decl., ¶2.  He attempted to obtain the requested documents
multiple times before filing this action. 
Manoukian Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.  
After the Petition was filed, the court held seven trial
setting conferences and orders to show cause re: dismissal when the parties
believed they could resolve the matter without adjudication.  Manoukian Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.  Ultimately, the District refused to produce
further documents without adjudication. 
Manoukian Decl., ¶3.
            Four
of the five District Board members asserted in declarations that no further
available documents were responsive to the CPRA request.  Manoukian Decl., ¶4.  Englander therefore had to depose the fifth Board
member and the District secretary. 
Manoukian Decl., ¶5.  After two District
Board members were deposed, it was obvious that the District had not conducted
a proper search.  Manoukian Decl.,
¶5.  Any declarations about the searches
conducted or documents sought were either not true or non-responsive to the
actual requests.  Manoukian Decl., ¶5.
            Englander
shared these findings with the District in a meet and confer letter on March
20, 2023.  Manoukian Decl., ¶6.  The District then promised to produce all
responsive documents but never did. 
Manoukian Decl., ¶7.  
            On
November 28, 2023, after briefing and oral argument (Manoukian Decl., ¶¶ 8-12),
this court ordered the District to produce additional responsive
documents.  Manoukian Decl., ¶12.  It also found Englander as the prevailing
party for the purpose of attorney’s fees and costs under section
7923.115(a).  Manoukian Decl., ¶13.  
            Counsel
was ordered to meet and confer regarding the attorney’s fees.  Manoukian Decl., ¶13.  After various emails about fees Englander incurred
through November 31, 2023, the District agreed to fees and costs totaling $30,564.19.  Manoukian Decl., ¶¶ 15-18, Ex. 1.  The District asked Englander to prepare a
settlement agreement to that effect, which was sent on December 15, 2023.  Manoukian Decl., ¶18, Ex. 1.  On December 28, the District confirmed this
settlement was “Ok for signature.”  Manoukian
Decl., ¶20, Ex. 2.  
            On
January 2, 2024, Englander sent the signed settlement agreement to the
District.  Manoukian Decl., ¶21, Ex.
3.  The deadline to pay fees under the
terms thereof was January 12, 2024.  Manoukian
Decl., ¶21, Ex. 3.  Englander sent a
reminder email on January 10.  Manoukian
Decl., ¶22, Ex. 4.  On January 12,
counsel for the District asserted the check was in the mail.  Manoukian Decl., ¶23, Ex. 5.  This check never arrived.  Manoukian Decl., ¶24.  
            Several
follow-up emails later, Englander’s attorney, Marina Manoukian Esq. (“Manoukian”),
discovered that the prior counsel for the District had left his firm and the
matter had been reassigned.  Manoukian
Decl., ¶25.  Since January 29, 2024, Manoukian
sent the District’s new attorneys all background information and requested
payment as agreed.  Manoukian Decl., ¶26.  As of February 21, 2024, it has refused to
pay.  Manoukian Decl., ¶27.  
 
            2.
Fees
            Manoukian
bills $450 per hour.  Manoukian Decl.,
¶28.  As of the moving papers, over a
period of 22 months she billed 61.5 hours, or $27,675 in fees, and incurred
$3,467.15 in costs.  Manoukian Decl., ¶¶ 29,
31, Ex. 6.  Disputed billings are as follows.
            Four
entries for time to review and finalize the writ across April and May 2022
total 0.2 + 1.8 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 2.7 hours. 
Manoukian Decl., Ex. 6.  When
combined with other entries, the total time associated with filing the writ is 3.1
hours.  Manoukian Decl., Ex. 6; Manoukian
Reply Decl., ¶2.  
            Entries
for preparing for depositions of Patti Edwards (“Edwards”) on December 13,
2022, and “GVMWB” on February 22, 2023, total 2.4 + 0.7 = 3.1 hours.  Manoukian Decl., Ex. 6.  When combined with one hour on December 14,
2022 to prepare for the deposition of Ryan Ralphs (“Ryan”), the total time
spent preparing to depose Board members was 4.1 hours.  Manoukian Decl., Ex. 6; Manoukian Reply
Decl., ¶3.  
            Manoukian
spent 0.3 hours to review and analyze a meet and confer letter from opposing
counsel and discuss it with Englander. 
Manoukian Decl., Ex. 6.  She spent
another 2.8 hours to draft a response, a total of 3.1 hours.  Manoukian Decl., Ex. 6; Manoukian Reply
Decl., ¶4.[3]  
            Manoukian
spent 0.2 + 0.4 = 0.6 hours to email opposing counsel about document production
on two different dates.  Manoukian Decl.,
Ex. 6.  
            Between
October 2022 and February 2023, Manoukian billed five entries of 0.2 hours
each, one hour total, to send emails to schedule depositions.  Manoukian Decl., Ex. 6.  Those emails were not simple calendaring
emails.  Manoukian Reply Decl., ¶10.  The hour spent on emails was because of the
District’s gamesmanship in attempting to resist the depositions by canceling
and rescheduling them.  Manoukian Reply
Decl., ¶5.  Manoukian sent the emails to
thwart attempts to avoid deposition, particularly as the court has already scheduled
status hearings based on when it believed the depositions would take
place.  Manoukian Reply Decl., ¶10.  
            Manoukian
spent 4.8 hours across three sessions to review two deposition transcripts.  Manoukian Decl., Ex. 6; Manoukian Reply
Decl., ¶6.
            In
September 2023, Manoukian spent 2.7 + 6.5 + 2.8 = 12 hours to draft and revise
the opening brief, 0.8 + 1.9 = 2.7 hours to draft accompanying declarations,
and 0.8 hours to compile and organize 12 supporting exhibits.  Manoukian Decl., Ex. 6; Manoukian Reply
Decl., ¶7.  “Compiling exhibits ” refers
to reviewing documents in the case and deciding which were relevant and
useful.  Manoukian Reply Decl., ¶11.  The opening brief was 15 pages, and the moving
papers totaled 300 pages.  Manoukian
Reply Decl., ¶7.  Manoukian spent 15.5 hours
on the moving papers.  Manoukian Decl.,
Ex. 6; Manoukian Reply Decl., ¶7.  
            Manoukian
spent 1.2 hours to review the opposition, 0.2 hours to draft a supplemental
declaration in support of the reply brief, and 2.1 + 2.8 + 0.8 = 5.7 hours to
draft the reply brief, for a total of 7.1 hours.  Manoukian Decl., Ex. 6; Manoukian Reply
Decl., ¶8. 
             Manoukian billed 0.4 hours in May 2022 to ensure
that the Petition filing was correct and prepare the civil case cover sheet,
0.3 hours in May 2022 to follow up on filing and instruct on service of the Petition,
0.2 hours in July 2022 to coordinate an inspection and copying date, and 0.2 hours
to email opposing counsel about the “OSC regarding dismissal ruling and
dates.”  Manoukian Decl., Ex. 6.  Although these hours seem purely
administrative, they were not.  Manoukian
Reply Decl., ¶9.  Because this was a
petition for writ of mandate, Manoukian was more involved in the instructions
to attorney service to ensure that filing and service were proper.  Manoukian Reply Decl., ¶9.
 
            3.
Fees for theFee Motion
            The
$27,675 in fees and $3,467.15 in costs claimed in the moving papers preceded
this motion.  Manoukian Reply Decl., ¶14.  The District’s refusal to cooperate with
discussions on attorney’s fees has incurred additional fees and costs.  Manoukian Reply Decl., ¶12.  
            Manoukian
spent seven hours drafting the motion and declaration, one reviewing the opposition,
and four drafting a reply.  Manoukian
Reply Decl., ¶¶ 15-16.  She expects to
bill 0.5 hours to attend the hearing, for a total of 12.5 hours on the fee motion.  Manoukian Reply Decl., ¶16.  This adds $5,625 to the fees, increasing them
to $33,300.  Manoukian Reply Decl., ¶¶
17-18.  
            Manoukian
incurred an additional $79.15 in filing costs for this motion.  Manoukian Reply Decl., ¶17.  She now seeks $3,566.30 in costs.  Manoukian Reply Decl., ¶18.
 
            D.
Analysis
            Petitioner
Englander’s moving papers seek an award of $33,300 in attorney’s fees and
$3,566.30 in costs.
The court’s ruling in this action compelled the District to
produce additional responsive documents and found Englander to be the
prevailing party for the purpose of attorney’s fees and costs under section
7923.115(a).  Manoukian Decl., ¶¶ 12-13.     
            The court employs the lodestar analysis when
looking to determine the reasonableness of an attorney’s fee award.  The lodestar figure is calculated by
multiplying the number of hours reasonably spent by the reasonable market
billing rate.  Serrano v. Priest,
(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48.
 
            1.
Hourly Rate
            Generally, the reasonable
hourly rate used for the lodestar calculation is the rate prevailing in the
community for similar work.  Center, supra,
188 Cal.App.4th at 616.  In making its
calculation, the court may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with the
legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney
requesting fees, the difficulty or complexity of the litigation to which that
skill was applied, and affidavits from other attorneys regarding prevailing
fees in the community and rate determinations in other cases.  569 East County Boulevard LLC v.
Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc., (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 437.  
            Manoukian
seeks an hourly rate of $450.  Manoukian
Decl., ¶28.  The District does not
dispute this rate.  Opp. at 2. The rate is
reasonable.
 
            2.
Reasonable Hours
            The petitioner bears the burden of
proof as to the reasonableness of any fee claim.  CCP §1033.5(c)(5).  This burden requires competent evidence as to
the nature and value of the services rendered. 
Martino, supra, 182 Cal.App.3d at 559.  “Testimony of an attorney as to the number of
hours worked on a particular case is sufficient evidence to support an award of
attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed time records.” Id.
            A
plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima facie evidence that the
costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily incurred.  See Hadley,
supra, 167 Cal.App.3d at 682.  “In challenging attorney fees as
excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the
challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient
argument and citations to the evidence. 
General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or
unrelated do not suffice.”  Lunada,
supra, 230 Cal.App.4th at 488.
            As of the moving
papers, Manoukian presents billings for 61.5 hours on this matter, or $27,675
in fees.  Manoukian Decl., ¶¶ 29, 31, Ex. 6.  Manoukian adds 12.5 hours for the motion for
attorney’s fees, from drafting the motion to attending the hearing.  Manoukian Reply Decl., ¶16.  
            The District asserts
that Manoukian’s hours contain duplicative entries and entries for
administrative tasks better spent by a paralegal or secretary.  Opp. at 2. 
The District complains of multiple entries to review and finalize the
Petition, for preparation for depositions, emailing opposing counsel about
production, scheduling depositions, reviewing deposition transcripts, drafting
the opening and reply trial briefs, and billing for working with an attorney
service and instructing on service of the Petition, and coordinating inspection
and copying.  Opp. at 3-4.
            The court
has reviewed Manoukian’s evidence and finds the District’s objections spurious,
with the possible exception of administrative tasks.  Even there, the court accepts Manoukian’s
explanation.  Moreover, the total fees
sought of $33,300 are completely reasonable.
 
            3.
Costs
A prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a
memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of
entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.5 or the date of service of written notice of entry of judgment or
dismissal, or within 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is first.  CRC 3.1700(a).  In a CPRA action, the 15-day deadline to file
a memorandum of costs begins with the notice of entry of an order that is
appealable, which is the instant order.  See
Los Angeles Corridor Transportation Authority, (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th
1381, 1388 (time for appeal of CPRA attorney’s fees denial is date of “notice
of entry” of denial).  
            Englander
asserts costs of $3,566.30 in this action. 
Manoukian Reply Decl., ¶18.  The
court granted the Petition on November 28, 2023.  Manoukian Decl., ¶12.  When it did, it also found Englander to be the
prevailing party for the purpose of attorney’s fees and costs under section
7923.115(a).  Manoukian Decl., ¶13.  Englander must file a memorandum of costs to
claim these costs; they will not be addressed by motion. 
 
            E.
Conclusion
            The
motion for attorney’s fees is granted in the amount of $33,300.
