And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses various issues related to a court case involving Aguirre's request for records from UCLA under the California Public Records Act (CPRA). The court has granted Aguirre's request to judicially notice certain documents, including news articles and press releases, but has denied the request for judicial notice of another document. The court has also rejected Aguirre's claims that UCLA failed to comply with section 7922.540 of the CPRA, which requires written notice of denial and the names and titles of each person responsible for the denial. The court has found that UCLA substantially complied with this section.
