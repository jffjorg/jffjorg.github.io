 Case Number:  22STCP03428    Hearing Date:   April 2, 2024    Dept:  85 
Michael
Aguirre v. University of California at
Los Angeles, 22STCP03428
Tentative decision on
petition for writ of mandate:   denied



 
            
 
            Petitioner
Michael Aguirre (“Aguirre”) seeks a writ of traditional mandate directing Respondent
University of California at Los Angeles (“UCLA”) to provide public records
responsive to his requests under the California Public Records Act (“CPRA”).  
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and renders
the following tentative decision. 
            
            A.
Statement of the Case
            1.
Petition
            Petitioner
Aguirre filed the verified Petition on September 19, 2022, alleging a cause of
action for traditional mandamus and a cause of action for declaratory and
injunctive relief.  The Petition alleges
in pertinent part as follows.
            The
University of California’s Board of Regents (“Regents”) governs UCLA.  On June 30, 2022, without Board knowledge or
consent, UCLA Chancellor Gene Block (“Block”) and Director of Athletics Martin
Jarmond (“Jarmond”) released a statement online that stated: “After careful
consideration and thoughtful consideration” UCLA [has] decided to transition
from the Pac-12 Conference (“Pac-12”) to the Big Ten Conference (“Big Ten”),
effective the 2024-25 season.
            On
July 19, 2022, Aguirre submitted a CPRA request to Block and Jarmond for (1)
all records of communications between UCLA and Big Ten personnel regarding this
transition (“Request No. 1”), and (2) any records of communications regarding
the “careful consideration and thoughtful deliberation” referenced in a report Block
and Jarmond issued to campus on June 30, 2022 (“June 30 Announcement”)
(“Request No. 2”).
            UCLA
Information Practices (“Information Practices”) acknowledged receipt of the
request, but the acknowledgement advised that UCLA would produce documents in
accordance with “University policy” as well as relevant law.  On July 29, 2022, Information Practices Senior
Public Records Analyst Nicholas J. Alexakis (“Alexakis”) advised Aguirre that Information
Practices needed additional time to respond to the request and promised a
response by August 12, 2022.  
            On
August 3, Aguirre responded that the July 29, 2022 response was not compliant
with the CPRA’s requirement that UCLA determine within ten days if disclosable
records are responsive to the request.  
            UCLA
used the 60 days after the request to brainstorm unmeritorious excuses to not
produce the records sought.  It eventually
promised a rolling production from August 19, 2022.  Despite this, they have only produced three
redacted documents.  On August 26, 2022,
UCLA officials wrote that some responsive documents were protected from
disclosure under the attorney-client privilege or the deliberative process
doctrine.
            On
August 27, 2022, Aguirre sent UCLA a draft of his Petition.  He gave UCLA until September 15, 2022 to
produce responsive documents before he would file it.  During that time, UCLA did not produce any
documents with substantive information responsive to the request.  It produced redacted documents, documents
dated after the June 30 Announcement, and miscellaneous documents. 
            Aguirre
seeks (1) a writ of mandate compelling the disclosure of documents pursuant to
the CPRA request, (2) a declaration that the records must be produced under the
CPRA and California Constitution, (3) a declaration that, to the extent the
deliberative process exemptions are present, the public interest in disclosure
clearly outweighs the public interest in concealment, and (4) attorney’s fees
and costs.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
November 22, 2022, Regents filed an Answer.
 
            B.
The CPRA
            1.
Governing Law
The CPRA was enacted in 1968 to safeguard the accountability
of government to the public.  San
Gabriel Tribune v. Superior Court, (1983) 143 Cal.App.4th 762, 771-72.  Government Code[1]
section 7921.000[2] declares
that “access to information concerning the conduct of the people’s business is
a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.”  The CPRA’s purpose is to increase freedom of
information by giving the public access to information in possession of public
agencies. CBS. Inc. v. Block, (1986) 42 Cal. 3d 646, 651.  The CPRA was intended to safeguard the
accountability of government to the public, and it makes public access to
governmental records a fundamental right of citizenship.  Wilson v. Superior Court, (1996) 51
Cal.App.4th 1136, 1141.  This requires
maximum disclosure of the conduct of government operations.  California State University Fresno Assn.,
Inc. v. Superior Court, (“California State University”) (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 810, 823.  In 2004, the
voters endorsed the CPRA by approving Prop 59, which amended the state
Constitution to declare that “the writings of public agencies…shall be open to
public scrutiny.”  Cal. Const. art. I,
§3(b)(1).  Accordingly, any statute,
court rule, or other authority shall be broadly construed if it furthers the
people’s right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right.  Cal. Const. art. I, §3(b)(2).  
            The
CPRA makes clear that “every person” has a right to inspect any public
record.  §7922.525(a).  The inspection may be for any purpose; the
requester’s motivation is irrelevant. §7921.300.  The term “public record” is broadly defined
to include any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the
people’s business prepared, owned, used or retained by any state or local
agency regardless of physical form or characteristics.  §7920.530(a). 
The definition of “state agency” excludes agencies described in articles
IV and VI of the state constitution, which describe the legislative and
judicial branches, except the State Bar of California.  §7920.540.
            A
CPRA request must reasonably describe an identifiable public record or
records.  §7922.530(a).  Upon receiving a request for a copy of public
records, an agency must determine within ten days whether the request seeks
public records in the possession of the agency that are subject to disclosure,
but that deadline may be extended up to 14 days for unusual circumstances.  §§ 7922.535(a), (b).  Nothing in the CPRA “shall be construed to
permit an agency to delay or obstruct the inspection or copying of public
records.”  §7922.500.  
            Even
significant expense to the agency will not excuse an agency from conducting a
thorough search for responsive records unless it constitutes an undue
burden.  See, e.g., CBS
Broadcasting Inc. v. Superior Ct., (2001) 91 Cal. App. 4th 892, 909
($43,000 cost to agency to compile responsive public records was not valid
reason to deny CPRA request). 
“Reasonable efforts do not require that agencies undertake
extraordinarily extensive or intrusive searches, however.  In general, the scope of an agency’s search
for public records ‘need only be reasonably calculated to locate responsive
documents.’” City of San Jose v. Superior Court, (“City of San Jose”)
(2017) 2 Cal.5th 608, 627 (citation omitted). 
The “CPRA does not prescribe specific methods of searching
for those documents and agencies may develop their own internal policies for
conducting searches.  Some general
principles have emerged, however. Once an agency receives a CPRA request, it
must “‘communicate the scope of the information requested to the custodians of
its records,’ although it need not use the precise language of the request...” Ibid.
(citation omitted).  If the agency
determines that the requested records are subject to disclosure, it must state
in the determination “the estimated date and time when the records will be made
available.”  §7922.535(a). There is no
deadline expressed in number of days for producing the records.  Rather, the agency “shall make the records
promptly available.”  §7922.530(a).
            If
the agency determines that the requested records are not subject to disclosure,
the agency must promptly notify the person making the request and provide the
reasons for its determination. §7922.535(a). 
The agency must justify withholding a responsive record by demonstrating
it is exempt or that on the facts of the case the public interest served by not
disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by
disclosure of the record. 
§7922.000.  The determination that
the request is denied, in whole or part, must be in writing.  §7922.540(a).
 
2. Exemptions
            The
right to inspect is subject to certain exemptions, which are narrowly
construed.  California State
University, supra, 90 Cal.App.4th at 831.  The burden of demonstrating that exemptions
apply lies with the governmental entity. 
§7922.000.  Additionally, if a state or local agency discloses a public
record that is otherwise exempt to a member of the public, this disclosure
shall constitute a waiver of the applicable exemptions.  §7921.505(b).  This does not apply to disclosures (1) made through
legal proceedings or as otherwise required by law (§7921.505(c)(2)); (2) within the scope of disclosure of a statute that
limits disclosure of specified writings to certain purposes (§7921.505(c)(3)); or (3) made to a governmental agency that agrees to treat
the disclosed material as confidential (§7921.505(c)(5)).  
a. Attorney-Client Privlege/Work Product Doctrine
            (i). Attorney-Client
Privilege
In performing various duties, a lawyer must work with a
certain degree of privacy, free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing parties
and their counsel.  Hickman v. Taylor,
(1947) 329 U.S. 495, 510.  Preparation of
a client’s case demands that the lawyer assemble information, sift relevant
from irrelevant facts, prepare legal theories, and plan a strategy without
undue and needless interference.  Id.
at 511.  
In California, the
attorney-client privilege is a legislative creation codified in the Evidence
Code.  McKesson HBOC, Inc. v. Superior Court,¿(2004) 115
Cal.App.4th 1229, 1236.  Its purpose is to promote full and open
discussion between clients and their attorneys.  Ibid.  The
attorney-client privilege covers all forms of communication, including
transactional advice and advice in contemplation of threatened
litigation.  Titmas v. Superior Court,¿(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 738,
744. 
            A
“confidential communication between client and lawyer” is “information
transmitted between a client and his or her lawyer in the course of that
relationship and in confidence by a means which, so far as the client is aware,
discloses the information to no third persons other than those who are present
to further the interest of the client in the consultation or those to whom
disclosure is reasonably necessary for the transmission of the information or
the accomplishment of the purpose for which the lawyer is consulted, and
includes a legal opinion formed and the advice given by the lawyer in the
course of that relationship.”  Evid. Code §952.  The attorney-client
privilege is the client’s privilege to refuse to disclose, and to prevent
another from disclosing, a confidential communication between client and
lawyer.  Evid. Code §954.   
            The party
claiming the attorney-client privilege has the burden of establishing the
preliminary facts necessary to support its exercise -- i.e., a
communication made in the course of an attorney-client relationship.  Costco Wholesale
Corp. v. Superior Court,¿(2009) 47 Cal.4th 725, 733.  These
preliminary facts are (a) information transmitted between and client and
lawyer, (b) in the course of a relationship, (c) in confidence, and it includes
a legal opinion formed and the advice given by the lawyer in the course of that
relationship.  Evid. Code §952.  Not every communication between an attorney
and client is privileged, however.  Los
Angeles County Board of Supervisors v. Superior Court, (2016) 2 Cal.5th
296, 282.  If the preliminary facts show
a communication made in the course of an attorney-client relationship, the communication is presumed to have been made in
confidence and the opponent of the claim of privilege has the burden of proof
to establish the communication was not confidential or that the privilege does
not for other reasons apply.  Ibid. (citing Evid. Code §917(a)). 

 
            (ii).
Work Product Rule
It is the policy of the state to (a) preserve the rights of
attorneys to prepare cases for trial, with the degree of privacy necessary to
encourage them to prepare their cases thoroughly and investigate the favorable and
unfavorable aspects of those cases; and (b) prevent attorneys from taking undue
advantage of their adversary’s industry and efforts.  CCP §2018.020.  Any writing that reflects an attorney’s
impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories is not
discoverable under any circumstances. 
CCP §2018.030(a).  Any other work
product of an attorney is not discoverable unless the court determines that
denial of discovery will unfairly prejudice the party seeking discovery in
preparing that party’s claim or defense or will result in an injustice.  CCP §2018.030(b).  The doctrine is not limited to writings
created by a lawyer in anticipation of a lawsuit.  League of Cal. Cities v. Sup. Ct., (“League
of Cal. Cities”) (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 976, 993.  It also applies to writings prepared by an
attorney while acting in a nonlitigation capacity.  Id. 
The party claiming the work
product rule “has the burden of establishing the preliminary facts necessary to
support its exercise”.  Citizens for Ceres,
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 889, 911-12 (citation omitted).  The preliminary facts necessary to support a work
product doctrine claim are those that establish that the documents are work
product.  Fellows v. Superior Court, (1980)
108 Cal.App.3d 55, 61 disapproved on
other grounds by Coito v. Superior Court, (“Coito”)
(2012) 54 Cal.4th 480 (noting that preliminary showing must establish that
documents in question qualify as attorney’s work product and establish whether
absolute or condition portions of privilege apply).  In the case of absolute work product
protection, this means that the agency must make a preliminary showing that the
disclosure would reveal the attorney’s “impressions, conclusions, opinions, or
legal research or theories.”  Coito, supra, 54 Cal.4th at 495 (citing CCP
§2018.030(a)).  In the case of qualified
work product protection, the agency must make a preliminary showing that
disclosure “would result in opposing counsel taking undue advantage of the
attorney’s industry or efforts.”  See id. at 502.  For every document withheld based on this
doctrine, the party seeking protection must produce a brief description of the
document and its contents sufficient to determine (1) whether the document is
work product, (2) whether absolute or partial work product protection applies,
and (3) why the work product protection applies.
            Whether
specific material is protected work product must be resolved on a case-by-case
basis.  League of Cal. Cities, supra,
241 Cal.App.4th at 993.  
b. Deliberative Process
The deliberative process privilege
falls under the section 7922.000 catchall’s exemption when “the public
interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public
interest served by disclosure of the record.” 
See, e.g., Labor & Workforce Development Agency v.
Superior Court, (2018) 19 Cal.App.5th 12, 26-27.  The deliberative process privilege protects
“mental processes by which a given decision was reached” and “the substance of
conversations, discussions, debates, deliberations and like materials
reflecting advice, opinions, and recommendations by which government policy is
processed and formulated.”  Regents of
University of California v. Superior Court, (1999) 20 Cal.4th 509,
540.  The frank discussion of legal or
policy matters in writing may be inhibited if the discussion is made public,
with the result of poorer decisions and policies formulated.  Id. (citation omitted).
In applying the privilege,
“[t]he key question in every case is ‘whether the disclosure of materials would
expose an agency’s decisionmaking process in such a way as to discourage candid
discussion within the agency and thereby undermine the agency’s ability to
perform its functions.’ [Citation.] Even if the content of a document is purely
factual, it is nonetheless exempt from public scrutiny if it is ‘actually...
related to the process by which policies are formulated’ [citation] or
‘inextricably intertwined with ‘policy-making processes.’ [Citations.]”  American Civil Liberties Union of Northern
California v. Superior Court, (“ACLU”) (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 55, 75-76
(Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court, (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325,
1342 (the public interest in non-disclosure of almost five years of the
governor’s appointment calendars and schedules, covering thousands of meetings,
conferences and engagements of every conceivable nature, clearly outweighed the
public interest in disclosure).
 
3. Enforcement
            A
CPRA claim to compel compliance with a public records request may proceed
through either mandamus or declaratory relief. 
§7923.000.  Because the petitioner
may proceed through either mandamus or declaratory relief, the trial court
independently decides whether disclosure is required.  See
City of San Jose v. Superior Court, (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1018
(appellate court independently reviews trial court CPRA decision).  No administrative record is required, and the
parties must submit admissible evidence.
 
C. Standard of Review
            A
traditional writ of mandate under CCP section 1085 is the method of compelling
the performance of a legal, ministerial duty. 
Pomona Police Officers’ Assn. v. City of Pomona, (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 578, 583-84.  Generally,
mandamus will lie when (1) there is no plain, speedy, and adequate alternative
remedy, (2) the respondent has a duty to perform, and (3) the petitioner has a
clear and beneficial right to performance. 
Id. at 584 (internal citations omitted).  Whether a statute imposes a ministerial duty
for which mandamus is available, or a mere obligation to perform a
discretionary function, is a question of statutory interpretation.  AIDS Healthcare Foundation v. Los Angeles
County Dept. of Public Health, (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 693, 701.
            Whenever
it is made to appear, by verified petition to the superior court of the county
where the records, or some part thereof, are situated that certain public
records are being improperly withheld from a member of the public, the court
shall order the officer or other person charged with withholding the records to
disclose those records or show cause why that person should not do so.  §7923.100. 
The court shall decide the case after it has (a) examined the record in
camera, if permitted by Evid. Code section 915(b); (b) examined the papers
filed by the parties; and (c) considered any oral argument and additional
evidence as the court may allow. 
§7923.105.
            If
the court finds that the public official’s decision to refuse disclosure is not
justified, the court shall order the public official to make the record
public.  §7923.110(a).  If the court finds that the public official
was justified in refusing to make the record public, the court shall return the
record to the public official without disclosing its content, together with an
order supporting the decision refusing disclosure.  §7923.110(b).
            If
the requestor prevails in such litigation, the court shall award court costs
and reasonable attorney’s fees, to be paid by the public agency at issue.  §7923.115(a). 
If the case was clearly frivolous, the court shall award court costs and
reasonable attorney’s fees to the public agency.  §7923.115(b).        

 
D. Statement of Facts[3]
            1.
Aguirres’ Evidence
            a.
UCLA’s Departure from the Pac-12 to the Big Ten
            FOX
Network owns 61% of the Big Ten Network, a four-hour national video programming
service dedicated to the collegiate Big Ten and its programming.  Severson Decl., Ex. 23 (AR 486).  The biographies of the Big Ten’s executive
team reveal that its President, Studio Production Vice President, and
Production & Executive Producer Senior Vice President have connections to
FOX Sports.  Severson Decl., ¶24, Ex. 23
(AR 489, 494-97).
            On
June 30, 2022, UCLA and the University of Southern California (“USC”) issued
press releases to announce their departure from the Pac-12.  RJN Exs. 2-3. 
UCLA’s June 30 announcement stated that after “careful consideration and
thoughtful deliberation, UCLA has decided to leave the Pac-12 Conference and join
the Big Ten Conference at the start of the 2024-25 season.”  Severson Decl., Ex. 14 (AR 161); RJN Ex. 2.  The press release asserted that entry into the
Big Ten would help ensure that UCLA preserves and maintains all 25 teams and over
700 student athletes in its program.  Severson
Decl., Ex. 14 (AR 161); RJN Ex. 2.  
            Since
that press release, every Pac-12 team except Oregon State and Washington State
has announced its departure.  RJN Exs.
4-11; Severson Decl. ¶¶ 31-32.  
            Minutes
from the Regents meeting on November 17, 2022 reflect its discussion of the
financial and legal implications of UCLA’s membership in the Big Ten instead of
the Pac-12.  Severson Decl., ¶22, Ex. 28
(AR 543).  The Regents discussed whether
it could choose to exercise its authority to withdraw UCLA from its agreement
with the Big Ten.  Ex. 28 (AR 543).  The minutes explained that Big Ten had announced
a seven-year media rights deal on August 18, 2022 that averages over $1 billion
in annual revenue and will increase in later years of the deal.  Ex. 28 (AR 551).  This media rights revenue suggested that member
schools would receive $60 million annually, potentially increasing to $70 million
in later years.  Ex. 28 (AR 551).  Other revenue streams include ticket sales, merchandise,
and media distributions.  Ex. 28 (AR
551). 
            The
LinkedIn page of Adam Neuman (“Neuman”), former Big Ten Conference Chief of
Staff, Strategy and Operations & Deputy General Counsel, asserts that he
was instrumental in (1) securing USC and UCLA’s addition to the conference and
(2) negotiating the record-breaking media rights deal with FOX, CBS and NBC.   Severson
Decl., ¶18, Ex. 27 (AR 537).
 
            b.
The CPRA Request
On July 19, 2022, Aguirre emailed a CPRA request to UCLA
Chancellor Block and Athletic Director Jarmond for the following:
(1) all records of
communication between UCLA agents, officers, and employees and Big Ten agents,
officers, and employees regarding the subject matter of UCLA departing from the
PAC 12 as UCLA Chancellor Gene Block and Martin Jarmond reported on June 30, 2022,
through the UCLA Newsroom; and 
(2) any records of
communications regarding the “careful consideration and thoughtful
deliberation” regarding UCLA's departure from the PAC 12 as represented in the
June 30 report to campus.  Aguirre Decl.,
¶8, Ex. 2 (AR 6).  
 
            c.
UCLA’s Response 
            Later
that day, Information Practices acknowledged receipt of Aguirre’s request in an
email and promised a response by July 29, 2022. 
Aguirre Decl., ¶9, Exs. 1-2 (AR 11). 
The email warned that the CPRA only requires a public agency to
determine within ten days whether a request seeks records that are publicly
disclosable and, if so, provide an estimated date when the records will be
available.  Aguirre Decl., ¶9, Ex. 2 (AR
11).  Nevertheless, the email stated that
UCLA “prides itself” on providing all publicly disclosable records in as timely
a manner as possible.  Aguirre Decl., ¶9,
Ex. 2 (AR 11). 
On July 29, 2022, Senior CPRA Analyst Alexakis informed
Aguirre that Information Practices needed additional time to search for and
collect responsive records from field facilities or other establishments separate
from the office processing the CPRA request. 
Aguirre Decl., ¶10, Ex. 3 (AR 13). 
Information Practices would respond to the request by August 12, 2022
with an estimated date by which it would make responsive documents available.  Aguirre Decl., ¶10, Ex. 3 (AR 13).
            On
August 12, 2022, Alexakis notified Aguirre that Information Practices was still
working on the request.  Aguirre Decl.,
¶11, Ex. 4 (AR 16).  Alexakis estimated that
Information Practices would produce responsive documents by September 30, 2022.
 Aguirre Decl., ¶11, Ex. 4 (AR 16).  A rolling production potentially would start in
a week.  Aguirre Decl., ¶11, Ex. 4 (AR
16).  
            On
August 15, 2022, Aguirre asked UCLA to confirm when it would begin
production.  Aguirre Decl., ¶12, Ex. 5
(AR 20).  He stated that he would hold
off filing a lawsuit if production began sometime that week.  Aguirre Decl., ¶12, Ex. 5 (AR 20).  Information Practices responded that a
rolling production would begin on August 19. 
Aguirre Decl., ¶13, Ex. 6 (AR 22).
 
            c.
Production of Records
            (i).
August 17 Production
            On
August 17, 2022, UCLA produced three pages of responsive documents.  Aguirre Decl., ¶14, Ex. 7 (AR 24-25).  One of the produced documents was a June 30,
2022 application from Block and Jarmond asking Big Ten Commissioner Kevin
Warren (“Warren”) to consider UCLA for full and equal membership in the
conference.  Aguirre Decl., ¶15, Ex. 7
(AR 30).  The letter said that Block and
Jarmond appreciated the Big Ten’s commitment to working with UCLA to reduce travel
impact and related issues so student athletes could maintain a well-rounded
college experience.  Ex. 7 (AR 30).  The other documents produced were an email Block
sent to Warren with the application attached and Warren’s response thanking
Block for the application.  Ex. 7 (AR 28).  
Alexakis’ cover letter to the production advised Aguirre
that certain contact information had been redacted because disclosure would
constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, per the then-applicable
provision of the CPRA.  Ex. 7 (AR
25).  
            On
August 23, 2022, Aguirre replied that he needed “a substantial production of
documents” that week.  Aguirre Decl.,
¶16, Ex. 8 (AR 32).  If UCLA failed to
provide this, he would have no choice but to seek judicial relief.  Ex. 8 (AR 32).  
            On
August 26, 2022, Information Practices Director Robert Baldridge (“Baldridge”) replied
via email that, while no further non-exempt records were available at the time,
UCLA was still looking for such records from the periods both before May 1,
2022 and between July 1 and 19, 2022. 
Aguirre Decl., ¶17, Ex. 9 (AR 37). 
Baldridge noted some responsive records were withheld as exempt under
either the attorney-client privilege or the deliberative process doctrine.  Ex. 9 (AR 37).  
            On
August 27, Aguirre responded that he did not want to have to take his “good
friends as UCLA” to court to obtain the requested documents.  Aguirre Decl., ¶18, Ex. 10 (AR 39).  He attached a draft of his Petition as part
of a last-ditch effort to compel UCLA to comply with its duties under the law.  Ex. 10 (AR 39).  
            On
August 29, UCLA’s counsel asked for time to “look into” the Petition before
Aguirre filed it. Aguirre Decl., ¶19, Ex. 11 (AR 41).  Counsel stated his belief that there was some
misunderstanding or miscommunication and wanted to see if the parties could either
resolve the issue without litigation or clearly identify the issues a court
would need to resolve.  Ex. 11 (AR
41).  Aguirre agreed to honor this
request.  Ex. 11 (AR 41).  
            After
a phone call on September 2, 2022, UCLA’s counsel thanked Aguirre for
clarifying that he wanted the CPRA production to include administrative
communications about scheduling meetings. 
Aguirre Decl., ¶21, Ex. 12 (AR 44). 
Counsel promised to include scheduling communications in future
productions to the extent they are not exempt. 
Ex. 12 (AR 44).  He also asked
Aguirre to wait until September 30, 2022 to file the Petition.  Aguirre Decl., ¶21, Ex. 12 (AR 44).  He indicated that date was UCLA’s original
estimate for completing production and only six weeks after the date of
Aguirre’s requests.  Aguirre Decl., ¶21,
Ex. 12 (AR 44).  
 
            (ii).
September 15 Production
            On
September 15, 2022, UCLA produced 55 pages of documents in what Baldridge identified
in his cover letter as two separate batches. 
Aguirre Decl., ¶22, Ex. 13 (AR 51). 
The first batch of 41 pages included a series of emails for scheduling
meetings about UCLA’s move to Big Ten. 
Ex. 13 (AR 51-65).  
            The
second batch of 14 pages was a series of documents UCLA found responsive to another
party’s request – one of about 12 different requests – for emails received and
sent by Block and Jarmond between May 1 and July 1, 2022 pertinent to joining the
Big Ten.  Ex. 13 (AR 51, 66).  Information Practices estimated that this request
incorporated about 90% of Aguirre’s request. 
Ex. 13 (AR 51).  The produced
documents in this batch consisted of July 1, 2022 emails summarizing press
releases announcing various universities’ departure from Pac-12.  Ex. 13 (AR 84). 
            Baldridge
explained that Information Practices continued to search for any additional
records.  Ex. 13 (AR 51).  It expected to complete this production by
the September 30 estimate Alexakis had provided on August 12, 2022.  Ex. 13 (AR 51).  It would notify Aguirre of any delays as
promptly as possible.  Ex. 13 (AR
51).  Baldridge asked Aguirre for his
patience as Information Practices processed all the requests on this
subject.  Ex. 13 (AR 51).  
            Aguirre
and his attorney reviewed these documents and concluded that none reflected
communications with the Big Ten or demonstrated that UCLA gave careful
consideration to the change of conferences. 
Aguirre Decl., ¶23.  Aguirre never
agreed to let UCLA limit his request to only emails received and sent by Block
and Jarmond between May 1 and July 1, 2022. 
Aguirre Decl., ¶24.  He also did
not agree that this reflected 90% of his request.  Aguirre Decl., ¶24.[4] 
            On
September 19, 2022, Aguirre filed this lawsuit.
 
            (iii).
September 30 Production
            On
September 30, 2022, Information Practices produced two more batches of
documents.  Aguirre Decl., ¶26, Ex. 14
(AR 265).  Baldridge explained the first batch
was UCLA’s New Member Agreement with the Big Ten (“Big Ten Member Agreement”).  Ex. 14 (AR 265).  The second batch was a series of July 2022
emails from Chancellor Block’s email address containing the terms “Big Ten,” “Big
Ten,” “USC,” “SEC,” or “Realignment.”  Ex.
14 (AR 265).
            The
production included a June 30, 2022 email in which Blake Livesay from UCLA’s
Registrar’s Office told Block that whatever careful and thoughtful
consideration occurred had not included the UCLA community.  Aguirre Decl., ¶27, Ex. 14 (AR 168).  The decision to throw away over 100 years of
conference history was outrageous, a disgrace, and a shock to the whole country.  Ex. 14 (AR 168).  
            The
Big Ten Member Agreement, dated July 13, 2022, included a confidentiality
clause in which the Big Ten and UCLA agreed to treat as confidential all
materials received from each other during negotiations or preparation of the
agreement.  Aguirre Decl., ¶28, Ex. 14
(AR 245, 252).  If the subject transactions
were not consummated, each party was required to return any copies of nonpublic
documents and materials received during negotiation.  Ex. 14 (AR 252).  The parties could not use these materials
except to evaluate the transactions and could not communicate them to a third
party.  This obligation of
confidentiality shall not apply to information which is required to be
disclosed by law.  Ex. 14 (AR 252-53).  
            Baldridge’s
September 30 cover letter recognized that UCLA had originally promised to
complete production by this date. 
Aguirre Decl., ¶26, Ex. 14 (AR 265). 
However, the process of reviewing records was taking longer than
expected.  Ex. 14 (AR 265).  This was “almost exclusively” because of the
challenging task of identifying records related to the “careful consideration
and thoughtful deliberation” Aguirre described in Request No. 2.  Ex. 14 (AR 265).  Baldridge gave a new estimated completion
date of October 31, 2022.  Ex. 14 (AR
265).  
 
            (iv).
October 17 Production
            On
October 17, 2022, Information Practices produced another batch of 37 pages of documents
and asserted exemptions for other responsive documents based on the
attorney-client privilege and attorney work product (CCP §2018), and deliberative
process doctrine.  Aguirre Decl., ¶29,
Ex. 15 (AR 268).  Baldridge also asserted
that some information was redacted as preliminary notes or drafts not retained
in UCLA’s normal course of business and the public interest in withholding
those records clearly outweighed the public interest in disclosure.  Ex. 15 (AR 268).  Information Systems expected to provide its
complete response by October 31, 2022. 
Ex. 15 (AR 268).
            Some
records produced on October 17 were duplicates of scheduling emails the UCLA
had already produced.  Aguirre Decl.,
¶30, Ex. 15 (AR 273-86).  
            On
October 24, 2022, Alexakis asserted via letter that UCLA had completed its
review of responsive records and produced all non-exempt records.  Aguirre Decl., ¶31, Ex. 16 (AR 313).  
 
            (v).
Post-Petition Production
            On
September 22, 2023, UCLA’s counsel emailed Aguirre two documents.  Severson Decl., ¶20, Ex. 18 (AR 331).  The first was the equivalent of a Vaughn
Index with the exempt portions redacted. 
Ex. 18 (AR 331).  The second was one
page responsive to the CPRA requests.  Exs.
18, 20 (AR 331, 406). UCLA had learned during the Vaughn Index’s preparation
that it had not disclosed the one-page document.  Ex. 18 (AR 331).  
            On
September 22 and October 20, 2023, UCLA produced the same set of 68 pages.  Severson Decl., ¶21, Exs. 19, 22 (AR 336,
415).  These documents were heavily
redacted based on the attorney-client privilege, deliberative process, and the
status of attachments as drafts.  Ex. 19
(AR 336).  Some of the emails are dated
after June 30, 2022.  Ex. 19 (AR 358-71).  
Also on October 20, 2023, UCLA emailed Aguirre a key to the Vaughn
Index of the withheld documents and attachments to the produced emails.  Severson Decl., ¶21, Ex. 21 (AR 408).  
 
            d.
Discovery
            (i).
Production of Documents
            On
May 12, 2023, Regents provided documents in response to Aguirre’s Request for
Production of Documents.  Severson Decl.,
¶9, Exs. 25-26.  Pertinent documents are
as follows.
            On
July 19, 2022, Alexakis informed UCLA Chancellor Assistant Rena Torres
(“Torres”) and UCLA Athletic Department Chief Strategy Officer Matt Elliott
(“Elliott”) in separate emails of Aguirre’s CPRA request.  Severson Decl., ¶¶ 10, 12, Ex. 26 (AR 522,
534).  Alexakis asserted that because
Aguirre’s request was encompassed by another request, no action was required on
Aguirre’s request yet.  Ex. 26 (AR 522,
534).  
            In
August 29, 2022 email, Alexakis asked Torres and Elliott to search the
Chancellor’s and the Athletic Director’s respective private emails for
documents responsive to both of Aguirre’s requests.  Severson Decl., ¶¶ 13, 15, Ex. 26 (AR 526,
535).  He asked them to focus on
documents responsive to Request No. 1. 
Ex. 26 (AR 526, 535).  In a
follow-up email to Torres later that day, Alexakis advised him to look for
emails Jarmond exchanged with Warren, Neuman, and Anil Gollahalli (“Gollahalli”).  Ex. 26 (AR 535).  
            On
September 23, 2022, Alexakis checked in with Torres about the status of
Aguirre’s requests.    He recognized that
Request No. 2 was quite subjective but asked her to do her best to identify
responsive documents.  Ex. 26 (AR 529).  
            In
an October 11, 2022 email, Torres told Alexakis she used the search terms “Big
Ten,” “careful consideration and thoughtful deliberation,” “careful
consideration,” “thoughtful deliberation,” and the combination of “Pac-12” and
“Big Ten.”  Ex. 26 (AR 528).
 
            (ii).
Alexakis Deposition
            During
his deposition, Alexakis testified that he did not speak to Chancellor Block
but he did speak to Block’s office about whether he had any responsive
writings.  Severson Decl., ¶19, Ex. 25
(AR 509).  He could not remember when,
but it was soon after he received Aguirre’s request.  Ex. 25 (AR 509-10).  He spoke to a representative, not Block
himself.  Ex. 25 (AR 510-11).  He also spoke to Athletic Director Jarmond’s representative.  Ex. 25 (AR 511-12).  Alexakis did not attempt to talk to either Block
or Jarmond personally to ask if they had responsive records.  Ex. 25 (AR 512).  
            When
asked if he found any records showing the substantive thoughtful deliberations
described in the June 30 Announcement, Alexakis testified that he did, but the
contents of the responsive emails were covered by the attorney-client
privilege.  Ex. 25 (AR 513-14).  These emails were between counsel for UCLA
and certain stakeholders within UCLA. 
Ex. 25 (AR 514).  
            Alexakis
could not remember from whom he received documents showing thoughtful
communication related to the authors of the June 22 Statement.  Ex. 25 (AR 515).  He could not remember if he obtained any such
documents other than privileged documents received from Bobby Swerdlow.  Ex. 25 (AR 516).  There are responsive records on his computer
that were not produced.  Ex. 25 (AR 517-18).  Alexakis estimated this was about 50 pages on
a server.  Ex. 25 (AR 518).  
            If
Alexakis concluded that a document was part of the deliberative process, he concluded
this was sufficient to find the document exempt.  Ex. 25 (AR 519). Alexakis made the exemption
determinations.  Ex. 25 (AR 520).  He did not “have an understanding” that he is
required by the CPRA to identify himself as the decisionmaker on exemptions.  Ex. 25 (AR 520).
 
            e.
Outstanding Records
            UCLA
has not produced any records of the purported “careful consideration and
thoughtful deliberation,” including communications between UCLA and Big Ten
personnel.  Severson Decl., ¶27.  This includes communications from Warren,
Neuman, and Gollahalli, the Big Ten officers who negotiated the Big Ten Member
Agreement.  Severson Decl., ¶27.  
            UCLA
has not produced any records showing the financial benefits it was told it
would receive if it joined Big Ten. 
Severson Decl., ¶26.  It has not
produced records of what inducements the conference made for UCLA to withdraw,
or of what financial data UCLA considered. 
Severson Decl., ¶29.  UCLA has not
produced communications between television executives and Block, Jarmond, or
their agents.  Severson Decl., ¶29.  
            UCLA
has not produced any communications about the transition with donors like Alice
and Nahum Lainer, the family for whom Jarmond’s position is named.  Severson Decl., ¶30.  
            
            2.
UCLA’s Evidence
            a.
Background
Information Practices receives about 3,323 CPRA requests per
year via about 786 submissions. 
Baldridge Decl., ¶2.  
Senior CPRA Analyst Alexakis reports to Ayse Donmez, who in
turn reports to Baldridge.  Alexakis
Decl., ¶3; Baldridge Decl., ¶4.  Alexakis
understands UCLA’s obligations under the CPRA and competently carries out all
related duties.  Baldridge Decl.,
¶3.  This is true for his management of
all requests pertaining to the change in conferences.  Baldridge Decl., ¶3.  
            Elliott,
the Chief Strategy Officer in the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics,
manages the Department’s response to almost all CPRA requests, about 10-15 per
year.  Elliott Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.  
Victoria Forman (“Forman”), the Senior Executive Assistant
to Athletics Director Jarmond, has processed any CPRA requests involving
Jarmond’s emails, a total of 45 since February 2016.  Forman Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.
            Torres
has been the Executive Assistant to the Chancellor for 14 years.  Torres Decl., ¶1.  She has handled CPRA requests for the
Chancellor from 50 requesters since late 2019 or early 2020.  Torres Decl., ¶2.
 
            b.
Prior Requests
            Previous
to Aguirre’s request, Information Practices received three CPRA requests related
to the Big 10 announcement, one on June 30, four on July 1, one on July 6, and
one on July 12.  Forman Decl., ¶6; Alexakis
Decl., ¶¶ 5-6, Ex. 36 (AR 2758-68).  Alexakis
was assigned to all CPRA requests concerning the announcement of the move from
the Pac-12 to the Big Ten.  Alexakis
Decl., ¶4.  Information Practices
received Aguirre’s request on July 19, almost three weeks after the
announcement and after the other requests. 
Alexakis Decl., ¶7.
            On
July 6, 2022, nearly two weeks before Aguirre’s request, Alexakis provided
custodians like Torres and Elliot with a color-coded spreadsheet of the
requests, with urgent ones marked red and those that temporarily could be
ignored in black.  Torres Decl., ¶¶ 3-5; Elliot
Decl., ¶¶ 5-6; Alexakis Decl., ¶¶ 8-9, Exs. 31, 40 (AR 584, 5405).  He asked that they search for documents
responsive to blue-marked requests and estimate the quantity without providing
them to Information Practices.  Torres
Decl., ¶5; Elliot Decl., ¶6; Alexakis Decl., ¶¶ 8-9, Exs. 31, 40 (AR 584, 5405).  Alexakis acknowledged that some requests were
worded more clearly than others and invited any questions or concerns about
them.  Torres Decl., ¶6; Elliot Decl.,
¶6; Alexakis Decl., ¶¶ 8-9, Exs. 31, 40 (AR 584, 5405).  
            Alexakis
asked Francis Avecilla, manager of the Chancellor’s Communications Service, to
check Chancellor Block’s public email account. 
Alexakis Decl., ¶9.  He asked Torres
to search Block’s private email account. 
Torres Decl., ¶7; Alexakis Decl., ¶9, Ex. 31 (AR 583).  Torres emailed Alexakis that she doubted she
would find anything because she did not remember written communications about
the decision to change conferences despite activity related to it.  Torres Decl., ¶8.  Torres asked Block to search his text
messages and his “Mednet” account, an account associated with the School of
Medicine that Block uses for his academic research.  Torres Decl., ¶¶ 8-9.  Block sent Torres responsive Mednet emails,
but he did not find any responsive text messages.  Torres Decl., ¶¶ 8-9.
 
            c.
Aguirre’s Request
 
            Information
Practices received Aguirre’s request on July 19, almost three weeks after the
announcement.  Alexakis Decl., ¶7, Ex. 32
(AR 937).  Information Practices
acknowledged the request the same day. 
Alexakis Decl., ¶13.  By then, Information
Practices already had a “high volume” of requests on this subject.  Alexakis Decl., ¶8.  Alexakis had already contacted custodians of
records to collect records potentially responsive to received requests.  Alexakis Decl., ¶8.  Information Practices would ultimately
collect and release a high volume of records in response to the prior
requests.  Alexakis Decl., ¶11.  
            Between
August 3 and November 17, 2022, five more CPRA requests followed Aguirre’s
request.  Alexakis Decl., ¶12.
            
            d.
Response to Aguirre’s Request
            The
day Information Practices received Aguirre’s request, Alexakis forwarded it to
the Chancellor’s Office and the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics.  Alexakis Decl., ¶15; Elliot Decl., ¶9; Torres
Decl., ¶10.  Based on his work on the
other requests, Alexakis knew those two offices would be the only ones with
responsive documents because they were the two key decisionmakers behind the
move between conferences.  Alexakis
Decl., ¶15.  Torres and Elliott were the
custodians of such records for those offices. 
Forman monitors the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics’ email inbox
and forwarded the email to Elliot. 
Alexakis Decl., ¶16; Elliot Decl., ¶9. 

            When
Alexakis told Torres and Elliott about Aguirre’s request, he kept it in black
font on his spreadsheet and asked them not to take action.  Torres Decl., ¶10; Elliot Decl., ¶8; Alexakis
Decl., ¶17.  Alexakis believed another
item highlighted blue on that spreadsheet encompassed Aguirre’s Request No.
1.  Alexakis Decl., ¶17.  This item was a request from The Athletic
for all emails Block or Jarmond received or sent, between May 1 and July 1,
2022, about joining Big Ten.  Alexakis
Decl., ¶¶ 6(h), 17.  Alexakis believed that
Aguirre’s Request No. 1 for all records of communication between UCLA and Big
Ten employees about the departure from Pac-12 was either identical to or
narrower than The Athletic’s request. 
Alexakis Decl., ¶18.  
            Alexakis
chose to briefly defer action on Aguirre’s Request No. 2 until the custodians
had completed production for requests predating Aguirre’s request.  Alexakis Decl., ¶19.  Request No. 2 was less clear than Request No.
1.  Alexakis Decl., ¶20.  He concluded that asking custodians to restart
the search and inspect all documents to see which were responsive to this
request would hamper efforts to efficiently complete the prior requests.  Alexakis Decl., ¶20.  He also believed that records responsive to
Request No. 1, coupled with records responsive to the prior requests, would be
responsive to Request No. 2.  Alexakis
Decl., ¶21.  He intended to provide
further instructions after the search for records responsive to Request No. 1
was completed, and he did.  Alexakis
Decl., ¶21.  
            After
Alexakis informed Torres and Elliott of the request, he regularly followed up
to monitor progress on the search for responsive records.  Alexakis Decl., ¶¶ 22, 24.  On July 29, 2022, Alexakis asked Torres how
long Block’s office needed to respond to Aguirre’s request.  Alexakis Decl., ¶22.  Torres said she would have the information by
the next week.  Alexakis Decl., ¶22.  Per section 7922.535, Alexakis informed
Aguirre that Information Practices needed additional time, until August 12, to search
for and collect responsive records from facilities and establishments other
than the establishment processing the CPRA request.  Alexakis Decl., ¶23; Baldridge Decl., ¶5.  
            On
August 3, 2022, Aguirre objected that this notice failed to comply with section
7922.535, accused UCLA of stonewalling, and threatened to file suit.  Baldridge Decl., ¶6; Alexakis Decl., ¶25, Ex.
33 (AR 1060).  On August 5, Baldridge
replied that this objection was without merit. 
Baldridge Decl., ¶7; Alexakis Decl., ¶25, Ex. 33 (AR 1059).  The CPRA states that within ten days of a
request, subject to the 14-day extension, an agency must estimate when the
records would be available.  Alexakis
Decl., ¶25, Ex. 33 (AR 1059).
            On
August 8, 2022, Alexakis sent Torres emails from Block’s public account,
apparently received from the Chancellor’s Communication Service Manager, so that
Block could review them before production. 
Torres Decl., ¶13, Ex. 31 (AR 593). 
Torres forwarded those emails to Block. 
Torres Decl., ¶13, Ex. 31 (AR 593). 

            Later
that day, Alexakis sent Torres emails from Block’s private email address (that
Torres had provided to Alexakis), with notice that he intended to produce them
on or soon after August 12.  Torres
Decl., ¶14, Ex. 31 (AR 616).  He asked if
the Chancellor’s Office had any questions or concerns about the release or any
markups on the documents.  Torres Decl.,
¶14, Ex. 31 (AR 616).  Torres asked Alexakis
to confirm that he would redact Big Ten Commissioner Warren’s cell phone
number, and he confirmed it.  Torres
Decl., ¶14, Ex. 31 (AR 616).  Torres
forwarded this email chain to Block. 
Torres Decl., ¶14, Ex. 31 (AR 616). 

 
            e.
Production
            On
August 12, 2022, Alexakis emailed Aguirre that responsive records would be
available on September 30, 2022.  Baldridge
Decl., ¶9; Alexakis Decl., ¶29, Exs. 33, 35 (AR 1072, 1918).  Aguirre responded he would refrain from
filing suit based on the representation that rolling production would begin the
next week.  Alexakis Decl., ¶29, Ex. 33
(AR 1072).  
            After
the first round of production, on August 23, 2022, Aguirre expressed
dissatisfaction with the production and threatened to file suit unless he received
a substantial production of documents that week.  Alexakis Decl., ¶¶ 31, 33, Ex. 33 (AR 1079).  Baldridge advised Alexakis to inform the
Office of Legal Affairs.  Alexakis Decl.,
¶33, Ex. 33 (AR 1082).  Alexakis
explained to a colleague that Information Practices was handling Aguirre’s
request as well as it could, given the number of CPRA requests on the same
issue.  Baldridge Decl., ¶10; Alexakis
Decl., ¶33, Ex. 33 (AR 1132).
            In
his August 26, 2022 letter to Aguirre, Baldridge explained that Information
Practices production was reviewing documents over a broader time period than
its original review because the CPRA request did not specify a date range aside
from the date of the June 30 Announcement. 
Baldridge Decl., ¶11.  The next
day, Aguirre sent the draft Petition as a “last ditch effort” to compel
compliance with the CPRA and production or the desired records.  Baldridge Decl., ¶12, Ex. 34 (AR 1190).
            On
August 29, 2022, Alexakis asked Torres and Elliot to search Block and Jarmond’s
email accounts for any records specifically responsive to Request No. 1.  Torres Decl., ¶15; Forman Decl., ¶8; Elliot Decl., ¶10; Alexakis
Decl., ¶35, Ex. 31 (AR 631, 941).  Alexakis
wanted to confirm that the production of documents responsive to broader
requests from other groups had not omitted any documents responsive to the more
specific Request No. 1.  Alexakis Decl.,
¶35.  Alexakis also suggested specific Big
Ten agents as a place to begin the search.  Torres Decl., ¶15; Forman Decl., ¶8; Elliot
Decl., ¶10; Alexakis Decl., ¶35, Exs. 31-32 (AR 638, 980).  
            Torres
conducted searches for responsive documents in Block’s email account, including
searches with all the names Alexakis provided. 
Torres Decl., ¶15.  Because Forman
monitors Jarmond’s work email and the Athletic Department’s general email
inbox, Elliot had her review them for potentially responsive documents.  Elliot Decl., ¶11.  She also checked Jarmond’s work phone for
telephone calls or texts responsive to the request.  Forman Decl., ¶10.  Forman does not have access to Jarmond’s
personal email, but he rarely uses it for work purposes and never used it to
discuss UCLA’s change of conferences. 
Forman Decl., ¶11; Jarmond Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.  Forman and Torres did not limit their search
beyond the restrictions on dates and search terms listed in the request
itself.  See Forman Decl., ¶9;
Torres Decl., ¶20.  
            On
September 2, 2022, Senior Principal Counsel Michael Goldstein, Esq.
(“Goldstein”) asked Aguirre via telephone if he wanted administrative emails
memorializing efforts to schedule meetings about the conference change.  Goldstein Decl., ¶4.  Aguirre confirmed that he did and that he
would file his Petition on September 16 if he was not satisfied with the
progress of Information Practices’s production. 
Goldstein Decl., ¶4.  Goldstein
asked him to wait until September 30, the day Information Practices had
estimated it would finish production, because he believed they could informally
resolve any outstanding issues.  Goldstein Decl., ¶4.  
            Later
that day, Goldstein informed Information Practices that Aguirre wanted records
relating to scheduling of meetings in connection with the UCLA’s decision to
change conferences.  Alexakis Decl., ¶36.  On September 7, Alexakis sent such records to
various team members for review and privilege assessment.  Alexakis Decl., ¶36, Ex. 34 (AR 1317, 1322,
1325).  Alexakis still intended to
release these documents by September 15. 
Alexakis Decl., ¶36, Ex. 34 (AR 1317, 1322, 1325).  
            On
September 12, 2022, upon Alexakis’s request for an update, Elliot told him that
Forman had not found any responsive documents from Jarmond, the only person in
the Department who would have such records. 
Forman Decl., ¶12; Elliot Decl., ¶12, Ex. 32 (AR 941).
            After
the second round of production on September 15, 2022, Goldstein asked Aguirre
if he still planned to file the Petition. 
Goldstein Decl., ¶7.  Aguirre
filed the Petition on September 19 and emailed a POS-15 packet on October
7.  Goldstein Decl., ¶¶ 8-9.
            On
September 23, 2022, Alexakis asked Torres, Elliott, and Forman to search for
records responsive to Request No. 2.  Torres
Decl., ¶18; Forman Decl., ¶13; Elliot Decl., ¶13; Alexakis Decl., ¶¶ 42-43,
Exs. 31-32 (AR 698, 973).  
            In
the letter to Aguirre accompanying production on September 30, 2022, Baldridge
explained that the records review process was taking longer than expected
“almost exclusively” because of Request No. 2. 
Alexakis Decl., ¶45, Ex. 39 (AR 5259). 
UCLA gave a new estimated completion date of October 31, 2022.  Alexakis Decl., ¶45, Ex. 39 (AR 5259).  
            On
October 4, 2022, Elliot told Alexakis that Elliot and Forman had not found any
documents responsive to Request No. 2.  Forman
Decl., ¶14; Elliot Decl., ¶14, Ex. 32 (AR 942).
            On
October 7, 2022, Alexakis reminded Torres to search for records responsive to
Request No. 2.  Torres Decl., ¶19, Ex. 31
(AR 702).  She replied on October 11 that
she had conducted this search during her first review.  Torres Decl., ¶19, Ex. 31 (AR 706).  Alexakis explained that because Aguirre had
filed suit, UCLA needed to cover all bases and ensure it had exhausted every
search possibility.  Torres Decl., ¶19,
Ex. 31 (AR 710).  As for Request No. 1,
he asked Torres to search for correspondence with Warren and Gollahalli.  Torres Decl., ¶19, Ex. 31 (AR 710).  
            On
October 17, 2022, Torres sent Alexakis three more emails she found through
the search terms Alexakis provided. 
Torres Decl., ¶19, Ex. 31 (AR 719). 
Information Practices then produced the last batch of documents to
Aguirre, subject to the attorney-client privilege, the deliberative process
privilege, and exclusion of drafts not retained in the normal course of
business.  Alexakis Decl., ¶49, Ex. 39
(AR 5334).
            Aguirre
asserts the production lacks any financial analysis records as well as
communications to or from Fox Network or UCLA donors.  Forman Decl., ¶15; Jarmond Decl., ¶6.  Torres, Forman, and Jarmond have never seen
any such records.  Torres Decl., ¶21; Forman
Decl., ¶15; Jarmond Decl., ¶6.  
To prepare for his deposition, Alexakis asked Torres,
Elliot, Forman, and Bobby Swerdlow about the processes they used to identify
and collect potentially responsive records after Alexakis asked them to do so
as custodians of records.  Alexakis
Decl., ¶52.  Their answers persuaded him
that they all understood his instructions and performed a thorough, diligent,
vigilant, and competent job.  Alexakis
Decl., ¶52.

Subsequent Communications
            Sometime
after Information Practices completed production, Aguirre requested a Vaughn
Index of all responsive documents Information Practices withheld in whole or
part and under what exemptions.  Alexakis
Decl., ¶55.  Per instructions, Alexakis prepared
a Vaughn-type Index insofar as he made copies of all responsive records with
partial or complete redactions.  Alexakis
Decl., ¶56, Ex. 40 (AR 5337-404).  He
marked each copy with the list of applicable exemptions.  Id. 
            None
of the unredacted body text in the Vaughn Index documents was new to Aguirre.  Alexakis Decl., ¶57.  Any unredacted text was included in one of
the earlier sets of production.  Alexakis
Decl., ¶57.  If a document in the Vaughn
Index was new to Aguirre, Information Practices had completely withheld it for
lack of any non-exempt information.  Alexakis
Decl., ¶57.  
            On
October 5, 2023, Aguirre’s counsel asked for more information about the
attachments to emails in the Vaughn Index because it was not clear that all the
attachments were exempt.  Goldstein
Decl., ¶13.  On October 20, 2023, Goldstein
provided a key of exemptions claimed for each attachment, including when Information
Practices had produced a final version of a withheld draft.  Goldstein Decl., ¶13.  Aguirre never challenged the listed
exemptions or otherwise responded to the Vaughn Index.  Goldstein Decl., ¶14.  
            
            g.
Aguirre’s Additional CPRA Requests 
            Although
Aguirre references a September 15, 2022 CPRA request, Alexakis is unaware of
any such request.  Alexakis Decl.,
¶58.  The September 15 production was all
in response to the CPRA request at issue in this Petition.  Alexakis Decl., ¶58.  
            Aguirre
did not submit another request related to the June 3 announcement until October
4, 2023, when he submitted a new CPRA request. 
Alexakis Decl., ¶53(a).  On
October 30, 2023, Aguirre submitted another new CPRA request.  Alexakis Decl., ¶53(b).  Finally, on November 2, 2023, Aguirre
submitted a third new request.  Alexakis
Decl., ¶53(c).  
            Information
Practices promptly processed all three requests but has not completed all
production thereunder.  Alexakis Decl.,
¶54.

Analysis
            Petitioner
Aguirre seeks to compel the production of records pursuant to his CPRA
request.  He raises issues concerning (a)
the timeliness of UCLA’s response, (b) the reasonableness of its search, and (c)
in camera review.
 
1. The Timeliness of UCLA’s Response
Unless an exemption applies, “each
agency, upon a request for a copy of records, shall, within 10 days from
receipt of the request, determine whether the request in whole or in part,
seeks copies of disclosable public records.”  §7922.500.  Should there be an “unusual circumstance”, the
time limit “may be extended by written notice… [by no] more than 14 days.”
§7922.535.  “Unusual
circumstances” include “[t]he need to search for and collect the requested
records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from
the office processing the request.”  §7922.535(c).  Nothing in the CPRA “shall be construed to
permit an agency to delay or obstruct the inspection or copying of public
records.”  §7922.500.  
“If the agency determines that
the requested records are not subject to disclosure, . . . the agency promptly
must notify the person making the request and provide the reasons for its
determination.”  Filarsky v. Superior
Court, (2002) 28 Cal.4th 419, 426.  A public
agency's “inability or unwillingness to locate and produce [the records] … is
tantamount to withholding requested information from a [CPRA] request.”  Sukumar v. City of San Diego, (2017)
14 Cal.App.5th 451, 466.
Aguirre argues that UCLA’s
response to his Request was untimely. 
The Request was made on July 19, 2022. Within ten days from receipt of
the request – i.e., by July 29, 2022 -- UCLA was required to “determine whether the request, in whole or in part, seeks
copies of disclosable public records in the possession of the agency,” and to
“promptly notify the person making the request of the determination.”  §7922.535.  UCLA failed to meet this legal duty.  Instead, on July 29, 2022, UCLA stated that it
needed “additional time to respond to your request” without stating that it possessed
responsive documents.  Aguirre Decl., ¶10,
Ex. 3 (AR 13).  On August 12, 2022, almost
two weeks after the July 29, 2022 deadline, UCLA told Aguirre that it will be
“able to provide you with the estimated date that responsive documents will be
made available” by September 30, 2022.  Aguirre
Decl., ¶11, Ex. 4 (AR 15-18).  Pet. Op.
Br. at 17.
This argument is untenable for
two reasons.  First, the CPRA provides no
remedy for a claim that the agency’s response was untimely.  City of Gilroy v. Superior Court,
(2023) 96 Cal.App.5th 818, 832.  The sole
remedy is to compel disclosure of unproduced records.  Id. 
Second, UCLA fully complied with
the CPRA’s timing requirements. 
Information Practices issued a ten-day letter on July 29, 2022, which informed
Aguirre that it was extending the deadline for its written determination
another 14 days, until August 12, due to “[t]he need to search for and collect
the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are
separate from the office processing the request.”  Alexakis, Decl., ¶23 (AR 5251).  This letter complied with sections 7922.500 and 7922.535.
Unlike the time limits governing
notification, the CPRA imposes no such fixed time limit on the release of
responsive non-exempt records.  Motorola
Commc’ns & Elecs, Inc. v. Dep’t of Gen. Servs., (1997) 55
Cal.App.4th 1340, 1349.  It provides that
only that the release be made “promptly”, and that the agency provide the
requester with an estimated time of release. 
§7922.535(a).  
On August 12, 2022, Information
Practices provided Aguirre with an estimate that responsive records would be
made available to him on September 30, 2022.  Alexakis Decl., ¶29 (AR 1918).  In the letter accompanying production on
September 30, 2022, Baldridge explained that the records review process was
taking longer than expected “almost exclusively” because of Request No. 2.  Alexakis Decl., ¶45, Ex. 39 (AR 5259).  UCLA gave a new estimated completion date of
October 31, 2022.  Alexakis Decl., ¶45,
Ex. 39 (AR 5259).  This fully complied
with section 7922.535(a).
Finally, Information Practices
began releasing responsive non-exempt records to Petitioner on August 17, 2022,
and there were three more rolling releases of records on September 15,
September 30, and October 17.  On
October 24, Information Practices notified Aguirre that it had no further
responsive non-exempt records to release to him and considered the request
fulfilled.  Alexakis, Decl., ¶50 (AR 5336).  With the exception of a single page inadvertently
not provided until September 22, 2023 (Ex. 18 (AR 331)), the release of records
was completed within 90 days Aguirre’s July 19, 2022 request.[5]  As stated, there is no CPRA time limit for
production of records.  UCLA’s production
of virtually all records within 90 days was eminently reasonable.[6] 
 
2. Reasonableness of the Search
Aguirre argues that UCLA’s search for responsive records was
unreasonable.  The scope of an agency’s
search for public records ‘need only be reasonably calculated to locate
responsive documents.’”  City of San
Jose v. Superior Court, (“City of San Jose”) (2017) 2 Cal.5th 608,
627.  The “CPRA does not prescribe
specific methods of searching for those documents and agencies may develop
their own internal policies for conducting searches.  Some general principles have emerged,
however. Once an agency receives a CPRA request, it must “‘communicate the
scope of the information requested to the custodians of its records,’ although
it need not use the precise language of the request...” Ibid. (citation
omitted).  
To determine if a search was adequate under the CPRA,
California courts apply the standard used in Freedom of Information Act
("FOIA") cases, which provides that a search "need only be
reasonably calculated to locate responsive documents" given the
circumstances.  ACLU supra, 202
Cal.App.4th at 85 (citing Meerepol v. Meese, (“Meerepol”) (D.C.
Cir. 1986) 790 F.2d 942, 951-56. 
"[T]he issue to be resolved is not whether there might exist any
other documents possibly responsive to the request, but rather whether the
search for those documents was adequate" in light of the relevant
circumstances.  Meerepol, supra, 790 F.2d at 951.  An agency's search must be "reasonably
calculated to locate responsive documents." Community Youth Athletic
Center v. City of National City, ("CYAC"), (2013) 220
Cal.App.4th 1385, 1420 (citation omitted). 

The scope of the search is dictated by the scope of the
request.  Id.  "An agency is... obliged to search for
records based on criteria set forth in the search request."  California First Amendment Coalition v.
Superior Court, ("CFAC"), (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 159,
166.  Based on the language of the
request, an agency must "determine whether it has such writings under its
control and the applicability of any exemption." Id. at 166. The
agency's search "should be broad enough to account for the problem that the
requester may not know what documents or information of interest an agency
possesses."  CYAC, supra, 220 Cal.App.4th at 1425 (citation
omitted).  
“Reasonable efforts do not require that agencies undertake
extraordinarily extensive or intrusive searches, however. [Citation.] In
general, the scope of an agency’s search for public records ‘need only be
reasonably calculated to locate responsive documents.’” City of San Jose,
supra, 2 Cal.5th at 627.  The “CPRA
does not prescribe specific methods of searching for those documents. Agencies
may develop their own internal policies for conducting searches.”  Id.
Ultimately, it is the agency's burden to prove the adequacy
of its search by proffering evidence showing its search was reasonably
calculated to locate all responsive records.  Baltranena v. Clinton, 770 F.Supp.2d
175, 182 (D.D.C. 2011); CYAC, 220 Cal.App.4th at 1418 (quoting CFAC,
supra, 67 Cal.App.4th at 167).  An agency can show its search was adequate
with affidavits showing where and how it searched for the records.  Citizens Comm. on Human Rights v. FDA,
((9th Cir. 1995) 45 F.3d 1325, 1328. 
In evaluating the agency's evidence on this issue, courts should
consider "such relevant factors as the amount of time and staff devoted to
the request and whether the agency attempted to limit its search to one or more
places when other sources likely would have contained [the] information
requested." Landmark Legal Foundation v. E.P.A., (D.D.C. 2003) 272
F.Supp.2d 59, 62.
 
a. The Search for the Chancellor’s Records 
Aguirre argues that, although UCLA knew Chancellor Block may
have responsive documents, the search was inadequate because Alexakis did not speak
to Chancellor Block.  Pet. Op. Br. at 17;
Reply at 3.  
This argument is spurious. 
During his deposition, Alexakis testified that he did not speak to
Chancellor Block but he did speak to Block’s office about whether he had any
responsive writings.  Severson Decl.,
¶19, Ex. 25 (AR 509).  He spoke to a
representative, not Block himself.  Ex.
25 (AR 510-11).  He also spoke to
Athletic Director Jarmond’s representative. 
Ex. 25 (AR 511-12).  
Regents’ opposition adds that
Information Practices conveyed the request to the staff member responsible for
the Chancellor’s public email account and also contacted the Executive
Assistant to the Chancellor, who has access to the Chancellor’s other email
accounts.  Alexakis, Decl., ¶9.  The Executive Assistant, in turn,
communicated with the Chancellor and they both participated in the process of
searching for potentially responsive records both in the Chancellor’s office email
accounts, research email account, personal email account, and cell phone.  Torres Decl., ¶¶ 8-9, 13-14, 16, 20.  
Information Practices followed a similar process with
respect to the Athletic Director’s records. 
The staff member who manages the Department’s communications, as well as
the Athletic Director himself, participated in the process of searching for
potentially responsive records both in the Department’s email accounts and in
the Athletic Director’s personal email account and cell phone.  The two worked side-by-side for part of the
process.  Forman, Decl., ¶¶ 8-11;
Jarmond Decl., ¶¶ 3-5. Opp. at 8.  These
efforts were "reasonably calculated to locate responsive documents." CYAC,
supra, 220 Cal.App.4th at 1420.
This effort was reasonable and sufficient.
 
b. Records That Should Exist
Aguirre argues that the public has the right to understand
the extent of communications and what was discussed leading up to UCLA leaving
the Pac-12.  The calendar entries show
meetings, but UCLA has failed to disclose communications from the meetings.  Ex. 13 (AR 103, 107).  UCLA did not produce any records showing the
details of the “careful consideration and thoughtful deliberation” that the
Chancellor and Athletic Director said occurred before the decision to join the
Big Ten was made. UCLA produced no records of communication between UCLA
agents, officers, and employees and Big Ten agents, officers, and employees
regarding the subject of UCLA departing from the Pac-12.  UCLA did not produce records from the Big Ten
personnel who negotiated the agreement with UCLA, especially Big Ten
Commissioner Warren, Big Ten Chief of Staff, Strategy and Operations &
Deputy General Counsel Neuman, and the Big Ten’s Chief Legal Officer &
General Counsel Gollahalli.  Severson
Decl., ¶27.  Pet. Op. Br. at 19.
Neuman admits that he was “instrumental in securing the
historic additions of USC and UCLA to the conference and negotiating the
record-breaking media rights deal with FOX, CBS and NBC.” Ex. 27 (AR 528-33).  Commissioner Warren was the person to whom
the UCLA Chancellor sent the June 30, 2022 application requesting that UCLA be
admitted to the Big-10 Conference.  Ex. 7 (AR 28-30).  Alexakis told UCLA Chancellor assistant
Torres that she should search for the names of Warren, Gollahalli, and Newman.  Ex. 26 (AR  527).  Pet. Op. Br. at 19.
Yet, UCLA officials did not produce any of the following 
records that would relate to the decision to withdraw from the Pac-12
and join the Big Ten: (1) records from Athletic Director Jarmond; (2)
substantive records from Chancellor Block; (3) substantive records to or from
the Big Ten; (4) records to or from Fox Network (Big Ten’s majority owner); (5)
records of communications to or from UCLA major donors such as Nahum Lainer;
(6) financial analysis records; (7) records showing consideration of the pros and
cons including financial advantages or disadvantages; (8) records showing
consideration of the effect on student athletes that would be forced to be away
longer and further from classes and endure traveling between time zones for
games; and (9) records showing any discussion about the ethics or morality of
withdrawing from the Pac-12 on the applicable circumstances.  Severson
Decl., ¶28.  Pet. Op. Br. at 19-20; Reply at 5.
Regents’ opposition correctly
responds (Opp. at 9) that Aguirre does not meet his burden by listing records
that he believes should exist that were not produced.  “[T]he adequacy of a FOIA search is generally
determined not by the fruits of the search, but by the appropriateness of the
methods used to carry out the search.”   Fredericks
v. Superior Court, (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 209, 227 (quoting Duenas
Iturralde v. Comptroller of the Currency, (D.C. Cir. 2003) 354 U.S. App.
D.C. 230 [315 F.3d 311, 315]).  Speculation
that documents should exist does not undermine the determination that the
agency conducted an adequate search for the requested records.  Wilbur v. CIA , (D.C. Cir. 204) 355 F.3d
675, 678. 
Aguirre suggests, but does not
actually argue in his opening brief (see Reply at 4), that the search
was unreasonably truncated.  He notes that
on September 15, 2022 Information Practices produced records found responsive
to another party’s request.  Ex. 13 (AR
51, 66).  Baldridge estimated that this
request incorporated about 90% of Aguirre’s request.  Ex. 13 (AR 51).  Baldridge explained that Information
Practices continued to search for any additional records subject to
release.  Ex. 13 (AR 51).  Aguirre and his attorney never agreed to let
UCLA limit his request to emails between May 1 and July 1, 2022 as the other
party’s request did.  Aguirre Decl.,
¶24.  He also did not agree that its
scope reflected 90% of his request. 
Aguirre Decl., ¶24.  
Aguirre ignores the fact that the search did not stop with
the September 15, 2022 production.  When
Alexakis told Torres and Elliott about Aguirre’s request, he believed that Aguirre’s
Request No. 1 was encompassed within a  request from The Athletic for all
emails Block or Jarmond received or sent, between May 1 and July 1, 2022, about
joining Big Ten.  Alexakis Decl., ¶¶
6(h), 17, 18.  He also chose to briefly
defer action on Aguirre’s Request No. 2 until the custodians had completed
production for requests predating Aguirre’s request.  Alexakis Decl., ¶19.  
However, on August 29, 2022, Alexakis asked Torres and
Elliot to search Block and Jarmond’s email accounts for any records
specifically responsive to Request No. 1. 
Torres Decl., ¶15; Forman Decl., ¶8; Elliot Decl., ¶10; Alexakis Decl.,
¶35, Ex. 31 (AR 631, 941).  Alexakis
wanted to confirm that the production of documents responsive to requests from
other groups had not omitted any documents responsive to Request No. 1.  Alexakis Decl., ¶35.  Alexakis suggested specific Big Ten agents as
a place to begin the search.  Torres
Decl., ¶15; Forman Decl., ¶8; Elliot Decl., ¶10; Alexakis Decl., ¶35, Exs.
31-32 (AR 638, 980).  Forman and Torres
did not limit their search beyond the restrictions on dates and search terms
listed in the request itself.  See Forman
Decl., ¶9; Torres Decl., ¶20.  On
September 23, 2022, Alexakis also asked Torres, Elliott, and Forman to search
for records responsive to Request No. 2. 
Torres Decl., ¶18; Forman Decl., ¶13; Elliot Decl., ¶13; Alexakis Decl.,
¶¶ 42-43, Exs. 31-32 (AR 698, 973).  See
Opp. at 14-15.  The search covered
Aguirre’s entire request.
Aguirre argues that the search terms were artificially
limited.  Severson Decl., ¶¶13-16,  Ex. 26 (AR 520-27).  Pet. Op. Br. at 12; Reply at 3.  The searches incorporated all of Aguirre’s
request and accompanied by specific names. 
Torres, Decl., ¶15; Forman Decl., ¶ 9.  Aguirre fails to explain what was wrong with
the search terms and he never suggested any others.
The court agrees with Regents that the search process was
thorough and complete, perhaps attributable in part to the fact that there were
multiple CPRA requests for essentially the same information.  Aguirre’s contention that records should exist
to and from Athletic Director
Jarmond, Chancellor Block, Big Ten officials, and major UCLA donors ignores the
fact that some records were withheld as exempt. 
As for Aguirre’s belief that there must be records of financial
analysis or communications with the Fox Network or major donors, the custodians
of record testified that they did not see such records.  Torres Decl., ¶21; Forman Decl., ¶15; Jarmond
Decl., ¶6.
 
3. The Public Interest
Aguirre does not challenge any of
the documents in UCLA’s Vaughn Index as not exempt.  He merely argues that there is an overriding
public interest in the role intercollegiate athletics plays in the life of
California’s public universities and its students. This public interest
supersedes any interest in nondisclosure.  “The weight of the public’s interest [in
disclosure] is proportionate to the gravity of governmental tasks sought to be
illuminated and the directness with which the disclosure will serve to
illuminate. The existence and weight of this public interest are conclusions
derived from the nature of the information…[T]he issue is ‘whether disclosure
would contribute significantly to public understanding of government
activities.”  Fredericks v. Superior
Court, supra, 233 Cal.App.4th at 226-28 (reviewing catch-all exemption
of former section 6255).  The public has
a right to know whether UCLA considered the effects longer travel across time
zones will have on the physiological health and academic and athletic
performance of the students.  The public also
has the right to know what financial projections and weighed against the
physical impacts on the student athletes. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 20.
Regents’ opposition correctly notes that the public interest
is irrelevant to disclosure of non-exempt records.  If records are not exempt, they must be
disclosed.  A balancing of public
interests only occurs when the agency is relying on the catch-all exemption of section
7922.000 (formerly §6255) or privileges that rely on the balancing test such as
the deliberative process privilege (Labor & Workforce Development Agency
v. Superior Court, supra, 19 Cal.App.5th at 26-27) and the official
information privilege in section 7927.705 CBS, Inc. v. Block, supra, 42
Cal.3d at 656.
UCLA’s Index withheld 68 pages as
exempt under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, and
deliberative process under section 7927.705. 
Of these, only deliberative process requires a balancing of public
interests.  Aguirre never challenged any
of the records as exempt.  Goldstein
Decl., ¶14.[7]  Nor does he do so in his opening brief.  As a result, Regents never had an obligation
to meet their burden of proof to show withheld documents are exempt.  See §7922.000.  
In reply, Aguirre argues that he
is challenging the exemptions in the purported Vaughn Index.  He argues that the entries are insufficient to
determine whether or not there is a proper basis for asserting attorney-client
privilege and the attorney work product doctrine and the court should order an
adequate privilege log based on those exemptions.  Reply at 6-7.
It is too late for Aguirre to
raise this issue.   New issues raised for the first time in a reply brief are
not properly presented to a trial court and may be disregarded.  Regency Outdoor Advertising v. Carolina
Lances, Inc., (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1333.  Nor can he make a blanket challenge without
articulating which redacted documents he is challenging.
 

            4.
In Camera Review
Aguirre
asks for an in camera review of any records withheld.  Pet. Op. Br. at 20.  To determine a claim of exemption from the
CPRA, the trial court may, but is not required to, examine the disputed records
in camera.  Section 7923.105(a) provides that the court shall decide the
case after examining “the record in camera, if permitted by
subdivision (b) of Section 915 of the Evidence Code,” papers filed
by the parties, and such oral argument and additional evidence as the court may
allow.  Register Div. of Freedom
Newspapers, Inc. v. County of Orange, (1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 893, 900
(citation omitted).  However, the in camera hearing provisions of Evidence Code
section 915(b) are permissive. Id.  Thus, under section 7923.105(a) “in camera inspection of the record in question is
not required as a matter of law, but is trusted to the sound discretion of the
trial court.” Id. (quoting Yarish v. Nelson, (1972)) 27
Cal.App.3d 893, 904). 
There are circumstances where it
is self-evident that the information sought to be protected is covered by the
privilege.  Torres v. Superior Court,
(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 867, 873.  If not,
the party claiming privilege must show in open court why the matter is
privileged or declare that doing so would compromise the privilege.  Id. 
If it appears to the trial court that this claim cannot be determined
without an in camera review, it may call for one.  Id. 
But simply requesting an in camera hearing without explaining why
the privilege applies to the requested information, or declaring that the
agency cannot provide that explanation open court without betraying a
privilege, cannot justify an in camera review.   
Aguirre cannot make a blanket
argument that none of the records withheld are privileged and then ask for an in
camera review.  In camera
review is burdensome for trial courts, “is not a substitute for the
government’s burden of proof, and should not be resorted to lightly.”  ACLU, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th
at 87 (citation omitted).  It should be
invoked only when the issue cannot otherwise be resolved.  Id. (citation omitted).  Additionally, Regents are correct (Opp. at
13-14) that documents withheld for attorney-client privilege, and those records
based on the absolute attorney work product privilege in CCP section
2018.030(a), cannot be reviewed in camera at all.  Evid. Code §915(a). The court declines
to review any withheld records in camera.
 
F.
Conclusion
The
Petition is denied.
