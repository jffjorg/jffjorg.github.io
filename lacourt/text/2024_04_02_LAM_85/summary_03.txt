**Summary of the Case**

* The case is about a petition for a writ of mandate seeking to compel UCLA to disclose public records responsive to Aguirre's CPRA request.

* UCLA acknowledged receipt of the request and promised a response by July 29, 2022.
* UCLA produced three pages of responsive documents on August 17, 2022, which included an application for UCLA to join the Big Ten Conference.
* Aguirre replied on August 23, 2022, requesting a substantial production of documents, which UCLA failed to provide.
* On August 26, 2022, Information Practices Director Robert Baldridge replied that UCLA was still searching for responsive records and that some records were withheld as exempt under the attorney-client privilege or the deliberative process doctrine.
* On August 29, 2022, UCLA's counsel asked for time to review the petition before Aguirre filed it.
* Aguirre agreed to honor this request, and UCLA's counsel promised to include scheduling communications in future productions.
