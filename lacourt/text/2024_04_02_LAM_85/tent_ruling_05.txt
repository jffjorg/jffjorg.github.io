Maria
Chao v. Frank D Lanterman Regional Center, 23STCL01543


 
Tentative decision on demurrer:  sustained 



 
Respondent Frankman D. Lanterman Regional Center (“Regional
Center”) demurs to the Petition filed by Petitioners
Maria Chao and Kua Chao (collectively, the “Chaos”).
The court has read and considered the moving papers (no
opposition was filed) and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. The January 24,
2024 Petition
Petitioner Maria Chao erroneously filed a Notice of
Appeal—Administrative Hearing for Parking on March, 7, 2023.  The operative pleading is the Petition,[1]
filed on January 24, 2024, and naming the Department of Developmental Services
(“DDS”) as the Defendant and Regional Center as Real Party-in-Interest.  The Petition alleges erroneous application of
the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act in determining whether
there will be an adjustment to a claimant’s individual budget.  The Petition alleges in pertinent part as
follows.  
Since February 28, 2013, 13 year-old Milo Chao (“Claimant”) has
had an Individualized Education Program (“IEP”) due to his eligibility for
Regional Center services based on his Autism Spectrum Disorder Diagnosis.  Although Claimant is verbal, he has required a
1:1 aide since preschool because he has very limited communication and lack of
safety skills.  The 1:1 aide has been
funded by the Chaos and reimbursed by the school district. 
On April 1, 2022, Claimant enrolled in the Self
Determination Program (“SDP”) with the Regional Center.  After graduating from elementary school,
Claimant required a different school because he no longer was able to keep up
with general education. 
On June 2, 2022, Claimant’s IEP assessment determined that
he requires 100% special education.  During
the IEP assessment, the parties agreed that a private special education school, Frostig, would be the best fit.  The Chaos then entered into a settlement
agreement[2]
with Los Angeles Unified School District (“LAUSD”) in which the LAUSD attorney
and parent’s attorney confirmed that LAUSD will not pay for a 1:1 aide at non-public
special education schools.  Although non-public
special education schools have higher tuition, they generally have embedded
aides.  Frostig does not include a 1:1
aide that Claimant requires.
In July 2022, Maria Chao asked Regional Center to fund the
1:1 aide through the SDP.  Regional
Center ultimately found a change in circumstance to modify the Chao’s SDP
budget as LAUSD was no longer reimbursing for a 1:1 aide.  However, Regional Center ultimately denied the
request, reasoning that the Chaos had not exhausted the generic resources
available and the school district is legally responsible to provide a 1:1 aide.

The Claimant subsequently appealed Regional Center’s denial
to the Office of Administrative Hearings. 
On December 7, 2022, the Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”)
Erlinda D. Shrenger denied the appeal for Regional Center to fund the 1:1
school aide through the SDP. 
The Petition seeks mandamus compelling Regional Center to
reimburse the Chaos for the 1:1 aide for the 2022-2023 school year in the
amount of $73,000.  The Petition also requests
that (1) the court not dismiss the Petition as Petitioners are moving forward
with appeal, and (2) they be permitted to proceed without an attorney or
guardian ad litem (“GAL”).
 
            2. Course of Proceedings
On March 7, 2023, Mrs. Chao erroneously filed a “Notice of
Appeal—Administrative Hearing,” for a Parking Enforcement Ruling appeal.  None of DDS, the Office of Administrative
Hearings (“OAH”), and Regional Center were named as Defendants/Respondents.  Nor were any “Doe” Defendants/Respondents
named. 
The case was assigned to the Honorable Mark E. Windham in
Department 26.
On April 27, 2023, the court granted Regional Center’s ex
parte application requesting the case be transferred to a Central District
writs and receivers department.  The case
was transferred to this court (Department 85). 
On June 27, 2023, the court held a trial setting conference.
 The court ordered the Chaos to file a
petition as there was only an appeal from a citation on file.  The court noted that the Chaos could not
appear on behalf of Claimant without an appointment as GAL.  The court continued to the Trial Setting
Conference to October 24, 2023 for the Petition to be filed and a GAL appointed.

On October 24, 2023, the court again advised the Chaos that they
could not represent the Claimant without a GAL appointment and a lawyer.  Mr. Chao informed the court that they were seeking
legal representation.  The court informed
the Chaos that the case will be dismissed if a Petition and GAL appointment were
not on file by the next hearing date of February 8, 2024. 
On January 24, 2024, the Chaos filed the Petition,
identifying themselves as “Plaintiff”, DDS as “Defendant”, and Regional Center
as “Real Party of Interest.”  
On February 23, 2024, Regional Center filed the instant demurrer.
 
B. Applicable Law
Demurrers are permitted in administrative mandate
proceedings.  CCP §§1108, 1109.  A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the
pleading alone and will be sustained where the pleading is defective on its
face.
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer or motion to strike or by motion for judgment on the
pleadings.  CCP §430.30(a); Coyne v.
Krempels, (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257.  The
party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may object by
demurrer or answer to the pleading.  CCP
§430.10.  A demurrer is timely filed
within the 30-day period after service of the complaint.  CCP § 430.40; Skrbina v. Fleming Companies,
(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1353, 1364.
A demurrer may be asserted on any one or more of the
following grounds: (a) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the
cause of action alleged in the pleading; (b) The person who filed the pleading
does not have legal capacity to sue; (c) There is another action pending
between the same parties on the same cause of action; (d) There is a defect or
misjoinder of parties; (e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action; (f) The pleading is uncertain (“uncertain” includes
ambiguous and unintelligible); (g) In an action founded upon a contract, it
cannot be ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is
oral, or is implied by conduct; (h) No certificate was filed as required by CCP
§411.35 or (i) by §411.36.  CCP
§430.10.  Accordingly, a demurrer tests
the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer must appear on
the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.  CCP §430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan,
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.  The face of
the pleading includes attachments and
incorporations by reference (Frantz v. Blackwell, (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d
91, 94); it does not include inadmissible hearsay.  Day v. Sharp, (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d
904, 914.  
The sole issue on demurrer for failure to state a cause of
action is whether the facts pleaded, if true, would entitle the plaintiff to
relief.  Garcetti v. Superior Court,
(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1533, 1547; Limandri v. Judkins, (1997) 52
Cal.App.4th 326, 339.  The question of
plaintiff’s ability to prove the allegations of the complaint or the possible
difficulty in making such proof does not concern the reviewing court.  Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty
Co., (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 47.  The
ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all
facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.  Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher,
(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403. 
Nevertheless, this rule does not apply to allegations expressing mere
conclusions of law, or allegations contradicted by the exhibits to the
complaint or by matters of which judicial notice may be taken.  Vance v. Villa Park Mobilehome Estates,
(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 698, 709.
For all demurrers filed after January 1, 2016, the demurring
party must meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed
the pleading for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.  CCP §430.31(a).  As part of the meet and confer process, the
demurring party must identify all of the specific causes of action that it
believes are subject to demurrer and provide legal support for the claimed
deficiencies.  CCP §430.31(a)(1).  The party who filed the pleading must in turn
provide legal support for its position that the pleading is legally sufficient
or, in the alternative, how the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer could be
amended to cure any legal insufficiency. 
Id.  The demurring party is
responsible for filing and serving a declaration that the meet and confer
requirement has been met.  CCP
§430.31(a)(3).  
 
C. Regional Center

Reginal Center is one of 21 regional centers in California,
which are established and operate pursuant to the Lanterman Developmental
Disabilities Services Act (Welfare & Institutions (“W&I”) Code §4500 et seq.) (“Lanterman Act”).  Regional centers are private, non-profit
corporations under contract with DDS to serve as local points of contact for
individuals and families eligible to receive regional center services.  W&I Code §4620 et seq.  
Regional centers are tasked with, among other things,
facilitating and procuring necessary services and support for their clients in
an effort to maximize opportunities and choices for living, working, learning,
and recreating in the community.  W&I
Code §4640.7(a).
With the exception of infants and toddlers up to three years
of age who have certain disabilities, or are at risk of having disabilities,
only those individuals who are determined by a regional center to have a
developmental disability, as defined by the Lanterman Act, are eligible to
receive services from a regional center. 
Govt. Code §§ 95000-95001; W&I Code §4512(a)(1).
Disputes between regional centers and consumers about services
to be included in an Individual Program Plan are resolved through an
administrative appeals process set forth in the Lanterman Act. W&I Code
§4700 et seq.  DDS contracts with OAH to provide independent
hearing officers to conduct these hearings. W&I Code §4712(b).
 
E. Analysis
Real Party Regional Center demurs to the Petition on the
grounds that the Chaos failed to name either OAH or DDS as Respondent on a
timely basis, and (2) they lack standing. 
Dem., p.1.  No opposition is on
file.  
Regional Center has complied with the meet and confer
requirements of CCP section 430.31(a).  Abramowtiz
Decl. ¶2.
 
1. Statute of
Limitations
OAH held the hearing and made the administrative decision in
the underlying Lanterman Act proceeding. 
DDS is the agency which contracts with OAH for that purpose.  At least one of OAH and DDS must be named as
Respondent in a mandamus case seeking review of OAH’s decision.  See Hayes v. California Dept. of
Developmental Services, (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1523, 1531-34.  
Regional Center notes that the initial “Notice of
Appeal-Administrative Hearing did not name DDS or OAH.  The Chaos added DDS as “Defendant” in their
January 24, 2024 Petition.  Pet. at
1.  Although OAH was not added in the
Petition, OAH is not a necessary or indispensable party where DDS is named.  Hayes, supra, 138 Cal.App.4th
at 1531-34. 
Regional Center argues that the January 24, 2024 addition of DDS
was untimely.  Dem., at 8.[3]  Pursuant to the Lanterman Act, either party
may now appeal a decision within 180 days. 
At the time this decision was issued to the Chaos, the correct timeframe
was still 90 days. W&I Code §4712.5(a).[4]  Reginal
Center argues without citation that the effective
date of OAH’’s decision is the date it is first mailed or served.  The OAH Decision was served via certified
mail to the Chaos on the same December 7, 2022 date it was issued.  Regional Center argues that it makes no
difference which limitations period the court uses.  If the court chooses the 90-day time frame
from the time the decision was issued, the last day to appeal would be March 7,
2023.  If the court opts for the new 180-day
period, the Chaos would have had until June 5, 2023.  Either way the January 24, 2024 naming of DDS
was untimely.  Dem. at 8-9. 
Apart from 
failing to cite a statutory authority that OAH’s decision is effective
when mailed or served, Regional Center has no facts in the Petition or matter
subject to judicial notice showing when the OAH decision was sent to the
Chaos.  As a result, this limitations argument
fails.
 
2. Standing
Code of Civil Procedure section 372(a)(1) requires that
minors who are (or should be) parties to an action must appear in a proceeding
either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by a GAL appointed by the court.
 
Regional Center notes that, at both the June 27 and October
24, 2023 Trial Setting Conferences, the court informed the Chaos that one or
both must be appointed as GAL for son’s claim. 
He also had to have a lawyer; the Chaos could not represent him.  
Regional Center demonstrates the latter statement to be the
law.  Dem. at 3, n. 2.  No one but an attorney can represent another
person in court.  Birbrower,
Montalbano, Condon & Frank v. Superior Court, (1998) 17 Cal.4th
119, 127-30.  A GAL is not a party, but
merely a representative of a party who lacks capacity to represent himself or
herself in the proceeding.  J.W. v.
Superior Court, (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 958, 964-65.  A parent appointed as GAL may not act in
pro per but must have a lawyer.  Id.
at 969.
When the Chaos filed the Petition on January 24, 2024, they
sought to proceed without an attorney and not as GALs.  The Chaos are not in compliance with the court’s
directions or the law.  The court does
not have discretion to relieve them of these obligations and they lack standing
to proceed on their own behalf.
 
F. Conclusion
The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
