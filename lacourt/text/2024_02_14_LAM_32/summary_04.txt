And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in response to the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to his request for production of documents. The plaintiff claims that the defendant's responses were overly broad and unduly burdensome, and seeks to compel the production of certain documents related to the defendant's warranty and recall policies.

The court has ordered the defendant to produce seven specific documents, including the "Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual", recall notices and technical service bulletins, documents related to the evaluation of customer requests for repurchase, repair orders and invoices, and communications with dealers and factories. The court has also denied all other requests for further production.

The court has also ordered the defendant to provide supplemental responses within 45 days of the order, and has issued a protective order for the production of documents. The court has denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that both sides acted with substantial justification.
