And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment or adjudication. The controversy surrounding the validity of the contract and assignment is ongoing, despite the Court of Appeal's finding that the contract was unenforceable due to the lack of a valid arbitration agreement. Since both parties agree that the pertinent contracts are void and the defendants have no right to the royalties, judgment should be in favor of the plaintiff. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief regarding the dispute over the royalties, and the judge concludes that there is no present controversy, as the Court of Appeal has already adjudicated the contract as unenforceable.
