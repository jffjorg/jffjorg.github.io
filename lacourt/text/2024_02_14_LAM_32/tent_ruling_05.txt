  order RE:
defendants’ motion for summary judgment
  or adjudication




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On February 10, 2011, plaintiff
Leonard W. Borisoff (“Borisoff”), a composer, filed a complaint against
defendants the Pullman Group, LLC; Wertheim, LLC; David Pullman; and Broadcast
Music, Inc. Defendants prevailed in the compelled arbitration proceeding and
were awarded ownership of Borisoff’s past and future royalties and attorney
fees of $67,866.13. On October 3, 2013, Defendants petitioned the Court to
confirm the award, which the Court did on January 15, 2014, with a final
judgment entered on August 27, 2014. Borisoff appealed the judgment. The Court
of Appeal reversed the judgment. On February 4, 2021, the Currency Corp
(“Plaintiff”) was substituted as Borisoff’s successor in interest after he
passed away in 2020.
            On February 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the operative Second Amended Complaint, alleging (1) fraud, (2) intentional
interference with contract, and (3) declaratory relief against Defendants
Pullman Group, David Pullman, and Wertheim LLC. Plaintiff has since dismissed
the first two causes of action, leaving only declaratory relief.       
On October 27, 2023, Defendants filed the
instant motion for summary judgment or adjudication in the alternative.
Plaintiff filed his opposition on January 19, 2024. Defendants filed their
reply on January 25, 2024. Although the motion initially attacked all three
causes of action, the only dispute remaining is declaratory relief.  
LEGAL STANDARD
“Any person interested under a written
instrument . . . or under a contract . . . may, in cases of actual controversy
relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties, bring an
original action or cross-complaint in the superior court for a declaration of
his or her rights and duties . . . arising under the instrument or contract.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1060.) “Where the allegations of the complaint reveal the
controversy to be conjectural, anticipated to occur in the future, or an
attempt to obtain an advisory opinion from the court, the fundamental basis of
declaratory relief is lacking.” (Brownfield v. Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital
(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 405, 410.) Additionally, “there is no basis for
declaratory relief where only past wrongs are involved.” (Osseous
Technologies of America, Inc. v. DiscoveryOrtho Partners LLC (2010) 191
Cal.App.4th 357, 366.) 
The SAC alleges declaratory relief based
on a dispute “between Plaintiff and all Defendants as to: (l) the validity of
the Contract and Assignment; and (2) the rights to receive Borisoff’s royalties
arising from the Compositions.” (SAC ¶ 43.) Specifically, “Plaintiff contends
that the Transaction Documents are void or voidable by Plaintiff as a result of
their lack of consideration and unconscionability, and by virtue of the conduct
of Defendants.” (Id., ¶ 40.) Additionally, Plaintiff alleges that the
Contract imposes numerous conditions precedent to Defendants obtaining any rights
to Borisoff’s royalties. (Id., ¶ 41.) 
Defendants argue that there is no present
controversy because the Court of Appeal has already adjudicated the Contract as
unenforceable. (Def.’s RJN, Ex. D.) The Court of Appeal found that there was no
valid arbitration agreement because the assignment contract that contained the
arbitration provision was void, and “[c]ourts will not enforce arbitration
awards rendered pursuant to illegal contracts.” (Borisoff v. Pullman Grp.,
LLC (Sep. 1, 2016, No. B259675) 2016 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 6458, at *15-16.)
While the Court agrees that this is the law of the case, there has been no
final judgment to that effect, and thus the controversy is ongoing. Since both
parties agree that the pertinent contracts are void and Defendants have no
right to the royalties, it appears that judgment should be for Plaintiff.
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is DENIED.
