Summary:

The Judge issues a tentative ruling on two motions: a motion to quash a subpoena issued to nonparty Preferred Bank and a motion for relief from waiver of objections and for a protective order. The Judge grants the motion to quash the subpoena, finding that the requests for documents are overbroad and irrelevant to the case. The Judge denies the motion for relief from waiver of objections and protective order, finding that the number of interrogatories propounded by the Defendant is proportionate to the complexity of the case and amount in controversy. The Judge also declines to impose sanctions on either party, finding that they acted with substantial justification.
