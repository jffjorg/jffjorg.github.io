The settlement amounts are $240,000.00 for Ethan Rangel Castillo, $40,000.00 for Briana Zoe Rangel-Castillo, and $40,000.00 for Scarlett Rangel Castillo. The court has found that the settlement is fair and reasonable and has granted the petition.

The court has also approved the attorney's fees and litigation costs, which total $84,000.00, $14,000.00, and $14,000.00, respectively, and $18,713.73 and $3,118.96, respectively.

The court has reviewed the declarations of Victoria L. Ersoff, the attorney for the minor claimants, and has found that the percentage of attorney's fees requested is reasonable.
