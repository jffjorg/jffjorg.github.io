And here is the text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Lyons' Motion to Strike 550 HOA's request for attorney's fees in their Cross-Complaint. Lyons argued that 550 HOA's request for attorney's fees was improper because Lyons had not requested mediation prior to filing their Cross-Complaint. However, the judge found that the management contract between the parties provides for mediation as a condition precedent to arbitration, and that 550 HOA's request for attorney's fees is based on an agreement that allows for it. The judge also found that the issue of whether 550 HOA fulfilled the requirements to be granted attorney's fees may not be subject to a motion to strike as it is an issue of fact.
