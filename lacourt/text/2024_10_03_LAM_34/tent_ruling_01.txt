Minor’s
Compromise (i.e., as to Ethan Rangel Castillo)
 
Legal
Standard
 
Court approval is required
for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
California Rules of Court Rule 7.950 provides that a petition “must be
verified by the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the
compromise.”  (See Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 7.950.)  Rule 7.950 states that the
Petition must be filed on a completed Petition for Approval of Compromise of
Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person With
a Disability (form MC-350).
 
Discussion
 
Petitioner
Ana Miriam Castillo Hernandez ("Petitioner") seeks court
approval of a settlement between minor claimant Ethan Uriel Gallegos (“Ethan”) (DOB:
7/27/21) and Defendants Maria G. Sandor and Luis Sandor (“Defendants”)[1]
in the total amount of $240,000.00. (Petition, ¶ 10.)[2]
Petitioner is Ethan’s parent. 
 
The petition
is executed by Petitioner. The petition explains that starting on July
28, 2021, Ethan was exposed to and ingested deteriorated lead-based
paint and lead contaminated dust from birth since living in the property. (Id.,
¶¶ 4-7.) Ethan also sustained bites from cockroaches and was exposed to other
unhabitable conditions while living in the property. (Ibid.) As a
result, Ethan suffers from attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder,
communication disorder, and chronic toxic stress. (Ibid.) There is no
medical treatment for elevated blood levels at the levels experienced by Ethan.
(Ibid.)
 
The total
amount of attorney’s fees for which court approval is requested is $84,000.00.
(Petition, ¶ 13; Ersoff Decl., Exh. C). This equates to 35% of Ethan’s
total recovery. The total amount of litigation costs and expenses is $18,713.73. (Petition,
¶ 13) Petitioner has attached a declaration from Victoria L. Ersoff,
as well as a copy of the retainer agreement. The court has reviewed the
declaration of Ersoff and believes that 35% is an appropriate
percentage for attorney’s fees here.
 
The net
balance of proceeds for Ethan after payment of all requested fees and expenses
is $137,286.27, which will be deposited in an annuity account at Metropolitan
Tower Life Insurance Company (“Metropolitan”). (Ersoff Decl., Exh. D.) Metropolitan
will make annuity payments to Ethan when he turns 21 and 25. (Id., ¶
