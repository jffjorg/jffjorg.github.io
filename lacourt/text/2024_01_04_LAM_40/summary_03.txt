Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Eric Canton's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint for improper service and dismissal and/or sanctions. The motion was filed by Canton, who claims that the service was improper because it was made on an employee at his place of business, Chris Menjivar, who was not the "managing agent" and was not informed of the contents of the documents being served. However, the judge finds that the service was proper and that the presumption of service applies where service is made through a registered process server. The judge also finds that the substituted service on Chris Menjivar was proper, as Menjivar was a person "apparently in charge" of Canton's place of business and had a relationship with Canton that made it likely that Menjivar would deliver the process to Canton. The judge denies Canton's motion to quash service and dismiss the action.
