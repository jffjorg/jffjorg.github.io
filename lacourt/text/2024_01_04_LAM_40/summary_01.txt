significant_statements:
  - "Terminating sanctions are drastic sanctions that should be imposed sparingly and only when it is clear that the party to be sanctioned has left no viable alternatives."
  - "Discovery sanctions 'should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.'"
  - "Ordering evidence sanctions in these circumstances would provide a windfall to the plaintiffs by relieving them of their burden of proving their theory of liability."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Armen Kavoukjian's motion for terminating sanctions, or, in the alternative, for evidentiary, issue, and monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Bagrat Ogannes in the amount of $10,728.16. The motion was based on alleged discovery abuses by Plaintiff Ogannes, including failure to supplement discovery responses. The judge found that terminating sanctions were not warranted because there were viable alternatives, such as imposing monetary sanctions or issue sanctions. The judge also denied the request for evidence sanctions, finding that they were overbroad and would relieve the Plaintiff of its burden of proving its theory of liability. Finally, the judge denied the request for monetary sanctions, finding that the supplemental discovery responses were facially sufficient and should have been challenged in a motion to compel further responses if necessary.
