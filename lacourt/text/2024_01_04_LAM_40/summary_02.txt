And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to provide further responses to certain discovery requests. The plaintiff, Asaf Raz, is suing General Motors, LLC (GM) for breach of implied and express warranties related to the purchase of a 2023 Cadillac Escalade. The plaintiff alleges that GM failed to bring certain defects in the Vehicle up to warranty and is seeking further discovery to support his claims. The court has found that the discovery requests are relevant and not vague, ambiguous, or oppressive, and that GM has failed to provide adequate responses to the requests. The court has ordered GM to provide supplemental responses and production to the discovery requests within 20 calendar days. The court has also taken note of the parties' engagement in discussions to sign a protective order and has prepared to sign it upon submission.
