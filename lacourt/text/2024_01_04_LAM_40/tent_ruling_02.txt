 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Asaf
  Raz’s Motion to Compel Defendant General Motors LLC, Further Responses to
  Request for Production of Documents, Nos. 1, 3, 9, 17, 31, 37-54, and 62.



 
Background
Pleadings
Plaintiff Asaf Raz sues Defendants General Motors, LLC (GM) and Does 1
through 20 pursuant to an April 25, 2023 Complaint alleging claims of (1)
Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability under The Song-Beverly Act and
(2) Breach of Express Warranty under The Song-Beverly Act.
The claims arise from allegations that on December 7, 2022, Plaintiff
Asaf Raz purchased a 2023 Cadillac Escalade (Vehicle), pursuant to which
Plaintiff received written warranties and other express and implied warranties
from GM, which GM breached after it or its repair facilities failed to bring
certain defects in the Vehicle up to warranty within a reasonable number of
attempts. The Complaint does not appear to list out the defects that were not
conformed to warranty, but does mention a repair visit for “a burning odor, the
illumination of the ‘Check Engine’ warning light, the engine violently
shaking[,] and recall #N222384930 to address the ‘Trailer Brake Control
Switch.’”
Motion Before the Court
On July 7, 2023, Plaintiff Raz
served Defendant GM with a set of Requests for Production of Documents, Set One
(1) (RPDs, Set One).
On August 7, 2023, GM served
unverified discovery responses to RPDs, Set One.
On August 17, 2023, Plaintiff Raz’s
counsel sent GM’s counsel a meet and confer letter highlighting what
Plaintiff’s counsel perceived as deficiencies with each discovery item at
issue.
On August 24, 2023, GM’s counsel
sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff’s counsel indicating that GM stood
by its objections and responses. The letter proposes that the parties enter
into a proposed stipulated protective order and privilege log agreement
regarding production of information subject to privileges.
On August 29, 2023, GM verified its
discovery responses to RPDs, Set One.
That same day, Plaintiff’s counsel
called GM’s counsel to further meet and confer, but the call was not answered
nor was the voicemail Plaintiff’s counsel left responded to by GM’s counsel.
On October 3, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel again left a voicemail for GM’s counsel with no response from GM’s
counsel.
On October 17, 2023, Plaintiff Raz
filed a motion to compel Defendant GM to provide further responses to RPDs, Set
One, Nos. 1, 3, 9, 17, 31, 37-54, and
62. The motion does not seek monetary sanctions.
On December 19, 2023, GM opposed
Plaintiff’s motion.
On December 22, 2023, Plaintiff
replied to GM’s opposition.
Plaintiff’s motion is now before
the Court.

Motion to Compel Further Responses to Production Request

Legal Standard
A motion to compel a further
response is used when a party gives unsatisfactory answers or makes untenable
objections to interrogatories, demands to produce, or requests for admission.
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)
To request further production, a
movant must establish: (1) good cause for the production (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1); Sinaiko, supra, at p. 403); and (2) that
a further response is needed because (a) the responding party’s statement of
compliance with the demand to produce is incomplete Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b) the responding party’s representation that it is unable
to comply is inadequate, complete, or evasive (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (a)(2)), (c) the responding party’s objection in the response is without
merit or is too general (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina
Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or
(d) if the responding party objected to the production of ESI on the ground
that it is not reasonably accessible the movant can show that the (i) ESI is
reasonably accessible or (ii) there is good cause for production of the ESI
regardless of its accessibility (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (e)).
Order Compelling Further
Production: GRANTED.
In his motion, Plaintiff Raz argues
that “[a]s shown in [his] … Separate Statement, [GM]’s response to Request Nos.
1, 3, 9, 17, 31, 37-54, and 62 are incomplete and/or the corresponding
production is deficient. (Mot., pp. 5-6.)
GM’s separate statement summarizes
each production request at issue, the objections and/or responses thereto, and
the reasons why a further response is merited. (Mot., Separate Statement, pp.
2-32.)
In opposition, GM argues that this
motion should be denied because Plaintiff’s counsel did not meet and confer in
good faith insofar as Plaintiff’s counsel never made an attempt to
substantively address GM’s concerns as to the production at issue. GM also
argues in favor of its objections and responses but notes that GM has offered
to produce responsive documents to all the production requests at issue,
insofar as they concern Plaintiff’s Escalade, and subject to the entry of a
stipulated LASC Model Protective Order. GM otherwise argues that production
related to Request No. 9 is not entirely necessary and is unnecessary as to
Request Nos. 37-54 and 62. GM last argues that the production requests seek
trade secrets belonging to GM. GM closes by asking that, if any portion of this
motion is granted, it should be contingent on the execution of a protective
order. (Opp’n, pp. 3-9.)
GM’s separate statement summarizes
each production request at issue, the objections and/or responses thereto, and
the reasons why a further response is not merited. (Opp’n, Separate Statement,
pp. 1-31.)
In reply, Plaintiff Raz argues that
the meet and confer efforts as to this motion were sufficient. Plaintiff also
argues that the documents sought in the requests at issue are relevant and
discoverable and good cause exists for their production. Last, Plaintiff argues
that GM failed to timely assert and substantiate its confidentiality and trade
secret claims when it opposed Plaintiff’s discovery motion. (Reply, pp. 2-7.)
The Court finds in favor of Plaintiff.
The propounded
discovery here is relevant and not vague, ambiguous, or, in light of the
subject matter at hand, oppressive. “‘If the buyer establishes that [a]
failure to comply [with the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (SBA)] was
willful, the judgment may include, in addition to the amounts recovered under
subdivision (a), a civil penalty which shall not exceed two times the amount of
actual damages.’ (§ 1794, subd. (c).)” (Santana v. FCA U.S. LLC (2020)
56 Cal.App.5th 334, 346.) “In regard to the willful requirement of Civil
Code section 1794, subdivision (c), a civil penalty may be awarded if the jury
determines that the manufacturer ‘knew of its obligations but intentionally
declined to fulfill them. ….’” (Schreidel v. American Honda Motor Co.
(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1249-1250, citations omitted; see also Bishop v.
Hyundai Motor Am. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 750, 759 [Defendant agreed that
jury was properly instructed that it “‘acted ‘willfully’ if [the jury]
determine[d] that [defendant] knew of its obligations under the Song-Beverly
Act but intentionally declined to fulfill them”].)
The document requests here could
influence a determination on whether GM was aware of a defect in the Vehicle
that should have compelled GM to replace or repurchase the Vehicle. Even the
requests related to other vehicles are discoverable because if those documents
show that a component of the Vehicle was defective, as gleaned from reports
from other vehicles, and GM was aware of that defect but failed to repurchase
or replace the Vehicle, then civil penalties may be in order. (See Mot.,
Separate Statement, RPD Nos. 37-54.)
The Court notes that the parties are
engaged, to whatever degree, in discussions to sign a protective order, with GM
advancing the proposed order as a condition of production of documents
otherwise subject to privileges or other protections (trade secrets). Plaintiff
contends in its Reply brief that such protective order has been signed, and the
Court is prepared to sign it upon submission to the Court. 
If GM can only provide a limited
response or limited production, it behooves GM to more clearly make that
representation in any supplemental response to this discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.210, et seq.)
Plaintiff’s motion is therefore GRANTED.

Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Nos. 1, 3, 9, 17, 31,
