 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant Armen
  Kavoukjian’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions, or, in the Alternative, for
  Evidentiary, Issue and Monetary Sanctions Against Plaintiff, Bagrat Ogannes
  of $10,728.16.



 
Background
Pleadings and Other Actions
Plaintiffs Bagrat Ogannes, Giorgi
Imnaishvili, and Tigran Hakobyan initiated this action (Instant Action) on
August 17, 2021, alleging a single claim of malicious prosecution against Defendant Armen Kavoukjian and Does 1 through
100.
The claim arose from allegations
that on October 6, 2015, Kavoukjian and his company, GreenEden, LLC (GreenEden)—alleged
as an alter ego of Kavoukjian—initiated LASC No. BC596896 (Underlying Action)
against Plaintiffs in the instant action, with Plaintiffs ultimately receiving
judgment in their favor on or about February 20, 2019, thus comprising an
action brought as malicious prosecution against Plaintiffs without probable
cause.
On October 14, 2021, in the Instant
Action, Plaintiffs requested the dismissal of Giorgi Imnaishvili and Tigran
Hakobyan as Plaintiffs. Thereafter, on November 8, 2021, Plaintiff Ogannes
filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) that retained the same factual
allegations supporting the malicious prosecution claim against Defendant
Kavoukjian and Does 1 through 100.
On April 12, 2022, Defendant
Kavoukjian filed a notice of related case, seeking to relate this action to
LASC No. 20STCV07228—initiated in Department 34—in which Plaintiff Ogannes, as
well as Giorgi Imnaishvili and Tigran Hakobyan, alleged a single claim of
malicious prosecution against Kavoukjian, Haruntin Kassakhian, GreenEden, LLC,
and Does 1 through 100. The claim arose from the same factual allegations as
this action.
On April 14, 2022, Department 34
issued an order relating this action and 20STCV07228.
On April 26, 2022, Kavoukjian made
a peremptory strike to the bench officer in 20STCV07228, which Department 34
granted on April 27, 2022.
On May 3, 2022, Department 1 kept
the two actions as related cases and reassigned them for all purposes to
Department 40.
Relevant Procedural History
As set forth in the motion, on May
16, 2022, Defendant Kavoukjian propounded on Plaintiff Ogannes Form
Interrogatories – General, Set One (FROGs, Set One), Special Interrogatories,
Set One (SROGs, Set One), and Requests for Production, Set One (RPDs, Set One).
On August 22, 2022, after
extensions from Defendant Kavoukjian, Plaintiff Ogannes served his responses
via mail, which were unverified.
On September 28, 2022, Kavoukjian’s
counsel notified Ogannes’ counsel that the responses were unverified,
requesting an extension of time to file motions to compel further discovery,
with Ogannes’ counsel promising to provide verifications and granting an
extension through November 17, 2022.
On August 22, 2022, Ogannes’
counsel provided verifications for the discovery responses.
On November 4, 2022, Kavoukjian’s
counsel sent correspondence to Ogannes’ counsel outlining the deficiencies of
the discovery responses—e.g., boilerplate and non-meritorious objections—and
requesting supplemental responses.
On November 15, 2022, Ogannes’
counsel agreed to serve supplemental responses by January 16, 2023 and allowed
Kavoukjian to file compel-further motions through December 21, 2022. Further
extensions were granted to Plaintiff’s counsel to provide supplemental
responses based upon his absence from the office on December 8, 2022, and
January 24, 2023. It was agreed that Plaintiff Ogannes would supplement
discovery responses by February 28, 2023, with failure to do so resulting in
Defendant Kavoukjian filing motions to compel, to be filed no later than March
30, 2023.
Plaintiff Ogannes ultimately failed
to supplement responses to the May 16, 2022 discovery.
As a result, on March 30, 2023,
Defendant Kavoukjian filed motions to compel further responses to FROGs, Set
One, SROGs Set One, and to compel further production on RPDs, Set One.
The motions were ultimately
unopposed by Plaintiff Ogannes.
On June 12, 2023, the Court granted
Defendant Kavoukjian’s motions in full, ordering Plaintiff Ogannes to (1) provide
further responses and/or production to FROGs, Set One, SROGs, Set One, and
RPDs, Set One, within 30 days of June 12, 2023, and (2) remit payment of $4,850
to Defendant Kavoukjian within 30 days of June 12, 2023.
On June 13, 2023, Defendant
Kavoukjian’s counsel served a notice of ruling on Plaintiff Ogannes’ counsel.
On July 12 and 14, 2023, Plaintiff
Ogannes supplemented his responses and/or production to FROGs, Set One, SROGs
Set One, and RPDs, Set One.
On August 16, 2023, Defendant
Kavoukjian’s counsel emailed a letter to Plaintiff’s counsel explaining
Plaintiff’s alleged willful disobedience of the Court’s June 12, 2023 order and
informing Plaintiff’s counsel of Defendant Kavoukjian’s intention to file the
instant motion seeking terminating and other sanctions.
On August 23, 2023, Plaintiff
Ogannes’ counsel’s paralegal informed Defendant Kavoukjian’s counsel that
supplemental responses would be provided by the following week.
On September 6, 2023, Plaintiff
Ogannes’ counsel received a letter promising supplemental responses by
September 29, 2023.
On September 29, 2023, Plaintiff
Ogannes’ counsel served a second set of supplemental responses and/or
production to FROGs, Set One, SROGs Set One, and RPDs, Set One.
On October 3, 2023, Plaintiff
Ogannes’ counsel served a corrected second set of supplemental responses and/or
production to FROGs, Set One, SROGs Set One, and RPDs, Set One.
Motion Before the Court
On December 7, 2023, Defendant
Kavoukjian filed a motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff Ogannes
for continued discovery abuses, including continued failure to provide adequate
discovery responses and disobedience of this Court’s June 12, 2023 order
through such failure.
Defendant Kavoukjian’s motion is
unopposed by Plaintiff Ogannes and is now before the Court. The proof of
service attached to the motion appears facially valid.
 
Motion for Sanctions
Legal
Standard
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 permits California courts to impose
terminating, evidence, issue, and monetary sanctions for discovery misuses,
which are defined by section 2023.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Misuses
of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following:
(a)
Persisting, over objection and without substantial justification, in an attempt
to obtain information or materials that are outside the scope of permissible
discovery.
(b)
Using a discovery method in a manner that does not comply with its specified
procedures.
(c)
Employing a discovery method in a manner or to an extent that causes
unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and
expense.
(d)
Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.
(e)
Making, without substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to
discovery.
(f)
Making an evasive response to discovery.
(g)
Disobeying a court order to provide discovery.
(h)
Making or opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a
motion to compel or to limit discovery.
(i)
Failing to confer in person, by telephone, or by letter with an opposing party
or attorney in a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve informally any
dispute concerning discovery, if the section governing a particular discovery
motion requires the filing of a declaration stating facts showing that an
attempt at informal resolution has been made.
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (a)-(i); see, e.g., Vallbona v. Springer
(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545 [court imposed evidence sanctions when defendants
misused discovery process by not responding to authorized method of discovery];
In re Marriage of Eustice (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1291, 1308-1309 [respondent
was sanctioned for willfully violating order to produce accounting and
financial documents].)
Terminating
sanctions are drastic sanctions that should be imposed sparingly and only when
it is clear that the party to be sanctioned has left no viable alternatives.
(See Dept. of Forestry & Fire. Prot. v. Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th
154, 191 (Dept. of Forestry), disapproved on other grounds in Presbyterian
Camp & Conf. Ctrs, Inc. v. Superior Court (2021) 12 Cal.5th 493; Lopez
v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc’y (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.)
The
court should consider the totality of the circumstances before ordering
terminating sanctions, including (1) whether the conduct of the party was
willful, (2) the detriment to the party propounding discovery, and (3) the
number of formal and informal attempt to obtain the discovery. (Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390.) The Court is
not required to find that a party acted in bad faith before imposing
terminating sanctions. (See Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18
Cal.App.5th 690, 703.)
Discovery
sanctions “should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that
which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied
discovery.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793.) Moreover,
“[d]iscovery sanctions must be tailored in order to remedy the offending party’s
discovery abuse, should not give the aggrieved party more than what it is
entitled to, and should not be used to punish the offending party.” (Karlsson
v. Ford Motor Co. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1202, 1217.) An order imposing
discovery sanctions is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. (New
Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1422.) The
court’s inherent power to curb abuses and promote fair process extends to the
preclusion of evidence. (Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. v. Superior Court
(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 272, 288.) 
Order
Granting Terminating Sanctions or Evidence, Issue, and Monetary Sanctions: DENIED.
I. Terminating Sanctions
Here,
the Court finds that, even if the Court had found that a misuse of the
discovery process had occurred, terminating sanctions would be premature.
Viable alternatives exist meriting a denial of the terminating sanctions
portion of Defendant Kavoukjian’s motion. (18 Cal.App.5th at p. 191.) For
example, the Court could impose monetary sanctions, issue, and/or evidence
sanctions, thereby applying an incremental approach to sanctions. (Lopez v.
Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604 [discovery statutes evince an incremental approach, starting with
monetary sanctions and ending with ultimate terminating sanction].)
Terminating
sanctions are thus DENIED.
II. Issue and/or Evidence Sanctions
The
Court also finds insufficient grounds for issue and evidence sanctions.
A. Issue Sanctions
Issue
sanctions are not proper because they are not sufficiently particularized to
the relief sought from the Court.
Issue
sanctions are proper only where they involve matters that the discovering party
had tried to prove through the impeded discovery and were properly tailored to
the specific harm caused by such withheld discovery. (Vallbona v. Springer
(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1548.) A trial court can correctly implement such a
sanction by instructing the jury that various facts should be taken as
established against a party. (See Ibid.)
Defendant
Kavoukjian seeks issue sanctions to the effect that it be taken as true that
(1) Kavoukjian is not and never was the “alter ego” of GreenEden, (2) Kavoukjian
has no personal liability for the debts and obligations of GreenEden, (3) Kavoukjian
did not prosecute the Underlying Action with malice, (4) the Underlying Action
was brought and prosecuted with probable cause, and (5) Plaintiff Ogannes has
not sustained injury or damages because of Kavoukjian’s conduct in connection
with the Underlying Action. (See Mot., p. 10.)
Such
requests are not sufficiently particularized to the specific harm suffered by Defendant
Kavoukjian through Plaintiff Ogannes’ alleged withholding of relevant
discovery—here, the alleged defective supplemental and second supplemental
responses to FROGs, Set One, SROGs Set One, and RPDs, Set One. Instead, Defendant
Kavoukjian seeks an order ordering five broad issue sanctions that completely
undercut Plaintiff’s ability to make a dispositive argument as to Defendant Kavoukjian’s
alter ego or malicious prosecution liability. (See discussion Section II.B.
infra; see FAC, ¶¶ 3, 8-9, 10-17.) In no way does Defendant Kavoukjian’s
briefing explain how Plaintiff’s alleged withholding of discovery as to each
individual interrogatory and production request supports one or more of the
five issue sanctions proposed by Defendant Kavoukjian. Neither do the points
and authorities group each of the nearly 150 discovery requests at issue here
into five cohesive groups that support one or more of the five broad issue
sanctions sought by Defendant Kavoukjian. In short, Defendant Kavoukjian’s
sought relief is overbroad.
Issue
sanctions are thus DENIED.
B. Evidence Sanctions
Evidence
sanctions are not proper because the evidence sanctions sought by Defendant
Kavoukjian result in an avoidance of a decision on the merits by relieving Defendant
Kavoukjian of the burden of proving a defense to Plaintiff’s claims.
The
operative First Amended Complaint alleges a single claim of malicious
prosecution against Defendant Kavoukjian for instituting the Underlying Action
against Plaintiff Ogannes alongside Kavoukjian’s company, GreenEden, LLC, with
the Underlying Action ultimately resolved in Plaintiff Ogannes’ favor. (FAC, ¶¶
1-6, 8-9, 10-17.)
“[T]he
tort of malicious prosecution … consists of the following elements: “[A]
plaintiff must demonstrate ‘that the prior action (1) was commenced by or at
the direction of the defendant and was pursued to a legal termination in his,
plaintiff’s, favor [citations]; (2) was brought without probable cause
[citations]; and (3) was initiated with malice [citations].’” [Citations.].” (Dalany
v. American Pacific Holding Corp. (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 822, 827.)
California
courts have found that it is not an abuse of discretion for a judge to refuse
to impose evidence sanctions against a defendant and to instead impose monetary
sanctions, when the evidence sanctions sought by the plaintiffs are sweeping
evidentiary conclusions that are at the heart of their theory of the
defendant’s liability. (Rutledge v Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238
Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194 (Rutledge).) Ordering evidence sanctions in these
circumstances would provide a windfall to the plaintiffs by relieving them of
their burden of proving their theory of liability. Such an order would also be
contrary to the purpose of discovery sanctions, which is not avoidance of a
decision on the merits. (Ibid.)
Defendant
Kavoukjian seeks evidence sanctions prohibiting Plaintiff Ogannes from
introducing evidence against Defendant Kavoukjian to the effect that (1)
Kavoukjian is or was the “alter ego” of GreenEden, (2) Kavoukjian is liable for
the debts and obligations of GreenEden, (3) Kavoukjian prosecuted the
Underlying Action with malice, (4) the Underlying Action was brought and
prosecuted without probable cause, and (5) Kavoukjian is liable for any damage Plaintiff
Ogannes attributes to the Underlying Action. (See Mot., p. 11.)
Such
evidence sanctions are overbroad because they restrict wholesale Plaintiff’s
ability to tie Defendant Kavoukjian to any liability that GreenEden had in
instituting the Underlying Action or to prove vital elements of malicious
prosecution—probable cause, malice, and damages – without tying the evidence sanctions
to the prejudice suffered as a result of the discovery not received. 
Evidence
sanctions are thus DENIED.
III. Monetary Sanctions
The
Court also DENIES monetary sanctions.
To
the extent that sanctions are sought based on the merit of terminating, issue,
or evidence sanctions, such sanctions have been denied and cannot support the
requested monetary sanctions.
To
the extent that Defendant Kavoukjian argues that the supplemental discovery is
unresponsive, the Court finds that the supplemental responses are facially
sufficient and should have been challenged in a motion to compel further
responses if Defendant felt there was additional information that should have
been compelled.
The
Court further notes that the 316-page PDF of Defendant’s Separate Statement in
this case is overlong and violates the California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345
in numerous ways. The first 12 pages are simply argument and thereby an
extension of the brief, violating the purpose both of the page limits for motions
and the utility of a separate statement to set forth in one document the requests,
responses, and reasons to compel additional information or issue sanctions. It
attaches various documents such as notices of ruling and meet and confer
correspondence that should have been attached to the attorney’s declaration. Most
significantly, Defendant’s brief fails to set forth the real nature of the
problems with the supplemental responses, instead referring the Court to the
correspondence and the separate statement for the “detail.” (Memorandum at page
4.) That does not fulfill counsel’s duty of explaining the inadequacies to the
Court, rather than asking the Court to scroll through the over 300 page long
document to see what the purported deficiencies are. 

Conclusion
Defendant Armen Kavoukjian’s Motion
for Terminating Sanctions, or, in the Alternative, for Evidentiary, Issue and
Monetary Sanctions Against Plaintiff, Bagrat Ogannes of $10,728.16 is DENIED.
