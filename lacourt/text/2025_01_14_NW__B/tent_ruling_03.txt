  FILED: MAY 25, 2022
TRIAL
  DATE: FEBRUARY 18, 2025



 
I.      
BACKGROUND  
This case is a personal injury action. Plaintiff Mehdi
Rostamian (“Plaintiff”) alleges that, on or about September 7, 2021, the
Pitbull dog of Defendants Mehrdad Dardashti (“Defendant”) and Mahyar Dardashti
(“Mahyar”) suddenly and without notice lunged at and bit Plaintiff’s leg,
causing Plaintiff to sustain serious injuries.
On May 25, 2022, Plaintiff
filed a complaint against Defendants Mehrdad, Mahyar, and Does 1 to 50,
alleging three causes of action: (1) strict liability pursuant to Cal. Civ.
Code § 3342; (2) strict liability for injury caused by domestic animal with
dangerous propensities; and (3) negligence.
On October 29, 2024, Defendant
Mehrdad Dardashti filed the instant motion for leave to reopen discovery.
On December 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed their opposition.
On January 7, 2025, Defendant filed their reply.
A jury trial is scheduled for February 18, 2025.

LEGAL STANDARDS

“On
motion of any party, the court may grant leave to complete discovery
proceedings, or to have a motion concerning discovery heard, closer to the
initial trial date, or to reopen discovery after a new trial date has been
set.  This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040.”  (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2024.050(a).) 
“In
exercising its discretion to grant or deny this motion, the court shall take
into consideration any matter relevant to the leave requested, including, but
not limited to, the following: (1) The necessity and the reasons for the
discovery. (2) The diligence or lack of diligence of the party seeking the
discovery or the hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons that the
discovery was not completed or that the discovery motion was not heard earlier.
(3) Any likelihood that permitting the discovery or hearing the discovery
motion will prevent the case from going to trial on the date set, or otherwise
interfere with the trial calendar, or result in prejudice to any other
party. (4) The length of time that has elapsed between any date previously
set, and the date presently set, for the trial of the action.” (CCP §
2024.050(b)(1)-(4).)   
“The
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to extend or to reopen discovery, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP §
2024.050(c).)
 
III.      
DISCUSSION

 Meet and Confer Requirement
            On
October 16, 2024, defense counsel contacted Plaintiff’s counsel asking if
Plaintiff would stipulate to the limited depositions of Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s experts. (Gerber Decl. ¶ 32; Exh. 23 [meet and confer].) Plaintiff’s
counsel would not agree to the stipulation. (Ibid. at ¶ 33; Exh. 23.)
Therefore, the Court finds that Defendant satisfies the meet and confer
requirement of CCP § 2024.050(a).
 
Good Cause
            Defendant
moves for leave to reopen discovery to take one-hour depositions from Plaintiff
and his experts on the issue of damages. (Motion p. 1:3-14.) Defendant claims
that he was previously prevented from obtaining this discovery due to prior
defense counsel’s health issues. (Motion p. 1:7-9; Gerber Decl. ¶ 37.) Defendant
argues the necessity of these depositions because Plaintiff alleges continued
pain and suffering. (Gerber Decl. ¶ 36.) Defendant does not request a continuance
for trial. (Gerber Decl. ¶ 40.)
            Trial
in this matter has been continued many times. On November 13, 2023, Defendant
filed an ex parte application to continue the trial due to defense counsel’s
health issues. (Mullen Decl. ¶ 6.) The Court granted a brief continuance to
December 20, 2023, but noted that discovery remained closed. (Ibid.) On
December 5, 2023, Defendant moved ex parte to reopen discovery. (Ibid. at
¶ 7.) The Court denied the motion but granted another continuance to January 23,
2024, to accommodate defense counsel’s health issues. (Ibid.) On January
8, 2024, Defendant again moved ex parte to continue the trial date. (Ibid. at
¶ 8.) The Court denied Defendant’s motion. (Ibid.) On January 17, 2024,
Defendant noticed reassignment of lead counsel. (Ibid. at ¶ 9.) On the
Court’s own motion, the trial was continued to February 20, 2024. (Ibid.
at ¶ 10.) Due to witness scheduling conflicts, the parties stipulated to
continue trial to March 25, 2024. (Ibid. at ¶ 11.) The Court granted
continuance, again noting that discovery remained closed. (Ibid.) On its
own motion, the Court continued trial to July 10, 2024. (Ibid. at ¶ 12.)
On July 10, 2024, the trial was continued to November 18, 2024. (Ibid. at
¶ 15.) At the November 8, 2024, final status conference, defense counsel
represented that his client was in Israel and would not be able to attend the
November 18, 2024, trial. (Ibid. at ¶ 18.) Trial was continued to the
current trial date of February 18, 2025. (See November 8, 2024, Minute
Order.) The Court stated that discovery was to remain closed. (Ibid.)
            Here,
despite the instant action’s many trial continuances, Defendant lacked
diligence in obtaining discovery or obtaining leave to reopen discovery. On
October 10, 2023, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s deposition but never took it. (Gerber
Decl. ¶¶ 8 and 10.) Defendant fails to explain why Plaintiff’s deposition never
occurred. Discovery has been closed since October 20, 2023. Prior to this
application, which was made less than three weeks before the November 18, 2024,
trial date, Defendant never sought to depose Plaintiff’s experts. (Mullen Decl.
¶ 4.) In fact, on July 8, 2024, defense counsel indicated that no further
discovery was necessary since “all the discovery in the world” would not change
Defendant’s insurance policy limits. (Savo Decl. ¶ 14; Exh. A [July 8, 2024,
correspondence].) While prior defense counsel struggled with health issues, the
Court continued trial in December 2023 so Defendant could obtain new
counsel. (See December 6, 2023, Minute Order.) Defendant retained new
lead counsel in January 2024. (Mullen Decl. ¶ 9.) Defendant provides no
explanation for their failure to request the reopening of discovery in the
interim nine months. Furthermore, despite having knowledge of the November 18,
2024, trial date since July 10, 2024, Defendant flew to Israel on November 3,
2024. (Dardashti December 2, 2024, Decl. ¶ 3.) While the Court is sympathetic
to Defendant’s family and friends who have been impacted by the region’s
hostilities, Defendant, in his untimely declaration regarding the same, fails
to explain why he had to travel just a few weeks before another continued
trial date. He further fails to explain why he did not inform the Court of his
travels until the final status conference on November 8, 2024. 
            This
case has been pending for over three years. In considering a request to reopen
discovery, the Court considers the “diligence or lack of diligence of
the party seeking the discovery . . . and the reasons that the discovery was
not completed or that the discovery motion was not heard earlier.” (CCP §
2024.050(b)(2).) Here, Defendant shows an unexplained lack of diligence in
timely seeking the reopening of discovery. Conversely, Plaintiff,
who has been prepared for trial since November 2023, would be greatly
prejudiced if discovery were reopened weeks before another continued
trial date.
 
IV.   
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons,
Defendant’s motion for leave to reopen discovery is DENIED. 
It is so ordered. Moving party to
give notice.
