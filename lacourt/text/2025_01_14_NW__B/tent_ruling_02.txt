COMPLAINT
  FILED: FEBRUARY 23, 2022
TRIAL
  DATE: FEBRUARY 18, 2025



 
I.      
BACKGROUND  
On February 23, 2022,
Plaintiff Yu Chol Kim (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Defendants RD America, LLC (“RD America”), Jetro Cash & Carry
(“Jetro”), and Does 1 to 20 (collectively “Defendants”) alleging one cause of
action for premises liability. The complaint arises from a March 9, 2020,
incident, where Plaintiff claims to have incurred injuries and damages after
slipping and falling on a piece of fruit on Defendants’ premises.
On December 27, 2022, Plaintiff filed their first amended
complaint (“FAC”) adding a cause of action for general negligence.
On March 22, 2024, RD America filed
the instant motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s FAC.
On December 30, 2024,
Plaintiff filed their opposition. 
RD America has not filed a reply.
 
II.      
MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
RD America moves for summary
judgment on Plaintiff’s FAC on the grounds that neither RD America nor its
employees created or had actual or constructive notice of the alleged dangerous
condition upon which Plaintiff bases his causes of action for general
negligence and premises liability. (Motion p. 2:8-11.)
 
III.      
LEGAL
STANDARDS 
Burden on Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication 
In reviewing a motion for
summary judgment, the Court must apply a three-step analysis: (1) identify the
issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has met
his or her initial burden; and (3) determine whether the opposition has
demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue. (Hinesley
v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) “[T]he
initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that
there are no triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf v. D.B. Log Homes,
Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for summary
judgment or summary adjudication has met his or her burden of showing that a
cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements
of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete
defense to the cause of action.” (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 437c(p)(2).) 
A moving defendant may
satisfy the initial burden to show that one or more elements cannot be
established by “presenting evidence that conclusively negates an element of the
plaintiff's cause of action or by relying on the plaintiff's factually devoid
discovery responses to show that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot
reasonably obtain, evidence to establish that element.” (Schmidt v.
Citibank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 1109, 1119; Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 856 [it is insufficient for the
defendant to merely point out the absence of evidence.]; Gaggero v. Yura
(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884, 891.) “The defendant must present evidence,
typically in the form of factually devoid discovery responses, showing that
plaintiff does not have and cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support his or
her claim.” (Ibid.) 
Unless and until a defendant
meets that burden, the plaintiff has no burden to present controverting
evidence. (Consumer Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454,
468 [“There is no obligation on the opposing party . . . to establish anything
by affidavit unless and until the moving party has by affidavit stated facts
establishing every element . . . necessary to sustain a judgment in his
favor.”].) If a defendant fails to meet that burden, summary judgment must be
denied, even if the plaintiff fails to file an opposition and fails to proffer
any evidence. 
On the other hand, if the
defendant “has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to
show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause
of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP § 437c(p)(2).) The plaintiff may not
merely rely on allegations or denials in its pleadings to show that a triable
issue of material fact exists, but instead “shall set forth the specific facts
showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of
action.” (Ibid.) “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should
be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467.) 
 
IV.      
DISCUSSION 
Defendant’s Burden 
RD America meets their initial
burden. 
RD America moves for summary
judgment on Plaintiff’s FAC on the grounds that neither RD America nor its
employees created or had actual or constructive notice of the alleged dangerous
condition upon which Plaintiff bases his causes of action for general
negligence and premises liability. (Motion p. 2:8-11.)
To succeed on a claim for negligence,
Plaintiff must show that: (1) defendant owed a legal duty to plaintiff to use
due care; (2) defendant breached that duty; (3) defendant’s breach was the
actual or proximate cause of plaintiff’s harm; and (4) plaintiff suffered
damages as a result. (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006)
137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318; Ladd v. County of San Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th
913, 917.) “Superimposed upon the criteria for determining the existence of a
duty of care in a particular category of negligence . . . are . . . universal
factors”, including foreseeability of harm. (Hamilton v. Gage Bowl (1992)
6 Cal.App.4th 1706, 1713.)
Premises liability is a form of negligence. (Brooks
v. Eugene Burger Management Corp. (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1611, 1619.) To
succeed on a claim of premises liability, a plaintiff must show that (1) the
defendant was the owner, occupant, or lessor of the premises; (2) the defendant
was negligent in the use, maintenance, or management of the premises; and (3)
such negligence was the cause of injury, damage, loss, or harm to plaintiff. (Ibid.)
“A landowner owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain his or her
property in such a manner as to avoid exposing others to an unreasonable risk
of injury.” (Barnes v. Black (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1473, 1478.)
Here, RD America argues that Plaintiff cannot
establish a breach of duty because RD America exercised due care in maintaining
its premises. The following facts are undisputed: the underlying incident
occurred when Plaintiff entered a RD America warehouse and slipped and fell on
a piece of produce on the floor, outside of the warehouse, near the front
entrance. (Plaintiff’s Response to Separate Statement of Facts “PR-SSF” No. 3;
Exh. A [Bubion Decl.] at ¶¶ 3, 5, and 7; Exh. B [FAC]; Exh. C [Plaintiff Depo.]
at 59:21-60:4 and 60:16-18; Exh. E [Begando Depo.] at 22:16-21].) The premises
are inspected three times per day by senior management: first upon opening,
second at midday, and third in the afternoon. During these daily inspections,
the entire warehouse, including the parking lot and front entrance,, is
inspected “specifically for spills and unsafe conditions.” (PR-SSF No. 7; Exh.
G [Gomez Decl.] at ¶ 3.) The inspections are documented on a Senior Manager
Daily Safety and Branch Readiness Checklist (“Checklist”). (PR-SSF No. 8; Exh.
A at ¶ 7; Exh. G at ¶¶ 3 and 6; Exh. E at 19:1-16, 22:22-23:9, and 24:8-17;
Exh. H [Checklist from March 9, 2020].) The “Lot” Checklist section includes
the parking lot and front entrance area outside of the store. The “Front End”
section includes the front entrance area inside the store. (Ibid.) The
Checklists are prepared contemporaneous with the inspections and identify the
areas of inspection, time of inspection, any potential hazards that may have
been encountered, and how they were remedied, if applicable. (PR-SSF No. 9;
Exh. A at ¶ 7; Exh. E at 19:1-16; Exh. G at ¶¶ 3 and 6; Exh. H.) Additionally,
all RD America personnel are trained to continuously monitor the premises for
any potential slipping hazards as they perform their duties. (PR-SSF No. 10;
Exh. G at ¶ 4.) On March 9, 2020, the day of the underlying incident, two
inspections were conducted on the premises prior to the alleged incident.
(PR-SSF No. 11; Exh. A at ¶ 7; Exh. E at 19:1-21 and 21:11-17; Exh. G at ¶¶
6-7; Exh. H.) The first inspection occurred at 6:04 a.m. and did not reveal any
spilled substances or slipping hazards near the parking lot and front entrance
area outside of the store. (PR-SSF No. 12; Exh. A at ¶ 7; Exh. E at 19:1-21,
22:3-7, and 24:24-25:8; Exh. G at ¶¶ 6 and 7; Exh. H.) The second inspection
was performed between 1:00 and 1:20 p.m. (PR-SSF No. 13; Exh. A at ¶ 7; Exh. E
at 21:11-17, 22:3-7, and 22:22-25:8; Exh. G at ¶¶ 6-9; Exh. H.) During the
inspection, inspecting employee Senior Manager Javier Gomez (“Gomez”) did not
observe any slipping hazards. (PR-SSF No. 14; Exh. G at ¶¶ 6-9; Exh. H.) Gomez
had no knowledge of the alleged piece of produce on the floor until Plaintiff
informed RD America personnel of the incident. (PR-SSF No. 15; Exh. A at ¶ 8
Exh. F [Gomez Depo.] at 11:15-25; Exh. G at ¶¶ 6-10; Exh. H.) Plaintiff did not
report the incident to RD America staff until three days after the incident,
when he reported the same to Assistant Branch Manager Debra Begando
(“Begando”). (PR-SSF No. 6; Exh. A at ¶¶ 5 and 7; Exh. C at 55:9-13; Exh. E at
20:11-21:2.)
In a premises liability action, the owner of
the premises may prove it exercised reasonable care and inspected the floor
within a brief period before the accident with a declaration from a
knowledgeable person describing the store’s regular maintenance practices and
the record of actual inspections conducted around the time of the plaintiff’s
injury. (Gonzalez v. Interstate Cleaning Corporation (2024) 106
Cal.App.5th 1026, 1026.) Here, RD America provides this exact proof with
declarations from Assistant Branch Manager Debra Begando and inspecting
employee Javier Gomez, in addition to providing the Senior Manager Daily Safety
and Branch Readiness Checklist from the day of the incident. Therefore, RD
America meets their initial burden.
 
Plaintiff’s Burden
The burden now shifts to Plaintiff to show a
triable issue of material fact as to RD America’s exercise of due care on the
day of the underlying incident.
Plaintiff’s opposition argues two points: (1)
the approximate 9 to 20 minutes between Gomez’s inspection and Plaintiff’s slip
and fall is enough time to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether RD
America had constructive notice of the alleged dangerous condition; and (2) RD
America engaged in spoilation of critical electronically stored information
pursuant to CCP § 2023.030 by failing to preserve the store’s March 9, 2020,
surveillance video and, as a result, Plaintiff is prevented from determining
whether RD America had actual or constructive notice of the alleged dangerous
condition. (Opposition p. 3.) The Court now addresses both arguments.
First, Plaintiff argues that the approximate 9 to 20
minutes between Gomez’s inspection and Plaintiff’s fall is enough time to raise
a triable issue of fact as to whether RD America knew, or should have known, of
the alleged dangerous condition. In support of their argument, Plaintiff relies
on Ortega v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1200, 1210-1211, Tuttle v.
Crawford (1936) 8 Cal.2d. 126, Louie v. Hagstrom’s Food Stores (1947)
81 Cal.App.2d 601, 608, and Hale v. Safeway Stores (1954) 129 Cal.App.2d
124. 
Whether a dangerous condition has existed
long enough for a reasonably prudent person to have discovered it is a question
of fact for the jury in a premises liability action, and governing case law
does not impose any time limitations. (Ortega v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26
Cal.4th 1200, 1207.) “. . . [A] plaintiff in premises liability action may
prove a dangerous condition existed for an unreasonable time with circumstantial
evidence, and . . . evidence that an inspection has not been made within a
particular period of time prior to an accident may warrant an inference that
the defective condition existed long enough so that a person exercising
reasonable care would have discovered it.” (Ibid. at 1210.) “. . . [A]n
owner must have a reasonable time to make an inspection in order to discover
the dangerous condition and correct it.” (Ibid. at 1210-1211.) “. . .
[I]f a store owner has taken care in the discharge of its duty [to maintain the
premises], by inspecting its premises in a reasonable manner, then no breach
will be found even if a patron suffers injury.” (Ibid. at 1211.) Here,
while Plaintiff argues that the 9 to 20 minutes existing between Gomez’s inspection
and Plaintiff’s fall is enough time to raise a triable issue of fact as to
whether RD America had actual or constructive knowledge of the alleged
dangerous condition, this claim is defeated by the undisputed facts that RD
America inspects its premises in a reasonable manner. Again, it is undisputed
that RD America inspects the premises, and maintains a Checklist thereof, at
least three times per day. (PR-SSF Nos. 7-8; Exh. A at ¶ 7; Exh. G at ¶¶ 3 and
6; Exh. E at 19:1-16, 22:22-23:9, and 24:8-17; Exh. H.) Additionally, it is
undisputed that all RD America personnel are trained to continuously monitor
the premises for any potential slipping hazards as they perform their duties.
(PR-SSF No. 10; Exh. G at ¶ 4.) Therefore, Plaintiff fails to raise a triable
issue of material fact as to whether RD America inspects its premises in a
reasonable manner. Consequently, pursuant to Ortega, no breach may be
found even though Plaintiff suffered injury.
Next, Plaintiff argues that RD America
engaged in spoilation of critical electronically stored information pursuant to
CCP § 2023.030 by failing to preserve the store’s March 9, 2020, surveillance
video and, as a result, Plaintiff is prevented from determining whether RD
America had actual or constructive notice of the alleged dangerous condition.
(Opposition p. 3.) Therefore, Plaintiff requests that, pursuant to CCP §
2023.030(b) and Victor Valley Union High School District v. Superior Court
of San Bernardino County (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 1121, the Court imposes a
sanction against RD America and that RD America is deemed, as a matter of law,
to have had notice of the produce matter on the floor prior to Plaintiff’s slip
and fall on March 9, 2020, and/or that a trier of fact may make a reasonable
inference that the March 9, 2020, surveillance footage showed that RD America
had notice of the produce matter on the floor prior to Plaintiff’s accident.
(Opposition p. 4:1-12.)
CCP § 2023.030(b) states that “[t]he court
may impose an issue sanction ordering that designated facts shall be taken as
established in the action in accordance with the claim of the party adversely
affected by the misuse of the discovery process.” (CCP § 2023.030(b).) One
serious form of discovery abuse potentially warranting discovery sanctions is
the “spoilation of evidence,” which is defined as the destruction or alteration
of relevant evidence or the failure to preserve evidence for another party’s
use in pending or future litigation. (Victor Valley Union High School
District v. Superior Court of San Bernardino County (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th
1121, 1139.) “’Chief among’ the non-tort remedies for the spoilation of
evidence ‘is the evidentiary inference that evidence which one party has
destroyed or rendered unavailable was unfavorable to that party.’ [Citation].” (Ibid.)
“The duty to preserve material evidence arises not only during litigation but
also extends to that period before the litigation when a party reasonably
should know that the evidence may be relevant to anticipated litigation.” (Silvestri
v. General Motors Corp. (4th Cir. 2001) 271 F.3d 583, 591.)
Here, both Begando and Gomez watched the
March 9, 2020, surveillance footage, which purportedly showed Plaintiff’s slip
and fall, yet failed to save and preserve the footage. (Plaintiff’s Separate
Statement of Facts (“P-SSF”) No. 1; Coolidge Decl. Exh. 1 [Begando Depo.] at
11:23-12:22, 15:4-12, 28:4-35:9, 35:11-38; Coolidge Decl. Exh. 2 [Gomez Depo.]
at 10:11-23, 12:16-13:17, 19:3-20:5, 22:5-7, 22:12-25:20.) Indeed, Begando and
Gomez watched the footage after Plaintiff reported his slip and fall on
March 12, 2020. (Ibid.) Therefore, Begando and Gomez watched the footage
with reasonable anticipation that it could be relevant to anticipated
litigation. Despite this, the video was copied over and erased two weeks after
Plaintiff’s incident, such that it was not available to be produced for
Plaintiff during discovery. (Ibid.) As a result, RD America engaged in
the spoilation of relevant evidence, and the Court imposes an issue sanction
ordering that a trier of fact may make a reasonable inference that the March 9,
2020, surveillance footage showed that RD America had notice of the produce
matter on the floor prior to Plaintiff’s accident.
To this extent, Plaintiff meets their burden
and defeats summary judgment.
 
V.      
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff
shows a triable issue of fact as to whether RD America had actual or
constructive notice of the alleged dangerous condition. Accordingly, RD America’s
motion for summary judgment is DENIED. 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
