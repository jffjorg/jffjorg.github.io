COMPLAINT
  FILED: OCTOBER 13, 2021
TRIAL
  DATE: AUGUST 25, 2025



 
I.      
BACKGROUND  
On
October 13, 2021, Plaintiff Rancho Palos Verdes Estates Community Association
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint for damages and an injunction against
Defendants Giovanni Funiciello (“Giovanni”), Christina Funiciello
(“Christina”), CSI Services (“CSI”), Frank Colaruotolo (“Colaruotolo”), and
Does to 10.
Plaintiff
is a homeowners association (“HOA”) that owns, occupies, and controls the
common area of Rancho Palos Verdes Estates Community (“RPVE”). (Complaint ¶ 1.)
RPVE is a gated community whose entrance lies south of Crest Road. (Ibid.)
Giovanni
and Christina Funiciello own a home north of Crest Road, across the street from
RPVE. (Complaint ¶ 2.) Plaintiff alleges that five utility poles have been on
the Funiciello property since at least 2004 and that, in 2019, Defendants began
work to move at least three of these poles to RPVE’s property. (Ibid. at
¶¶ 7-8.) As a result, Plaintiff seeks damages and an injunction.
On
April 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to augment their expert
witness list.
The
motion was taken under submission on November 26, 2024. On December 3, 2024,
the Court issued a ruling denying the motion as moot.
On
December 12, 2024, Defendants Giovanni and Christina Funiciello (hereinafter
“Defendants”) filed the instant motion for reconsideration of the Court’s
December 3, 2024, ruling denying Plaintiff’s April 10, 2024, motion for leave
to augment expert witness list as moot.
On
December 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed their opposition.
On
January 7, 2025, Defendants filed their reply.
 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
C.C.P. §1008(a) provides, as follows:  “When an application for an order has been
made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or
granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order
and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application
to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and
modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application
shall state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what
judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.”
 
III.      
DISCUSSION 
Defendants
move for reconsideration of the Court’s December 3, 2024, ruling denying
Plaintiff’s April 10, 2024, motion for leave to augment expert witness list on
the grounds that the motion was moot. (Motion p. 1:22-2-3.) It appears that
Defendant does not wish for the Court to change its denial, but rather issue a
correction regarding its grounds for the denial. “. . . Defendants respectfully
ask this Court to reconsider its Minute Order and adopt its Tentative Ruling of
November 25, 2024, which correctly DENIED Plaintiff’s Motion.” (Motion p. 4:20-24.)

The
Court finds Defendants’ request confusing. A motion for reconsideration must be
based on new or different facts, circumstances, or law. (CCP § 1008(a).) Here,
Defendants fail to provide any new or different facts, circumstances, or law.
Instead, Defendants appear to argue that the Court, in its December 3, 2024,
Minute Order, denied Plaintiff’s motion as moot on the grounds that discovery
was still open. (See December 3, 2024, Minute Order.) In Defendants’
instant motion, Defendants argue that “[d]iscovery is and has been closed since
February 13, 2024 . . .” (Motion p. 4:18-22.) However, as noted by the court in
the December 3, 2024, Minute Order, on May 30, 2024, after Plaintiff’s
filing of their motion to augment expert witness list, the Court advanced and
vacated the August 20, 2024, trial date due to the action’s pending
reassignment to an independent calendar court. (See December 3, 2024,
and May 30, 2024, Minute Orders.) The May 30, 2024, Minute Order, provided no
indication that discovery or other cut-off dates remained tied to the August
20, 2024, trial date. (Ibid.) Therefore, in its December 3, 2024, Minute
Order, the Court ordered that all discovery cutoff dates were to follow the
final trial date of August 25, 2025. (See December 3, 2024, Minute
Order.) As a result, Plaintiff’s motion to augment their expert witness list
was properly denied as moot since discovery remains open.
Defendants
argue that “[t]he parties never agreed to re-open discovery since it closed 30
days before the March 13, 2024[sic] trial date.” (Motion p. 4:17-18.) However,
the Court may reopen or change discovery cutoff dates sua sponte, as it
did in its December 3, 2024, Minute Order, as it has an inherent power to
manage its own calendar. (Walker v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257,
266-267.) Therefore, on both procedural and substantive grounds, Defendants’
motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
 
IV.   
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’
motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
