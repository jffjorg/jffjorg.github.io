And here is a summary in English text:

This is the Judge's tentative ruling on a motion to reopen discovery in a personal injury case. The plaintiff, Mehdi Rostamian, alleges that he was bitten by the defendant's dog on September 7, 2021, causing him to sustain serious injuries. The defendant, Mehrdad Dardashti, moved to reopen discovery to take depositions of the plaintiff and his experts to gather more information about the plaintiff's alleged continued pain and suffering.

The Judge denied the defendant's motion, finding that the defendant lacked diligence in seeking discovery. The defendant had previously noticed the plaintiff's deposition but never took it, and had failed to request the reopening of discovery in the nine months prior to filing the motion. The Judge also noted that the plaintiff had been prepared for trial since November 2023 and would be prejudiced if discovery were reopened weeks before another continued trial date.

The Judge cited California Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050, which requires the court to consider the necessity and reasons for the discovery, as well as the diligence or lack of diligence of the party seeking the discovery. The Judge also noted that the defendant's lack of diligence in seeking discovery was unexplained and that the plaintiff would be prejudiced if discovery were reopened.
