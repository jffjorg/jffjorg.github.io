And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant CDMY Investment, LLC to the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The demurrer was filed in response to Plaintiff U&G Construction Group, Inc.'s claims for foreclosure of mechanic's lien and quantum meruit. The judge has ruled that the demurrer is SUSTAINED, meaning that Plaintiff's claims are defective and cannot move forward.

The judge has also ruled that Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint is DENIED because the proposed Second Amended Complaint includes causes of action for foreclosure on the mechanic's lien and quantum meruit, which are the same causes of action that were dismissed in the demurrer.

The judge has given Plaintiff 20 days to file an amended complaint that does not include the causes of action for foreclosure on the mechanic's lien and quantum meruit against Defendant CDMY Investment, LLC.
