Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by defendants Eastern Horizon LLC, Chong Ding aka Virginia Ding, and Joy Wang. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the plaintiff's complaint in the Related Case and argues that the complaint is a "sham pleading" because it is premised on facts that are "fundamentally inconsistent" with the facts alleged in the complaint filed in the Lead Case.

The judge has ruled that the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend only with respect to the plaintiff's Fourth Cause of Action asserted against Wang. The demurrer is otherwise overruled. The judge has also granted the request for judicial notice of the complaint filed in the Lead Case.

The judge's ruling is based on the legal standards set forth in Code of Civil Procedure, Section 430.10, which states that a demurrer may be brought if there is another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action or if insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted. The judge has also considered the allegations made in the complaint and the demurrer, and has concluded that the plaintiff's complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action against the defendants.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to submission by the parties and may be changed or modified if the parties submit written arguments or appear at the hearing.
