ANALYSIS: 
 
On January 11, 2023, Plaintiff Haney & Shah, LLP
(“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this action
against Defendants Shahram Tamjidi aka Shawn Tamjidi (“Defendant
Tamjidi”) and Tamjidi Enterprises, Inc. Defendant Tamjidi filed an answer on
February 21, 2023. On April 13, 2023, the parties stipulated to transfer the
action from an independent calendar court to the limited jurisdiction court. 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Deposition and
Request for Sanctions on June 5, 2023. The Motion initially was set for hearing
on August 7, 2023 and continued upon the parties’ stipulation. (Minute Order,
08/07/23.) No opposition, nor supplemental papers, have been filed to date. 
 
Discussion

 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, section (a) states
in relevant part: 
 
If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party
under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) The motion must
also “set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice” and “be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subds. (b)(1), (2).) 
 
Plaintiff served Defendant Tamjidi with a Notice of
Deposition on March 31, 2023, setting the deposition for April 14, 2023.
(Motion, Haney Decl., ¶2 and Exh. 1.) Defendant Tamjidi did not object to the
deposition notice, nor otherwise communicate with Plaintiff regarding the
deposition date. (Id. at ¶2.) However, the deposition did not take
place. (Ibid.) On April 27, 2023, defense counsel indicated that a
settlement offer would be forthcoming. (Id. at ¶3 and Exh. 2.) When no
settlement offer was communicated, Plaintiff requested additional deposition
dates but did not hear back from defense counsel. (Id. at ¶¶3-4 and Exh.
3.) This evidence demonstrates that Plaintiff sought to meet and confer
regarding the deposition, to no avail. 
 
Due to Defendant Tamjidi’s failure to cooperate in the
taking of their deposition, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling their
deposition. An award of sanctions is also appropriate due to Defendant
Tamjidi’s non-cooperation. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) However,
the sanctions sought are excessive. Pursuant to a lodestar calculation,
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is granted in the amount of $660.00
based on one hour of attorney time billed at $600.00 per hour and $60.00 in costs.
(Motion, Haney Decl., ¶6.)
 
 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Haney
& Shah, LLP’s Motion to Compel Appearance at Deposition and Request for
Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT SHAHRAM TAMJIDI AKA SHAWN TAMJIDI IS ORDERED TO
APPEAR FOR DEPOSITION AT A DATE AND TIME DETERMINED BY PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL,
WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT SHAHRAM TAMJIDI AKA SHAWN TAMJIDI AND
COUNSEL OF RECORD ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $660.00
TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
