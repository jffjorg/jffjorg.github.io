The original judgment was entered against Steven Elliot Edelson, both individually and as a representative of the Los Angeles Entertainment Trust, but Park intended to enter judgment solely against Edelson as an individual. The judge has determined that this is a clerical error that can be corrected, and has granted the motion. Park must file a proposed amended judgment within 20 days of this order.
