## English Summary

The Judge has tentatively ruled to grant the Plaintiff, Young Hee Park's, motion to amend the judgment.  The original judgment was entered against both Steven Elliot Edelson as an individual and as a representative of the Los Angeles Entertainment Trust.  Ms. Park's attorney argues that this dual designation causes problems with bank levies, as banks often refuse to honor them when an account holder has a legal description after their name. The Judge agrees that this appears to be a clerical error and will allow Ms. Park to file a revised judgment that names Mr. Edelson solely as an individual.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Young Hee Park's motion to amend the judgment nunc pro tunc, which means that the judgment will be corrected retroactively. The error in the original judgment was the inclusion of Los Angeles Entertainment Trust as a defendant, whereas Park intended to sue only Steven Elliot Edelson as an individual. The court has the power to correct clerical errors, and in this case, the error was due to inadvertence on the part of the attorney who drafted the judgment. As a result, the judgment will be amended to name Edelson solely as an individual. Park must file a proposed amended judgment within 20 days.

The motion was unopposed, and the Judge relied on relevant case law and statutes, including CCP § 473(d), to make their decision.
