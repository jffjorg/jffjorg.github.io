  Case Number:  18STLC13458    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  26   Gutierrez  v. Perry, et al.MOTION  TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL CROSS-COMPLAINT(CCP § 464) TENTATIVE RULING:   Cross-Complainant Raymond C.  Perry aka Chris Perry’s Motion to File Supplemental Cross-Complaint is GRANTED     ANALYSIS:  On November 2, 2018, Plaintiff Aguileo  Gutierrez (“Cross-Defendant”) filed the instant action for breach of contract against Defendant Raymond C. Perry aka Chris Perry (“Cross-Complainant”).  On April 4, 2019, Cross-Complainant filed a Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendant.   The Court granted Cross-Defendant’s Motion  to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted Against Cross-Complainant on November  7, 2019. However, the Court denied Cross-Defendant’s Motion for Terminating  Sanctions on July 8, 2020. The matter came for trial on September 3, 2020 and  the Court continued the trial date to July 8, 2021. Due to there being no judge  available for trial on July 8, 2021, the trial date was again continued to  November 16, 2021. (Minute Order, 07/08/21.)   On August 2, 2021, the Court denied  Cross-Complainant’s Motion to Vacate the Order Deeming the Requests for  Admission Admitted. (Minute Order, 08/02/21.) The trial was continued multiple  times to May 23, 2022, at which time the parties represented a desire for  settlement discussions. Following a mandatory settlement conference, which did  not resolve the action, the trial date was again set and continued multiple  times.    Cross-Complainant  filed the instant Motion to File Supplemental Cross-Complaint on July 5, 2023.  The trial date was again continued and is now set for September 28, 2023. No  opposition to the Motion to File Supplemental Cross-Complaint has been filed to  date.    Discussion   Cross-Complainant  moves to file a Supplemental Cross-Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil  Procedure section 464, subdivision (a), which states in relevant part: “[t]he  plaintiff and defendant, respectively, may be allowed, on motion, to make a  supplemental complaint or answer, alleging facts material to the case occurring  after the former complaint or answer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 464, subd.  (a).)    It is the general policy that courts should  exercise liberality in permitting the filing of supplemental pleadings when the  alleged “occurring-after” facts are pertinent to the case. (Code Civ. Proc., §  464; People ex rel. Dept. Pub. Wks. v. Douglas, 15 Cal.App.3d 814 [93 Cal.Rptr.  644]; Louie Queriolo Trucking, Inc. v. Superior Court, 252 Cal.App.2d 194,  197—198 [60 Cal.Rptr. 389].) Nonetheless, the motion to file a supplemental  pleading is addressed to the sound legal discretion of the court, and its ruling  will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a showing of a manifest abuse  of that discretion.   (Flood v. Simpson (1975) 45  Cal.App.3d 644, 647.)   Cross-Complainant seeks to file a  Supplemental Cross-Complaint alleging that he incurred additional damages due  to Cross-Defendant’s alleged wrongdoing. Specifically, during the heavy rains  in Los Angeles in the winter of 2022-2023, the improper roof construction  performed by Cross-Defendant led to hundreds of thousands of additional dollars  of damage to Cross-Complainant’s home and personal property. (Motion, p.  3:17-21.) The Motion, however, is not supported by any evidence to support  these allegations  or even when Cross-Complainant became aware  of the purported damages. No supporting declaration nor documentary evidence  attests to these facts, which presumably began last winter. (See Motion, Cohon  Decl.). Nevertheless, at the hearing on this motion, Plaintiff accedes to its thrust for reasons of judicial economy.       Conclusion    Cross-Complainant Raymond C.  Perry aka Chris Perry’s Motion to File Supplemental Cross-Complaint is GRANTED.     Court clerk to give notice.
