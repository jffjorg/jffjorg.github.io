ANALYSIS:
 
On May 5, 2021, Judgment
Creditor Young Hee Park (“Judgment Creditor”) filed the instant action for
civil rights violations against Judgment Debtor Steven Elliot Edelson, as an
individual, and as a representative of the Los Angeles Entertainment Trust
Dated October 21, 2016 (“Judgment Debtor”). Default judgment was entered
against Judgment Debtor on July 5, 2022. 
 
Judgment
Creditor filed the instant Motion to Amend Judgment Nunc Pro Tunc on July 7,
2023. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion  
 
Courts have inherent powers to
correct judgments by a nunc pro tunc order where there has been clerical error
by clerk or by the judge himself, or where some provision of, or omission from,
order or judgment was due to inadvertence, or mistake of court. (Lane v.
Superior Court of Siskiyou County (1950) 98 Cal App 2d 165, 219; Code Civ.
Proc., § 473, subd. (d).) This includes clerical errors when made by an
attorney who drafts the judgment. (See In re Marriage of Kaufman (1980)
101 Cal.App.3d 147, 151.) However, while a trial court may correct clerical
errors and misprisions in a judgment, it cannot amend a judgment once entered,
if the error to be corrected is a judicial one, for instance if it embodies an
intentional action of the court even though legally erroneous. (Kamper v.
Mark Hopkins, Inc. (1947) 78 Cal App 2d 885.) 
 
Judgment Creditor has shown that they
intended to enter judgment against Judgment Debtor solely as “Steven Elliot
Edelson, an individual,” instead of
individually and in Judgment Debtor’s representative capacity. Judgment
Creditor’s attorney attests that banks often refuse to honor bank levies
where the account holder has a legal description after their name. (Motion, Kim
Decl., ¶3.) Here, the judgment was entered against Judgment Debtor individually and in their representative
capacity. Accordingly, the request to amend the judgment to name Judgment
Debtor solely as an individual is granted.
 
Conclusion
 
Judgment Young Hee Park’s Motion
to Amend Judgment Nunc Pro Tunc is GRANTED.
JUDGMENT CREDITOR IS TO FILE A PROPOSED AMENDED JUDGMENT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS
ORDER.
