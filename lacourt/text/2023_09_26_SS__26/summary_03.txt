And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to vacate the dismissal filed by Plaintiff Intellectual Property is granted. The dismissal entered on July 3, 2023 is hereby vacated. Additionally, an order to show cause regarding the failure to file proof of service is set for December 4, 2023 at 8:30am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The judge's decision is based on the fact that the motion was filed within six months of the dismissal and is supported by an affidavit of attorney fault, which states that the attorney suffered from health setbacks and was unable to attend to the action.
