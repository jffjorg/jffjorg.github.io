## English Text Summary

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the Plaintiff's, Intellectual Property's, motion to vacate the dismissal of the case. 

The case was dismissed because Plaintiff failed to appear at trial on July 3rd, 2023. The Plaintiff's attorney claims this was due to numerous health setbacks throughout the year. 

The judge finds this explanation sufficient to warrant vacating the dismissal under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). 

However, because the Plaintiff has still not filed proof of service for the Defendants, the judge has scheduled an Order to Show Cause hearing for December 4th, 2023 to address this issue.
