And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Haney & Shah, LLP's Motion to Compel Appearance at Deposition and Request for Sanctions. Defendant Shahram Tamjidi aka Shawn Tamjidi is ordered to appear for a deposition at a date and time to be determined by Plaintiff's counsel within 20 days of this order. Defendant Tamjidi and counsel of record are jointly and severally ordered to pay sanctions of $660.00 to Plaintiff's counsel within 20 days of this order. The judge finds that Defendant Tamjidi's failure to cooperate in the taking of their deposition warrants an order compelling their deposition, and an award of sanctions is also appropriate due to their non-cooperation.
