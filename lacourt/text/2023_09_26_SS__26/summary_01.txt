## English Summary:

Judge grants Perry's motion to file a supplemental cross-complaint, even though it lacks supporting evidence. 

This case started with Gutierrez suing Perry for breach of contract. Perry then filed a cross-complaint against Gutierrez.  The court has already ruled on several motions, including deeming some of Perry's requests for admission admitted against him. 

Perry now wants to add to his cross-complaint, alleging that Gutierrez's improper roof construction caused him significant damage during recent storms.  

While Perry's motion lacks evidence to support these claims, the judge grants it, likely for reasons of judicial economy (making the case proceed efficiently). The trial is set for September 28, 2023.
