And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the petition to confirm an arbitration award filed by Edward C. Yoon on May 28, 2024. The arbitration award recommends expunging two customer complaints made by Diana Offen and Mehdi Famili from Yoon's record on the Central Registration Depository (CRD). The petition is unopposed. The court finds that the petition satisfies the procedural requirements to confirm the arbitration award, including the timely filing of the petition and the provision of required documents, such as the arbitration award and waivers and submission agreements. The court also notes that FINRA waived the requirement that it be named as a party to this petition, and that both Offen and Famili waived service, notice, and participation in this petition. Therefore, the petition is granted, and Yoon is required to give notice of the ruling.
