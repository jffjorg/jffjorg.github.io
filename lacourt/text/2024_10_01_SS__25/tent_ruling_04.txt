BACKGROUND 
 
On May 28, 2024, Petitioner Edward C. Yoon (“Petitioner”)
filed the instant petition to confirm the arbitration award issued in FINRA
Case No. 23-02061, Edward C. Yoon v. Mehdi Famili and Diana Offen.  The award recommends expunging two
customer complaints made
by Diana Offen (“Offen”) and Mehdi Famili (“Famili”), Occurrence Numbers
1766573 and 2191250 (both related to the same investments purchased by Offen),
and 2241177 (related to an investment purchased by Famili), from Petitioner’s
record on the Central Registration Depository (“CRD”).  The recommendation is based on the
understanding that Petitioner obtains confirmation of the award before the CRD
will execute the expungement directive. The petition is unopposed. 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
I.          Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award 
 
“Any party to an arbitration award in which an award has been made
may petition the court to confirm, correct, or vacate the award.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1285.) “Regardless of the particular relief granted, any arbitrator’s
award is enforceable only when confirmed as a judgment of the superior court.”
(O’Hare v. Municipal Resource Consultants (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 267,
278.) “Once a petition to confirm an award is filed, the superior court must
select one of only four courses of action: it may confirm the award, correct
and confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition.” (EHM Productions, Inc.
v. Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc. (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.) “It
is well settled that the scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is
extremely narrow.” (California Faculty Assn. v. Superior Court (1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 935, 943.) “Neither the trial court, nor the appellate court, may
‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the evidence, or the
arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an award because of an
arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on the award’s face.” (EHM
Productions, supra, at p. 1063-64.)
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1285.4 states, “[a] petition under this chapter shall: (a) Set forth
the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless
the petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement. (b) Set forth the
names of the arbitrators. (c) Set forth or have attached a copy of the award
and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.”
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1283.6 states,“[t]he neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of
the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by registered or
certified mail or as provided in the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1283.6.) Additionally,
a party may seek a court judgment confirming an arbitration award by filing and
serving a petition no more than four years, but not less than 10 days, after
the award is served on the petitioner. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.)
Code of Civil
Procedure, section 1290.4 states, in relevant part:
a.      
A copy of the petition
and a written notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other
papers upon which the petition is based shall be served in the manner provided
in the arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice.
b.     
If the arbitration
agreement does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made and
the person upon whom service is to be made has not previously appeared in the
proceeding and has not previously been served in accordance with this subdivision.
1.     
Service within this
State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in
an action.
2.     
Service outside this
State shall be made by mailing the copy of the petition and notice of hearing
and other papers by registered or certified mail. Personal service is the
equivalent of such service by mail. Proof of service by mail shall be made by
affidavit showing such mailing together with the return receipt of the United
States Post Office bearing the signature of the person on whom service was
made….
II.        Discussion  
Here, Petitioner has satisfied the procedural
requirements to confirm the arbitration award
issued in FINRA Case No. 23-02061, Edward C. Yoon v. Mehdi Famili and Diana
Offen. 
Petitioner provides Famili and Offen’s waivers and submission agreements
wherein each agreed to waive service, notice, and participation in the FIRNA
arbitration as well as this petition to confirm arbitration award. (Lowery
Decl., ¶ 6; Exs. A, B.) Petitioner sets forth the names of the arbitrators:
Robert Albini, Mary O’Neal, and Daniel Yasharel (collectively, the
“Arbitrators”). (Lowery Decl., ¶ 8.) Petitioner provides a copy of the
arbitration award issued by the Arbitrators on February 20, 2024 and a copy of
the FINRA Award Service Letter sent on the same day. (Lowery Decl., ¶ 9; Exs. C,
D.) The award states, “[a]fter considering the pleadings, the
testimony and evidence presented at the expungement hearing, and any
post-hearing submissions, the Panel [of Arbitrators] has decided in full and
final resolution of the issues submitted for the determination as follows: 
…The Panel awards the expungement of all references
to Occurrence Numbers 1766573, 2191250, and 2241177 from registration records
maintained by the CRD for claimant Edward C. Yoon (CRD Number 2408137) with the
understanding that pursuant to Rule 2080, Claimant Edward C. Yoon must obtain
confirmation from a court of competent jurisdiction before the CRD will execute
the expungement directive.”
(Lowery Decl., ¶¶ 9-10, Ex. C.)
Further, the petition
is timely because Petitioner filed the petition on May 28, 2024, which is more
than 10 days, but less than four years, after the award was served on February
20, 2024. Lastly, FIRNA waived the requirement that it is named as a party to
this petition, and, as noted above, both Famili and Offen waived service,
notice and participation for this petition. (Lowery Decl., ¶¶ 6, 12; Exs. A, B,
E.) 
No oppositions has been
filed. 
III.       Conclusion 
 
Accordingly, the Petition to Confirm Arbitration
Award filed by Edward C. Yoon on May 28, 2024 is GRANTED.
 
Moving party is to give notice of ruling.
