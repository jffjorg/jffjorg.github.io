    BACKGROUND   On  February 23, 2023, Plaintiff Maxwell + Bessie, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed a  Complaint against Defendants Michael Onagbesan (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through  10, alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of written agreement, (2) breach  of oral agreement, (3) breach of oral agreement, and (4) breach of implied  covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The complaint arises from the alleged  breach of an agreement to provide media advertising and marketing.     On  June 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)  against Defendant alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of  written agreement, (2) breach of oral agreement, (3) breach of oral agreement,  and (4) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.    On August 3, 2023,  Defendant filed an Answer to the Complaint.    On  March 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel Defendant’s responses to set  one of Plaintiff’s request for production of documents. Also, on March 8, 2024,  Plaintiff filed a motion to compel Defendant’s responses to set one of  Plaintiff’s special interrogatories.     On  April 18, 2024, after hearing oral argument, the Court granted Plaintiff’s  unopposed discovery motions. (04/18/24 Minute Order.) Defendant was “ordered to  comply with the production of documents pursuant to CCP 2031.280(a).) (04/18/24  Minute Order at p. 2.) The Court indicated that “[a]ny documents or category of  documents produced in response to Plaintiff’s request for production of  documents must be identified with the specific request(s) number(s) to which  they respond.” (04/18/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) Additionally, the Court ordered  Defendant “to respond to Plaintiff’s discovery requests with Code compliant  Verified responses within twenty (20) days of notice of [the] Court’s order.”  (04/18/24 Minute Order at p. 2.)     On  April 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served Notice of Ruling of the Court’s  April 18, 2024 order.    On  June 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served the instant Motion for Evidence  Sanctions (the “Motion”). Plaintiff moves for evidence sanctions against  Defendant due to Defendant’s failure to comply with the Court’s April 18, 2024  order.     On  July 18, 2024, after hearing, the Court continued the hearing on the Motion to  August 13, 2024. (07/18/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court ordered the parties  to meet and confer within seven days via telephone regarding the pending  issues. (07/18/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) The Court ordered the parties to file  supplemental briefing, including declarations, regarding meet and confer  efforts and its outcome. (07/18/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) Counsel for Plaintiff  was ordered to give notice. (07/18/24 Minute Order at p. 2.)    On  July 19, 2024, Plaintiff served a Notice of Ruling as to the Court’s July 18,  2024 order. Initially, the Court notes that Plaintiff’s Notice of Ruling does  not set forth the Court’s instruction that the parties were to file  supplemental briefing regarding meet and confer efforts. (See 08/07/24 Notice  of Ruling.)    On  August 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a supplemental brief in support of the Motion.    As of August 12, 2024, the Motion  was unopposed. Any opposition to the Motion was required to have been filed and  served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005,  subd. (b).)        ANALYSIS   I.          Sanctions   A.                 Legal Standard   “A trial court may impose  sanctions, including terminating sanctions, for a party’s misuse of the  discovery process, which includes disobedience of a court order.” Sole  Energy Co. v. Hodges (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 199, 207. A misuse of the  discovery process includes “[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an authorized  method of discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) A misuse of the  discovery process also includes disobeying a court order to provide discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (g).) A court may impose issue sanctions,  evidence sanctions, or monetary sanctions against a party engaging in misuse of  the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030.) An evidence sanction  involves “an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the  discovery process from introducing designated matters in evidence.” (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (c).)   “The discovery statutes evince an  incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions  and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174  Cal.App.4th 967, 992. “Discovery sanctions should be appropriate  to the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the  interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” Ibid. “[C]ontinuing misuses of  the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the  sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” Ibid. Where  discovery violations are “willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the  evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with  discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate  sanction.” Ibid. “Although not expressly required by  statute, courts have noted that, absent unusual circumstances, nonmonetary  sanctions are warranted only if a party willfully fails to comply with a court  order.” Aghaian v. Minassian (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 603, 619-20. The  imposition of evidentiary sanctions does not require a finding of willfulness. Id.  at p. 620.      B.        Analysis  In  support of the Motion, Plaintiff’s counsel, James Lee Reynolds, Esq.  (“Reynolds”), provides a declaration. Mr. Reynolds declares the following: on  April 18, 2024, the Court heard and granted Plaintiff’s motions to compel  Defendant to provide initial responses to set one of Plaintiff’s special  interrogatories and request for production. (Reynolds Decl., ¶ 2; Ex. 1.) On  April 18, 2024, Plaintiff served on Defendant and filed a Notice of Ruling as  to such orders. (Reynolds Decl., ¶ 2; Ex. 2.) With service via regular US mail  on April 18, 2024, Defendant’s verified code-compliant responses and production  had to be served by May 13, 2024. (Reynolds Decl., ¶ 3.) With service via  regular mail by Defendant of his initial responses and production, and  allocating five business days, excluding weekends and holidays for delivery,  Plaintiff should have received Defendant’s initial responses and production no  later than May 20, 2024. (Reynolds Decl., ¶ 3.)   On  or about April 22, 2024, Plaintiff received from Defendant a non-descriptive  pile of documents with bate-stamped numbers 1 through 145. (Reynolds Decl., ¶  4; Ex. 3.) On May 20, 2024, Plaintiff had not received from Defendant the  Court-ordered verified code-compliant initial responses and production.  (Reynolds Decl., ¶ 6; Ex. 5.) The pile of non-descriptive legal documents does  not contain a document that complies with CCP § 2031.280(a).) (Reynolds Decl.,  ¶ 8.)    In  his supplemental declaration, Mr. Reynolds indicates that on July 19, 2024, he  advised Defendant of the Court-ordered meet and confer. (Reynolds Supp. Decl.,  ¶ 3.) After Defendant’s non-responsiveness to the initial meet and confer  attempts and initial refusal to provide availability to meet and confer, the  parties met and conferred on July 29, 2024. (Reynolds Supp. Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.)  Defendant, however, expressly refused to confirm that he would comply with the  Court’s discovery orders. (Reynolds Supp. Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. 4.) As of the date of  the supplemental brief, Defendant continues to refuse and fails to comply with  the Court’s discovery orders. (Reynolds Supp. Decl., ¶ 4.) Counsel states that  “[a]s to the unidentified documents which Defendant previously filed with this  Court, and served on Plaintiff, Defendant represents that these documents will  be used by him at [t]rial. Accordingly, Plaintiff is withdrawing its request  for exclusion of this information.” (Reynolds Supp. Decl., ¶ 4.)    According  to the supplemental brief, Plaintiff is only seeking to prevent Defendant from  introducing or attempting to introduce any matter or information responsive to  Plaintiff’s special interrogatories. (Supp. Brief at pp. 2-3.) Plaintiff  specifically indicates that it “withdraws its challenge to Defendant’s use in  whole or in part of the unidentified documents, which he previously filed with  the Court, and served on Plaintiff; provide[d], however, at [t]rial Defendant  can properly lay a foundation for admissibility.” (Supp. Brief at p. 2:13-15.)    Thus,  based on set one of Plaintiff’s special interrogatories, Plaintiff seeks an  order prohibiting Defendant from attempting to place into evidence the  following:    1.         All facts, witnesses, documents,  custodian of documents, physical evidence, and custodian of physical evidence  supporting Defendant’s non-liability as to Plaintiff’s First Cause of Action  (Breach of Written Agreement); 2.         All facts, witnesses, documents,  custodian of documents, physical evidence, and custodian of physical evidence  supporting Defendant’s non-liability as to Plaintiff’s Second Cause of Action  (Breach of Oral Agreement); 3.         All facts, witnesses, documents,  custodian of documents, physical evidence, and custodian of physical evidence  supporting Defendant’s non-liability as to Plaintiff’s Third Cause of Action  (Breach of Oral Agreement); and 4.         All facts, witnesses, documents,  custodian of documents, physical evidence, and custodian of physical evidence  supporting Defendant’s non-liability as to Plaintiff’s Fourth Cause of Action  (Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith); and 5.         Any document, communication, audio  media, visual media, physical evidence or electronic media that mentions,  refers to, or relates to (which as to each is discoverable by a reasonable  search and inquiry) documents required to be identified and disclosed in  response to set one of Plaintiff’s special interrogatories.    Defendant  has not opposed the Motion.   When  determining whether evidentiary sanctions are appropriate, merely failing to  obey a Court order is sufficient and a showing of willful disobedience is not  required.  (Aghaian v. Minassian, 64  Cal.App.5th 603, 618-620.)  The Court has  discretion to determine whether sanctions are appropriate.  (Code of Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)   Code  of Civil Procedure §§ 2030.210 through 2030.310 set forth the requirements for  providing Code-compliant responses to interrogatories.  Similarly, §§ 2031.210 through 2031.310 set  forth the requirements for providing Code-compliant responses to a request for  production. Plaintiff argues that the Defendant has disobeyed the Court’s Order  compelling compliance with Plaintiff’s discovery requests because he has served  “a non-descriptive pile of documents” and, as a result, seeks evidentiary  sanctions regarding eleven matters that prohibit Defendant from presenting any  evidence regarding non-liability or relating to Plaintiff’s claims.   In  Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co., the Court reaffirmed the trial court’s  broad discretion when imposing discovery sanctions.  (Rutledge, 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,  1193.)  The Court explained that this  discretion must be exercised for the purpose of compelling disclosure of  discoverable information not solely to punish the offending party.  (Ibid.)   Moreover, “the sanction chosen should not provide a windfall to the  other party, by putting the prevailing party in a better position than if he or  she had obtained the discovery sought and it had been favorable.  [Citations.]”   (Ibid.)  In Rutledge, the Court  found that the trial court’s refusal to order evidentiary sanctions, despite  seven prior orders to comply with discovery, was not an abuse of discretion  because if sanctions had been granted, they “would provide a windfall to  appellants relieving them of their burden of proving their theory of liability.”  (Ibid. at 1194.)   On  August 13, 2024, after hearing, the Court continued the hearing on the Motion  to October 1, 2024. (08/13/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) The Court ordered  Defendant to meet/confer (with or without legal representation) with  Plaintiff’s Counsel in the next 15-days Re: Any outstanding discovery  responses. Further, the Court ordered Defendant to comply with the Court’s  April 18, 2024 discovery order and provide Plaintiff’s Counsel with the  outstanding responses to production of documents and to special interrogatories  no later than October 11, 2024.   On  August 17, 2024, Plaintiff served a Notice of Ruling as to the Court’s August  27, 2024 order.    On  September 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed notice of Defendant’s refusal to  participate in meet and confer as ordered by the Court. Plaintiff provides the  declaration of its Counsel in support, which provides that Counsel heard  nothing from Defendant by August 27, 2024, and, therefore, Counsel sent  multiple emails to Defendant requesting Defendant’s availability to set up the  meet and confer, but Defendant never responded. (Reynolds Decl., ¶ 3; Ex. 2 and  3.)    Non-jury  trial is scheduled to commence on November 12, 2024.   On  August 13, 2024, after hearing, the Court continued the hearing on the Motion  to October 1, 2024. (08/13/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) The Court ordered  Defendant to meet/confer (with or without legal representation) with  Plaintiff’s Counsel in the next 15-days Re: Any outstanding discovery  responses. The Court    On  September 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed Notice of Defendant’s Refusal to  Participate in Meet and Confer along with the supporting Declaration of James  Lee Reynolds. Reynolds declares that he heard nothing from Defendant by August  27, 2024, and, therefore, he sent multiple emails to Defendant requesting  Defendant’s availability to set up the meet and confer, but Defendant never  responded. (Reynolds Decl., ¶ 3; Ex. 2 and 3.)    As  of September 25, 2024, Defendant has not filed a response to Plaintiff’s  Notice. Nor has Plaintiff informed the Court that Defendant has responded to  Plaintiff’s requests for available dates to meet and confer.     Previously,  the Court noted that it must take an incremental approach to discovery  sanctions, especially given that Defendant has produced some documents in  response to discovery. (08/13/24 Minute Order at p. 8.)  Therefore, the Court will continue the Motion  one last time to allow Defendant to comply with the Court Order of August 13,  2024. If Defendant fails to comply and absent good cause shown, then the Court  intends to grant the Motion for Evidence Sanctions.     II.        Conclusion               Plaintiff's Motion for Evidence Sanctions Against Defendant  Michael Onagbesan for Failure to Comply with Court Discovery Orders Issued  April 18, 2024, is CONTINUED for the last time to October 22, 2024, at  10:00 a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse.    Defendant is ordered to provide  Plaintiff’s Counsel with the outstanding responses to Production of Documents  and to Special Interrogatories by no later than October 11, 2024.  Failure to comply will result in the granting  of the Motion.    Parties are ordered to submit a  declaration Re: Status on Outstanding Responses to Special Interrogatories and  Request for Production of Documents by no later than five (5) court days before  the 10/22/2024 hearing date.     Defendant has failed to comply  with the Court Order of August 13, 2024, directing Defendant to meet and confer  with Plaintiff’s Counsel regarding any outstanding discovery.    The Court sanctions Defendant for  failure to comply with the Court’s previous order on August 18, 2024, to meet  and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel in the amount of $850 pursuant to  Code of Civil Procedure §2023.030(a) and §2023.010. Defendant is ordered to  make payment in the amount of $850 payable to Plaintiff within 30 days.   Moving party is ordered to give  notice of ruling, and to file proof of service of said notice.
