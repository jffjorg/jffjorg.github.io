And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled to dismiss the case without prejudice. The case was filed on June 3, 2024, by Flavien Prat, a jockey who was suspended by the California Horse Racing Board (CHRB). The court stayed the suspension pending Prat's appeal to the CHRB. The court ordered Prat's counsel to file a status report on the status of the CHRB proceedings, but counsel failed to do so. Counsel also failed to appear at two trial setting conferences and did not serve the CHRB with a copy of the petition. The court has granted its own motion for judgment on the pleadings, citing that the case is not ripe for review because Prat did not exhaust his administrative remedies, or that the case is moot because the appeal has been resolved. The court has ordered the stay of Prat's suspension to be lifted and has discharged the order to show cause re: monetary sanctions.
