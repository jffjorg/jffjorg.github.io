REQUESTED RELIEF:

TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
1.      Motion
to Amend Sister-State Judgment due to Clerical Error is GRANTED.
STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On December 5, 2023, Plaintiff Ace Funding Source LLC
(Plaintiff) filed an Application for Entry of Judgment on Sister-State Judgment
(Application) against Defendants Azizi Imports Inc. d/b/a Azizi Imports; Flyby
Auto Transport LLC d/b/a Flyby Auto Transport; Overight, LLC d/b/a Oversight;
and Jonathan Azizi (Defendants).
 
On December 12, 2023, the Clerk entered judgment.
 
On April 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed notice of motion to amend
the Sister-State Judgment.
 
On May 13, 2024, the court continued the hearing on
Plaintiff’s motion to amend.
 
On June 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a memorandum of points and
authorities and a declaration in support of its motion to amend the
Sister-State Judgment.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Courts have inherent powers to correct judgments by a nunc
pro tunc order where there has been a clerical error by clerk or by the judge
himself, or where some provision of, or omission from, order or judgment was
due to inadvertence, or mistake of court. (Lane
v. Superior Court of Siskiyou County (1950) 98 Cal App 2d 165, 219; Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (d).) This includes clerical errors when made by an
attorney who drafts the judgment. (See In
re Marriage of Kaufman (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 147, 151.) However, while a
trial court may correct clerical errors and misprisions in a judgment, it
cannot amend a judgment once entered, if the error to be corrected is a
judicial one, for instance if it embodies an intentional action of the court
even though legally erroneous. (Kamper v.
Mark Hopkins, Inc. (1947) 78 Cal App 2d 885.)  
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff contends that Defendants Flyby Auto Transport LLC
d/b/a Flyby Auto Transport, Oversight, LLC d/b/a Oversight, and Flyby Auto
Transport LLC were not added to the court’s docket due to a clerical error. Plaintiff
further contends that these Defendants were listed in the Sister-State Judgment
packet documents. Plaintiff seeks to have these Defendants added to the docket.
 
Here, the court agrees there is a clerical error. The
Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment entered on December 12, 2023 identify
all Defendants. However, the court’s docket only includes Defendants Azizi
Imports Inc. d/b/a Azizi Imports and Jonathan Azizi. While Plaintiff does not
seek revision of the documents themselves, Plaintiff’s request is still proper
because it is clearly a clerical error that the docket does not accurately
reflect the entered Judgment. (Code Civ. Proc. § 183(3).)
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to
amend. 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
to Amend Sister-State Judgment due to Clerical Error is GRANTED.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
