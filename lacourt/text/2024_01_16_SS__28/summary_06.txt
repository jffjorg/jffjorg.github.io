And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the motion filed by Plaintiff's counsel to be relieved as counsel. The ruling is based on the fact that counsel did not comply with the California Rules of Court, specifically rule 3.1362, which requires certain information and documents to be filed and served in connection with a motion to be relieved as counsel. The Judge notes that counsel did not identify the name(s) of the withdrawing attorney(s) and that the proof of service did not include the proposed order as one of the documents being served. The ruling is without prejudice, and counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file the proof of service with the Court within five days.
