  Case Number:  20STCV34742    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
September 11, 2020, Plaintiffs Shaun Zhao (“Shaun Zhao”) and Derek Zhao (“Derek
Zhao”), by and through their guardian ad litem Qiyu Chen, filed this action
against Defendants Chin Ho See, Jane Yuk Yin Lee, and Does 1-100 for motor
vehicle, general negligence, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. 
On
March 16, 2022, Defendants Chin Ho See and Jane Yuk Yin Lee (“Defendants”)
filed an answer. 
On
February 24, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement conditioned on the
Court’s approval of petitions for minor’s compromise. On November 14, 2023,
Petitioner Qiyu Chen (“Petitioner”) submitted petitions to approve minor’s
compromise for each Plaintiff to be heard on November 16, 2023. 
On
November 16, 2023, the Court denied the petition to approve the compromise of
Shaun Zhao’s claims without prejudice and
granted the petition to approve the
compromise of Derek Zhao’s claims conditioned on Petitioner submitting an order
consistent with the Court's ruling for the Court’s signature. 
On
December 19, 2023, the Court signed the revised order approving the compromise
of Derek Zhao’s claims. 
On
January 11, 2024, Petitioner filed a petition to approve the compromise of
Shaun Zhao’s claims to be heard on January 12, 2024.  The Court continued the hearing to January
16, 2024. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of Shaun Zhao
(“Claimant”). 
LEGAL STANDARD 
The
parties to a lawsuit may settle a minor’s claim only with court approval.  (Prob. Code., §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.;
Code Civ. Proc., § 372; see Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th
1333, 1337.) 
A
petition for court approval of a compromise or covenant not to sue under Code
of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court,
rules 7.950, 7.951 and 7.952. The petition must be verified by the petitioner
and contain a full disclosure of all information that has “any bearing upon the
reasonableness” of the compromise or the covenant. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
7.950.) 
The
person compromising the claim on behalf of the minor, and the represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise of
the claim unless the court for good cause dispenses with their personal
appearance. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952.) 
DISCUSSION 
Section
12a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $49,162.00.  Section 12a(3) of the petition states that this amount was reduced by $5,956.49.
 The $5,956.49 figure for reductions is
inconsistent with Section 12(b)(2)(f)(ii)(B), which states that a reduction of
$17,455.02 took place.  As discussed more fully below, if one or more medical providers reduced their charges by $5,956.49 (in addition to the $17,455.02 reduction), Petitioner must identify the medical providers, provide the information required in Section 12b(5)(b), and place the total amount of reductions in Section 12(a)(3). 
Section
12a(4) of the petition states that none of the medical expenses will be
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. This is inconsistent with Section
12b(2) of the petition, which states that the private insurance or self-funded
non-ERISA plan ("plan") which paid $43,205.51 of the medical expenses has agreed to
accept $25,750.49 to satisfy its lien rights, and also inconsistent with
Section 16b of the petition, which states that $25,750.49 will be reimbursed
from the settlement proceeds. 
Section
12b(2) of the petition states that the plan paid $43,205.51 of the medical expenses and that the plan
has agreed to accept $25,750.49 in satisfaction of its lien rights, based on a
negotiated reduction of $17,455.02. However, the
petition does not explain the source of the medical expenses that the plan did
not pay—that is, $5,956.49 (the difference between total medical expenses of
$49,162.00 and the plan’s payment of $43,205.51).  Petitioner should identify the medical
provider or providers that provided care for $5,956.49 and explain if these
provider(s) reduced or waived this amount, have liens, and/or should receive
reimbursement from the settlement proceeds. 
(See Section 12b(5)(b).) 
The
Court cannot approve the petition unless it shows that the minor’s compromise
will reimburse all of the medical expenses ($49,162.00, according to the
petition) that have not been reduced or waived. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court DENIES the petition to approve the compromise of
Plaintiff Shaun Zhao’s action without prejudice.    
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
