LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2024.020 provides: 
“(a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any
party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings
on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or
before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the action. 
“(b) Except as provided in Section 2024.050, a
continuance or postponement of the trial date does not operate to reopen
discovery proceedings.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 provides: 
“(a) On motion of any party, the court may grant leave
to complete discovery proceedings, or to have a motion concerning discovery
heard, closer to the initial trial date, or to reopen discovery after a new
trial date has been set. This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(b) In exercising its discretion to grant or deny
this motion, the court shall take into consideration any matter relevant to the
leave requested, including, but not limited to, the following: 
“(1) The necessity and the reasons for the discovery. 
“(2) The diligence or lack of diligence of the party
seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons
that the discovery was not completed or that the discovery motion was not heard
earlier. 
“(3) Any likelihood that permitting the discovery or
hearing the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to trial on the
date set, or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar, or result in prejudice
to any other party. 
“(4) The length of time that has elapsed between any
date previously set, and the date presently set, for the trial of the action. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to extend or to reopen
discovery, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2024.050.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2016.040 provides: “A meet and confer declaration in
support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” 
DISCUSSION 
          Defendant argues that it needs to conduct additional
discovery, including a subsequent deposition of Plaintiff, because Plaintiff
recently disclosed the need for additional surgery and then had the
surgery.  
          Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that Defendant has obstructed
the taking of the bus driver’s deposition. 
The
Court has considered the factors listed in Code of Civil Procedure section
2024.050 and grants Defendant’s motion to reopen discovery.  Discovery is reopened
and will be based on the current May 20, 2024. trial date. 
          The Court denies Plaintiff’s request for sanctions. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS the motion of Defendant Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority to reopen discovery.  Discovery is
reopened and will be based on the current May 20, 2024 trial date. 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Amanda Montano’s request for sanctions. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
