And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the petition to approve the compromise of Shaun Zhao's action and has denied the petition without prejudice. The court has identified several inconsistencies in the petition, including an incorrect reduction in medical expenses and a failure to identify the medical providers that provided care for the remaining expenses. The court has ordered the petitioner to provide additional information, including the identities of the medical providers and the amounts of the reductions, in order to approve the compromise. The court has also scheduled a continued hearing for January 16, 2024, to review the revised petition.
