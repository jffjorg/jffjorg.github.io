English-text summary:

The court's tentative ruling grants Defendant Daniel Shoykhet's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Fournier Calixte, filed a lawsuit against the defendant and others for negligence and premises liability. The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that he did not have actual or constructive notice of a sawhorse in his residence, which the plaintiff allegedly struck and injured himself on. The court finds that the plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact regarding the defendant's knowledge of the sawhorse's presence. Therefore, the court grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment and denies the plaintiff's claims.
