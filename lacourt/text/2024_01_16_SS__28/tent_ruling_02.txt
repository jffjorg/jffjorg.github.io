On

(“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 for motor vehicle negligence. 
On

on Defendant of the summons, complaint, statement of damages and other

On
July 8, 2022, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
January 31, 2023, the Court identified defects in the statement of damages
filed on May 19, 2022 and found that Plaintiff was required to serve a new

On

proof of service by mail on Defendant on March 29, 2023. 
On September
6, 2023, the Court vacated the default and denied Plaintiff’s request for
default judgment. 
On September
14, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing personal service on
Defendant of a statement of damages on September 14, 2023. 
On
October 18, 2023, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
November 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed an application for default judgment.
 On November 22, 2023, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request.
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court enter default judgment against Defendant Candido Soto
and award Plaintiff $122,430.91, consisting of $21,849.46 in special damages,
$100,000.00 in general damages, and $581.45 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and
the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
          “Where a cause of action is stated in the complaint,
plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence establishing a prima facie case
for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide), citing Johnson
v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a
defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for
personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in
court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p.
493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of
the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at
p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258, p. 5-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
has submitted a completed default judgment packet with all applicable
attachments and supporting evidence.  The
Court grants the request. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Jesus Lazcano’s application for default judgment filed
on November 20, 2023.  The Court enters
judgment of $122,430.91 against Defendant Candido
Soto. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
