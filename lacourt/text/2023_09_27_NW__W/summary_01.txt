And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion by Plaintiff Guillermo Arana to compel further responses to special interrogatories from Defendant FCA US LLC, as well as a request for sanctions. The judge found that some of the interrogatories are overly broad and seek irrelevant information. The judge also found that Plaintiff failed to meet and confer in good faith with Defendant before filing the motion. As a result, the judge did not impose sanctions on Defendant.
