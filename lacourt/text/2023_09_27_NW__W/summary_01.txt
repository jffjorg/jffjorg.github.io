And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories from Defendant FCA US LLC, and has also denied the request for sanctions. The Judge found that the Defendant had acted with substantial justification in objecting to the requests and opposing the motion. The Plaintiff had served special interrogatories on the Defendant, seeking information about the Defendant's policies and procedures for handling consumer requests for relief under the Song-Beverly Act, as well as repair rates for 2021 Ram 1500 vehicles. The Defendant had objected to the interrogatories on grounds of irrelevance, overbreadth, and privilege. The Judge agreed that the interrogatories were overly broad and not limited to the specific vehicle at issue. The Plaintiff had requested sanctions in the amount of $2,310.00, but the Judge found that sanctions were unwarranted. The case is a lemon law action, and the Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant was unable to conform the vehicle to the applicable express warranty after a reasonable number of repair attempts. The Judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after hearing oral arguments and considering further evidence.
