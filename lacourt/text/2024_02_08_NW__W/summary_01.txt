And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for summary judgment filed by defendants Exer Medical Corporation d/b/a Exer Urgent Care and Michael H. Lee, M.D. The defendants sought summary judgment on the grounds that they did not breach the applicable standard of care regarding plaintiff Michael Corominas and that they did not, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, proximately cause or contribute to the plaintiffs' injuries.

The defendants presented the expert declaration of Richard Cho, M.D., who testified that the standard of care was met at all times with respect to the care and treatment provided to the plaintiff. The expert declared that the plaintiff's complaints were non-specific and that the treatment provided was reasonable given the plaintiff's presentation. The expert also declared that a diagnosis of an epidural abscess requires more than just a complaint of low back pain.

The defendants have met their burden of showing, by expert declaration, that they did not breach the standard of care or cause the plaintiff's injury. As the defendants are entitled to judgment on the first cause of action for negligence, they are also entitled to judgment on the second cause of action for loss of consortium. The plaintiff has failed to present contradictory expert evidence to challenge the defendants' declaration, and therefore, the defendants are entitled to summary judgment.
