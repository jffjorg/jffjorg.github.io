And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to Defendant Kevin Tsujihara's demurrer to the first and fourth causes of action. The judge has sustained the demurrer as to the fourth cause of action, which alleges a direct breach of fiduciary duty, due to the lack of allegations regarding a demand. The judge has granted 20 days leave to amend. The judge has overruled the demurrer as to the first cause of action, which alleges fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment, finding that the allegations are sufficient. The judge has also found that the fraud claim alleges misrepresentation/concealment and that the FAC sufficiently alleges the essential elements of fraud. The judge has also found that the conspiracy claim is easy to allege and that general allegations of agreement have been held sufficient.
