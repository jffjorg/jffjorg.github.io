Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike and a demurrer filed by the Smythe Defendants. The Smythe Defendants' demurrer to the Complaint is overruled as to the second cause of action, which seeks declaratory relief. The motion to strike is granted as to paragraphs 8, 12, and 14 of the Complaint, which relate to the Smythe Defendants' entitlement to attorneys' fees and costs. The Smythe Defendants are ordered to answer the remaining allegations of the Complaint within 10 days. The judge notes that the Smythe Defendants' arguments that the complaint does not state a cause of action for declaratory relief are without merit.
