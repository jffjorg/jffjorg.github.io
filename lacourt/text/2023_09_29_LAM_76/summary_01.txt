The report must include information about the list of written discovery that has been propounded by each party, the dates upon which responses were served, or are anticipated to be served, and whether unresolved disputes remain with regard to any of the written discovery devices.

The judge also orders that any future discovery motion hearing reservations for which moving papers have not been filed are hereby cancelled and ordered off calendar. The parties are prohibited from using the CRS system to reserve any motions regarding discovery. If any discovery dispute arises for which a motion appears to be necessary, a party who wishes to file a discovery motion shall prepare their moving papers in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and Rules of Court governing discovery motions.

The judge finds that additional case management is necessary to ensure the timely completion of discovery and prevent the discovery issues from creating an undue burden on the Court's motion calendar.

The purpose of discovery is to take the "game" element out of trial preparation by enabling the parties to obtain evidence necessary to evaluate and resolve their dispute before a trial is necessary.
Civil discovery is intended to operate with a minimum of judicial intervention.
The Court has a limited number of available hearing dates for discovery motions, because it is necessary for the Court to manage its resources and prevent the motion calendar from becoming so large that it threatens the ability to conduct trials.
```
Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the discovery motions in this case. The Judge finds that the discovery disputes in this case are excessive and uncooperative, and that the parties are unable or unwilling to resolve routine discovery issues through good faith efforts to meet and confer. The Judge orders the appointment of a discovery referee to manage the discovery process and prevent the discovery issues in this case from creating an undue burden on the Court's motion calendar. The Judge also sets a hearing date for the Order to Show Cause, directs the parties to file a joint status report, and prohibits the parties from using the CRS system to reserve any motions regarding discovery. Failure to follow the Judge's orders may result in consequences, including the imposition of monetary sanctions and/or discovery sanctions.
