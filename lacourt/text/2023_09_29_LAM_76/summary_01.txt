The judge orders the parties to file a joint status report regarding the status of discovery no later than October 31, 2023. The report must include information about the list of written discovery that has been propounded by each party, the dates upon which responses were served, or are anticipated to be served, and whether unresolved disputes remain with regard to any of the written discovery devices.

The judge also orders that any future discovery motion hearing reservations for which moving papers have not been filed are hereby cancelled and ordered off calendar. The parties are prohibited from using the CRS system to reserve any motions regarding discovery. If any discovery dispute arises for which a motion appears to be necessary, a party who wishes to file a discovery motion shall prepare their moving papers in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and Rules of Court governing discovery motions.

The judge finds that additional case management is necessary to ensure the timely completion of discovery and prevent the discovery issues from creating an undue burden on the Court's motion calendar.
