[1] The Court routinely receives ex
parte applications from parties seeking to advance hearing dates on motions
to compel further discovery, on the grounds that the first available hearing
dates are so far in the future that their ability to complete discovery before
their trial date is threatened.  The
Court often denies such requests to advance hearing dates, because adding
additional hearings to the daily motion calendar jeopardizes the Court’s
ability to start trials in the morning. 
Delayed starting times for trial causes an inconvenience to attorneys, parties,
and witnesses involved, as well as jurors whose daily lives are already burdened
by jury service.  The waste of a hearing
time compounds this problem.
