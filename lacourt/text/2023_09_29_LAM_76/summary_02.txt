And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling states that the Court regularly receives ex parte applications to advance hearing dates for motions to compel further discovery, citing concerns that the first available hearing dates are too far in the future and may compromise the ability to complete discovery before trial. The Court has a practice of denying such requests, as adding additional hearings to the daily motion calendar can disrupt the Court's ability to start trials on time, causing inconvenience to attorneys, parties, witnesses, and jurors. The Judge intends to uphold this practice, as delayed starting times for trial can lead to wasted hearing time and further inconvenience.
