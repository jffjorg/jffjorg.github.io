The Judge has summarized their tentative ruling regarding ex parte applications for discovery hearings. These applications seek to advance hearing dates due to the concern that the first available hearing dates are too far in the future, potentially affecting the ability to complete discovery before the trial date. However, the Judge usually denies these requests as adding more hearings to the daily motion calendar could jeopardize the Court's ability to start trials in the morning, causing inconvenience to attorneys, parties, witnesses, and jurors. The Judge also mentioned that the waste of a hearing time exacerbates this issue.
