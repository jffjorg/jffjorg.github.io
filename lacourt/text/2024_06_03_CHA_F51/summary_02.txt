Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to strike references to punitive damages from the complaint. The motion was filed by the defendants, Paradise Ranch, LLC, and Newport Pacific Capital Company, Inc. The defendants argued that the complaint failed to plead sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The plaintiffs, Brigido Acevedo Ortega, et al., argued that the complaint sufficiently pleaded a basis for punitive damages. The judge found that the complaint sufficiently pleaded a basis for punitive damages based on the alleged conduct of the defendants, which constituted malice or oppression. The judge also found that the defendants ratified or approved the allegedly wrongful conduct by their agents and/or employees. Therefore, the motion to strike was denied. The defendants are ordered to file and serve their answer to the complaint within 30 days.
