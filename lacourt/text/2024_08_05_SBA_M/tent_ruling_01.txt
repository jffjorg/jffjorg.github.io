            22TRCV01055
1.      Ray
& Seeb LLP, Counsel for Plaintiff John Doe, Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel 
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Ray
& Seeb LLP, Counsel for Plaintiff John Doe, Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel is granted. 
 
            Background
 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on October 26, 2022. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. Plaintiff alleges sexual abuse as a minor at
defendant's daycare center. 
 
Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel
 
Counsel
states, in the declaration, valid reasons for withdrawal. Counsel states that
there has been a breakdown in communication between counsel and Plaintiff. The
Court finds that the attorney has filed the required declaration.  The Court also finds that the attorney has
shown sufficient reasons why the motion to be relieved as counsel should be
granted and why the attorney brought a motion under Code of Civil Procedure §
284(2) instead of filing a consent under section 284(1). The Court finds that
the attorney filed and served the proposed order. 
 
Therefore, the motion to be relieved as counsel is granted.
 
The attorney is relieved as counsel of record for the clients effective
upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed order upon the client. 
 
Ray & Seeb LLP is ordered to give notice of the
Court’s ruling.
