            23TRCV02168
1.      CHDI
Foundation’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons and Complaint
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            CHDI Foundation’s Motion to Quash Service
of Summons and Complaint is granted.       
 
            Background
 
            Plaintiff
filed the Complaint on July 5, 2023. The First Amended Complaint was filed on
September 25, 2023. Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff, a former
employee of Defendants, contends that he was discriminated against and
wrongfully terminated.  
 
            Motion
to Quash 
 
            Code
Civ. Proc., § 415.10 states: 
            “A
summons may be served by personal delivery of a copy of the summons and of the
complaint to the person to be served. Service of a summons in this manner is
deemed complete at the time of such delivery. The date upon which personal
delivery is made shall be entered on or affixed to the face of the copy of the
summons at the time of its delivery. However, service of a summons without such
date shall be valid and effective.”
 
            Code
Civ. Proc., § 416.10 states:
            “A
summons may be served on a corporation by delivering a copy of the summons and
the complaint by any of the following methods:
(a) To the person designated as agent for service of
process as provided by any provision in Section 202, 1502, 2105, or 2107 of the
Corporations Code (or Sections 3301 to 3303, inclusive, or Sections 6500 to
6504, inclusive, of the Corporations Code, as in effect on December 31, 1976,
with respect to corporations to which they remain applicable).
(b) To the president, chief executive officer, or
other head of the corporation, a vice president, a secretary or assistant
secretary, a treasurer or assistant treasurer, a controller or chief financial
officer, a general manager, or a person authorized by the corporation to
receive service of process.
(c) If the corporation is a bank, to a cashier or
assistant cashier or to a person specified in subdivision (a) or (b).
(d) If authorized by any provision in Section 1701,
1702, 2110, or 2111 of the Corporations Code (or Sections 3301 to 3303,
inclusive, or Sections 6500 to 6504, inclusive, of the Corporations Code, as in
effect on December 31, 1976, with respect to corporations to which they remain
applicable), as provided by that provision.”
 
            Code
Civ. Proc., § 415.20 states, in relevant part: 
            “(a)
In lieu of personal delivery of a copy of the summons and complaint to the
person to be served as specified in Section 416.10, 416.20, 416.30, 416.40, or
416.50, a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint
during usual office hours in his or her office or, if no physical address is
known, at his or her usual mailing address, other than a United States Postal
Service post office box, with the person who is apparently in charge thereof,
and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and complaint by first-class
mail, postage prepaid to the person to be served at the place where a copy of
the summons and complaint were left. When service is effected by leaving a copy
of the summons and complaint at a mailing address, it shall be left with a
person at least 18 years of age, who shall be informed of the contents thereof.
Service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete on the 10th day after
the mailing.”
 
            Code
Civ. Proc., § 418.10 states, in relevant part: “(a) A defendant, on or before
the last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the
court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one
or more of the following purposes: (1) To quash service of summons on the
ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”
 
            “Section
418.10, subdivision (a) (§ 418.10(a)), entitles a defendant to move to quash
“on or before the last day of [the movant's] time to plead or within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow.”  In re Marriage of Obrecht (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 1, 16.  “The notice shall
designate, as the time for making the motion, a date not more than 30 days
after filing of the notice. The notice shall be served in the same manner, and
at the same times, prescribed by subdivision (b) of Section 1005. The service
and filing of the notice shall extend the defendant's time to plead until 15
days after service upon him or her of a written notice of entry of an order
denying his or her motion, except that for good cause shown the court may
extend the defendant's time to plead for an additional period not exceeding 20
days.”  Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10(b).
 
            Substantial compliance requires a showing
of the following: there must be some degree of compliance, that the
circumstances show that it was highly probable that attempted service imparted
the same notice as full compliance, and that the attempted service provided
sufficient notice to Defendant to put on a defense.  Carol Gilbert, Inc. v. Haller (2009)
179 Cal.App.4th 852, 865-66.
 
            Pursuant
to CCP § 418.10(a)(1), Defendant moves to quash service of the summons on the
grounds that it was not properly served with the summons and complaint under
any of the methods for service provided under CCP § 415.10 et seq.  The Court notes that no proof of service was
submitted by Plaintiff – either as to the original Complaint or the First
Amended Complaint. Plaintiff did, however, file an Acknowledgment of Service
executed by Karen Luh on behalf of the moving party CHDI Foundation. The moving
party indicates that Ms. Luh signed the acknowledgement in error and that she
was not authorized to accept service for CHDI Foundation. Ms. Luh states that
she is an attorney only representing CHDI Management. (Decl., Luh, ¶¶ 1-11.)
            
            When
a Defendant challenges the Court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of
improper service of process the burden is on the Plaintiff to prove the facts
of effective service.”  Summers v.
McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413. Plaintiff must meet this burden
by a preponderance of the evidence.  See,
Ziller Elec. Lab GmbH v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1222, 1232.  Plaintiff filed a “limited” opposition in
which Plaintiff stated that Plaintiff was prepared to concede the motion so
long as this does not limit Plaintiff’s right to proceed against co-Defendant
CHDI Management.  Thus, Plaintiff
submitted no evidence to meet his burden to prove the facts of effective
service. 
 
            Therefore, Defendant’s motion to quash
service of summons and complaint is granted. Since CHDI Management is not a
moving party nothing in this ruling has any effect on CHDI Management. The
Court will note that Plaintiff’s request to somehow deem the service that was
effectuated against CHDI Foundation to be operative as to CHDI Management is
without any authority and appears to be contrary to long standing and familiar
law mandating that each Defendant be served properly.
 
            Defendant
CHDI Foundation is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
