The Plaintiffs have filed a verified Complaint seeking relief and have moved the court for an order enjoining the Defendants from proceeding with foreclosure. The motion is unopposed, which means that the other parties do not oppose it and are essentially conceding that the motion has merit. The Judge grants the motion and orders the Defendants to refrain from proceeding with foreclosure until the case is resolved.
