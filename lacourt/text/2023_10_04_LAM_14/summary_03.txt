case\_number: 23STCV02252
hearing\_date: October 4, 2023
dept: 14

case\_background:

* Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Broker refused to pay the full amount owed for several shipping containers and defamed Plaintiff.
* Plaintiff filed a Complaint for Defamation, Defamation Per Se, Trade Libel, Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage, Negligent Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage, and Unfair Competition against Defendants S&S Brokerage, Inc. and DOES 1-30 on February 1, 2023.
* The default of Defendant Broker was entered on March 23, 2023.

instant\_motion:

* Defendant Broker moves for an order setting aside their default and permitting them to file an Answer.

decision:

* Plaintiff’s Evidentiary Objections are OVERRULED.
* The motion is GRANTED. Defendant Broker is to file its Answer within one week.
* Plaintiff’s request for $4,950 in fees and costs is DENIED.

governing\_statute:

* Code of Civil Procedure §473(b) provides for relief from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against a party through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.

discussion:

* Defendant Broker was served on February 7, 2023.
* Defendant Broker’s New Jersey lawyer, Mr. Tom Reardon, attempted to settle the case with Plaintiff’s counsel and informed Plaintiff’s counsel that he would be retaining local counsel, but did not say who that would be.
* Plaintiff’s counsel told Mr. Reardon on March 22 that he would be seeking entry of default.
* Mr. Reardon then called current Defense counsel, Ms. Hillary Arrow Booth, who was formally retained on March 28.
* Default had already been entered on March 27, and Ms. Booth discovered the default on March 30.
* Defense counsel immediately emailed Plaintiff and asked for a stipulation to set aside the default.
* Plaintiff’s counsel refused, asserting that there was no basis to set aside the default.
* Code of Civil Procedure §473(b) contains two provisions for relief: one mandatory, the other discretionary.
* Defendant Broker previously filed a motion to be relieved under the mandatory provision, but it was denied because the court found that Mr. Reardon, not Ms. Booth, was the cause of the default.
* This court made the denial without prejudice, a judicial invitation to correct the motion by either producing an affidavit of fault from Mr. Reardon or making a motion under the discretionary provision of the statute.
* Plaintiff complains that this motion violates the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure §1008, but it does not.

conclusion:

* Defendant Broker is entitled to relief.
* Plaintiff has produced no evidence of proper compensatory costs.
* Therefore, the motion is GRANTED and Plaintiff’s request for $4,950 in fees and costs is DENIED.
* Defendant Broker is to file its Answer within one week.

summary:

* The Judge grants Defendant Broker's motion to set aside their default and permits them to file an Answer.
* The Judge overrules Plaintiff's evidentiary objections and denies Plaintiff's request for $4,950 in fees and costs.
* The Judge finds that Defendant Broker's New Jersey lawyer, Mr. Tom Reardon, is at fault for the default and that Defendant Broker should have retained local counsel before the default loomed.
* The Judge also finds that Plaintiff has produced no evidence of proper compensatory costs.
* The Judge makes this decision without prejudice and allows Defendant Broker to file a new motion under the discretionary provision of the statute.
