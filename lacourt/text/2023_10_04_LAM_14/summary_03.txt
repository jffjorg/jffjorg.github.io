And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Defendant Broker's motion to set aside the default and permit them to file an Answer. The Judge has also denied Plaintiff's request for $4,950 in fees and costs. The Judge found that Defendant Broker's mistake in not finding local counsel before default was entered was excusable and that the motion was properly made under Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b). The Judge also noted that Plaintiff has produced no evidence of proper compensatory costs, which are intended to compensate the opposing party for the work they did in pursuit of the default. The Judge ordered Defendant Broker to file their Answer within one week.
