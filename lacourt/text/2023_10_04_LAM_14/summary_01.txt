And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the case for delay in prosecution. The case was filed in 2020 and was ordered to arbitration in 2021, but the plaintiffs did virtually nothing to initiate the arbitration process for 2 ½ years. Only when faced with a motion to dismiss did the plaintiffs put forth any meaningful effort. The judge finds that the relevant factors weigh in favor of dismissal, including the delay in proceeding with the case, the prejudice to the defendant, and the lack of diligence shown by the plaintiffs in advancing the case. The case is dismissed without prejudice to the proceedings in arbitration.
