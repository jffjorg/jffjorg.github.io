And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the demurrer filed by Wells Fargo, without granting leave to amend, and has ordered the defendant to submit a judgment of dismissal within 10 days. The court has found that the plaintiff's amended complaint does not state a proper cause of action and that the plaintiff has failed to provide any intelligible explanation of their legal theory. The court has also rejected several additional documents filed by the plaintiff, including a "notice of remedy" and a "certificate of ownership", as being legally cognizable in any way. The court has concluded that the plaintiff is unlikely to be able to state a cause of action on which the court could grant relief, and has therefore dismissed the case.

The plaintiff's original complaint alleged that Wells Fargo took his property and that he was owed $55,977.96 in cash. The plaintiff's subsequent amendments to the complaint have not cured the defects in the original pleading, and the court has no reason to believe that the plaintiff can or will state a proper cause of action. The court has also taken issue with the plaintiff's attempts to impose a "fee" of $100 billion for the alleged trespass, as well as the plaintiff's requests for a "magistrate" and a private court.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Curtis A. Chism Jr. vs. Wells Fargo, case number 22STCV33411. The plaintiff, Curtis A. Chism Jr., filed an original complaint on October 13, 2022, alleging that Wells Fargo took his property and imposing a fee of $100 billion on the bank. The complaint was amended on June 20, 2023, to include a claim for $55,977.96 in cash. However, the amended complaint failed to state a cause of action and was uncertain. The defendant, Wells Fargo, demurred to the amended complaint, and the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. The plaintiff has filed several additional documents, including a notice of remedy, a conflict resolution and severability, a notice of arbitration and rules of court, a certificate of ownership, and an equitable claim requires injunction. However, none of these documents are properly an opposition to the demurrer, and none of them are legally cognizable. The court has found that the plaintiff has given no prospect of an intelligible amendment and that there is no reasonable probability that the plaintiff can or will state a proper cause of action in this court. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained, and the defendant is to submit a judgment of dismissal within 10 days.

This tentative ruling is a court order issued by a judge in a legal case. The case involves a plaintiff who filed a complaint alleging that Wells Fargo took some property belonging to him and imposed a fee for the offense. The plaintiff also requested a court order to press claims of trespass and required the court to provide him with a room and a magistrate. The judge sustained a demurrer filed by Wells Fargo and dismissed the case due to the plaintiff's failure to state a proper cause of action. The plaintiff filed various other documents, including a notice of remedy, a notice of arbitration and rules of court, a certificate of ownership, and a request for an injunction, but these were not properly filed in opposition to the demurrer and were not legally cognizable. The judge concluded that there was no reasonable probability that the plaintiff would ever be able to state a cause of action on which the court could grant relief.
