And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the demurrer filed by Wells Fargo, without granting leave to amend, and has ordered the defendant to submit a judgment of dismissal within 10 days. The court has found that the plaintiff's amended complaint does not state a proper cause of action and that the plaintiff has failed to provide any intelligible explanation of their legal theory. The court has also rejected several additional documents filed by the plaintiff, including a "notice of remedy" and a "certificate of ownership", as being legally cognizable in any way. The court has concluded that the plaintiff is unlikely to be able to state a cause of action on which the court could grant relief, and has therefore dismissed the case.
