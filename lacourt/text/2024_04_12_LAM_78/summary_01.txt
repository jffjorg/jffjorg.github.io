The tentative ruling is a summary of the Court's thinking on the matter. The Court has decided to continue the matter to permit the filing of a corrected default judgment package. The moving party must appear to set a continued date. The moving party must also provide notice.

The Court will grant the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment once the Plaintiff dismisses the Doe Defendants, provides a calculation of interest from counsel, and submits an updated form JUD-100. The Court awards attorneys' fees in the reduced amount of $3,057.63. The request for statutory damages in the amount of $200 is denied.
