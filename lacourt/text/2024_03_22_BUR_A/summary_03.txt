Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a lawsuit filed by Warawut Pongpradit and Arie Waisbard against Mariane Mufta Bilolo. The plaintiffs allege that they were injured in a motor vehicle accident caused by the defendant's negligence in January 2021. The defendant has moved to compel the plaintiffs to answer certain deposition questions that were not answered during a deposition on September 28, 2023. The lawyer representing the defendant instructed the plaintiffs not to answer these questions on grounds of privacy.

The judge has ruled that the motion to compel answers is granted. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have not established a compelling privacy interest and that the defendant has the right to discovery. The judge awards sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $1,425.00, which includes 7 hours of attorney work at a rate of $195 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee. The judge also declines to impose court reporter fees.

The ruling notes that the plaintiffs did not file an opposition to the motion, which may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion. The judge also finds that the burden to establish a privacy interest remains initially with the party asserting such an interest.
