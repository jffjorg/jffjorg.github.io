And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Hami Golbar, Fred Golbar, and Gol 5 Properties, LLC (Defendants) against Brandon Brooks (Plaintiff). The Court has sustained the demurrer to the seventh, tenth, and eleventh causes of action with 20 days' leave to amend. The Court has also sustained the demurrer to the ninth cause of action without leave to amend. The motion to strike is moot.

The Plaintiff alleged that the Subject Property had deficient conditions, including infestations, water damage, and unsafe common areas, and that Defendants failed to remedy these conditions. The Court found that the Plaintiff's claims for private nuisance, breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress were not sufficiently alleged. The Court also found that the Plaintiff's claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress was not a legally cognizable claim.

The Court granted 20 days' leave to amend for the Plaintiff to cure the defects in his pleading. The motion to strike is moot because the demurrer to the causes of action was sustained with leave to amend.
