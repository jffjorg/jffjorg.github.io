And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has denied FAAS Properties, LLC's motion for attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 12205. The court finds that California Civil Code § 52 affords greater protections to the disabled than 42 U.S.C. § 12205 and that the defendant is not entitled to recover attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 12205. The court also concludes that the defendant's offer of judgment of $1 under California Civil Code § 998 was reasonable and made in good faith. The court orders that the defendant may still pursue costs under California Civil Code § 998 or a memorandum of costs as the prevailing party.
