Significant Statements:

* "The Court finds that a motion to strike is an inappropriate vehicle by which to address REEF Defendants' concerns."
* "As with demurrers, the grounds for a motion to strike must appear on the face of the pleading under attack, or on a matter which the court may judicially notice."
* "The failure to allege satisfaction of conditions precedent can be fatal to a cause of action for breach of contractual liability."
* "The Court agrees that the failure to allege satisfaction of conditions precedent can be fatal to a cause of action for breach of contractual liability. Regardless, Careau concerned a motion for judgment on the pleadings and a direct challenge to a cause of action for contractual liability. Here, REEF Defendants do not challenge the cause of action for breach, only that the provision for attorney's fees has triggered. Careau contains no aversion to a motion to strike."
