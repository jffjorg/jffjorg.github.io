ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Warawut Pongpradit
(Plaintiff-Pongpradit) and Arie Waisbard (collectively Plaintiffs) bring this action against Mariane Mufta Bilolo (Defendant).
Plaintiffs allege they were injured by virtue of Defendant’s negligent
operation of a motor vehicle in January of 2021. 
 
Before the Court is a
motion to compel Plaintiff-Pongpradit
to answer certain deposition questions posed on September 28, 2023. At the
deposition, Plaintiff’s counsel instructed Plaintiff not to answer certain
question on grounds that they were violative of his right to privacy. Defendant
now seeks to compel further answers to these questions, arguing the refusal to
answer was improper. Plaintiff does not oppose the motion. 
  
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
C.C.P. §
2025.480 permits a party to seek a motion
to compel deposition answers where a deponent fails
to answer any question or produce any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s control. The Court shall
order the production or answer be given if it determines that the
matter sought is subject to discovery. (C.C.P. § 2025.480 (i).) The moving
party is required to lodge a certified copy of
the deposition transcript portions relevant to the motion. (C.C.P. §
2025.480(h).) 
 
A motion
made pursuant to C.C.P.§ 2025.480 must be made no later than 60 days
after the completion of the record of the deposition. (C.C.P.§ 2025.480
(b).) “If the court determines that the answer or production sought
is subject to discovery, it shall order that the answer be given or
production sought is subject to discovery, it shall order that
the answer be given or the production be made on the resumption of
the deposition.” (C.C.P. § 2025.480(i).)

Analysis
 
Counsel should not instruct
clients not to answer the question unless the purpose is to protect
privileged information. (See Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc.
(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1014.)
 
Under Article I § 1 of
the California Constitution, California recognizes a constitutional right to
privacy. This right “protects an individual’s reasonable expectation of
privacy against a serious invasion.” (Faunce v. Cate (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th
166, 171.) Under California law, even highly relevant, nonprivileged
information may be shielded from discovery if its disclosure would impair a
person’s inalienable right to privacy. (See Britt v. Superior
Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 855-56.) The right to privacy protects the
individual’s reasonable expectation of privacy against a serious invasion. (Pioneer
Electronics (USA), Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 40 Cal.4th 360,
370.) Generally, in evaluating a discovery dispute which involves a privacy
claim the trial court should apply the framework set forth in Hill v.
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1.
 
The California Supreme
Court, in Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, reiterated
that the Hill analysis is to be applied in determining the scope of
discovery of private information, and rejected in part some of the authority
cited in the opposition papers, holding that the burden to establish a privacy
interest remains initially with the party asserting such an interest. (Williams
supra, 3 Cal.5th 531 at 552.) The Supreme Court rejected case law which
requires a party seeking discovery of private information to establish a
compelling interest, placing the initial burden on the party asserting a
privacy objection to establish the extent and seriousness of the prospective
invasion. (Id. at 557.)
 
Here, Plaintiff has
rendered no opposition to this motion. A
failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of the
motion. (California Rules of Court, Rule 8.54(c).) Further, pursuant to Williams,
Plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a compelling privacy
interest. As Plaintiff has rendered no opposition, he has not carried his
burden. 
 
Accordingly, the motion to compel
answers is GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions

 
Monetary sanctions are mandatory against an unsuccessful
moving or opposing party unless they acted with substantial justification or
imposition of sanctions would be unjust. (C.C.P. § 2025.480 (j).) Additionally,
it is customary to grant sanctions where a party has filed a motion to compel,
and the other party fails to file an opposition. (C.R.C. Rule 3.1348(a).)  
 
As such,
the Court awards sanctions to Defendant in the amount of $1,425. This amount
reflects 7 hours of attorney work at a rate of $195 per hour, plus the $60
filing fee.  The Court declines to impose
court reporter fees. (Enge Decl. ¶ 20.). 
Since Plaintiff has not filed an opposition the Court declines to impose
sanctions of $487.50.   Sanctions are against Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s counsel jointly and severally.
