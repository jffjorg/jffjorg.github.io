ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Gibraltar Convalescent Hospital (Plaintiff) brings this
action against Lucille Mary Schermerhorn (Defendant). Plaintiff alleges Defendant
owes approximately $153,742.24 for skilled nursing care that was rendered to
Defendant’s late husband (Decedent). 
 
Before the Court are four motions to compel further
discovery responses brought by Defendant. Defendant seeks to compel Plaintiff’s
further responses to each of their Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, Requests for Production of Documents (RFPD), and Request for
Admissions (RFA). Defendant has rendered no opposition. 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Interrogatories 
 
After
receiving responses to interrogatories, the propounding party may seek an order
compelling further responses if the responses contain: (1) answers that are
evasive or incomplete, (2)¿an unwarranted or insufficiently specific exercise
of an option to produce documents in lieu of a substantive response, or (3)
unmerited or overly generalized objections. 
(C.C.P. §¿2030.300(a).) The responding party has the burden of
justifying the objections thereto. (Coy v. Sup.Ct. (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210,
220-21.)
  
Motion to
Compel Further Responses to RFPD
 
A motion
to compel further responses to RFPD may be brought based on: (1) incomplete
statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive, or incomplete claims of
inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections. 
(C.C.P. § 2031.310(c).) 
 
A motion
to compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See C.C.P. §
2031.310(b)(1).) In Digital Music News LLC v Superior Court (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 216 at 224, the Court defined “good cause” as a showing that there
“a disputed fact that is of consequence in the action and the discovery sought
will tend in reason to prove or disprove that fact or lead to other evidence
that will tend to prove or disprove the fact.”  
 
If the
moving party has shown good cause for the requests for production, the burden
is on the objecting party to justify the objections. (Kirkland v. Sup.Ct
(2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.) 
 
Motion to
Compel Further Responses on RFA
 
On
receipt of a response to requests for admission, the party requesting
admissions may move for an order compelling a further response if that party
deems that either or both of the following apply: (1) an answer to a particular
request is evasive or incomplete or (2) an objection to a particular request is
without merit or too general. (C.C.P. § 2033.290(a).)
 
II.           
MERITS 
 
Discovery
Timeline 
 
On November 3,
2023, Plaintiff propounded all discovery via mail service on Defendant’s
counsel. (Wilson Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. A.) On December 1, 2023, Plaintiff
granted Defendant’s counsel an extension on responses to December 18. (Wilson
Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. B.) On December 20, 2023, Defendant rendered replies to
each discovery request. (Wilson Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. C.) Verification of these
responses was not received until December 27 as it was mailed separately.
(Wilson Decl. ¶ 9, Exh. E.) Plaintiff’s counsel has attempted to meet and
confer with Defendant’s counsel regarding the inadequacy of the responses but
has received no reply. (Wilson Decl. ¶¶ 8, 10, Exh. D.) 
 
Form Interrogatories

 
Plaintiff seeks
further responses to its Form Interrogatories Nos. 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5,
2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, 15.1, 17.1, 50.1, 50.1, 50.1, 50.1, 50.1, 50.2, 50.3,
50.4, 50.5, and 50.6. For the majority of these Form Interrogatories, Defendant
responded simply “Objection Irrelevant”. (See Mot. Exh. C.) Some of the Form
Interrogatories are objected to instead on the basis of work product privilege or
as unduly burdensome. (See FROG Nos. 15.1 & 17.1) Neither the work product nor
the unduly burdensome objections are accompanied by an explanation. Plaintiff
asserts that these objections are without merit. By virtue of failing to oppose
the motion, Defendant has provided no argument to the contrary. As such,
Defendant has failed to carry her burden of justifying the objections. 
 
Accordingly, the
motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories is GRANTED. 
 
Special
Interrogatories 
 
Plaintiff seeks
further responses to its Special Interrogatories Nos. 1.1-5. As with
Defendant’s responses to Form Interrogatories, these responses consist entirely
of objections. Plaintiff objects on grounds of privacy (SPROG No. 1), overbroad
and unduly burdensome (SPROG Nos. 2-3), and that the requests are premature
(SPROG Nos. 4-5). None of these objections are accompanied by an explanation
and Defendant has rendered no opposition. As such, Defendant has failed to
carry her burden of justifying the objections. Failure to file an opposition to
the motion indicates the other parties' acquiescence that the motion is
meritorious. CRC Rule 8.54(c). 
 
Accordingly, the
motion to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories is GRANTED. 
 
RFPD 
 
Plaintiff seeks
further responses to its RFPD Nos. 3-9. The Court finds good cause for further
production. Each of the documents requested is directly related to this
litigation. The documents in question are Medi-Cal applications, correspondence
between the parties, and any documents that support Defendant’s contention that
the debt was paid in full. Defendant rendered objection only responses to these
RFPD, objection on grounds of privacy concerns of Plaintiff or Decedent. None
of these objections are accompanied by an explanation and Defendant has
rendered no opposition. As such, Defendant has failed to carry her burden of
justifying the objections.  As stated
above, failure to file an opposition to the motion indicates the other parties'
acquiescence that the motion is meritorious. CRC Rule 8.54(c).
 
Accordingly, the
motion to compel further responses to RFPD is GRANTED. 
 
RFA
 
Plaintiff seeks
further responses to its RFA Nos. 1-28. Defendant rendered objection only
responses to these RFA, objection on grounds of privacy concerns of Plaintiff
or Decedent. Each objection was accompanied by the following statement: 
 
without waiving the objection answering party lacks
information and belief sufficient to determine the truth or falsity of the
request despite a reasonable inquiry into the matter and therefore denies 
 
Plaintiff argues
that C.C.P. § 2033.220 allows a responding party to either deny an RFA or state
an inability to deny, but it does not allow a party to do both. The Court
agrees that Defendant’s response is incomplete by virtue of both stating an
inability to respond and yet responding regardless. Additionally, Defendant has
rendered no opposition in defense of her objections. Failure to file an
opposition to the motion indicates the other parties' acquiescence that the
motion is meritorious. CRC Rule 8.54(c).
 
Accordingly, the motion to compel further responses to
RFA is GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions 
 
As concerns motions to compel, the law only requires
sanctions in the event that a party unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel further response. (C.C.P. § 2033.290(d), C.C.P. §¿2030.300(d).) As such,
any monetary sanctions granted are within the discretionary power of the Court
as per C.C.P. § 2030.290. As per C.C.P. § 2023.010(d), failure to respond
constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. Additionally, it is customary to
grant sanctions where a party has filed a motion to compel, and the other party
fails to file an opposition. (C.R.C. Rule 3.1348(a).)  
 
Here, Plaintiff
has submitted four motions to compel further responses while Defendant has
provided no response. As such, the Court awards sanctions in the amount of $1,018.50.
This amount reflects 2.7 hours of attorney work in preparing this motion at a
rate of $355 per hour, plus the $60 filing fee. (Alami Decl. ¶ 9.)  This amount does not include the time spent
preparing a reply, as no opposition was filed, nor time required to appear for
argument as no argument was requested and the motions were unopposed. The Court
finds this amount of sanctions appropriate to compensate for the cost of all
four motions, given their relative lack of complexity and similar nature.
