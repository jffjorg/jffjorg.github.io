And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of her case. The plaintiff's case was dismissed for failure to bring it to trial within five years, and the judge has found that the motion for reconsideration is untimely. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside/vacate the dismissal, finding that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support her claims of fraud and bias. The judge has noted that the plaintiff has failed to provide an affidavit demonstrating her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, and that the plaintiff's arguments are unfounded and lack merit. The judge has also found that the plaintiff's status as a vexatious litigant is not relevant to the case, and that the plaintiff's failure to comply with prefiling requirements for writs with the Court of Appeal is not a basis for relief.
