And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer of the Moving Defendants, consisting of First American Title Company and Closing Agents Escrow, to the first three causes of action alleged by the Plaintiff, 27715 PCH LLC. The causes of action alleged are conspiracy to commit fraud, aiding and abetting, and negligent misstatements.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action and that the complaint is uncertain. The Judge grants the Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to add factual allegations as to all three causes of action.

The Judge notes that the proposed second amended complaint attached to the opposition also attempts to add four new causes of action that are beyond the scope of the demurrer. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to file and serve a second amended complaint by December 20, 2024.

This tentative ruling is subject to change after considering further arguments and evidence presented at the hearing.
