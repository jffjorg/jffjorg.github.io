MOTION
 
            Plaintiff Jean France (“Plaintiff”)
moves to compel responses from Defendants Wang Chung Family, LLC and Mashcole
Property Management, Inc. (“Defendants”) to Form Interrogatories, Set 1
(“FROG”).  Defendants also seek sanctions
against Defendants and their attorney, including monetary sanctions.  
 
Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed.
 
LEGAL
STANDARDS
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.290, “[i]f a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a
timely response . . . [t]he party to whom the interrogatories are directed
waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section
2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based
on privilege or the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010.  . . .   [and] The party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds. (a)-(b).) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.    
Discovery Requests
 
Plaintiff served Defendants with the FROG on
February 20, 2024.  (Mayberry Decl. ¶
1.)  It is unclear in what manner the
FROG were served on Defendants, but if they were served by mail, the deadline
to respond would have been March 26, 2024. 
Plaintiff extended the time for Defendants to respond to April 24,
2024.  (Mayberry Decl. ¶ 1.)  Yet, as of the filing of the motion,
Plaintiff has still not received any responses to the FROG from Defendants.  (Mayberry Decl. ¶ 8.)  
 
2.    
Monetary Sanctions
Plaintiff
requests monetary sanctions for legal fees spent in connection with the motion.  The Court finds Plaintiff’s failure to timely
respond to the FROG to be an abuse of the discovery process, warranting
monetary sanctions.  (See Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2023.010, subd. (d), 2030.290, subd. (c).)  But the Court finds Plaintiff’s request to be
procedurally defective for two reasons.  
 
First, with respect to Defendants’ counsel of
record, “where sanctions are sought against the opposing party's counsel, the
notice of motion must expressly so state. It is not enough simply to attach
declarations or a transcript showing that the deponent refused to appear or
answer questions on counsel's advice.” (Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide:
Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2024) ¶ 8:1985 (citing Blumenthal
v. Superior Court (1980) 103 CA3d 317; Marriage of Fuller (1985) 163
CA3d 1070); see also id. at ¶ 8:1986 [“Where an award is sought against the
attorney for advising the opposing party not to answer or respond, the notice
of motion must identify the opposing counsel and state that sanctions are being
sought against such counsel personally”].) 
Here, Plaintiff did not specifically identify Defendants’ counsel of
record; thus, the Court finds Plaintiff’s notice to be defective.
 
Second,
“a request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every
person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify
the type of sanction sought. The notice of motion shall be supported by a
memorandum of points and authorities, and accompanied by a declaration
setting forth facts supporting the amount of any monetary sanction sought.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.040, emphasis
added.)  Here, Plaintiff advanced the
Declaration of Brent Mayberry (“Mayberry) in support of the motion.  However, Mayberry failed to set forth facts
supporting the monetary sanctions request. 
In particular, Mayberry does not state how many hours it took him to
craft the motion and his hourly fee for representing Plaintiff in this discovery
matter.  As such, the Court finds
Plaintiff’s request to be non-compliant with Section 2023.040.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants in part Plaintiff’s motion to compel
responses to the FROG per Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290.   As such, the Court orders Defendants to
serve verified responses to the FROG, without objections, within 30 days of
notice of the Court’s orders.
  
Further, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.  
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice
of the Court’s order and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
