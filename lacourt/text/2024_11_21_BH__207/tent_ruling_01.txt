MOTION
 
This case arises from allegations that Defendants Tax Credit Group and
Pejman J. Sage (“Defendants”) failed to adequately compensate Plaintiff
Adrienne Doustkam (“Plaintiff”) for her employment with Defendants.  
 
On December 13, 2021, the Court granted Defendant’s motion for summary
adjudication as to five of Plaintiff’s causes of action.  (Minute Order, Dec. 13, 2021.)  On March 15, 2022, Plaintiff stipulated to
entry of judgment and dismissed with prejudice the remaining causes of action.  
 
On September 12, 2022, the Court granted in part Defendants’ motion
for attorneys’ fees pursuant to Labor Code section 218.5.  In so holding, the Court found that Defendants
were the “prevailing parties” and that Plaintiff had brought the action in bad
faith.  (Minute Order, Sept. 12, 2022.)   Plaintiff appealed the judgment.  
 
On July 1, 2024, the appellate court affirmed the judgment and issued
the Remittitur on September 4, 2024.  
 
Defendants now seek their attorneys’ fees and costs incurred on
appeal, pursuant to Labor Code section 218.5. 
The motion is unopposed.
 
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            Defendants request judicial notice
of the following:
 
1) The Minute Order Granting Defendants’ Motion for Summary
Adjudication, entered December 13, 2021, a true and correct copy of which is
attached as Exhibit “2.”. In that Order, the Court ruled that the first six
causes of action in Plaintiff’s SAC (breach of contract, fraud, quantum meruit,
unjust enrichment, failure to pay wages under Labor Code §201 and statutory
penalties under Labor Code § 203) all were claims for non-payment of wages. 
 
2) The Stipulation and Order re: Judgment of Dismissal, a true and
correct copy of which is attached as Exhibit “3.” That Order demonstrates that
Plaintiff dismissed her remaining causes of action with prejudice, meaning they
were not part of her appeal. 
 
3) Plaintiff’s notice of appeal of this Court’s ruling granting
Defendants’ MSA, a true and correct copy of which is attached as Exhibit “4.” 
 
4) The Minute Order awarding certain allowable litigation costs to
Defendants dated June 6, 2022, a true and correct copy of which is attached as
Exhibit “5.” 
 
5) Plaintiff’s notice of appeal of this Court’s ruling awarding
certain allowable litigation costs to Defendants, a true and correct copy of
which is attached as Exhibit “6.” 
 
6) The Minute Order awarding Defendants $156,893.84 in attorney’s fees
dated Sept. 12, 2022, a true and correct copy of which is attached as Exhibit
“7.” 
 
7) Plaintiff’s notice of appeal of this Court’s ruling awarding
Defendants $156,893.84 in attorney’s fees, a true and correct copy of which is
attached as Exhibit “8.” 
 
8) Plaintiff’s Jan. 10, 2024 notice of substitution of counsel, a true
and correct copy of which is attached as Exhibit “9.”
 
9) The September 4, 2024 Remittitur with the Opinion attached issued
by the Second District Court of Appeal affirming all of this Court’s prior
rulings in their entirety, a true and correct copy of which is attached as
Exhibit “10.”
 
Judicial notice may be taken
of records of any court in this state. 
(Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d)(1).) 
Because the requested exhibits are all part of the Court’s record for
this case, the Court may take judicial notice of them.  (Ibid.)   However, “while courts are free to take
judicial notice of the existence of each document in a court file, including
the truth of results reached, they may not take judicial notice of the truth of
hearsay statements in decisions and court files.  Courts may not take judicial notice of
allegations in affidavits, declarations and probation reports in court records
because such matters are reasonably subject to dispute and therefore require
formal proof.”  (Lockley v. Law Office
of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875,
882 [cleaned up].)  
 
Accordingly, the Court takes
judicial notice of the existence of the requested exhibits, including the truth
of results reached, but not the truth of any hearsay allegations contained
therein.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5, which outlines recoverable costs to a prevailing party under Code
of Civil Procedure section 1032, permits the recovery of attorneys’ fees when
authorized by contract, statute, or law. 
(Code Civ. Proc.. § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).)  Code of Civil Procedure section 1021 provides
“[e]xcept as attorney’s fees are specifically provided for by statute, the
measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to
the agreement, express or implied, of the parties [….]”  
 
The Code of Civil Procedure defines the “prevailing party” as follows:

 
[T]he party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a
dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains
any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any
relief against that defendant. If any party recovers other than monetary relief
and in situations other than as specified, the “prevailing party” shall be as
determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its
discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion costs between
the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under
Section 1034.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
 
Labor Code section 218.5, subdivision (a) provides in pertinent part:  “In any action brought for the nonpayment of
wages, fringe benefits, or health and welfare or pension fund contributions,
the court shall award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing
party if any party to the action requests attorney’s fees and costs upon the
initiation of the action. However, if the prevailing party in the court action
is not an employee, attorney’s fees and costs shall be awarded pursuant to this
section only if the court finds that the employee brought the court action in
bad faith.”      
 
Thus, Labor Code section 218.5 allows an employer to recover
attorney’s fees “only if the court finds the employee brought the court action
in bad faith.” “The legislative history indicates the Legislature intends
employers to recover fees when they ‘defeat frivolous claims,’ which ‘would
align the statute with the state and federal civil rights and employment
statutes.’ (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 462 (2013-2014
Reg. Sess.) July 2, 2013, p. 4).” (Arave v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
& Smith, Inc. (2018) 18 Cal.App.5th 525, 545.) “A prevailing defendant,
however, should not be awarded attorneys' fees unless the court finds the
action was objectively without foundation, or the plaintiff continued to
litigate after it clearly became so.” (Williams v. Chino Valley Independent
Fire Dist., (2015) 61 Cal.4th 97, 115.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
1.     Entitlement
to Fees
 
            There is no dispute that Defendants
are the prevailing parties, both in the proceedings in this Court and on
appeal. The primary question is whether the appeal was brought in bad faith.
 
            In awarding Defendants’ attorneys’
fees in part pursuant to Labor Code section 218.5, the Court previously
determined that “Plaintiff’s wage claims had no objective, factual basis but
instead were premised solely on her unsupported belief that Defendants must
have been withholding payments due to her because they had not paid her any
such commissions by October 2016 even though she apparently felt some
commissions must have been due to her.” 
(Minute Order, Sept. 12, 2022 at p. 5.) 
As such, the Court found “Plaintiff’s causes of action against Defendant
are deemed to have been raised in bad faith as the term is used in Labor Code §
218.5.”  (Id. at p. 6.)
 
            Similarly, on appeal, the appellate
court affirmed the grant of summary adjudication and award of attorneys’ fees,
including the Court’s finding that Plaintiff brought suit in “bad faith” under
Labor Code section 218.5, because, despite a diligent inquiry, Plaintiff was
unable to uncover any evidence that Defendants had withheld any
commission payments owed to Plaintiff.  
 
            As such, the Court finds Plaintiff
similarly had no good faith ground upon which to appeal those findings.  Therefore, Plaintiff also filed the appeal in
“bad faith” as that term is used in Labor Code section 218.5 and Defendants are
generally entitled to their attorneys’ fees and costs incurred on appeal.
 
2.     Reasonableness
of Fees Sought
 
Defendants seek the following attorneys’ fees:
 
Mark
Share (Partner) – 14.5 hours (appeal) - $585/hr = $8,482.50
Mark
Share (Partner) – 9.5 hours (appeal) $635/hr = $6,032.50
Mark
Share (Partner) – 5 hours (fee motion) $635/hr = $3,175
Martha
Cohen (Contract Attorney) – 29.5 hours (appeal) $330/hr = $9,735
Craig
Newton (Contract Attorney) – 15 (fee motion) $395 = $5,925
 
            The Court does not find the hourly
rates or the fees incurred on appeal unreasonable, and Plaintiff has not
opposed the motion to argue otherwise. 
However, the Court does find expending 20 hours on this fee motion alone
to be excessive.  As such, the Court declines
to award 10 hours incurred by Craig Newton on the fee motion.
 
3.     Costs
 
Defendants also seek $433.20 in costs incurred on appeal, representing
$390 in filing fees and $43.20 incurred in the transmitting, filing, and
serving of the record, briefs, and other papers.  (See Memorandum of Costs.)  The Court of Appeal expressly held that
Defendants were entitled to their costs incurred on appeal.  Further, because the judgment and attorney
fee order were affirmed in their entirety, Defendants are the prevailing
parties on appeal.  Therefore,
Defendants’ request for costs is granted.
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, the Court grants in part
Defendants’ unopposed motion for attorneys’ fees and costs.  Moving Defendants are entitled to recover a
total of $29,833.20, representing $29,400 in attorneys’ fees and $433.20 in
costs.   
 
Moving Defendants shall provide notice of
the Court’s ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.  Further, Defendants shall serve and lodge
with the Court a proposed Order and Judgment in conformance with the Court’s
ruling on or before December 13, 2024.
