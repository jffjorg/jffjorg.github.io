And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants in part the defendants' unopposed motion for attorneys' fees and costs. The defendants are the prevailing parties in the case, and the plaintiff brought the action in bad faith. The judge finds that the plaintiff's wage claims had no objective, factual basis and were premised solely on her unsupported belief that the defendants must have been withholding payments due to her. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's appeal of the judgment and the award of attorneys' fees and costs was brought in bad faith.

The judge awards the defendants $29,400 in attorneys' fees and $433.20 in costs. The judge also finds that the hourly rates and fees incurred on appeal by the defendants' attorneys are reasonable, but declines to award 10 hours incurred by one of the attorneys on the fee motion.

The judge concludes that the defendants are entitled to recover a total of $29,833.20, representing $29,400 in attorneys' fees and $433.20 in costs. The defendants must provide notice of the court's ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
