And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted in part and denied in part the motion to compel further responses to the Request for Production (RFP) filed by Plaintiff Myriad Pictures, Inc. The motion was filed to compel Defendants Jake Seal, Orwo Film Distribution LLC, and PVS Studios to provide further, verified, code-compliant responses to certain financial records related to the production and distribution of the "Jeepers Creepers" movie franchise.

The judge found that the motion was timely and that the Defendants' unverified responses to the RFP were inadequate. The judge ordered the Defendants to provide further, verified, code-compliant responses to the RFP within 20 days of notice of the order.

The judge also denied as premature Plaintiff's motion to compel a further production of the financial records, as the Plaintiff has not yet received verified, code-compliant responses to the RFP.

Finally, the judge granted in part Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the Defendants and ordered them to pay $2,910 in attorney fees and filing fees.
