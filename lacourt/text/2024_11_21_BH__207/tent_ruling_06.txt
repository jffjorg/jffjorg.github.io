MOTION
 
On June 11, 2024, Plaintiff 27715 PCH LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed suit
against Defendants Closing Agents Escrow (“Closing Agents”); First American
Title Company (“First American”) and Judith Sender (“Sender”).  The operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)
alleges four causes of action; three against Closing Agents for (1) Conspiracy
to Commit Fraud; (2) Aiding and Abetting; and (3) Negligent Misstatements; and
the fourth against First American for Vicarious Liability.
 
Closing Agents and Sender (“Moving Defendants”) demur to all three
causes of action alleged against them for failure to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
430.10, subdivision (e).  Plaintiff
opposes the demurrer and Moving Defendants reply.
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.     DEMURRER
 
“It is black letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of
the allegations in a complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015)
235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  In testing the sufficiency of a cause of
action, a court accepts “[a]s true all material facts properly pled and matters
which may be judicially noticed but disregard contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.  [A court
also gives] the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole
and its parts in their context.”  (290
Division (EAT), LLC v. City & County of San Francisco (2022) 86
Cal.App.5th 439, 450 [cleaned up]; Hacker v. Homeward Residential, Inc.
(2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 270, 280 [“in considering the merits of a demurrer,
however, “the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be”].)
 
Further, in ruling on a demurrer, a court must “liberally construe”
the allegations of the complaint “with a view to substantial justice between
the parties.”  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)  “This rule of liberal construction
means that the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not
the defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)   
 
In summary, “[d]etermining whether the complaint is sufficient as
against the demurrer on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, the rule is that if on consideration of all the
facts stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of
the court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the
facts may not be clearly stated, or may be intermingled with a statement of
other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown, or although the plaintiff
may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)
 
A.   
FAILURE TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION
 
                                                        
i.         
First Cause
of Action – Conspiracy to Commit Fraud
 
“Civil conspiracy is not an
independent tort. Instead, it is a legal doctrine that imposes liability on
persons who, although not actually committing a tort themselves, share with the
immediate tortfeasors a common plan or design in its perpetration. By participation
in a civil conspiracy, a coconspirator effectively adopts as his or her own the
torts of other coconspirators within the ambit of the conspiracy.  In this way, a coconspirator incurs tort
liability co-equal with the immediate tortfeasors.”  (City of Industry v. City of Fillmore
(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 191, 211-212 [cleaned up].)  “The elements of a civil conspiracy are (1)
the formation of a group of two or more persons who agreed to a common plan or
design to commit a tortious act; (2) a wrongful act committed pursuant to the
agreement; and (3) resulting damages.”  (Id.
at pp. 211-212.)
 
Here, the underlying wrong
alleged is fraud.  The elements for
fraudulent misrepresentation are “(1) the defendant represented to the
plaintiff that an important fact was true; (2) that representation was false;
(3) the defendant knew that the representation was false when the defendant
made it, or the defendant made the representation recklessly and without regard
for its truth; (4) the defendant intended that the plaintiff rely on the
representation; (5) the plaintiff reasonably relied on the representation; (6)
the plaintiff was harmed; and (7) the plaintiff's reliance on the defendant's
representation was a substantial factor in causing that harm to the plaintiff.”  (Graham v. Bank of America, N.A.
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 594, 605–606.)  
 
“In California, fraud must be
pled specifically; general and conclusory allegations do not suffice.”  (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12
Cal.4th 631, 645.)  “This particularity
requirement necessitates pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom,
and by what means the representations were tendered.”  (Ibid.)  
 
“One of the purposes of the
specificity requirement is notice to the defendant, to furnish the defendant
with certain definite charges which can be intelligently met.”  (Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement
System & Planning Assn., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1384.)  As such, less specificity is required “when
it appears from the nature of the allegations that the defendant must
necessarily possess full information concerning the facts of the
controversy[.]”  (Ibid.)  “Even under the strict rules of common law
pleading, one of the canons was that less particularity is required when the
facts lie more in the knowledge of the opposite party.”  (Ibid.)
 
Here, the FAC alleges:
 
11. On
June 12, 2021 the Plaintiff 27715 entered into a California Residential
Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”; Exhibit A) for the sale of 27715
Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu, California (the “Malibu Property”) for the
purchase amount of $16,000,000.00. The Purchaser was a California limited
liability Company by the name of Hacopian Design & Development Group, LLC
spearheaded by its sole principal Ando Hacopian (together “Hacopian”).
 
12.
Hacopian put together financing for the purchase of the Malibu Property. The
principal lender was Marquee Funding Group, Inc. which contributed
$11,000,000.00 and was granted a first position deed of trust. Hacopian induced
Plaintiff to provide carryback financing. Hacopian would satisfy all prior
liens and payment of Plaintiff’s closing costs and Plaintiff was to receive the
net sum of $6,000,000.00. Plaintiff was to receive $2,000,000 payable in cash
at closing (the “Net Cash at Closing”) and the remaining $4,000,000.00 through
two promissory notes from Hacopian each in the amount of $2,000,000 at Closing.

 
13. In
the days between the June 12, 2021 execution of the Purchase Agreement and the
closing held on July 1, 2024, Plaintiff learned that Hacopian was getting
involved with a private lender by the name of VIG Private Lending, Inc. and its
affiliate the Val Serebryany Family Trust. (together “VIG”). VIG lent Hacopian
a total of $5,225,000.00 and took a second priority deed of trust on the Malibu
Property. 
 
14. In
anticipation of settlement on the property, Hacopian opened escrow with the
Defendant Closing Agents through Sender, its principal. At all relevant times,
Sender was acting in her capacity as an officer of Closing Agents and as an
authorized agent acting on behalf of First American. 
 
15. Prior
to closing, Hacopian represented to Plaintiff that its lender required that
$1,000,000.00 of the Net Cash at Closing be held back for a brief time (the
“$1mm Holdback”) following the closing pending receipt of something called a
title insurance indemnification letter. (the “Escrow Representations”).
Defendant Sender was copied on the email in which Hacopian made the
representation. (Exhibit B). 
 
16.
Trusting in what it believed to be Hacopian’s good faith, and believing the
Escrow Representations to be true, on or about June 29th, 2021, Plaintiff
entered into an Amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”;
Exhibit C) which stated in pertinent part as follows: 
 
1.
Closing. Seller shall receive a minimum of One Million ($1,000,000) Dollars of
the closing proceeds immediately upon closing which is scheduled for on or
around June 28th, 2021. 
 
2.
Release of the Funds: Seller shall receive the Funds held back in escrow upon
the occurrence of the first of the following events: 
 
A.
Receipt of an indemnification letter from the Title Insurance Company or 
 
B. July
25th, 2021. 
 
Upon the
occurrence of the earlier of the aforementioned events, the Funds shall
immediately wire funds to the Seller. A default in the payment of the funds by
July 25th, 2021 shall result in the assessment of a ten percent penalty. 
 
17.
Plaintiff would not have closed the transaction, and conveyed title to Hacopian
but for the Escrow Representations that Hacopian made to Plaintiff. 
 
18. As it
developed, Plaintiff never received any indication that a title indemnification
letter was ever issued or even required. 
 
19. The
July 25, 2021 deadline came and went, and Plaintiff has never received any
portion of the $1,000,000.00 that Hacopian represented had been held back by
Marquee. 
 
20. Upon
information and belief, the whole story concerning the Escrow Holdback was a
charade engineered by Hacopian to trick Plaintiff into closing the transaction,
rather than calling a default and pursuing its right to, inter alia, liquidated
damages. 
 
21. Upon
information and belief, The Closing Agents and Sender were aware that the HDDG
was making specific representations regarding the lender’s requirements to hold
back $1,000,000 from the closing. These Defendants were aware that no monies
were held back from the Lender yet conspired with Hacopian to intentionally
withhold the information from the Plaintiff causing Plaintiffs to complete the
transaction. 
 
22. Upon
information and belief, the Defendants were fully aware that Marquee did not
insist upon the $1mm Holdback and that the Escrow Representations were
fraudulent as a result, Plaintiff received only half of the Cash Due at
Closing. 
 
23. A few
months following the closing, Hacopian defaulted on its obligations to VIG as a
consequence of which VIG foreclosed on its deed of trust, extinguishing
Plaintiff’s third position $2mm deed of trust. The bottom line here is that
Plaintiff was to receive $6 million from the sale of the Malibu Property to
Hacopian. Instead, it received only $1 million.
 
[…]
 
25.
Plaintiff alleges the following upon information and belief: 
 
(a) The
Escrow Representations were representations of fact that were false when made; 
 
(b)
Defendants and Hacopian knew the Escrow Representations were false; 
 
(c)
Defendants and Hacopian made the Escrow Representations to Plaintiff with the
intent of inducing Plaintiff’s reliance upon them; 
 
(d)
Plaintiff reasonably relied upon the Escrow Representations to its detriment; 
 
(e)
Plaintiff’s reliance upon the Escrow Representations caused it to sustain
material injury and harm. 
 
26.
Plaintiff alleges the following upon information and belief:
 
(a)
Closing Agents and Hacopian formed and operated a conspiracy to wrongfully and
fraudulently induce Plaintiff into closing the sale of the Malibu Property; 
 
(b) In
furtherance of this conspiracy, Hacopian made the fraudulent Escrow
Representations to Plaintiff; 
 
(c) On
June 29, 2021, counsel for the Plaintiff emailed Sender asking where in the
closing documents the $1mm Holdback was referenced. Sender sent the following
response (Exhibit D) which she knew to be false: Title does not want to insure
against Mechanic’s Liens and the Lender is concerned that some mechanics may
come forward with large Liens, the Buyer is negotiating with them for the last
few days to reach agreement; 
 
(d) But
for the fraudulent conspiracy formed and operated by Closing Agents, Sender and
Hacopian, Plaintiff would not have closed the sale of the Malibu Property
because it was deceived into believing that Hacopian was going to provide the
$2 million Net Cash when in fact he had no intention of doing so. 
 
(e) By
reason of the foregoing, Plaintiff was fraudulently induced into closing the
sale of the Malibu Property, resulting in a $5,000,000 loss. 
 
(f)
Alternatively, Plaintiff was defrauded out of the $1mm Holdback as a result of
the aforementioned conspiracy. 
 
27. By
reason of the foregoing, Plaintiff is entitled to Judgment awarding damages in
an amount to be determined by the trier of fact, as well as the costs of this
action including reasonable attorneys (sic) fees.
 
(FAC ¶¶ 11-27.)
 
Thus, although Plaintiff
alleges specific facts about Hacopian’s fraud, Plaintiff’s only allegations
with respect to Moving Defendants’ knowledge or involvement in Hacopian’s fraud
are made on information and belief.  But
allegations made “on information and belief,” are insufficient to satisfy the
heightened pleading requirement “unless the facts upon which the belief is
founded are stated in the pleading.”  (Dowling
v. Spring Val. Water Co. (1917) 174 Cal. 218, 221.)
 
Therefore, the Court sustains Moving Defendants’ demurrer to the first
cause of action.
 
                                                      
ii.         
Second Cause
of Action – Aiding and Abetting
 
“Liability may also be imposed
on one who aids and abets the commission of an intentional tort if the person
(a) knows the other's conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives
substantial assistance or encouragement to the other to so act or (b) gives
substantial assistance to the other in accomplishing a tortious result and the
person's own conduct, separately considered, constitutes a breach of duty to
the third person.”  (Stueve Bros.
Farms, LLC v. Berger Kahn (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 303, 324.)
 
In addition to the above
allegations, the FAC alleges:
 
29. Upon
information and belief, Closing Agents and Sender knew that Hacopian’s conduct
in making the Escrow Representations was wrongful. 
 
30. Upon
information and belief, knowing that Hacopian’s conduct was unlawful, Closing
Agents gave substantial assistance and/or encouragement to Hacopian in
fraudulently inducing Plaintiff into closing the Sale of the Malibu Property.
By making false representations to Plaintiff regarding the $1mm Holdback,
Closing agents and Sender, separately considered, breached a duty to Plaintiff.

 
31. By
reason of the foregoing, Closing Agents and Sender aided and abetted Hacopian’s
fraud and are liable to Plaintiff for the damages proximately caused thereby,
in an amount to be determined by the trier of fact.
 
(FAC ¶¶ 29-31.)
 
            Again,
the only allegations concerning Moving Defendants’ knowledge of or provision of
substantial assistance to the fraud are made upon “information and belief”
which is insufficient to satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of
fraud.  
 
            Therefore,
the Court sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action.
 
                                                    
iii.         
Third Cause
of Action – Negligence
 
“The elements of a negligence cause
of action are the existence of a legal duty of care, breach of that duty, and
proximate cause resulting in injury.” (Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp (2013)
220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998, citation omitted.) 
Here, Plaintiff alleges:
 
33. When
asked by Plaintiff’s attorney to verify the $1mm Holdback, Sender owed to
Plaintiff a duty of care in formulating her response. 
 
34. Even
if she did not know that the $1mm Holdback was a fraud, Sender had a duty to
verify that it was a legitimate aspect of the transaction before confirming
that it was. 
 
35. By
representing that the Lender in fact was requiring the $1mm Holdback, thereby
giving assurance that Plaintiff would receive the full $2mm Net at Closing,
Sender made a negligent misstatement to Plaintiff and is liable to Plaintiff
for all damages proximately caused thereby, in an amount to be determined by
the trier of fact.
 
(FAC ¶¶ 33-35.)
 
Moving Defendants argue that
as the escrow holder, their only duty of care was to follow the joint escrow
instructions, but “an escrow holder has no general duty to police the affairs
of its depositors; rather, an escrow holder’s obligations are limited to
faithful compliance with [the depositors’] instructions.”  (Summit Fin. Holdings, Ltd. v. Cont’l
Lawyers Title Co. (2002) 27 Cal.4th 705, 711 (hereafter Summit).)  
 
Plaintiff attempts to
distinguish Summit on the grounds that the aggrieved party there was not
a party to the escrow, and therefore the escrow holder owed them no general
duty of care.  By contrast, here,
Plaintiff argues, Moving Defendants failed to follow the escrow instructions to
pay Plaintiff $2 million.
 
But the FAC alleges that, upon
Hacopian’s misrepresentation to Plaintiff, Plaintiff and Hacopian entered into
an amended purchase agreement, that provided for $1 million to be held back.  (FAC ¶ 16.) 
Thus, Plaintiff alleges that Moving Defendants followed the joint escrow
instructions as laid out in the amended purchase agreement, and Moving
Defendants owed no general duty of care to investigate or police the
transaction beyond following those joint instructions in the operative amended
purchase agreement.
 
Therefore, the Court sustains
Moving Defendants’ demurrer to the third cause of action.
 
2.    
LEAVE TO AMEND
 
A plaintiff has the burden of showing in what
manner the complaint could be amended and how the amendment would change the
legal effect of the complaint, i.e., state a cause of action. (See The
Inland Oversight Committee v. City of San Bernardino (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th
771, 779; PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v. Hulven Int'l, Inc. (2017)
14 Cal.App.5th 156, 189.) A plaintiff must not only state the legal basis for
the amendment, but also the factual allegations sufficient to state a cause of
action or claim. (See PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v. Hulven Int'l, Inc.,
supra, 14 Cal.App.5th at p. 189.) Moreover, a plaintiff does not meet his
or her burden by merely stating in the opposition to a demurrer or motion to
strike that “if the Court finds the operative complaint deficient, plaintiff
respectfully requests leave to amend.” (See Major Clients Agency v Diemer
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1133; Graham v. Bank of America (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 594, 618 [asserting an abstract right to amend does not satisfy the
burden].)
 
Here, Plaintiff requests leave to amend the complaint to add
allegations that Moving Defendants knew or should have known that the lender
did not in fact require that $1 million be held back from the transaction, yet
failed to raise the issue to Plaintiff and instead simply went along with the
fraudulent transaction.  
 
Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiff leave to amend to add these
factual allegations as to all three causes of action.  However, the Court notes that the proposed
second amended complaint Plaintiff has attached to the opposition also attempts
to add four new causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of
contract against Closing Agent and against First American, respectively.  These new causes of action are beyond the
scope of the demurrer.  If Plaintiff
wants to add additional causes of action or factual allegations unrelated to
the existing causes of action, Plaintiff must move for leave to amend the
complaint.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the reasons stated, the Court sustains Moving Defendants’ demurrer
to the first three causes of action with leave to amend.  Plaintiff shall file and serve a second
amended complaint in conformance with this ruling on or before December 20,
2024.
 
Moving Defendants shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file
the notice with a proof of service forthwith.

MOTION
 
On June 11, 2024, Plaintiff 27715 PCH LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed suit
against Defendants Closing Agents Escrow (“Closing Agents”); First American
Title Company (“First American”) and Judith Sender (“Sender”).  The operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)
alleges four causes of action; three against Closing Agents for (1) Conspiracy
to Commit Fraud; (2) Aiding and Abetting; and (3) Negligent Misstatements; and
the fourth against First American for Vicarious Liability.
 
First American now demurs to the fourth cause of action for failure to
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and uncertainty pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivisions (e) and (f),
respectively.  Plaintiff opposes the
demurrer and First American replies.
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.     DEMURRER
 
“It is black letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of
the allegations in a complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015)
235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  In testing the sufficiency of a cause of
action, a court accepts “[a]s true all material facts properly pled and matters
which may be judicially noticed but disregard contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.  [A court
also gives] the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole
and its parts in their context.”  (290
Division (EAT), LLC v. City & County of San Francisco (2022) 86
Cal.App.5th 439, 450 [cleaned up]; Hacker v. Homeward Residential, Inc.
(2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 270, 280 [“in considering the merits of a demurrer,
however, “the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be”].)
 
Further, in ruling on a demurrer, a court must “liberally construe”
the allegations of the complaint “with a view to substantial justice between
the parties.”  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)  “This rule of liberal construction
means that the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not
the defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)   
 
In summary, “[d]etermining whether the complaint is sufficient as
against the demurrer on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, the rule is that if on consideration of all the
facts stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of
the court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the
facts may not be clearly stated, or may be intermingled with a statement of
other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown, or although the plaintiff
may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)
 
A.   
UNCERTAINTY
 
“[D]emurrers for uncertainty are disfavored.”  (Lickiss v. Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.)  A demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained
only where the pleading is so bad that the responding party cannot reasonably
respond - i.e., he or she cannot reasonably determine what issues must be
admitted or denied, or what claims are directed against him or her.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  Where a
demurrer is made upon the ground of uncertainty, the demurrer must distinctly
specify exactly how or why the pleading is uncertain, and where such
uncertainty appears by reference to page and line numbers.  (See Fenton v. Groveland Comm. Services
Dist. (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 797, 809.) 

 
Here, the FAC generally
alleges:
 
11. On
June 12, 2021 the Plaintiff 27715 entered into a California Residential
Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”; Exhibit A) for the sale of 27715
Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu, California (the “Malibu Property”) for the
purchase amount of $16,000,000.00. The Purchaser was a California limited
liability Company by the name of Hacopian Design & Development Group, LLC
spearheaded by its sole principal Ando Hacopian (together “Hacopian”).
 
12.
Hacopian put together financing for the purchase of the Malibu Property. The
principal lender was Marquee Funding Group, Inc. which contributed
$11,000,000.00 and was granted a first position deed of trust. Hacopian induced
Plaintiff to provide carryback financing. Hacopian would satisfy all prior
liens and payment of Plaintiff’s closing costs and Plaintiff was to receive the
net sum of $6,000,000.00. Plaintiff was to receive $2,000,000 payable in cash
at closing (the “Net Cash at Closing”) and the remaining $4,000,000.00 through
two promissory notes from Hacopian each in the amount of $2,000,000 at Closing.

 
13. In
the days between the June 12, 2021 execution of the Purchase Agreement and the
closing held on July 1, 2024, Plaintiff learned that Hacopian was getting
involved with a private lender by the name of VIG Private Lending, Inc. and its
affiliate the Val Serebryany Family Trust. (together “VIG”). VIG lent Hacopian
a total of $5,225,000.00 and took a second priority deed of trust on the Malibu
Property. 
 
14. In
anticipation of settlement on the property, Hacopian opened escrow with the
Defendant Closing Agents through Sender, its principal. At all relevant times,
Sender was acting in her capacity as an officer of Closing Agents and as an
authorized agent acting on behalf of First American. 
 
15. Prior
to closing, Hacopian represented to Plaintiff that its lender required that
$1,000,000.00 of the Net Cash at Closing be held back for a brief time (the
“$1mm Holdback”) following the closing pending receipt of something called a
title insurance indemnification letter. (the “Escrow Representations”).
Defendant Sender was copied on the email in which Hacopian made the
representation. (Exhibit B). 
 
16.
Trusting in what it believed to be Hacopian’s good faith, and believing the
Escrow Representations to be true, on or about June 29th, 2021, Plaintiff
entered into an Amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”;
Exhibit C) which stated in pertinent part as follows: 
 
1.
Closing. Seller shall receive a minimum of One Million ($1,000,000) Dollars of
the closing proceeds immediately upon closing which is scheduled for on or
around June 28th, 2021. 
 
2.
Release of the Funds: Seller shall receive the Funds held back in escrow upon
the occurrence of the first of the following events: 
 
A.
Receipt of an indemnification letter from the Title Insurance Company or 
 
B. July
25th, 2021. 
 
Upon the
occurrence of the earlier of the aforementioned events, the Funds shall
immediately wire funds to the Seller. A default in the payment of the funds by
July 25th, 2021 shall result in the assessment of a ten percent penalty. 
 
17.
Plaintiff would not have closed the transaction, and conveyed title to Hacopian
but for the Escrow Representations that Hacopian made to Plaintiff. 
 
18. As it
developed, Plaintiff never received any indication that a title indemnification
letter was ever issued or even required. 
 
19. The
July 25, 2021 deadline came and went, and Plaintiff has never received any
portion of the $1,000,000.00 that Hacopian represented had been held back by
Marquee. 
 
20. Upon
information and belief, the whole story concerning the Escrow Holdback was a
charade engineered by Hacopian to trick Plaintiff into closing the transaction,
rather than calling a default and pursuing its right to, inter alia, liquidated
damages. 
 
21. Upon
information and belief, The Closing Agents and Sender were aware that the HDDG
was making specific representations regarding the lender’s requirements to hold
back $1,000,000 from the closing. These Defendants were aware that no monies
were held back from the Lender yet conspired with Hacopian to intentionally
withhold the information from the Plaintiff causing Plaintiffs to complete the
transaction. 
 
22. Upon
information and belief, the Defendants were fully aware that Marquee did not
insist upon the $1mm Holdback and that the Escrow Representations were
fraudulent as a result, Plaintiff received only half of the Cash Due at
Closing. 
 
23. A few
months following the closing, Hacopian defaulted on its obligations to VIG as a
consequence of which VIG foreclosed on its deed of trust, extinguishing
Plaintiff’s third position $2mm deed of trust. The bottom line here is that
Plaintiff was to receive $6 million from the sale of the Malibu Property to
Hacopian. Instead, it received only $1 million.
 
[…]
 
25.
Plaintiff alleges the following upon information and belief: 
 
(a) The
Escrow Representations were representations of fact that were false when made; 
 
(b)
Defendants and Hacopian knew the Escrow Representations were false; 
 
(c)
Defendants and Hacopian made the Escrow Representations to Plaintiff with the
intent of inducing Plaintiff’s reliance upon them; 
 
(d)
Plaintiff reasonably relied upon the Escrow Representations to its detriment; 
 
(e)
Plaintiff’s reliance upon the Escrow Representations caused it to sustain
material injury and harm. 
 
26.
Plaintiff alleges the following upon information and belief:
 
(a)
Closing Agents and Hacopian formed and operated a conspiracy to wrongfully and
fraudulently induce Plaintiff into closing the sale of the Malibu Property; 
 
(b) In
furtherance of this conspiracy, Hacopian made the fraudulent Escrow
Representations to Plaintiff; 
 
(c) On
June 29, 2021, counsel for the Plaintiff emailed Sender asking where in the
closing documents the $1mm Holdback was referenced. Sender sent the following
response (Exhibit D) which she knew to be false: Title does not want to insure
against Mechanic’s Liens and the Lender is concerned that some mechanics may
come forward with large Liens, the Buyer is negotiating with them for the last
few days to reach agreement; 
 
(d) But
for the fraudulent conspiracy formed and operated by Closing Agents, Sender and
Hacopian, Plaintiff would not have closed the sale of the Malibu Property
because it was deceived into believing that Hacopian was going to provide the
$2 million Net Cash when in fact he had no intention of doing so. 
 
(e) By
reason of the foregoing, Plaintiff was fraudulently induced into closing the
sale of the Malibu Property, resulting in a $5,000,000 loss. 
 
(f)
Alternatively, Plaintiff was defrauded out of the $1mm Holdback as a result of
the aforementioned conspiracy. 
 
27. By
reason of the foregoing, Plaintiff is entitled to Judgment awarding damages in
an amount to be determined by the trier of fact, as well as the costs of this
action including reasonable attorneys (sic) fees.
 
[…]
 
29. Upon
information and belief, Closing Agents and Sender knew that Hacopian’s conduct
in making the Escrow Representations was wrongful. 
 
30. Upon
information and belief, knowing that Hacopian’s conduct was unlawful, Closing
Agents gave substantial assistance and/or encouragement to Hacopian in
fraudulently inducing Plaintiff into closing the Sale of the Malibu Property.
By making false representations to Plaintiff regarding the $1mm Holdback,
Closing agents and Sender, separately considered, breached a duty to Plaintiff.

 
31. By
reason of the foregoing, Closing Agents and Sender aided and abetted Hacopian’s
fraud and are liable to Plaintiff for the damages proximately caused thereby,
in an amount to be determined by the trier of fact.
 
[…]
 
33. When
asked by Plaintiff’s attorney to verify the $1mm Holdback, Sender owed to
Plaintiff a duty of care in formulating her response. 
 
34. Even
if she did not know that the $1mm Holdback was a fraud, Sender had a duty to
verify that it was a legitimate aspect of the transaction before confirming
that it was. 
 
35. By
representing that the Lender in fact was requiring the $1mm Holdback, thereby
giving assurance that Plaintiff would receive the full $2mm Net at Closing,
Sender made a negligent misstatement to Plaintiff and is liable to Plaintiff
for all damages proximately caused thereby, in an amount to be determined by
the trier of fact.
 
(FAC ¶¶ 11-35.)  As to First American, the FAC alleges only:
 
36.
Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1-35 of
this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.
 
37. At
all relevant times, Closing Agents and Sender were agents of First American,
and the wrongful acts alleged above were committed within the scope of the
agency. 
 
38. By
reason of the foregoing First American is liable for the above pled torts
committed by Closing Agent and Sender under the theory of Respondeat
Superior.
 
(FAC ¶¶ 36-38.)
 
            Thus, Plaintiff seeks to hold First
American vicariously liable for the conduct of Closing Agents and Sender, but
Plaintiff has not alleged the first three causes of action against First
American.  Therefore, it is unclear what
allegations First American must admit or deny or what causes of action are
being brought against it by virtue of Closing Agent and Sender’s alleged
misconduct.
 
            As such, the Court sustains First
American’s demurrer to the fourth cause of action on the basis of uncertainty.
 
2.    
LEAVE TO AMEND
 
A plaintiff has the burden of showing in what
manner the complaint could be amended and how the amendment would change the
legal effect of the complaint, i.e., state a cause of action. (See The
Inland Oversight Committee v. City of San Bernardino (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th
771, 779; PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v. Hulven Int'l, Inc. (2017)
14 Cal.App.5th 156, 189.) A plaintiff must not only state the legal basis for
the amendment, but also the factual allegations sufficient to state a cause of
action or claim. (See PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v. Hulven Int'l, Inc.,
supra, 14 Cal.App.5th at p. 189.) Moreover, a plaintiff does not meet his
or her burden by merely stating in the opposition to a demurrer or motion to
strike that “if the Court finds the operative complaint deficient, plaintiff
respectfully requests leave to amend.” (See Major Clients Agency v Diemer
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1133; Graham v. Bank of America (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 594, 618 [asserting an abstract right to amend does not satisfy the
burden].)
 
Here, Plaintiff requests leave to amend the complaint to add
allegations that First American is Closing Agent’s sub-escrow agent.  But this would establish that First American
is the agent of Closing Agent, such that Closing Agent could be vicariously
liable for First American’s conduct, not the other way around.  
 
Therefore, Plaintiff has not provided the Court any facts that
could be added to the complaint to establish that First American is vicariously
liable for Closing Agent’s and/or Sender’s alleged misconduct.
 
Further, the Court notes that the proposed second amended
complaint Plaintiff has attached to the opposition also attempts to add four
new causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract
against Closing Agent and against First American, respectively.  These new causes of action are beyond the
scope of demurrer.  If Plaintiff wants to
add additional causes of action or factual allegations unrelated to the
existing causes of action, Plaintiff must move for leave to amend the
complaint.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the reasons stated, the Court sustains First American’s demurrer
to the fourth cause of action without leave to amend.  Further, the Court will enter the proposed
Order lodged on October 4, 2024.     
 
First American shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the
notice with a proof of service forthwith.
