And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted in part the motion to compel responses to the Form Interrogatories (FROG) served by Plaintiff Jean France. The Judge orders the Defendants to serve verified responses to the FROG, without objections, within 30 days of notice of the Court's order. However, the Judge has denied Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, finding that the notice of motion was defective and did not comply with the relevant statutes. The Judge has also noted that Plaintiff's failure to provide facts supporting the amount of monetary sanctions requested was a procedural defect.
