And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Carlos Aguilar v. P.F. Chang's III, LLC, hearing on November 13, 2023. The case involves a product liability action stemming from Aguilar's alleged consumption of fried rice from a P.F. Chang's restaurant in Sherman Oaks on August 4, 2021, which resulted in injuries. The defendant, P.F. Chang's, demurred to the complaint and moved to strike certain allegations. The court has sustained the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation with leave to amend, meaning that Aguilar must refile the claim with sufficient specificity. The court has also granted the defendant's motion to strike Aguilar's prayer for attorney fees, but has given Aguilar leave to amend to provide a basis for the fees. Finally, the court has granted the defendant's motion to strike allegations against defendant Christine Doe, the supervisor and/or manager of the restaurant at the time of the incident, finding that she is not personally liable and that the defendant, P.F. Chang's, has standing to argue this point.
