Plaintiff alleges on December 10, 2016, Plaintiff underwent a
esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed by Dr. Jonathan S. Matthew, MD with the
assistance of Dr. Laurence Friedman. However, the procedure fell below the
standard of care. Plaintiff further alleges on January 23, 2020, she was seen

RULING:
 
I.                   
Defendant Jamshid Nazarian, M.D.’s
Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One and Request for
Sanctions GRANTED
II.                 
Defendant Jamshid Nazarian, M.D.’s
Motion to Deem Request for Admissions Set One Admitted and Request for

DISCUSSION
 
Defendant Jamshid Nazarian, M.D. moves the court for
an order to deem Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions, Set One admitted as well
as moves the court for an order compelling Plaintiff to provide responses to
Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set One. Defendant also requests sanctions
against Plaintiff. 
 
Where
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may
make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300, 2033.280; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve a timely response to the
discovery request waives any objection to the request, including one based on
privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (CCP §§2030.290(a),
2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra,
148 Cal.App.4th at 404.) Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010,
the propounding party may also move for an order that the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (CCP § 2033.280(b).)
 
On
June 20, 2023, Defendant propounded discovery on Plaintiff, which included
Special Interrogatories, Set One and Request for Admissions, Set One (Trotter
Decl. ¶2, Exh. A.) Such responses were due on or before June 20, 2023. (Trotter
Decl. ¶2.) Multiple meet and confer attempts were made with Plaintiff’s
counsel; however, no response was ever received from Plaintiff’s counsel.
(Trotter Decl. ¶3, Exh. B.) To date, no responses have been received from
Plaintiff. (Trotter Decl. ¶4.) 
 
As such, Defendant’s unopposed motion to compel
Plaintiff’s discovery responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set One;
and Request for Admissions, Set One is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to produce
verified discovery responses without objection in twenty days.
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant
requests $960.00 per motion for 2 hours preparing each motion and another 2
hours reviewing the opposition and attending the hearing on each motion.
Defendant also seeks the $60 filing fee per motion against Plaintiff. 
 
If a propounding party moves for and obtains a court
order compelling a response, the court shall impose monetary sanctions against
the party failing to timely respond to interrogatories and demands for
inspection unless that party acted with substantial justification or the
sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c), 2033.280(c); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.) 
 
Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED, in the reduced amount of $735 for
the first motion and $285 for the second motion. The court finds only one hour
necessary for attending the hearing on the two motions.
