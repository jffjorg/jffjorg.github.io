And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendants' motion to compel arbitration, ordering that the Plaintiff's claims against the three Culichitown corporate entities shall be resolved by binding arbitration. The Judge finds that the arbitration agreement is valid and covers all claims related to employment, including those predicated on allegations of sexual harassment. The Judge also rejects the Plaintiff's arguments that the agreement is unconscionable and that the other corporate entities are not signatories to the agreement. The case is stayed only with respect to the Defendants who are subject to the arbitration agreement.
