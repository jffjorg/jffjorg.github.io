Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules on a motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production of Documents (RPDs) filed by the plaintiffs, Full Count, Inc. and Karyn McCarthy. The plaintiffs seek responses from the defendants, LucasFilm Entertainment Company Ltd. and Blue Stockings, Inc., regarding various documents and communications related to the hiring process for an executive producer position on a television show called Acolyte.

The judge grants some of the requests, including RPD #14, which seeks a copy of the series overview and season one bible, and RPD #21, which seeks documents and communications related to any payment by the defendants to Jeff King, the person who replaced Karyn McCarthy as executive producer. The judge also grants RPD #23, which seeks documents related to the organizational structure of the production of Acolyte.

The judge denies other requests, including RPD #3, which seeks all documents and communications related to the hiring process for any executive producer position on Acolyte, and RPD #26, which seeks all documents and communications related to revenues earned or expected to be earned through the licensing and/or distribution of Acolyte.

The judge also rules on a motion for a protective order filed by the defendants, which seeks to exclude Leslie Lindeman, Karyn McCarthy's husband, from her deposition. The judge is troubled by the lack of documentation showing Lindeman's status as an officer of Full Count, Inc., but does not make a tentative ruling on the motion.
