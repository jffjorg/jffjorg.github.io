And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, James Foster and Lane Marsh Realty, Inc., moved to compel responses to their interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demand for identification and inspection of documents. The plaintiff, Alyssa Balken, failed to serve timely responses, and the defendants moved for an order compelling responses and for monetary sanctions. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to serve timely responses waives all objections, including privilege and work product, and that the defendants' motions are denied as moot since the plaintiff has since provided responses. The court also grants the defendants' request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,363, payable by the plaintiff and her counsel to the defendants and their counsel within 30 days of entry of this order.
