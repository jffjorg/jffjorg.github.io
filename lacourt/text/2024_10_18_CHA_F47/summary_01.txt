And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel further responses from the defendant, Kia America, Inc. The defendant had failed to provide proper responses to certain discovery requests, despite having served verified responses. The judge finds that the defendant's objections to certain requests were not justified and that the defendant has failed to provide adequate explanations for its failure to comply with discovery obligations.

The judge orders the defendant to provide further responses to the discovery requests and to produce responsive documents within 30 days. The judge also awards sanctions to the plaintiffs in the amount of $2,760.00, which represents the attorney fees and costs incurred by the plaintiffs in preparing and prosecuting the motion.

The judge's ruling is based on the defendant's failure to comply with its discovery obligations, despite having been given multiple opportunities to do so. The judge finds that the defendant's opposition to the motion was confusing and that the defendant has failed to provide adequate explanations for its actions.
