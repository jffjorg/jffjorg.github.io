RULING: The motion is granted as set forth
below.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiffs Arelis Lopex and
Gene Lopez’s (Plaintiffs) purchase of a 2019 Kia Forte (the Vehicle)
manufactured and/or distributed and warranted by Defendant Kia America, Inc.
(Defendant).  Plaintiffs contend that the
Vehicle was/is defective and unsafe as it has recurring and unpredictable transmission,
electrical and other defects.  Plaintiffs
allege that despite frequent repair visits and Defendant’s inability to fix the
problems after a reasonable number of attempts, Defendant failed to replace the
Vehicle in accordance with the Song-Beverly Act.
 
On 3/30/23, Plaintiffs filed this action against
Defendant for: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty,
(2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Civil Code 1793.2.  On 5/8/23, Defendant answered the complaint.
 
On 12/28/23, Plaintiffs served Defendant with Requests
for Production of Documents, Set 1. 
(Thomas Decl., Ex.A).  Defendant
served verified responses on 2/13/24. 
(Thomas Decl., Ex.B).  In response
to Requests 26, 33-36 and 38-41, Defendant asserted objections and refused to
produce any documents.  Id.  On 4/1/24, Plaintiffs sent a meet and confer
letter regarding the deficiencies in certain of the responses and offered to
sign the Los Angeles County Superior Court Model Protective Order.  (Thomas Decl., Ex.C).  Defendant responded indicating that it would
be supplementing its responses to Requests 26, 33-36 and 38-41 by 5/10/24.  (Thomas Decl., Ex.D).  On 4/30/24, Defendant agreed to extend the
deadline for a motion to compel further responses to 5/24/24.  (Thomas Decl., Ex.E).  On 5/13/24, Plaintiffs sent an email regarding
the overdue supplemental responses to which Defendant did not respond.  (Thomas Decl., Ex.F).  
 
On 5/24/24, Plaintiffs filed and served the instant
motion seeking an order compelling Defendant 
to provide further responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests for Production of
Documents, Set 1.  Additionally,
Plaintiffs requests an order imposing sanctions against Defendant and its
attorneys of record, Lehrman, Villegas, Chinery & Douglas, LLP, in the
amount of $3,210.00.  Defendant has
opposed the motion and Plaintiffs have filed a reply to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
The  opposition is
confusing.  At points it claims that further
responses and production have been provided; however, at other points, it
claims that by the time the motion is heard, Defendant will have provided
code-compliant responses and served documents responsive to Requests 26, 33-36
and 38-41 which are the requests at issue in this motion.  (See Opposition, p.2:14-20, p.3:2-9,
p.4:5-7; Chang Decl. ¶¶3-4).  The
opposition goes on to argue that sanctions are not warranted because there was
never any misuse/abuse of the discovery process by Defendant.  
 
The reply to the opposition states that as of the time of
the filing of the opposition on 10/11/24, Defendant has not provided proper further
responses to the subject document requests. 
The reply indicates that Defendant has produced additional documents that
appear to be responsive to some of the requests at issue.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.
 
The opposition essentially concedes that further
responses and production to Requests 26, 33-36 and 38-41 are warranted as
Defendant indicates that such have been or will be provided before the
hearing.  Since Defendant has not
provided any evidence that proper, verified further responses to the subject
document requests have been served and has failed to justify its objections, Defendant
is ordered to provide further responses to Requests 26, 33-36 and 38-41 and to
produce responsive documents within 30 days.
 
The Court further finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to
an award of sanctions against Defendant and its attorneys of record, Lehrman,
Villegas, Chinery & Douglas, LLP, in the amount of $2,760.00 (3 hours to
prepare motion + 2 hours to review opposition and draft reply +1 hour to
prepare for and appear at hearing multiplied by $450/hour + $60 filing fee),
for their failure to comply with their discovery obligations.  (See Thomas Decl. ¶¶13-15 – the Court
notes that the Thomas declaration includes an error in the calculation of
attorneys’ fees).  Defendant fails to
provide an adequate explanation as to why proper responses and production to
the discovery requests have not been provided in the more than 9 months since
the discovery requests were served on Defendant.  Sanctions are payable within 30 days.
