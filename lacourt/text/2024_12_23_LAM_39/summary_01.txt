And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to compel Defendant Mag Estate Property LLC to produce its person most qualified to testify at deposition. The court finds that Defendant failed to appear for the deposition after being served with a notice of deposition and has not served a valid objection to that deposition notice. The court also notes that Defendant offered dates in January 2025 for the deposition to take place, which led the court to decline imposing sanctions against Defendant at this time. The court orders Defendant to produce its person most qualified for an in-person deposition within 20 days of notice of this order, unless Plaintiff stipulates otherwise.
