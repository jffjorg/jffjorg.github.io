And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to quash the defendants' subpoenas to Transparent Arts, Inc. and Blizzfull, but the denial is without prejudice. This means that the plaintiff can still file a motion to quash or other procedural vehicle in the context of the arbitration to challenge the subpoenas. The judge has also denied the defendants' request for sanctions. The motion to quash was filed because the arbitration is stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration, and the plaintiff does not want to produce the documents or information requested by the subpoenas. The judge has determined that the subpoenas are reasonable and necessary for the arbitration, and that the court has jurisdiction to hear the motion to quash. However, the judge has noted that the stay of proceedings pending arbitration places the proceedings in a "twilight zone" of abatement, and that the court's power to revisit the foundational question of whether the parties are bound by the arbitration agreement is limited.
