And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to quash the defendants' subpoenas to Transparent Arts, Inc. and Blizzfull, but the denial is without prejudice. This means that the plaintiff can still file a motion to quash or other procedural vehicle in the context of the arbitration to challenge the subpoenas. The judge has also denied the defendants' request for sanctions. The motion to quash was filed because the arbitration is stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration, and the plaintiff does not want to produce the documents or information requested by the subpoenas. The judge has determined that the subpoenas are reasonable and necessary for the arbitration, and that the court has jurisdiction to hear the motion to quash. However, the judge has noted that the stay of proceedings pending arbitration places the proceedings in a "twilight zone" of abatement, and that the court's power to revisit the foundational question of whether the parties are bound by the arbitration agreement is limited.

## Summary of Judge's Tentative Ruling 

The judge denies Plaintiff's motion to quash subpoenas issued to Transparent Arts, Inc. and Blizzfull, but does so without prejudice. This means the Plaintiff can re-file the motion, potentially to the arbitrator, once the arbitration process is underway.  

The judge explains that because the case is currently stayed pending arbitration, the court lacks jurisdiction to rule on the subpoenas. The matters regarding subpoenas, discovery disputes, and other procedural issues are best handled within the arbitration process.

The judge also denies Defendants' request for sanctions against the Plaintiff. While acknowledging the Plaintiff filed the motion incorrectly, the judge believes it was substantially justified given the delays in the arbitration and the sensitive nature of the privacy issues involved.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to quash the defendants' subpoenas to Transparent Arts, Inc. and Blizzfull without prejudice. This means that the plaintiff can still challenge the subpoenas at a later time, perhaps in the context of the arbitration. The judge also denied the defendants' request for sanctions, finding that the plaintiff's conduct in filing the motion in court was substantially justified given the important privacy issues at stake. The court notes that the arbitration process is still pending, and the parties will need to continue to follow the procedures set forth in the arbitration agreement.
