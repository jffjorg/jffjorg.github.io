 Case Number:  21STCV24492    Hearing Date:   September 28, 2023    Dept:  29  
TENTATIVE


The Court CONTINUES
the hearing on Defendant’s motion. 
Background
This case (Case No. 21STCV24492) (the
“Smith Case”) and the related case (Case No. 21STCV23847) (the “Marinero Case”)
both arise out of a multi-vehicle accident on July 6, 2019.
In the Smith Case, Plaintiff Lloyd Smith (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint on July 1, 2021, against Defendants Angelica Bianca Diaz,
Luis Rodriguez, and Does 1 through 50.  Rodriguez
and Diaz each filed an answer on February 1, 2023.  Also in February 2023, Rodriguez filed a
cross-complaint against Diaz, and Diaz filed a cross-complaint against Luis
Rodriguez.
In the Marinero Case, Plaintiffs Luis
Felix Marinero, Ana Rodriguez, and Nathaly Rodriguez filed a complaint on June
28, 2021, against Diaz and Does 1 through 25. 
Diaz filed an answer on August 20, 2021.
In this case (the Smith
Case), on February 1, 2023, counsel for Defendant Rodriguez (“Defendant”) states
that he served Requests For Admission (“RFAs”) on Plaintiff on February 1,
2023. (Mahlstedt Decl., ¶ 5.) Counsel states that no response to the RFAs was
ever received.  (Id., ¶ 6.) 
On April 27, 2023,
Defendant filed this motion for an order that the truth of each matter
specified and the genuineness of each document specified in the RFAs be deemed
admitted and conclusively established for all purposes in this action. The
motion also requests monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and his attorney.
Plaintiff has filed no
opposition to the motion.
Legal Standard
A party must respond to requests for admission within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests
for admission are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding party
may move for an order that the truth of the matters specified in the requests
be deemed admitted. (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall” make the order that the truth of the matters
specified in the request be deemed admitted unless the court “finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before
the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission
that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St.
Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both,
whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated
this motion [to deem admitted the matters contained in the requests for
admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil
Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d),
defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond
to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Defendant’s counsel states in his
declaration that he served RFAs on Plaintiff and never received a
response.  (Mahlstedt
Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.)  Counsel also states that
the RFAs are attached as Exhibit A to his declaration, but the declaration in
the Court’s file has no Exhibit A attached. 

The Court CONTINUES the
hearing on this motion for approximately 30 days to give Defendant’s counsel
the opportunity to cure this oversight.
Conclusion
The hearing is CONTINUED for approximately 30 days.
 
Moving party is
ordered to give notice to all parties.
