The judge awards an additional monetary sanction of $395.00 to defendant, calculated based on two hours of attorney time and a filing fee.

## English Text Summary

The Judge issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ana Zuniga vs. Julia McDonough. The Judge denied Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions but granted a motion for additional monetary sanctions against Plaintiff.

The issue stems from Plaintiff's failure to comply with a court order to provide discovery responses. Although the Court previously imposed monetary sanctions on Plaintiff, she still hasn't complied. 

The Judge acknowledged that Plaintiff's conduct warrants substantial sanctions, but a terminating sanction is too drastic a remedy at this point. The Court emphasizes that terminating sanctions are reserved for extreme cases, and will consider further sanctions if Plaintiff continues to violate court orders.
