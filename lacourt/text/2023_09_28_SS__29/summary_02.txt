And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies defendant Julia McDonough's motion for terminating sanctions against plaintiff Ana Zuniga. However, the judge grants defendant's request for a further monetary sanction in the amount of $395.00. The ruling is based on the fact that plaintiff has failed to comply with the court's January 12, 2023 order to provide verified responses to defendant's discovery requests, despite previous warnings and sanctions. The judge notes that terminating sanctions are a drastic remedy and are only appropriate in extreme cases, and that plaintiff's conduct merits substantial sanctions but not terminating sanctions at this time. The judge awards an additional monetary sanction of $395.00 to defendant, calculated based on two hours of attorney time and a filing fee.
