This tentative ruling involves a case arising from a motor vehicle accident on July 16, 2018. Plaintiff Lawrence Stewart filed a complaint against DM Pest Control, Inc., David Kim, and Does 1 through 25 on January 21, 2020, alleging one cause of action for motor vehicle negligence. The case is currently considering Defendants' motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production Nos. 53, 54, 58, and 61 and for monetary sanctions.

The legal standard for a motion to compel further responses requires the demanding party to show specific facts of good cause for the discovery and be accompanied by a meet-and-confer declaration and a separate statement. The court may impose a monetary sanction on any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response without substantial justification.

The ruling denies the motion to compel further responses to Requests Nos. 53 and 54, which seek Plaintiff's federal and state tax returns from 2017 to the present. The request is denied as the information sought is covered by the tax return privilege.

The ruling grants in part the motion to compel further response to Request No. 58, which seeks Plaintiff's bank statements from 2017 to the present. The Court finds that Defendants' legitimate interest in obtaining the information regarding Plaintiff's income outweighs Plaintiff's substantial privacy interest. However, Plaintiff may redact all information on the bank statements relating to withdrawals, debits, expenditures, and subtractions from the account.

The ruling denies each party's request for sanctions. The Court finds that each party acted with substantial justification on those matters as to which they have been unsuccessful.
