**English Summary:**

The judge has tentatively decided to continue the hearing on a motion filed by Defendant Luis Rodriguez. The motion requests that the court deem certain facts in unresponded-to Requests for Admission (RFAs) as admitted by Plaintiff Lloyd Smith. The judge is continuing the hearing because Defendant's counsel did not include the RFAs as an exhibit in their declaration to the court. 

The judge is requiring Defendant's counsel to provide the missing exhibit to the court within approximately 30 days. 

Under California law, if a party fails to respond to RFAs within 30 days, the propounding party may move the court to deem the facts in the RFAs admitted. If the court grants this motion, the facts in the RFAs are considered true for all purposes in the case. The judge also has the authority to impose monetary sanctions on the party who failed to respond to the RFAs.
