And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge continues the hearing on Defendant's motion to deem admitted the truth of each matter specified in the Requests For Admission (RFAs) served on Plaintiff. The Defendant's counsel states that they served the RFAs on February 1, 2023, but did not receive a response. The Defendant is seeking an order deeming the truth of each matter specified in the RFAs admitted and is also seeking monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff and his attorney.

The Judge notes that under California Code of Civil Procedure, § 2033.250, a party must respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. If a party fails to respond, the propounding party may move for an order deeming the truth of the matters specified in the requests admitted. The Judge also notes that the court is required to impose a monetary sanction on the party or attorney who failed to serve a timely response to requests for admission.

The Judge continues the hearing for approximately 30 days to give Defendant's counsel the opportunity to cure an oversight in their declaration.
