And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Evgeny Yalanskiy (Plaintiff) against Axel Albin-Lax and Christina Albin-Lax (Defendants). The case involves a dispute over liability for damages caused by two dogs owned by the Defendants, which allegedly attacked the Plaintiff. The Defendants had served a deposition notice on Zanoza, Inc., a party to the action, but Zanoza failed to appear at the deposition and did not produce any documents.

The Judge grants the motion to compel Zanoza to attend and testify at the deposition and to produce the documents requested in the deposition notice. The Judge also grants in part the request for monetary sanctions against Zanoza and its counsel, Joseph W. Kellener, in the amount of $492.90. The Judge orders Zanoza to designate and produce for deposition the person(s) most qualified to testify on the topics set forth in the deposition notice and to produce the documents requested. The deposition is scheduled to take place on October 12, 2023, through remote means.
