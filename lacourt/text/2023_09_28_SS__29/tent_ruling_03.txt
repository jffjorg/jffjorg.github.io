 Case Number:  21STCV01197    Hearing Date:   September 28, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE 
 
The Court GRANTS Defendants’
motion to compel the Person Most Knowledgeable at Zamora, Inc. to attend,
testify, and produce documents at deposition. 
 
The Court GRANTS in part Defendants’
request for monetary sanctions. 
 
Background 
 
On January 12, 2021, Plaintiff Evgeny Yalanskiy
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Axel Albin-Lax and Christina
Albin-Lax (“Defendants”) asserting causes of action for: (1) strict liability
pursuant to Civil Code, Section 3342; and (2) negligence. The complaint alleges
that Plaintiff was at a property located at 10809 Hartsook Street, North
Hollywood, California 91601 (the “Property”) when two of Defendants’ unleashed
dogs ran towards him and viciously attacked him. 
 
On March 11, 2022, Defendants filed a Cross-Complaint
against Zanoza, Inc. (“Zanoza”) and Roes 1 through 5.  On May 31, 2022, Defendants filed a First
Amended Cross-Complaint against Zanoza and Roes 1 through 5.  In the First Amended Cross-Complaint,
Defendants allege that Zanoza owned the Property, that Zanoza rented it to
Defendants knowing that they would have dogs on the Property, that Defendants
had no knowledge that Plaintiff or anyone else would enter the Property, and
that Zanoza permitted Plaintiff, its employee, to enter the Property without
telling him that dogs would be present. 
 
On July 27, 2022, Zanoza filed an answer to the
Cross-Complaint.
 
On July 13, 2023, Defendants noticed the deposition of
Zanoza for August 1, 2023.  (Flannery
Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. B.)  By agreement of
all parties, the deposition was continued to and renoticed for August 23.  (Id., ¶ 5 & Exh. D.)
 
On August 22, Zanoza’s counsel advised that the
representative of Zanoza would not appear for deposition.  (Id., ¶ 6.)  No one representing Zanoza appeared at the
deposition.  (Id., ¶ 8.) Defendant’s
counsel attempted to contact Zanoza’s counsel to inquire about the
non-appearance but, as of the filing of the motion, had not heard from Zanoza’s
counsel.  (Id., ¶ 7.)
 
On August 31, 2023, Defendants filed and served this
motion to compel Zanoza to attend and testify at the deposition and to produce
the documents set forth in the deposition notice.  Defendants also seek monetary sanctions. 
 
Legal
Standard 
 
“Any party may
obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any person,
including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The service of a
deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a party to the
action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party to
attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280, subd. (a).)
Section 2025.230
provides: “If the deponent named is not a natural person, the deposition notice
shall describe with reasonable particularity the matters on which examination
is requested.  In that event, the deponent
shall designate and produce at the deposition those of its officers, directors,
managing agents, employees, or agents who are most qualified to testify on its
behalf as to those matters to the extent of any information known or reasonably
available to the deponent.”  
Section 2025.410,
subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at least three
days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition notice does
not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through 2025.280.
“If, after
service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director,
managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party
under Section 2025.230,
without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear
for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance
and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.”  (Id.,  §
2025.450, subd. (a).)  Any such motion to compel must show good
cause for the production of documents and, when a deponent has failed to
appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (b).)   
When a motion to
compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (c).) 
In Chapter 7 of the Civil
Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
Discussion            
 
Defendants
noticed the deposition of Zanoza, a party to this action.  (Flannery Decl., Exhs. B & D.) Although
Plaintiff served an objection, Zanoza did not. Zanoza did not appear at the
deposition.  (Id. ¶ 8.)
 
No party has
opposed this motion to compel.
 
Defendants
have satisfied all of the procedural and substantive requirements for their
motion for an order compelling Zanoza to appear, testify, and produce
documents.  The motion is GRANTED.
 
Defendants’
request for sanctions is also GRANTED in part. 
The Court awards monetary sanctions in the amount of $492.90, calculated
as three hours of attorney time, multiplied by counsel’s billing rate of $143.75
per hour, plus a filing fee of $61.65. 
(See Flannery Decl., ¶ 8.)

The Court
GRANTS the motion to compel.
 
Zanoza is
ORDERED to designate and produce for deposition the person(s) most qualified to
testify on the topics set forth in the deposition notice served on or about
August 7, 2023 (Exhibit D to the Declaration of Courtney D. Flannery filed with
the Court on August 31, 2023).  The

means.

further ORDERED to produce at the deposition (electronically) the documents requested
in the deposition notice served on or about August 7, 2023 (Exhibit D to the

The Court
GRANTS in part Defendants’ request for sanctions.
