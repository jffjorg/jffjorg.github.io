## English Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the County of Los Angeles against a Complaint filed by Mallium Annoxmimbar. The Judge found the Complaint to be "uncertain" and "unintelligible" because it lacks a clear legal claim and instead consists of a series of unrelated personal facts, including an allegation that the University of Davis Medical Center implanted a computer chip in the Plaintiff's brain.

While demurrers based on uncertainty are generally disfavored, the Judge ruled that the Plaintiff's Complaint is so confusing that it impairs the Defendant's ability to understand the claim. 

Therefore, the demurrer is sustained, meaning the Complaint is dismissed.  However, the Judge is granting the Plaintiff leave to amend their Complaint and file a revised version by October 2, 2023. If an amended complaint is not filed by that date, the case will be dismissed.

**English Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge is leaning towards sustaining the County of Los Angeles' demurrer to Mallium Annoxmimbar's complaint because the complaint is unintelligible and uncertain.  The complaint lacks a clear cause of action and instead contains a collection of seemingly unrelated personal facts, including a bizarre claim about a computer chip implant. Although the judge finds the complaint deficient, they are giving the Plaintiff one last chance to amend their complaint and file it by October 2, 2023. If the Plaintiff fails to do so, the case will be dismissed. The judge's decision to grant leave to amend is influenced by the fact that the defendant mentioned a 60-page complaint, while the filed complaint is only 3 pages, suggesting a possible filing error.

**Summary in English Text:**

The Judge issued a tentative ruling sustaining the Defendant's demurrer to the Plaintiff's Complaint. The Defendant, the County of Los Angeles, argued that the Complaint filed by Mallium Annoxmimbar was unintelligible and uncertain. The Judge agreed, finding the Complaint lacked a clear cause of action and contained only a series of unrelated facts, including an allegation about a computer chip implanted by a medical center.  Because the Complaint was so unclear, the Defendant couldn't reasonably respond. However, the Judge is giving the Plaintiff an opportunity to amend the Complaint and clarify their claims. The Plaintiff has until October 2, 2023, to file an amended Complaint. If they fail to do so, the case will be dismissed. There was a discrepancy over the page number, the defendant stated the complaint was 60 pages, but it was actually 3. The judge granted leave to amend, in part, because of this filing defect.
