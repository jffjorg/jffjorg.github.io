And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the County of Los Angeles. The County had argued that the Complaint filed by Mallium Annoxmimbar is unclear and uncertain, and the judge has agreed. The Complaint is deemed uncertain because it is completely devoid of any comprehensible cause of action and instead contains a litany of unrelated facts about the Plaintiff's personal history. The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the Plaintiff has the opportunity to revise and refile the Complaint. The amended complaint must be filed on or before October 2, 2023. If the amended complaint is not filed, the matter will be dismissed.
