## English Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the County of Los Angeles against a Complaint filed by Mallium Annoxmimbar. The Judge found the Complaint to be "uncertain" and "unintelligible" because it lacks a clear legal claim and instead consists of a series of unrelated personal facts, including an allegation that the University of Davis Medical Center implanted a computer chip in the Plaintiff's brain.

While demurrers based on uncertainty are generally disfavored, the Judge ruled that the Plaintiff's Complaint is so confusing that it impairs the Defendant's ability to understand the claim. 

Therefore, the demurrer is sustained, meaning the Complaint is dismissed.  However, the Judge is granting the Plaintiff leave to amend their Complaint and file a revised version by October 2, 2023. If an amended complaint is not filed by that date, the case will be dismissed.
