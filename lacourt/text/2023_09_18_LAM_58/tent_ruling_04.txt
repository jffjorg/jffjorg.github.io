Background and procedural history
 
            This
action arises from a dispute over the real property located at 2906 East Ave.,
R7, Palmdale, CA 93550 (Property). On May 16, 2022, Plaintiffs Kathleen Bevan
(as Successor Trustee of the Gilbert A. Bolton Trust 2012), Kathleen Bevan, and
Adam Bolton (Plaintiffs) filed a Complaint against Defendants Cordelia Higley
and Midfirst Bank – alleging causes of action for (1.) sale by partition, (2.)
cancellation of quitclaim deeds, (3.) cancellation of affidavit of death of
joint tenant, and (4.) cancellation of grant deeds. 
 
            Now,
Defendant Cordelia Higley’s counsel – James Hornbuckle – seeks to be relieved,
citing an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. No
opposition was filed.
 
            The
motion to be relieved is denied.   
 
Discussion
 
            An attorney is entitled to withdraw
upon the consent of the client, or without that consent if approved by the
court. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284; Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) In the latter case, counsel must make a motion to be
relieved as attorney of record.  The
motion must be made using mandatory forms: Notice of Motion and Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel – Civil (MC-051), Declaration (MC-052), and Proposed Order
(MC-053). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (a), (b), (e).) 
 
            The declaration accompanying the
motion to be relieved as counsel must state “in general terms and without
compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1).” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (b).)
 
            The notice to the client must be
done by personal service, electronically, or mail. If it is done via mail under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1013, it must be accompanied by a declaration
confirming the service address to be the most current residence or that it is
the client’s last known address, and the attorney has been unable to locate a
more current address. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (d)(1)(A)-(B).) 
 
            Here, Attorney Hornbuckle has complied with the Rules of Court by filing all the
appropriate forms (MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053). He has also submitted a supporting
declaration providing an adequate explanation for why he is moving to be
relieved as counsel. Additionally, Form MC-052 indicates that notice was
provided to Defendant Higley via mail and his client’s address was confirmed by
return receipt.
 
However, this motion is set to be heard on September 18,
2023, and trial in this matter is set for the following day – September 19,
2023. The prejudice to Defendant Higley in granting this motion is substantial; it would leave her without
an attorney for trial.    
 
Accordingly, the Court denies the motion to be relieved as
counsel based on the substantial prejudice to Defendant Higley.
