And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Defendant Cordelia Higley's attorney, James Hornbuckle, seeking to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed due to an alleged irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. However, the judge denied the motion, citing the substantial prejudice it would cause to Defendant Higley, who would be left without an attorney for trial. The judge noted that the attorney had complied with the necessary procedures and filed the required forms, including a supporting declaration explaining why he was seeking to be relieved as counsel. The judge also considered the fact that the motion was set to be heard on September 18, 2023, and trial was set for the following day, September 19, 2023, and determined that granting the motion would cause substantial prejudice to Defendant Higley.
