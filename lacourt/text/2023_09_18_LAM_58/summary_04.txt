However, the judge denied the motion, citing the substantial prejudice it would cause to Defendant Higley, who would be left without an attorney for trial. The judge noted that the attorney had complied with the necessary procedures and filed the required forms, including a supporting declaration explaining why he was seeking to be relieved as counsel. The judge also considered the fact that the motion was set to be heard on September 18, 2023, and trial was set for the following day, September 19, 2023, and determined that granting the motion would cause substantial prejudice to Defendant Higley.

## English Summary

The judge is denying the motion of Defendant Cordelia Higley's attorney, James Hornbuckle, to be relieved as counsel. 

Hornbuckle filed the proper paperwork and provided a valid reason for seeking withdrawal. However, the judge determined that granting the motion would cause substantial prejudice to Higley because trial is scheduled just one day after the hearing on the motion. This would leave Higley without legal representation for trial, which is not in her best interest.
