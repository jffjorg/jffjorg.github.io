The judge also considered the fact that the motion was set to be heard on September 18, 2023, and trial was set for the following day, September 19, 2023, and determined that granting the motion would cause substantial prejudice to Defendant Higley.

## English Summary

The judge is denying the motion of Defendant Cordelia Higley's attorney, James Hornbuckle, to be relieved as counsel. 

Hornbuckle filed the proper paperwork and provided a valid reason for seeking withdrawal. However, the judge determined that granting the motion would cause substantial prejudice to Higley because trial is scheduled just one day after the hearing on the motion. This would leave Higley without legal representation for trial, which is not in her best interest.

**English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

Plaintiffs Kathleen Bevan (both individually and as trustee) and Adam Bolton sued Cordelia Higley and Midfirst Bank over a property in Palmdale, California.  They want to force a sale of the property and cancel several deeds.  Cordelia Higley's lawyer, James Hornbuckle, asked the court to allow him to stop representing her, citing a complete breakdown in their relationship.  He followed all the correct procedures and notified Higley.  However, the judge *denied* the request.  The reason is that the trial is scheduled for *the very next day* after the hearing on the lawyer's request.  The judge ruled that allowing the lawyer to withdraw would severely prejudice Higley by leaving her without legal representation at trial.
