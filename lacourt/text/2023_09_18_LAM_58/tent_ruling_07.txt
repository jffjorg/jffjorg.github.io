 
             On May 30, 2023, Plaintiff Mallium Annoxmimbar
(Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against “the City and the County of Los Angeles.”
 
On July 24, 2023, Defendant County
of Los Angeles (Defendant) filed a demurrer to the Complaint. No opposition was
filed.   
 
            The demurrer
is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
Legal Standard for
Demurrers
 
A demurrer is an objection to a
pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the face of the
complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice. Code
Civ. Proc. § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the
sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v.
Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law . . . .” ’ ”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007)
152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court
liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has
been stated. (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50
Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
Allegations
in the Complaint
 
Defendant
County argues the allegations are entirely unintelligible and uncertain. Defendant’s
demurrer based on uncertainty is well-taken. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10 establishes
that a pleading that is “uncertain” is subject to demurrer, defining
“uncertain” to include “ambiguous and unintelligible.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (f).) However, a demurrer based on uncertainty is disfavored and
will be strictly construed, even when the pleading is uncertain in some
respects, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
practices. (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 616.) 
 
Nevertheless, a demurrer for uncertainty is properly
sustained where the complaint is so confusing that the defendant's ability to
understand the complaint is impaired. (Cf. Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition
Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2 [though “inconvenient, annoying
and inconsiderate,” lack of labels for causes of action did not substantially
impair defendant's ability to understand complaint, so demurrer on ground of
uncertainty should have been overruled].)
 
Here,
the Complaint is completely devoid of any comprehensible cause of action; instead,
the Complaint contains only a litany of unrelated facts pertaining to
Plaintiff’s personal history– including an allegation that the University of
Davis Medical Center implanted a computer chip in Plaintiff’s brain. The
Complaint is uncertain. 
 
In
determining whether or not to grant leave to amend, the Court notes that Defendant
refers to Plaintiff’s “60-page Complaint” in the demurrer but Plaintiff’s filed
Complaint is only three pages. While the possibility of successfully amending
seems remote, Plaintiff’s apparent filing defect, alone, warrants granting
leave to amend. 
 
The
demurrer is sustained with leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
 
The demurrer is sustained. Plaintiff
shall have leave to amend. The amended complaint shall be served and filed on
or before October 2, 2023.  If an amended
complaint is not filed by then, the matter will be dismissed.
