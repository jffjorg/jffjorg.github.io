   [1] It is  unclear to the Court what changes were made to the amended motions, as the only  difference the Court can find is a proof of service for the motion to compel  responses to Specially Prepared Interrogatories Set One. Either way, the Court  will proceed based on the amended motions. [2] The Court  notes that paragraph 4 of the Forberg Declarations states the discovery  requests were served on December 19, 2022. (Forberg Decls., ¶ 4.) However, the  proofs of service attached to the discovery requests indicate they were served  on August 23, 2023, which is also the date listed in Defendants’ motions.
