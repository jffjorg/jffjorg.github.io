And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant/cross-complainant's motion to compel initial responses to form interrogatories and requests for production of documents, and deems requests for admissions admitted. The plaintiff failed to respond to these discovery requests, and the defendant/cross-complainant filed motions to compel and request for monetary sanctions. The judge also denies the defendant/cross-complainant's request for monetary sanctions against the plaintiff, as the plaintiff is litigating this matter in propria persona.
