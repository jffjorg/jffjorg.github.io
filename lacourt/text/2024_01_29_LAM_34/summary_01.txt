And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Application for Determination of Good Faith Settlement and the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel. The settlement between the Plaintiff and Defendants Sam Ghanouni, Avi Galili, and Charles Hefner is deemed to be made in good faith, as there is no evidence to indicate otherwise. The Court notes that none of the non-settling defendants have filed an opposition or response to the settlement.

As for the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, the Judge grants the motion, citing California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, which outlines the requirements for an attorney to withdraw from representation. The Court notes that there is a moderate risk of prejudice to Defendant Swall Heights, LLC by this withdrawal, but concludes that it is not counsel's responsibility to litigate a matter without reasonable payment when that counsel and its client have not agreed to a contingency agreement. The Judge orders that the trial, scheduled for May 20, 2024, will proceed with new counsel for Defendant Swall Heights, LLC, if necessary.
