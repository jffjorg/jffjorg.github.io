ANALYSIS:
 
        
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
A.         
Legal
Standard for Initial Responses to Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents
 
California Code of Civil Procedure requires a
response from the party to whom form interrogatories, special interrogatories,
and demand requests are propounded within 30 days after service of the
requests, unless the time is extended by agreement of the parties. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.260, subd. (a), 2030.270, subd. (a), 2031.260, subd. (a),
2031.270, subd. (a).) If a party fails to serve timely responses, "the party
making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).) By failing to respond, the offending
party waives any objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(a).)
 
For a motion to compel, all a propounding
party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the
time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were
directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Super. Ct.
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905, 906.) Indeed, "[o]nce [a party] 'fail[ed]
to serve a timely response,' the trial court had authority to grant [opposing
party's] motion to compel responses." (Sinaiko Healthcare Counseling,
Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 405.)
 
The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel motions for
interrogatories or requests for production, unless the Court finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails
to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
B. 
    Legal
Standard for Requests for Admission
 
California Code of Civil Procedure requires a
response from the party to whom the request for admissions is directed within
30 days after service of the request for admissions. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.250, subd. (a).)
 
If the party fails to serve a timely response,
“the party to whom the requests for admission are directed waives any objection
to the requests.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)
 
The requesting party may then “move for an
order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for monetary sanction
under Chapter 7.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
 
A court will deem requests admitted, “unless
it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed
has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the
requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.
It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
A. 
    The
Discovery Requests
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant moves the Court to compel Plaintiff to
serve responses to form interrogatories (“FROGs”) and requests for production
of documents (“RPDs”). (FROGs and RPDs Motion, p. 5:2–4.)
 
        Defendant/Cross-Complainant also moves
the Court to deem the requests in the requests for admission (“RFAs”) admitted
and the facts stated therein conclusively established for all purposes in this
action. (RFAs Motion, p. 5:2–4.)
 
        There is no evidence before the Court that
would indicate Plaintiff responded to these discovery requests. Rather, counsel
for Defendant/Cross-Complainant declares that Plaintiff has not responded to
these discovery requests. (FROGs and RPDs Motion, Decl. Brophy, ¶¶ 4, 6; RFAs
Motion, Decl. Brophy, ¶¶ 4, 6.)
 
        The Court GRANTS the FROGs and RPDs
Motion. 
 
        Plaintiff shall provide initial
responses to the FROGs and RPDs within fourteen (14) days of the issuance of
this Order. 
 
        The Court GRANTS the RFAs Motion. 
 
        The RFAs are DEEMED ADMITTED. 
 
B. 
    Sanctions
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant requests monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff. But given that Plaintiff is litigating this matter in propria
persona, monetary sanctions would not be appropriate here. 
 
The Court DENIES Defendant/Cross-Complainant’s Requests for Monetary
Sanctions. 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The FROGs and RPDs Motion is GRANTED. 
 
        Plaintiff shall provide initial
responses to the FROGs and RPDs within fourteen (14) days of the issuance of
this Order. 
 
        The RFAs Motion is GRANTED. 
 
        The RFAs are DEEMED ADMITTED. 
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant’s Requests for Monetary
Sanctions are DENIED.
