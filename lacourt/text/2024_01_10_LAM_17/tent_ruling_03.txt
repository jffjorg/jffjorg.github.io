 Hearing
  Date:  January 10, 2024




 
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel compliance is GRANTED.
 
On 6/29/2022,
Plaintiff Homayoon Ebraim-Nehoray (Plaintiff) filed suit against Farzin
Aghaipour, Shahla Sassounian, and Pacific Construction (collectively,
Defendants). On 1/3/2022, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (FAC)
alleging: (1) declaratory relief; (2) trespass; and (3) private nuisance.
 
            Now,
Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant’s compliance with the subpoena for business
records served on M&G Civil Engineering & Land Surveying (M&G).
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
served a subpoena for business records on M&G on October 5, 2021. M&G’s
deposition was conducted on May 24, 2023. M&G produced documents on June
12, 2023. (Erigero Decl. ¶ 3). Upon receipt of M&G’s document production,
Nehoray realized that M&G had failed to provide the AutoCad format data
file which serves as the basis for any final printed survey. Now, Plaintiff
moves to compel production of the software version of the drawings, rather than
just the PDF versions of the drawings.
 
            After
review, the Court finds Plaintiff’s motion should be granted.
 
In
opposition, Defendant contends that the motion is untimely and that the
documents sought are private and confidential.
 
As to the
first concern, pursuant to CCP section 2025.480(b), a motion to compel
compliance with a deposition subpoena no later than 60 days after the
completion of the record of the deposition. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.480(b).)
The deposition record is “complete” as of the “date specified for production”
or the date objections are served. (Board of Registered Nursing v. Sup. Ct.
(Johnson & Johnson) (2021) 59 Cal.App.5th 1011, 1032-1033.) Here, while
M&G produced some documents on June 12, 2023, it did not serve objections
until August 24, 2023. Accordingly, Plaintiff had 60 days from August 24, 2023
to file its Motion. Plaintiff’s Motion was filed on October 23, 2023.
Therefore, Plaintiff’s Motion is timely
 
            As
to the second concern, Defendant argues that “it is not standard industry
practice for a surveyor to provide AutoCAD data to a party who has not paid for
it,” and that Plaintiff hasn’t shown a particularized need for the data. (Opp.,
3: 27-4:3.) However, Plaintiff has set forth such a particularized need: “As
the surveyors, M&G’s AutoCad files contain important information regarding
the architectural and landscape plans of Aghaipour’s property. Plaintiff’s
entire action against Defendant Aghaipour consists of the obstructive
construction surrounding his architectural and landscape plans that have
interfered with Nehoray’s use and enjoyment of his property. Plaintiff is
entitled to the information in the AutoCad files in order to properly present
evidence that establishes his claim for nuisance and trespass.” (Reply, 4:
1-7.) Moreover, privacy interests are not inviolable,  but rather must be weighed alongside the
opposing party’s interest in the discovery. Here, Defendant asserts in a
conclusory fashion that the AutoCAD data is private and confidential, but do
not engage in any description of the confidential nature of the AutoCad files,
or provide analysis as to why this confidentiality interest outweighs the need
for discovery.  
             
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel compliance is granted. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
