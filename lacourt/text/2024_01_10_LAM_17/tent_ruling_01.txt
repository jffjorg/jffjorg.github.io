PRINCESS OBIENU 
  
        
  vs.
 
COUNTY OF LOS
  ANGELES
 


 Case
  No.:  19STCV33111
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 10, 2024



 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel
responses is DENIED. 
 
On September
17, 2019, Plaintiff Princess Obienu (Plaintiff) filed suit against the County
of Los Angeles Department of Health Services (Defendant), alleging: (1)
race/national origin discrimination; (2) disability discrimination; (3) failure
to accommodate disability; (4) failure to engage in the interactive process;
(5) violation of the California Family Rights Act (CFRA); (6) violation of the
CFRA – Interference with Family Leave Rights; (7) violation of CFRA –
retaliation; (8) failure to prevent/correct discrimination; and (9)
retaliation.
 
            Now,
Plaintiff moves to compel responses to her special interrogatories. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
moves to compel responses to her special interrogatories. 
 
            As
noted by Defendant, Plaintiff’s counsel filed this motion on 8/29/2023, after
the date set for trial.
 
CCP section
2024.020 provides that discovery motions must be heard on or before the 15th
day before the trial date. In this case, trial was set for August 21, 2023. As
such, any discovery motion had to be noticed for hearing on or before August 6,
2023, and served no later than July 14, 2023. Plaintiff’s counsel served it
over two months later and noticed it to be heard after the aborted trial
concluded. As the Court of Appeal has ruled, “a party who notices a discovery
motion to be heard after the discovery motion cutoff date does not have a right
to have the motion heard.” (Cottini v. Enloe Med. Ctr. (2014) 226 Cal.
App. 4th 401, 420, quoting Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta
Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1586.)
 
Although
discovery may have been reopened following the grant of a mistrial on September
29, 2023 (see Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal. 4th
245), the present motion is still untimely, because it was served before the
Court declared the mistrial and relates to discovery proceedings that took
place long before the date initially set for trial. (See Golf & Tennis
Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal. App. 5th 127, 137
(discovery motion deadlines are “mandatory and the court may not entertain a
belated motion to compel”).)
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses is denied. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
