And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant Keaton Keller to the second and third causes of action in a lawsuit filed by Plaintiff Eian Beron Jr. against Gas Media Group, LLC, Keaton Keller, and Oombrella Enterprises.

The Judge has overruled the demurrer as to the second cause of action, which alleges promissory fraud, and sustained it as to the third cause of action, which alleges fraudulent concealment. The Judge has also declined to grant leave to amend the third cause of action, finding that Plaintiff has had multiple opportunities to plead a sufficiently specific claim.

The Judge has found that Plaintiff's promissory fraud claim is adequately pled, but that the fraudulent concealment claim is not. The Judge has also noted that Plaintiff cannot simultaneously allege that Defendant affirmatively promised him and concealed the same thing from him, and has declined to grant leave to amend the third cause of action.

The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court by 4 p.m. the day prior to the hearing, and if all parties submit, the court will adopt this tentative as the final order.
