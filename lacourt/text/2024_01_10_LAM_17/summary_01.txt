And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to her special interrogatories. The plaintiff filed the motion on August 29, 2023, after the date set for trial, and the defendant argued that the motion is untimely. The court ruled that discovery motions must be heard on or before the 15th day before the trial date, and since the trial date was set for August 21, 2023, any discovery motion had to be noticed for hearing on or before August 6, 2023, and served no later than July 14, 2023. The plaintiff's counsel served the motion over two months later and noticed it to be heard after the aborted trial concluded. The court held that a party who notices a discovery motion to be heard after the discovery motion cutoff date does not have a right to have the motion heard. Therefore, the plaintiff's motion to compel responses is denied.
