The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel compliance with the subpoena for business records served on M&G Civil Engineering & Land Surveying. The Plaintiff, Homayoon Ebrahimi-Nehoray, filed a lawsuit against the Defendants, Farzin Aghaipour, Shahla Sassounian, and Pacific Construction, alleging declaratory relief, trespass, and private nuisance. The Plaintiff served a subpoena on M&G for business records, but M&G only produced some documents, not the AutoCAD data files.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's motion is timely, as it was filed within 60 days of the completion of the deposition record. The Judge also rejects the Defendants' argument that the data is private and confidential, as they failed to provide a description of the confidential nature of the data or provide analysis as to why this confidentiality interest outweighs the need for discovery. The Judge grants the Plaintiff's motion and orders the Defendants to produce the AutoCAD data files.
