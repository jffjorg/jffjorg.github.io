And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration in a lawsuit brought by the Plaintiff, Gabriela Harnden, against American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The Plaintiff alleges violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The Defendant argued that the Plaintiff agreed to arbitrate disputes related to the sale of a new 2022 Honda Pilot, but the Judge found that the Defendant does not have standing to enforce the arbitration provision. The Judge relied on the recent Court of Appeal decision in Martha Ochoa v. Ford Motor Company, which held that a car manufacturer cannot enforce an arbitration agreement under a theory of third-party beneficiary or equitable estoppel. The Judge concluded that since the Plaintiff's claims do not rely on the underlying contract, the Defendant has not met its burden to compel arbitration.
