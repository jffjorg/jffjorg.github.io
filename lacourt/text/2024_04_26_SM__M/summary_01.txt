```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of Bashar Oudah, M.D., who refused to appear for a deposition without a court order. The defendants properly served a deposition subpoena on Dr. Oudah, which obligated him to appear at the deposition. Dr. Oudah's refusal to appear without a court order is not imputable to the plaintiff. The court will not grant sanctions against the plaintiff for Dr. Oudah's conduct. The defendants' request for sanctions in the amount of $2,370.00 is also denied.
