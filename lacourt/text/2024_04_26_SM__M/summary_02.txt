Here is the summary in English text:

The judge denied the motion to stay the fraudulent transfer action pending the resolution of the earlier-filed rent recovery action. The defendant argued that the fraudulent transfer action should be stayed for efficiency's sake in favor of first resolving the related rent action. The defendant claimed that the fraudulent transfer action is contingent on the success of the rent action, as the debt alleged in the fraudulent transfer action is based on the underlying rent claim. The judge found that there was no substantial prejudice in proceeding with both actions simultaneously, and that the defendant failed to explain how concurrently litigating this action would substantially prejudice them. The judge declined to issue a stay.
