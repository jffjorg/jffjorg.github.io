  Case Number:  21STCV02647    Hearing Date:   April 26, 2024    Dept:  M CASE NAME:           Sanchez, v. Mizban,
et al.
CASE NO.:                21STCV02647
MOTION:                  Motion
for Authorization of Taking Deposition
HEARING DATE:   4/26/2024
 
Legal
Standard
 
            Personal service of a
deposition subpoena obligates the production of whatever documents or things
are specified in the subpoena and to appear in any proceedings to enforce
discovery. (CCP § 2020.220(c). If a nonparty disobeys a deposition subpoena,
the subpoenaing party may seek a court order pursuant to CCP section 1987.1
compelling the nonparty to comply with the subpoena within 60 days after
completion of the deposition record. (CCP §§ 2020.240; 2025.480(b); see also UnzippedApparel, LLC v. Bader
(2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 123, 127.)
 
The motion must be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration. (CCP § 2025.480(b).) There is no “good cause”
requirement when seeking to compel documents from a nonparty. (CCP §
2020.410(c).) 
 
Analysis
 
            Defendants Kasra and Nasser Mizban move for an order
authorizing the taking of the deposition of Bashar Oudah, M.D. pursuant to a
deposition subpoena for personal appearance.
Defendants also request
sanctions against Plaintiff Gabriel Sanchez and/or his counsel of record,
Peter Hakim and/or Downtown
LA Law Group, in the amount of $2,370.00.
 
            On February 8, 2024, Defendants issued and served a
Deposition Subpoena for Personal Appearance to Bashar Oudah, M.D. for a remote
deposition to take place on March 5, 2024. (Kang Decl., Ex. I.) During meet and
confer efforts, Dr. Oudah indicated that he would only sit for a deposition if
Plaintiff signed an authorization or Defendants obtained a court order. (Kang
Decl., ¶¶17-21.) Defendants have therefore shown the proper service of a
third-party deposition subpoena. Such service obligated Dr. Oudah to appear at
the noticed deposition. Dr. Oudah refused to proceed with the deposition
without any justification. Accordingly, the motion to compel Dr. Oudah’s
deposition is GRANTED.
 
The
Court will not grant sanctions against Plaintiff for Dr. Oudah’s conduct. Defendants
do not demonstrate that Dr. Oudah is a party-affiliated deponent. Therefore, Dr.
Oudah’s unwillingness to be deposed absent a court order cannot be imputed to
Plaintiff. Further, as discussed at prior discovery hearings in this action, the
Court may not order Plaintiff to sign authorizations under the Discovery Act. Similarly,
the Court cannot sanction Plaintiff for failing to sign an authorization under
the guise of “discovery abuse.”
