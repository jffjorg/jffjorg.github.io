 Case Number:  22STCV08379    Hearing Date:   March 26, 2024    Dept:  O JANE P. vs SOLEIL SERVICES, INC. D/B/A SPA SOLEIL MASSAGE, et al. Case No. 22STCV08379SUBJECT: Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to Obtain Default and Default JudgmentPlaintiff’s
request for the entry of a default judgment is DENIED, without prejudice. Preliminarily,
the register shows that a default has not yet been entered by the Clerk against
Defendant Soleil Services, Inc. (See Clerk’s most recent rejection filed 2/28/2024).  It appears the default
entered against John Cohn on February 22, 2024 was based in the proof of the
personal service of the summons and complaint on Mr. Cohn filed on April 18,
2022 (exhibit 2, declaration of David Gottlieb filled March 22, 2024) and the
proof of substituted service of the statement of damages filed on November 17,
2022. (exhibit 4, Gottlieb decl.) When a defendant
has not yet appeared in the action, a Statement of Damages must be served on
that person in the same manner as a summons.  (Code of Civil Procedure
§425.11((d)(1) (“If a party has not appeared in the action, the statement shall
be served in the same manner as a summons.”); See also, 6 Witkin, California
Civil Procedure Before Trial, §194 Notice of Damages.  (6th ed.
2023.), California Practice Guide Civil Procedure Before Trial §6:288 (The Rutter
Group, 2023) (“[6:288] Special requirements upon default: The statement of
damages requirement makes entry of default more complicated: If defendant does
not respond to the summons and complaint, plaintiff must go back and re-serve
defendant with the statement of damages before seeking entry of
default—i.e., double service may be required.”Proof of service
of the summons and complaint should be completed and filed using the mandatory
judicial council form  POS-010. (Rule 1.31
Cal Rules of Court.) In addition, prior to serving an individual through
substituted service, personal service must be attempted and a declaration
showing reasonable diligence to affect personal service has been attempted.
(Code of Civil Procedure §415.20(b) (see Comments to §415.20.))   The proof of
personal service on John Cohn shows he was served with the summons and
complaint, but not with a statement of damages. The proof of substituted service
of the Statement of Damages on John Cohn filed November 17 2022  is not the mandatory judicial council form
(POS-010) and is incomplete.  The POS is missing the mandatory language
from Form POS-010 showing the completion of the summons to “Notice to Person
Served” (¶6) and is missing the reference to an attach “declaration of
diligence,”¶5b.(5).  In addition, no
declaration of due diligence is attached to the POS.Finally, regarding
the request for a default judgment, there still is insufficient evidentiary
foundation to support the request for attorney’s fees of $138,068.  Simply
stating the hourly rates and the hours spent by multiple attorneys and
paralegals from two separate firms without any description of the work performed
is not sufficient to support such an extraordinary request for attorney’s fees. 
Counsels’  declarations do not show any
description of the work performed, or more importantly, do not give any
explanation or justification of the need to have four very experienced
attorneys (at hourly rates of $1000, $850, §700 and $450 respectively), and
multiple paralegals as support staff, spend over 126 hours to prepare, file and
serve (still not completed) a relatively simple complaint, and to request a
default judgment on such an uncontested case.    
The hearing on
the order to show cause Re:  dismissal for failure to obtain default and
default judgment is continued to___________________________.
