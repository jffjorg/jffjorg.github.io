The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of O JANE P. vs. Soleil Services, Inc. D/B/A SPA SOLEIL MASSAGE, et al. (Case No. 22STCV08379). The Plaintiff has requested the entry of a default judgment, but the Judge has denied this request without prejudice. The Judge has preliminarily found that a default has not yet been entered by the Clerk against the Defendant, Soleil Services, Inc.

The Judge has also found that the proof of personal service on John Cohn shows that he was served with the summons and complaint, but not with a statement of damages. The proof of substituted service of the Statement of Damages on John Cohn filed November 17, 2022 is incomplete and does not meet the statutory requirements.

Furthermore, the Judge has ruled that the request for a default judgment lacks sufficient evidentiary foundation to support the request for attorney's fees of $138,068. The Judge has requested that the parties provide more detailed information about the work performed and the need for multiple attorneys and paralegals to support this extraordinary request.

The hearing on the order to show cause Re: dismissal for failure to obtain default and default judgment has been continued to a later date.
