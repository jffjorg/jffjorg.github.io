Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Julie Ann Proctor's Motion for Summary Judgment. The judge has granted the motion, finding that Proctor has met her burden to establish a complete defense to civil liability as a notary and that the first element of the cancellation of a written instrument cause of action cannot be met because Proctor successfully demonstrates that the instrument is not void or voidable due to any fraud. The judge further finds that Proctor has met her burden to show that Plaintiff Peter Sjorstand cannot establish an existence of a claim, an essential element of a quiet title cause of action. The judge also finds that Sjorstand has not met his duty to provide evidence showing an existence of a triable issue of material fact as to Proctor's defense or the causes of action.
