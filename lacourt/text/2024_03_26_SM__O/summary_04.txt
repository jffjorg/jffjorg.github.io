And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to RFPS, requiring the defendant City of Santa Monica to produce responses to RFPs Nos. 19, 30-33, and 35-41 without objection within 10 days. The judge finds that the plaintiff has shown good cause to compel the production of these documents, which are relevant to the subject matter of the case and may assist in evaluating the claims and defenses. The judge also finds that the City has not met its burden to show that the privacy issues outweigh the relevance of the documents sought. The parties' 3-11-24 Protective Order eliminates any privacy concerns, and the judge concludes that the documents sought are not inadmissible character evidence.
