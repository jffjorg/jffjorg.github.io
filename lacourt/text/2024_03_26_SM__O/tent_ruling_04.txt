TENTATIVE
RULING
            Plaintiff
Izumi Streller’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to RFPs (Set One) is
GRANTED. Defendant City of Santa Monica is ordered to serve responses to RFPs Nos.
19, 30-33, and 35-41 without objection within 10 days. Plaintiff has not
requested sanctions. 
  
“California law provides parties with
expansive discovery rights.” (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society
of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 590.) “Unless otherwise
limited by order of the court… any party may obtain discovery regarding any
matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the
pending action... if the matter… appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.) “For discovery
purposes, information is relevant if it might reasonably assist a party in
evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement.” (Gonzalez
v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546 [quotations omitted].)
“In sum, the relevance of the subject matter standard must be reasonably
applied; in accordance with the liberal policies underlying the discovery
procedures, doubts as to relevance should generally be resolved in favor of
permitting discovery.” (Pacific Telephone. & Telegraph Co. v. Superior
Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d 161, 173.)
 
A motion to compel further
"shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the demand." Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(b)(1).
"Good cause" should be construed liberally and includes evidence that
the sought-after documents are necessary for effective trial preparation or to
prevent surprise at trial. (Associated Brewers Distributing Co. v. Superior
Court (1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 587.) If good cause is shown, the burden shifts
to the responding party to justify any objections made to documents production.
(Kirkland v. Superior Court 2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.)
 
            Plaintiff Izumi Streller (“Steller”) seeks to compel
further responses to RFPs Nos. Nos. 19, 30-33, and 35-41. The discovery was
served on 8-21-23, and after agreed upon extensions, Defendant City of Santa
Monica (“City”) provided responses to RFPs on 10-30-23. (Owen Decl., ¶¶ 2, 3.
Ex. 1, 2.) The City provided verified supplemental responses and produced
additional responsive documents to the requests at issue in the motion to
compel, including a privilege log detailing documents that were not being
produced and the asserted privileges on 3-1-24. (Joint Decl., ¶ 2. Ex. B.) On
3-26-24 the parties met and conferred, resolving most disputes at issue, with
the only remaining issues being the production of RFPs Nos. 19, 30-33, and
35-41 identified in the privilege log—documents consisting of personnel records
including performance evaluations and disciplinary notices related to the
City’s employment of Defendant Rachel McCovery (“McCovery”), the operator of
the bus on the date of the incident at issue. (Joint Decl., ¶ 3.) 
 
            Streller shows
the documents at issue could be relevant to McCovery’s competence to operate
the City’s bus on the date of the incident. Streller argues the requests are
narrowly tailored and specific, directly relevant and probative of the parties’
claims and defenses which will help Streller and the Court understand and
evaluate the causes of the subject incident, McCovery’s competence and fitness
to operate the bus, the training and instruction the City provided to her on
safe bus operation, and rules the City required her to follow when transporting
fee-paying passengers (Owen Decl., ¶ 8.) 
 
            The City
argues that the documents at issue would be an unwarranted invasion of privacy
pursuant to Gov. Code § 7927.700 and Article 1, Section 1 of the California
Constitution. Furthermore, the City argues the documents sought are not
relevant to the underlying claim of negligence and would be inadmissible
character evidence, thus the lack of relevance must be weighed against
McCovery’s privacy interest in her personnel records and driving history.
(Oppo., pp. 7–8.)
 
            The Court finds that Streller has shown good cause to
compel further responses to RFPs to Nos. 19, 30-33, and 35-41.  The Court finds that the city has not met its
burden to show that the privacy issues outweigh the relevance of the documents
sought. Whether the documents sought are inadmissible character evidence is not
an issue now. (See Associated Brewers Distributing Co., supra,
65 Cal.2d at p. 587 [“it is not necessary to show that the material sought
will be admissible in evidence.”].) Furthermore, Streller has stipulated that
all of the documents at issue would be subject to the Parties’ 3-11-24 Protective
Order, thus eliminating any privacy concerns. (Reply, p. 2:8–9.)
