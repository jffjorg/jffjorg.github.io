RULING
            Plaintiffs
Jill Pauley and Brandon Howletts’ Motion for Leave to Amend the Complaint adding
the intentional misrepresentation cause of action against Defendant Cesar
Andrino and to include Steven Guban as DOE Defendant No. 1 is GRANTED.  Plaintiff’s declaration in support of the
motion satisfies the requirements under CRC Rule 3.1324.  Plaintiff includes the proposed amended
complaint, the effects of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and
proper,  and the recently received
information that prompted the amendment. 
(See Compl., Ex. A; Herrmann Decl., ¶¶1–12.) 
             The
Court acknowledges the proposed amendments potentially could cause a further
delay of the trial. If a trial continuance is necessary counsel may submit a stipulation
and order that identifies the remaining discovery to be completed and the
proposed continued trial date.
