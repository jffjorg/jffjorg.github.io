And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions brought by the plaintiff, Sylvia Monique Murray, against Southern California Permanente Medical Group, Inc. The motions seek to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for admission in an employment dispute alleging disability discrimination.

The judge finds that both motions are moot because the defendant has already provided supplemental responses. However, the judge awards the plaintiff sanctions in the amount of $3,910.00 for the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and $1,985.00 for the motion to compel further responses to requests for admission. The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for costs in the amount of $60.00.

The judge notes that even though the defendant has provided supplemental responses, sanctions may still be awarded as a matter of law. The judge cites the case of Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 409, which supports the award of sanctions in this case.
