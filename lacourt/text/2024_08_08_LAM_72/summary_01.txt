Significant Statements:
  - "The Court OVERRULES the demurrer."
  - "A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged."
  - "Whether a defendant's conduct can reasonably be found to be outrageous is a question of law that must initially be determined by the court; if reasonable persons may differ, it is for the jury to determine whether the conduct was, in fact, outrageous."
  - "The Court does not read allegations of the FAC in isolation. Plaintiff's allegations reflect a pattern of conduct whereby Defendant allegedly deceived Plaintiff into seeking financing through Defendant, and then allegedly told Plaintiff that she would be denied financing if she did not provide specific details about a traumatic sexual assault. A reasonable jury could find that Defendant's conduct towards Plaintiff was outrageous."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) claim is overruled. The plaintiff, a disabled U.S. Veteran, had sought financing from the defendant to purchase a property approved for VA financing with conditions. However, the defendant allegedly made misrepresentations and concealed information regarding VA financing, causing the plaintiff to suffer emotional distress. The judge finds that the defendant's conduct was outrageous and could be found to be so by a reasonable jury. The judge also notes that the defendant's subsequent request for sensitive personal information regarding the plaintiff's time serving in the U.S. military was intrusive and oppressive, and could form the basis for an IIED claim.
