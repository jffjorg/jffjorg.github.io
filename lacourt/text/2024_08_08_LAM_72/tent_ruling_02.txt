Defendants Alo, LLC (“Alo”) and Bella + Canvas LLC (“Bella”)
(collectively, “Defendants”) move for an order permitting them to substitute
undertakings for all of their property which has been attached or is subject to
attachment.
 
The Court GRANTS Alo’s motion on the condition that Alo
posts an undertaking in the amount of $84,610.86 in the form of cash or a bond.

 
The Court GRANTS Bella’s motion on the condition that Bella
posts an undertaking in the amount of $2,474,054.30 in the form of cash or a

Background
 
Plaintiff filed this action against Defendants on February
16, 2024.
 
On June 25, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s applications
for writ of attachment against Alo in the amount of $84,610.86 and against
Bella in the amount of $2,474,054.30. Plaintiff issued writs of attachment
pursuant to that order.
 
On July 16, 2024, Defendants each filed a motion seeking
leave to substitute undertakings for any of their property that is being
attached by Plaintiff. Plaintiff filed an opposition and Defendants filed a
reply.
 
Legal Standard
        
“Whenever a writ is issued, a
defendant who has appeared in the action may apply by noticed motion to the
court in which the action is pending for an order permitting the defendant to
substitute an undertaking for any of his property in the state which has been
or is subject to being attached.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 489.310, subd. (a).)
 
“The defendant shall file an
undertaking to pay the plaintiff the value of the property released not
exceeding the amount of any judgment which may be recovered by the plaintiff in
the action against the defendant. The amount of the undertaking filed pursuant
to this section shall be equal to the lesser of (1) the value of the property
attached or prevented from being attached or (2) the amount specified by the
writ to be secured by the attachment. The court shall issue such order upon the
condition that a sufficient undertaking be filed.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 489.310,
subd. (c).)
 
Discussion
 
Alo is prepared to post an undertaking in the amount of
$84,610.86 and Bella is prepared to post an undertaking in the amount of
$2,474,054.30. (Matthews Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.) Defendants request permission to allow
undertakings in the form of letters of credit.
 
Plaintiff argues that a letter of credit is not a proper
form of undertaking and that Defendants have not provided sufficient
information about the proposed letters of credit to determine if they could be
sufficient undertakings. Plaintiff has stated that the provision of a cash
deposit or a bond from an admitted surety would satisfy its objection.
(Opposition at pp. 2:23-3:1.) Defendants have stated that they are willing to
provide undertakings in the form of a bond or cash. (Reply at p. 2:6-8.)
 
The Court grants Alo’s motion on the condition that Alo
posts an undertaking in the amount of $84,610.86 in the form of cash or a bond.
The Court grants Bella’s motion on the condition that Bella posts an
undertaking in the amount of $2,474,054.30 in the form of cash or a bond.
