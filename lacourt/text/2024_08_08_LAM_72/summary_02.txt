And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion by defendants Alo, LLC and Bella + Canvas LLC to substitute undertakings for their property that has been attached or is subject to attachment. The plaintiff, REV CAPITAL (CALIFORNIA) INC., had previously obtained writs of attachment against both defendants. The defendants request permission to post undertakings in the form of letters of credit, but the plaintiff objects, arguing that letters of credit are not a proper form of undertaking and that the defendants have not provided sufficient information about the proposed letters of credit. The court grants the defendants' motions, but only on the condition that they post undertakings in the form of cash or a bond in the amounts of $84,610.86 and $2,474,054.30, respectively.
