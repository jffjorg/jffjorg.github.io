And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion of Plaintiffs Thrifty Oil Co. and Tesoro Refining & Marketing Company LLC to appoint a receiver to carry out the judgment in this matter. The Court previously denied the motion without prejudice, and Plaintiffs have renewed their application.

The Court finds that the permanent injunction issued on December 9, 2021, is adequate to protect Plaintiffs' rights, and that there is no need for a receiver. The Court notes that Defendants have generally complied with the injunction, and that the events that have occurred since the injunction was issued do not show the type of extreme circumstances necessary to justify a receivership.

The Court also notes that Plaintiffs' arguments are based on speculation and do not provide a sufficient basis for appointing a receiver. The Court therefore denies the motion for receivership, but allows Plaintiffs to renew the motion and bring any new evidence to the Court's attention if they experience problems with the enforcement of the injunction.
