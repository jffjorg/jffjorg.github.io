```

And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is that the motions to compel discovery responses are moot because defendant Polestar Automotive USA, Inc. has now served responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests. The plaintiff, Raymond Chang, had moved the court to compel responses to his first set of form interrogatories, request for admissions, request for production of documents, and special interrogatories. The defendant claimed that an internal clerical error caused the delay in serving the responses. The court denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions at this time and orders the parties to participate in an informal discovery conference if they have any disputes about the responses.
