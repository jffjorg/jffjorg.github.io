Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to certain requests for production of documents (RFP Nos. 5, 7, 11-14, 19, 22, 27, 35, 43-55, 58, 60-62, 64-65, 67-70, and 74). The judge orders that these requests be served within 10 days with student names and names of their family members redacted and replaced with pseudonyms, as provided in the parties' stipulated protective order. The defendant did not oppose the production of these requests. The judge denies the motion as to other requests (RFP Nos. 2, 3, 10, 20, 21, 24, 28, 42, 71, 72, 73, 89, and 90) as they have either been answered or objected to on different grounds.
