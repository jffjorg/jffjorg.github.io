```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the defendant's special motion to strike the plaintiff's claims as a SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation). The Court finds that the defendant's article, published in Knock LA on April 25, 2021, is protected speech that implicates a public issue, specifically the ongoing Los Angeles housing crisis and the effect of airbnb's and corporate landlords on the crisis.

The Court also finds that the plaintiff, Simone Shah, has failed to meet her burden of demonstrating a probability of prevailing on her claims, as she has not submitted any evidence to support her claims and has missed the one-year statute of limitations for filing the complaint.

Therefore, the Court has struck the plaintiff's claims as a SLAPP and has barred them as a matter of law.
