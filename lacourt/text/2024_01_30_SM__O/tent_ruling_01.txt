TENTATIVE
RULING
            Plaintiff
Rama Fund, LLC’s Motion for Attorney Fees is GRANTED. The Court orders
Defendant to pay $32,283.70 (agreed $30,000 flat rate, 4.6 hours at $400 per
hour, 1.3 hours at $400, and $443.70 in filing fees) to Plaintiff Rama Fund,
LLC. Plaintiff is the undisputed prevailing party on appeal and is entitled to
attorney fees. 
 
            Plaintiff
Rama Fund, LLC’s RJN is GRANTED.
 
            “Except as
attorney's fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode
of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement,
express or implied, of the parties; but parties to actions or proceedings are
entitled to their costs, as hereinafter provided.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.) “In
any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that
attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall
be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the
party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he
or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to
reasonable attorney's fees in addition to other costs.” (Civ. Code, § 1717.)
  
            “A notice
of motion to claim attorney's fees on appeal--other than the attorney's fees on
appeal claimed under (b)--under a statute or contract requiring the court to
determine entitlement to the fees, the amount of the fees, or both, must be
served and filed within the time for serving and filing the memorandum of costs
under rule 8.278(c)(1) in an unlimited civil case or under rule 8.891(c)(1) in
a limited civil case.” (CA ST CIVIL RULES Rule 3.1702.) “Within 40 days after
issuance of the remittitur, a party claiming costs awarded by a reviewing court
must serve and file in the superior court a verified memorandum of costs under
rule 3.1700.” (Cal. Rules of Court, 8.278, subd., (c)(1).)
 
            A general
principle of attorney fees includes “that statutes authorizing attorney fee
awards in lower tribunals include attorney fees incurred on appeals of
decisions from those lower tribunals. (Morcos v. Board of Retirement
(1990) 51 Cal.3d 924, 927; see also Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d
621, 637 [“[I]t is established that fees, if recoverable at all—pursuant either
to statute or parties' agreement—are available for services at trial and on
appeal,” and “[t]his rule governs whether or not the sole issue on appeal has
been fee entitlement.”].)
 
            It is
undisputed that Plaintiff Rama Fund, LLC was the prevailing party on appeal.
(See RJN, Exh. 2.) The Remittitur was issued on 11-16-23 (See RJN, Exh. 3), and
this motion was filed on 12-26-23, satisfying the 40-day filing requirement of
Rule 3.1702. Thus, Plaintiff is entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees by
contract and statute. 


            Plaintiff requests fees for work
involved in Defendant Comstock’s unsuccessful appeal of an order granting
summary judgment in the amount of $32,283.70 based on a flat rate of $30,000 (52
hours at discounted rate of $575/hr.), 4.6 hours at $400 per hour, 1.3 hours at
$400, and $443.70 in filing fees. Plaintiff’s counsel provides two declarations
identifying (1) the number of hours spent (2) by each attorney and (3) the
hourly rate of each attorney.  (See Motion, Klapach Decl., ¶¶5–10, 18; Mase
Decl., ¶¶ 3–6.)  Plaintiff’s counsel also provides the billing entries for
the work performed on this matter by each attorney.  (Id. at Mase Exh.
1; Klapach Exhs. 1, 2.)  Attorney Joseph
S. Klapach explains the reasonableness of the flat $30,000 rate, includes
descriptions and number of hours for each activity, and states the work totaled
over 65 hours but the flat rate amounted to 52 hours at a discounted rate of
$575/hr.—Klapach’s normal is $800/hr. (Klapach Decl.,¶¶ 11–18.).
