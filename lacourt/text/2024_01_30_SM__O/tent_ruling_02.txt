TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendant Lisa Kwon’s Special Motion to Strike Pursuant
to CCP § 425.16 (Anti-SLAPP) is GRANTED as to the 1st cause of
action for Defamation Per Se, the 2nd cause of action for Defamation
Per Quod, and the 3rd cause of action for False Light in Plaintiff
Simone Shah’s Complaint. Defendant Lisa Kwon has met her burden of showing
Plaintiff’s claims arise from Defendant’s constitutionally protected speech.
Plaintiff has not met their burden of establishing a probability of prevailing
on their claims as no opposition was filed, and the complaint is barred by the one-year
statute of limitations for the Defamation (Per se and Per quod) and False light
causes of action.         
  
            “Litigation of an anti-SLAPP motion involves a two-step
process. First, the moving defendant bears the burden of establishing that the
challenged allegations or claims arise from protected activity in which the
defendant has engaged.  Second, for each claim that does arise from
protected activity, the plaintiff must show the claim has “at least minimal
merit.  If the plaintiff cannot make this showing, the court will strike
the claim.”  (Bonni v. St. Joseph Health System (2021) 11 Cal.5th
995, 1009.) The Court will grant the motion "if the plaintiff fails to
produce evidence to substantiate his claim or if the defendant has shown that
the plaintiff cannot prevail as a matter of law." (Siam v. Kizilbash
(2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1563, 1570.)
 
I.               
Anti-SLAPP
First Prong – Defendants Burden of Establishing Claims Arise From Protected
Activity.
            In
the first prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis, “courts are to consider the
elements of the challenged claim and what actions by the defendant supply those
elements and consequently form the basis for liability.  The defendant’s
burden is to identify what acts each challenged claim rests on and to show how
those acts are protected under a statutorily defined category of protected
activity.”  (Bonni, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 1009.)
            “First,
the moving defendant must show that the challenged claim or claims arise from
the defendant's constitutionally protected free speech or petition rights. (Ojjeh
v. Brown (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 1027, 1035.) A defendant has the “burden of
identifying all allegations of protected activity” on the 1st prong
of SLAPP.”  (Bel Air Internet, LLC v. Morales (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th
924, 936-937.)  Defendant only meets this burden by demonstrating that the
act underlying the plaintiff’s cause of action “fits one of the categories
spelled out in section 425.16, subdivision (e).”  (Sprengel v. Zbylut
(2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 140, 150.)
            The
Plaintiff Simone Shah’s (“Shah”) defamation and false light claims arise from speech
within an article written by Defendant Lisa Kwon (“Kwon”), and published by
Knock LA. (See Compl., ¶¶ 18, 27, 36.) The next step of a the analysis is
whether this speech is made in connection with a public interest. 
            The
anti-SLAPP statute applies to “cause[s] of action … arising from any act of
that person in furtherance of the person’s right of petition or free speech …
in connection with a public issue.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) Whether
this speech is made in connection with an issue of public interest is based on
a two-part analysis. (FilmOn.com Inc. v. DoubleVerify Inc. (2019) 7
Cal.5th 133, 148.) “First, [a court should] ask what ‘public issue or . . .
issue of public interest’ the speech in question implicates—a question [courts
can] answer by looking to the content of the speech.” (Ibid., quoting
Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (e)(4) (ellipsis in original).) )  “FilmOn’s first step is satisfied so
long as the challenged speech or conduct, considered in light of its context,
may reasonably be understood to implicate a public issue, even if it also
implicates a private dispute.  (Geiser
v. Kuhns (2022) 13 Cal.5th 1238, 1253.)
            The Court finds the
challenged speech implicates a public issue because the article from which the
claims arise addresses the ongoing Los Angeles housing crisis, plus the effect
of airbnb’s and corporate landlords regarding the crisis. Speech related to
housing availability is a public issue. (See Geiser, supra 13
Cal.5th at pp. 1250–1254 [finding “residential displacement [and]
gentrification” are issues of public interest]; see also Motion, at p. 2, fn. 1
[including website links to numerous articles within major publications about the
effect of Airbnb’s on the housing rental market].)
            FilmOn’s second step
looks to the context of the speech to determine what functional relationship
exists between the speech and the public conversation about some matter of
public interest. (FilmOn.com Inc., supra 7 Cal.5th at
pp. 149–150.) These contextual factors include the identity of the speaker, the
audience, and the “purpose of the speech.” (Id. at p. 145.) 
            The Court finds Kwon meets
the second step of the FilmOn analysis. Here, Kwon is a freelance
journalist, published in numerous reputable news publications, who researched
and wrote a piece about the “effect of short-term rentals on the LA housing
supply” for Knock LA, a local news publication. (Kwon Decl., ¶¶ 2, 3.) Kwon
intended the audience to be the editors and publishers of Knock LA who would
then publish the work for the public to read. (Motion, p. 5; Kwon Decl., ¶ 3.) Kwon
conducted thorough research into the matter, and confirmed the facts prior to
sending the article to Knock LA. (Kwon Decl., ¶¶ 5–30.) The purpose of the
speech was to factually inform the public of the issues surrounding the effect
of short-term rentals on the housing supply, a matter that is of great public
interest. (See Clancy Decl., ¶¶ 3, 4.)
            Thus, Kwon’s has
successfully established that Shah’s defamation and false light claims arise
from the protected activity of researching and writing the article at issue
published by Knock LA on 4-25-21.
 
II.            
Anti-SLAPP Second
Prong – Plaintiff’s Burden of Demonstrating a Probability of Prevailing on
their Claims
            Once
a defendant demonstrates that a cause of action arises from protected conduct,
the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient
and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a
favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is
credited.  (Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82,
88–89.)  “Precisely because the statute (1) permits early intervention in
lawsuits alleging unmeritorious causes of action that implicate free speech
concerns, and (2) limits opportunity to conduct discovery, the plaintiff's
burden of establishing a probability of prevailing is not high: We do not weigh
credibility, nor do we evaluate the weight of the evidence. Instead, we accept
as true all evidence favorable to the plaintiff and assess the defendant's
evidence only to determine if it defeats the plaintiff's submission as a matter
of law.  Only a cause of action that lacks ‘even minimal merit'
constitutes SLAPP.”  (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Gradient Analytics, Inc.
(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 688, 699.)
            “The
second prong of the statute deals with whether the plaintiff has “demonstrated
a probability of prevailing on the claim.  Under section 425.16,
subdivision (b)(2), the superior court, in making these determinations,
considers ‘the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the
facts upon which the liability or defense is based.’ For purposes of an
anti-SLAPP motion, the court considers the pleadings and evidence submitted by
both sides, but does not weigh credibility or compare the weight of the
evidence. Rather, the court's responsibility is to accept as true the evidence
favorable to the plaintiff.  A plaintiff need only establish that his or
her claim has minimal merit to avoid being stricken as a SLAPP.  With
these descriptions in mind, we will not strike a cause of action under the
anti-SLAPP statute unless it lacks even minimal merit.”  (Ralphs
Grocery Co. v. Victory Consultants, Inc. (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 245, 261.)
            The
“probability of prevailing” is tested by the same standard governing a motion
for summary judgment, nonsuit, or directed verdict.  Thus, in opposing a
SLAPP motion, it is plaintiff's burden to make a prima facie showing of facts
that would support a judgment in plaintiff's favor.  (Crossroads
Investors, L.P. v. Federal National Mortgage Assn. (2017) 13
Cal.App.5th 757, 785; Taus v. Loftus (2007) 40 Cal.4th 683, 714 [a
“summary-judgment-like procedure”].)    
            “In
a claim for defamation, as with other tort claims, the period of limitations
commences when the cause of action accrues” (Shively v. Bozanich (2003)
31 Cal.4th 1230, 1246, as modified (Dec. 22, 2003).) “[A] cause of
action for defamation accrues at the time the defamatory statement is ‘published’
(using the term ‘published’ in its technical sense).” (Ibid.) The
Statute of limitations for defamation “that an action be filed within one year
of accrual of the cause of action, to the present case.” (Ibid.; see
also (Code Civ. Proc., § 340, subd. (c).)
            “A
one-year statute of limitation applies to claims for false light invasion of
privacy.” (Lauter v. Anoufrieva (C.D. Cal. 2009) 642 F.Supp.2d 1060,
1105 (citing Cain v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1976) 62 Cal.App.3d
310, 313 [“The applicable statute of limitations for tortious invasion of
privacy is found in Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (3), which
sets forth a one-year period during which the action may be filed.”].)
            The
article at issue was published in Knock LA on 4-25-21. (Compl., ¶ 8.) Shah
filed the suit at bar on 4-26-22, thus missing the one-year statute of
limitations on all three claims. (See e.g. Compl.)  Furthermore, Shah has not submitted an
opposition to the motion, meaning Shah did not submit any evidence to meet her
burden of demonstrating the probability of prevailing on the claims. (See
1-22-24 Notice of Non-Oppo.)
            Thus,
the Court finds Shah did not meet her burden on the second prong of the SLAPP
analysis. Furthermore the claims are barred as a matter of law since the complaint
was not filed within the requisite statute of limitations.
