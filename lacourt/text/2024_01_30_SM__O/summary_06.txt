And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a protective order, which sought to limit discovery to the plaintiff's compliance with the Ellis Act and its intent to withdraw the residential rental units from rental use permanently. The judge found that the defendant's discovery requests are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence regarding the plaintiff's intent when it made the decision to withdraw the property from the rental market.

The judge granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of the complaint filed in a related case, but limited the scope of the notice to the existence of the complaint, rather than the truth of the allegations.

The judge also sustained the plaintiff's objection to an email from Emma Garcia to Roberto Aldape, finding that the email was not relevant to the case.

The judge further sustained the defendant's foundation objections to the plaintiff's counsel's estimates of the time and cost to produce the documents sought by the defendant, finding that the estimates were speculative and lacked foundation.

The judge's ruling is based on California law, which provides parties with expansive discovery rights. The judge noted that the concept of relevance in the discovery context is broader than evidence that is admissible at trial, and that much of the information that surfaces during pretrial discovery may be unrelated or only tangentially related to the underlying cause of action.

The judge found that the defendant's discovery requests are relevant because they could shed greater light on the credibility of the plaintiff's intent when it made its decision to withdraw the property from the rental market and whether that decision was made in good faith consistent with the Ellis Act. The judge noted that even considering counsel's speculative estimates of the cost to comply with the requested discovery, the plaintiff has not shown that the burden and expense of responding to that discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood that the information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

The judge's ruling is tentative, and the parties will have an opportunity to address any further objections to the requested discovery at an informal discovery conference.
