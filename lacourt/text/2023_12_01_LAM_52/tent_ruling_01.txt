  Case Number:  22STCV13981    Hearing Date:   December 1, 2023    Dept:  52 Defendant Department
of Health Care Services’ Motion to Dismiss Complaint
Defendant State of
California by and through the Department of Health Care Services moves to
dismiss the complaint against it by plaintiffs Christopher A. Altounian, Maria
Margarita Carranza, and Luis H. Carranza.
Defendant shows
grounds to dismiss the action against it. 
Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2) provides, “The court may dismiss the
complaint as to that defendant when: [¶] (2) … after a demurrer to the
complaint is sustained with leave to amend, the plaintiff fails to amend it
within the time allowed by the court and either party moves for dismissal.”
Plaintiffs failed to amend their complaint within the time allowed by the
court after sustaining a demurrer to the entire complaint.  On May 23, 2023, the court sustained
defendant State of California by and through
the Department of Health Care Services’ demurrer to the entire complaint with
20 days’ leave to amend.  The clerk
served the minute order on plaintiffs by mail the same day.  Plaintiffs never filed an amended
complaint.  Defendant now moves for
dismissal.  Plaintiffs did not oppose
this motion.  Dismissal is proper.
Disposition
Defendant State of California by and
through the Department of Health Care Services’ motion to dismiss the complaint
against it is granted.  The court
hereby dismisses the complaint by Christopher A. Altounian, Maria Margarita Carranza, and
Luis H. Carranza as against defendant State of California by and through the Department of
Health Care Services with prejudice.
