And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the parties' submissions and made a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses. The plaintiff, Georgina Gomez, brought this action against Kia America, Inc. for alleged violation of the Song Beverly Act, alleging that her 2020 Kia Sportage was manufactured as defective. The plaintiff moved for an order compelling Kia's further response to requests for production of documents, specifically RFPD Nos. 15-22, 23-29, and 30-31.

The court found that the plaintiff's meet and confer efforts were insufficient and that the plaintiff failed to respond to Kia's July 8, 2024 letter, which offered to produce further documentation. The court denied the motion to compel without prejudice and ordered the parties to meet and confer in good faith as mandated by California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 2023.010(i). The court noted that Kia was willing to produce further documentation at this juncture, which would address several of the requests in the plaintiff's motion.
