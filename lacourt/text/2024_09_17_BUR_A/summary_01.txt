And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

On September 17, 2024, Judge F.M. Tavelman issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents in a case brought by Ivanlouis Nicholson against Ford Motor Company. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Nicholson, who sought to compel Ford to produce further responses to his requests for production of documents related to the Song Beverly Act, which regulates the production and sale of vehicles in California.

The Court found that Plaintiff's meet and confer efforts were insufficient, as they did not specifically address Ford's objections to the requests for production. The Court also noted that Ford produced documents which may be responsive to some of the RFPD, but Plaintiff did not provide any reason why further production was required.

As a result, the Court denied the motion to compel further production without prejudice and ordered the parties to meet and confer in good faith regarding discovery compliance. The Court also noted that it appears that Ford is willing to produce further documentation at this juncture, which would address at least some of the requests in Plaintiff's motion.
