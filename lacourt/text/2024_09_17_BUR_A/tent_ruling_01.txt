ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Plaintiff Ivanlouis
Nicholson (Plaintiff) brings this action against Ford Motor Company (Ford) for Ford’s
alleged violation of the Song Beverly Act. Plaintiff alleges that his 2022 Ford
Escape VIN 1FMCU0BZXNUA03285 (the “Subject Vehicle”) was manufactured as
defective. 
 
Plaintiff
now moves for an order compelling Ford’s
further response to Plaintiff’s RFPD as follows: 
 
RFPD Nos. 1, 3,
8, 10, and 13 concerning the Subject Vehicle.
 
RFPD Nos. 15,
16, 19, 20, 27, 28, 28, 47, 48, 49, 50, 59, 60, 65 and 66 requesting documents
related to Ford’s Internal Knowledge and Investigation of an engine defect. 
 
RFPD Nos.
71, 72, 75, 76 and 77 requesting Ford’s internal
documents concerning the engine defect. 
 
RFPD Nos. 86,
87, 88, 90, 99, 100, 103, 106, 107, and 108 requesting documents related to
Ford’s warranty and vehicle repurchase policies. 
 
RFPD Nos. 113,
114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123 and 124 requesting documents
related to Ford’s communications with Governmental Agencies and Suppliers as
concerns the engine defect in 2019 Ford Expedition vehicles. 
 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS: 
 
Plaintiff requests
the Court strike the declaration of Eric Kemnitz in its entirety. Plaintiff
argues that Ford impermissibly attempts to enter the declaration while
maintaining objections of attorney-client privilege. Plaintiff asks that in the
alternative, the attorney client privilege be waived, and Kemnitz be subject to
an Evidentiary Hearing in which he may be cross-examined. The Court finds the
content of these declarations to have no bearing on its consideration of this
motion. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s objection is OVERRULED. 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
A motion
to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or production of
documents (“RFPD”) may be brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of
compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive, or incomplete claims of inability to
comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections.  (C.C.P. §
2031.310(c).) 
 
A motion
to compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See C.C.P. §
2031.310(b)(1).) In Digital Music News LLC v Superior Court (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 216 at 224, the Court defined “good cause” as a showing that there
“a disputed fact that is of consequence in the action and the discovery sought
will tend in reason to prove or disprove that fact or lead to other evidence
that will tend to prove or disprove the fact.”  
 
If the
moving party has shown good cause for the requests for production, the burden
is on the objecting party to justify the objections. (Kirkland v. Sup.Ct
(2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.) 
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
A motion to compel further
responses to a request for production must include a meet and confer
declaration consistent with C.C.P. § 2016.040. (C.C.P. § 2031.310 (b)(2).) In
turn, Section 2016.040 requires that the moving party have made “a reasonable
and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion.” (C.C.P. § 2016.040.) 
 
“A single letter, followed
by a response which refuses concessions, might in some instances be an adequate
attempt at informal resolution, especially when a legitimate discovery
objective is demonstrated. The time available before the motion filing deadline,
and the extent to which the responding party was complicit in the lapse of
available time, can also be relevant. An evaluation of whether, from the
perspective of a reasonable person in the position of the discovering party,
additional effort appeared likely to bear fruit, should also be considered” (Obregon
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 432.)
Upon review of the parties
submissions, the Court finds the meet and confer efforts of Plaintiff were
insufficient. The Court may deny a motion to compel discovery
for lack of a reasonable and good faith attempt to meet and confer. (Townsend
v. Superior Court (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1431, 1436-1439; Obregon v.
Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 434-435.)
 
As evidence of their meet and confer
efforts, Plaintiff submits a May 9, 2024 meet and confer letter sent to Ford. (Smith
Decl. Exh. 12.) This meet and confer letter is 36 pages long and appears to be
devoid of any specific reference to Ford’s discovery responses. (Id.)
Rather than identify the individual requests which require further response,
Plaintiff’s letter simply identifies types of information which are typically
in dispute in Song Beverly Cases. (Id.) Nor does this letter contain any
reference to Ford’s responses/objections, instead it appears to address a
number of usual objections regardless of whether Ford asserted them. For
example, Section D(1)(a) of Plaintiff’s meet and confer letter addresses Ford’s
allegedly improper objection on grounds that Plaintiff’s vehicle did not suffer
the claimed defects. Upon review of each of Ford’s responses their appears to
be no such objection. Ford’s responses to RFPD Nos. 28-30 merely state:
 
Claims and reports sometimes do not clearly articulate the basis for
the complaint or clearly identify any alleged defect or other issue with the
vehicle, and the facts and circumstances surrounding other claims and reports
vary widely depending on any number of factors, such as owner maintenance, use
or environmental conditions
 
(Bieman Exh. B, p. 38.) 
 
The above response may be improper on another
basis, but it is not the equivalent to Ford refusing to produce documents
because they claim Plaintiff’s vehicle does not suffer from an engine or transmission
defect. Further, it appears that the nature of the defect in Plaintiff’s
vehicle is something that Ford unsuccessfully sought clarification on in the
meet and confer process. It appears from June 25, 2024 email between counsel
that Ford sought to telephonically meet and confer as to the nature of the engine/transmission
defect so that they could provide the appropriate documents. (Biemann Decl.
Exh. E.) Ford contends that Plaintiff refused this request and Plaintiff does
not dispute this statement in their reply. (Id.) 
 
Additionally, it appears that Ford has
produced documents which may be responsive to some of the RFPD Plaintiff seeks to
further compel. Although Plaintiff’s declaration in reply concedes that Ford
has produced documents, it goes on to state that Ford has failed to produce all
documents with respect to various categories. The Court notes that neither
party explains whether this production was prior to the filing of this motion
or after. To the extent that Ford’s production predated the filing of this
motion, Plaintiff’s motion makes no reference to what production has occurred. For
example, Plaintiff’s motion seeks further responses related to defects in the
Subject Vehicle (RFPD Nos. 1, 3,8,10, and 13.) In response to RFPD No. 8 Ford
replied as follows: 
 
Ford will comply with this Request, in whole. Ford will produce repair
and service-related information for the subject vehicle from Ford’s Global
System for Analytics and Reporting (“GSAR”) regarding repairs or services
reimbursed by Ford to independent Ford dealers pursuant to Ford-issued
warranties, service contracts, and Field Service Actions.
 
(Biemann Decl. Exh. B, p. 4.) 
 
Despite the fact that Ford apparently
produced these documents, Plaintiff presents no reason as to why further
production is required to RFDP No. 8. The same can be said of most of the RFPD
to which Ford produced documents. 
 
Given the
foregoing, the Court does not construe the March 9, 2024 and June 10, 2024
letters to be evidence of a good faith effort to meet and confer. While Ford’s
objections may be without merit, Plaintiff’s informal efforts did little to
specifically address these concerns. Instead, Plaintiff’s counsel tendered a
lengthy letter which could have applied just as easily to any Song-Beverly
discovery dispute. This may be a good first step toward addressing discovery
issues, but it is far from a substantive effort to meet and confer. Plaintiff’s
counsel ignoring Ford’s request to meet and confer telephonically also supports
this interpretation. The Court simply does not view three letters in which the
parties talk past one another to be a good faith attempt at informal
resolution. 
 
Accordingly, the
motion to compel further production is DENIED without prejudice and the parties are ordered to meet and confer
in good faith as mandated by C.C.P. §2023.010(i).  It appears to the Court that Ford is willing
to produce further documentation at this juncture which would address at least
some of the requests in Plaintiff’s motion.
