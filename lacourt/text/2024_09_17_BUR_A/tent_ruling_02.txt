ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Georgina Gomez (Plaintiff)
brings this action against Kia America, Inc. (Kia) for Kia’s alleged violation
of the Song Beverly Act. Plaintiff alleges that her 2020 Kia Sportage (the Subject
Vehicle) was manufactured as defective. 
 
Plaintiff
now moves for an order compelling Kia’s
further response to Request for the Production of Documents (RFPD) as follows: 
 
RFPD Nos. 15-22
requesting documents related to Kia’s policies and procedures for handling
Song-Beverly cases.
 
RFPD Nos. 23-29 requesting
documents related to Kia’s warranty policy and procedure for handling warranty
issues. 
 
RFPD Nos. 30-31 requesting
documents of customer complaints for vehicles of the same year, make, and model
as the Subject Vehicle.  
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
A motion
to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or production of
documents (“RFPD”) may be brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of
compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive, or incomplete claims of inability to
comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections.  (C.C.P. §
2031.310(c).) 
 
A motion
to compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See C.C.P. §
2031.310(b)(1).) In Digital Music News LLC v Superior Court (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 216 at 224, the Court defined “good cause” as a showing that there
“a disputed fact that is of consequence in the action and the discovery sought
will tend in reason to prove or disprove that fact or lead to other evidence
that will tend to prove or disprove the fact.”  
 
If the
moving party has shown good cause for the requests for production, the burden
is on the objecting party to justify the objections. (Kirkland v. Sup.Ct
(2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.) 
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
A motion to compel further
responses to a request for production must include a meet and confer
declaration consistent with C.C.P. § 2016.040. (C.C.P. § 2031.310 (b)(2).) In
turn, Section 2016.040 requires that the moving party have made “a reasonable
and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion.” (C.C.P. § 2016.040.) 
 
“A single letter, followed
by a response which refuses concessions, might in some instances be an adequate
attempt at informal resolution, especially when a legitimate discovery
objective is demonstrated. The time available before the motion filing deadline,
and the extent to which the responding party was complicit in the lapse of
available time, can also be relevant. An evaluation of whether, from the
perspective of a reasonable person in the position of the discovering party,
additional effort appeared likely to bear fruit, should also be considered” (Obregon
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 432.)
 
Upon review of the parties submissions,
the Court finds the meet and confer efforts of Plaintiff were insufficient. The Court
may deny a motion to compel discovery for lack of a reasonable and good faith
attempt to meet and confer. (Townsend v. Superior Court (1998) 61
Cal.App.4th 1431, 1436-1439; Obregon v. Superior Court (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 424, 434-435.)
 
On March 28, 2024, Plaintiff propounded
her RFPD upon Kia. (Jung Decl. ¶ 18, Exh. 3.) On May 14, 2024, Kia
rendered its responses to the RFPD. (Jung Decl. ¶ 19, Exh. 4.) What
proceeded was a series of meet and confer correspondences which appear to have
been prematurely interrupted by Plaintiff’s filing of this motion. 
 
On June 17, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel
sent Kia a meet and confer letter detailing the various perceived deficiencies
in Kia’s responses. (Jung Decl. Exh. 6) This letter specifically requested Kia
respond by June 24, 2024. (Id.) On July 8, 2024, Kia responded to this
letter stating that it would supplement its responses to RFPD Nos. 1, 21, 22,
26-28, and 30 and produce more documents, pursuant to Plaintiff’s stipulation
to a protective order. (Haroutunian Decl. ¶ 7, Exh. B.) Kia represents
that it had received an extension to reply to the June 17, 2024 letter, thus her
July 8 response would have still been timely. (Hartounian Decl. ¶ 7.) 
 
On August 12, 2024, Kia served its
further responses and supplemental production pursuant to the stipulated
protective order. (Hartounian Decl. ¶ 8.) This was in accordance with the
July 8, 2024 letter which stated that further production would occur by August
12, 2024. (Hartounian Decl. Exh. 7.) The letter also agreed to extend
Plaintiff’ deadline to file this motion to August 26, 2024. (Id.) 
 
There is no evidence of any response by
Plaintiff’s counsel to Kia’s July 8, 2024 letter.  Instead, this motion to compel further
responses was filed on July 16, 2024. Plaintiff’s reply makes no reference to
the July 8 letter or the August 12 production. Given this omission, the Court
can only assume that the letter was received. If this is the case, Plaintiff’s
filing of this motion seems to be without evidence of a good faith meet and
confer effort. It was clear that Kia was willing to work with Plaintiff’s
counsel to address concerns regarding discovery and to produce supplemental
documents. Despite Kia’s good faith offer to work toward informal resolution,
Plaintiff elected to abandon the meet and confer process and file the instant
motion. 
 
Accordingly, the Court
orders denies the motion to compel without prejudice, and the parties are
ordered to meet and confer in good faith as mandated by C.C.P.
§2023.010(i).  It appears to the Court
that Kia is willing to produce further documentation at this juncture which
would address several of the requests in Plaintiff’s motion.
