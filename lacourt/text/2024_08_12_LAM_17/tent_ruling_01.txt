P^2MG, LLC, et al. 
 


 Case
  No.:  23STCV10071 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: August 12, 2024 



 
Defendants’
motion to file a cross-complaint against American Contractors is GRANTED.    
 
            On
5/4/2023, Plaintiff American Contractors Indemnity Company (ACIC) filed suit
against P^2MG, LLC dba P2MG, LLC, Michael E. Nelson, and Bakeyah S. Nelson,
alleging: (1) specific performance; (2) breach of contract; (3) express
indemnity; and (4) statutory reimbursement. 
 
            On
5/28/2024, Michael E. Nelson and P2MG, LLC (collectively, Defendants) moved for
leave to file a Cross-complaint against ACIC. 

 
Discussion 
 
            Defendants
seek leave to file a cross-complaint. 
 
Under Code of
Civil Procedure (CCP) section 426.50, a party may move for leave to file a
compulsory cross-complaint at any time before trial. 
 
Here, trial
is not set until 4/7/2025, and discovery is ongoing. The
policy favoring leave to amend is so strong that it is an abuse of discretion
to deny an amendment unless the adverse party can show meaningful prejudice.
(Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.) 
 
Given
that the Court has not found any evidence of meaningful prejudice if leave to
amend is granted, the Court grants Defendants’ motion.
 
Based
on the foregoing, Defendants’ motion to file a cross-complaint against ACIC is
granted.    
 
It is so ordered.
