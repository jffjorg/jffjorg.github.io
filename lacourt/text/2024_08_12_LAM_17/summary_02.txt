And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Sohaila Derakhshan (plaintiff) and Hamed Jafari (defendant). The plaintiff, representing herself, filed suit against the defendant alleging breach of fiduciary duty, elder abuse, forgery, conversion, and fraud. The defendant demurred to the Complaint, arguing that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient allegations to support each cause of action. The court agrees with the defendant and sustains the demurrer, without leave to amend. However, the dismissal is without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to refile the action on behalf of her deceased brother, rather than on her own individual standing. The court notes that the plaintiff does not have individual standing to pursue the claims and must pursue them on a representative basis. The plaintiff is urged to consult an attorney to assist with navigating this process.
