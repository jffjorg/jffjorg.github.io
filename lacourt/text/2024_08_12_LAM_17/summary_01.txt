And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Sohaila Derakhshan vs. Hamed Jafari, Case No. 23STCV28218. The defendant's demurrer is sustained, without leave to amend, meaning the defendant's objection to the complaint is upheld and the plaintiff cannot make changes to the complaint. However, the dismissal of the action is without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to refile the case on behalf of her deceased brother, rather than on her own individual standing. The judge finds that the plaintiff lacks individual standing to pursue the claims and must instead pursue them on a representative basis. The judge encourages the plaintiff to consult an attorney to assist her with navigating this process.
