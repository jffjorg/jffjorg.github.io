And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The motion was granted in part, denied in part. The plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages is denied, but the request for attorney fees is granted. The plaintiff alleged facts that could show the defendants engaged in conduct intended to cause injury and with "willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others." The judge denied the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages because the plaintiff has an operative claim for intrusion into private affairs. The judge granted the motion to strike the request for attorney fees because California follows the American rule, which provides that each party to a lawsuit must ordinarily pay his own attorney fees. The judge's ruling is subject to modification based on any submissions from the parties.
