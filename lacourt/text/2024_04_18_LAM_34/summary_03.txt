The plaintiff, Maria Antonia Rodriguez, filed a complaint against the defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc. on March 20, 2023. The defendant filed an answer on May 9, 2023. The plaintiff then filed a motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's PMQ on February 9, 2024.

The court found that the defendant's opposition lacked professionalism and that the plaintiff had shown good cause for the motion. Therefore, the motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's PMQ is granted, and the defendant's PMQ shall be made available within ten days of the issuance of this order.
