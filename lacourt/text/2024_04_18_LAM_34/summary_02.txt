Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Edgebanding Services, Inc., has filed a motion to relieve itself from the order deeming certain requests for admissions admitted. The defendant argues that it did not oppose the motion to deem the requests for admissions admitted in reliance on representations by the plaintiff's counsel and that it did not appear at the November 9, 2023, hearing due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and/or excusable neglect. The court finds that the defendant has not met its burden of showing that it is entitled to relief from the admission of the requests for admissions and that the defendant has inexcusably neglected this case. Additionally, the court notes that the entry of default against both defendants deprives the court of jurisdiction to consider any motion other than a motion for relief from default. Therefore, the court will deny the motion for relief from admitted requests for admissions.
