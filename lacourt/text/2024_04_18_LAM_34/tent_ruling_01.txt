BACKGROUND:
 
On January 3, 2020,
Plaintiffs Stephen Glick and Alfred Garcia filed their Complaint against
Defendant City of Los Angeles on causes of action for discrimination and
retaliation, both in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”).

 
From July 5 to 12,
2023, the Court held a jury trial in this matter. The Jury found in favor of
both Plaintiffs and against Defendant on both causes of action. For Plaintiff
Stephen Glick, the Jury found $8,621,358.00 in damages, which consisted of
$5,000,000.00 in past non-economic damages, $3,000,000.00 in future
non-economic damages, and $621,358.00 in future economic damages. For Plaintiff
Alfred Garcia, the Jury found $4,500,000.00 in damages, which consisted of
$3,000,000.00 in past non-economic damages and $1,500,000.00 in future
non-economic damages. 
 
On September 20,
2023, the Court entered Judgment in this matter. 
 
On November 16, 2023,
the Court: (1) denied Defendant’s Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the
Verdict; and (2) granted in part Defendant’s Motion to Tax Costs. 
 
On November 30, 2023,
the Court granted Defendant’s Motion for New Trial. 
 
On December 19, 2023,
Plaintiffs filed their respective Notices of Rejection of the Court’s Reduction
of Damages in Conditional New Trial Order. 
 
On December 21, 2023,
Plaintiffs appealed the Court’s grant of the Motion for New Trial. 
 
On January 2, 2024,
Defendant cross-appealed the Judgment.  
 
On March 14, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Award of Attorney’s Fees, Expert Fees, and
Interest (“Motion for Attorneys’ Fees”). In support of their Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees, Plaintiffs concurrently filed: (1) Declaration of Dan Stormer;
(2) Declaration of Matthew S. McNicholas; (3) Declaration of Jason L. Oliver;
and (4) Declaration of Douglas D. Winter. 
 
On March 15, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed their Notice of Errata. 
 
On March 27, 2024,
Defendant filed its Opposition to the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees. In support of
its Opposition, Defendant concurrently filed Declaration of Kim Karelis. 
 
On April 2, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed their Reply in support of the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees. 
 
On April 3, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed their Objections to Declaration of Kim Karelis.

        Although the Court has sustained one objection, many of the
objections are frivolous.  To cite but
the first example, Plaintiff objects to the statement in the declaration of Kim
Karelis that “I was retained by the City to prepare an expert opinion regarding
what would be a reasonable and necessary lodestar fee for the work performed by
plaintiffs’ counsel, . . .” (Plaintiff’s Objections, Objection No. 1.)  Plaintiff objects to this statement, inter
alia, on the grounds of “lack of personal knowledge”, “inadmissible
opinion”, “improper legal conclusion”, and “improper Expert Testimony on Issue
of Law.”  These objections are
frivolous.  “This is hardly good
advocacy, and it unnecessarily overburdens the trial court.” (Nazir v.
United Airlines, Inc. (2009) 178
Cal.App.4th 243, 254, fn. 3.)  
 
        In addition,
Plaintiffs object to various portions of the memorandum in Defendant’s
Opposition. The Court OVERRULES these objections. Memoranda do not consist of
evidence. 
 
II.      
Legal
Standard
 
“Except as otherwise
expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of
right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032,
subd. (b).)
 
Attorneys’ fees are
allowed as costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc,
§ 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(B).)
 
III.    
Discussion
 
A. 
    The
Parties’ Arguments
 
Plaintiffs move the Court to award
$1,912,950.00 in attorney’s fees, which would consist of:
 
(1)      
$907,506.25
in lodestar attorney’s fees;
 
(2)      
$907,506.25
for a 2.0 multiplier on the lodestar;
 
(3)      
$54,225.00
in fees for the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees; 
 
(4)      
$27,112.50
for a 1.5 multiplier on the motion fees; and
 
(5)      
$16,600.00
in expert fees. 
 
(Reply, p. 10:3–8.)
 
        Plaintiffs
argue: (1) that they are entitled to recover attorneys’ fees as Plaintiffs who
prevailed on a FEHA claim; (2) that the lodestar method is appropriate for
calculating fees; (3) that the number of hours expended by Plaintiffs’ Counsel
was reasonable; (4) that the hourly rates of Plaintiffs’ Counsel were
reasonable; (5) that a 2.0 multiplier of the lodestar is reasonable and should
be awarded; (6) that Plaintiffs are entitled to recovery of their expert
witness fees; and (7) that Plaintiffs are entitled to interest on their fees
and costs from the date Judgment was entered. (Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, pp.
3:8, 4:7, 5:15, 7:19, 11:6, 13:7, 14:11, 14:23–24.)
 
        Defendant
argues: (1) that the requested hourly rates are excessive; (2) that Plaintiffs
seek fees for work that was administrative, non-billable, duplicative, and
excessive; (3) that a multiplier should not be awarded given this case was not
complex and did not require superior skill or expertise; and (4) that
Plaintiffs waived their right to seek expert witness fees. (Opposition, pp.
2:11, 3:4–5, 4:15–16, 4:22–23.)
 
        Plaintiffs
reiterates their arguments in their Reply. 
 
B. 
    Authority for Fees & Prevailing Party
 
1. 
    Legal
Standard
 
“It is an unlawful
employment practice . . . [f]or an employer, because of the race, religious
creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental
disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex,
gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or veteran
or military status of any person, to refuse to hire or employ the person or to
refuse to select the person for a training program leading to employment, or to
bar or to discharge the person from employment or from a training program
leading to employment, or to discriminate against the person in compensation or
in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.” (Gov. Code, § 12940, subd.
(a).)
 
“In civil actions brought under this
section, the court, in its discretion, may award to the prevailing party,
including the department, reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, including
expert witness fees, except that, notwithstanding Section 998 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, a prevailing defendant shall not be awarded fees and costs
unless the court finds the action was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless
when brought, or the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became
so.” (Gov. Code, § 12965, subd. (c)(6).) 
 
The relevant section of FEHA
“grants the trial court discretion to award attorney fees to a prevailing
party.” (Chavez v. City of Los Angeles (2010) 47 Cal.4th 970, 976.)
“This statute has been interpreted to mean that in a FEHA action a trial court
should ordinarily award attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff unless special
circumstances would render a fee award unjust. (Ibid.)
 
2. 
    Discussion
 
Attorneys’ fees pursuant to FEHA
are applicable here. Defendant does not dispute this. 
 
Plaintiffs are the prevailing
party. The Jury found in favor of them and against Defendant on both causes of
action tried. Even with the remittitur, Plaintiffs are still entitled to an
award of damages. There are no circumstances here that would render a fee award
unjust. 
 
        The Court
exercises its discretion here to award Plaintiffs attorneys’ fees. (Gov. Code,
§ 12965, subd. (c)(6).)
 
C. 
    Method
of Calculation
 
1. 
    Legal
Standard
 
“An attorney fee award under the
FEHA is designed to incentivize and reward a plaintiff's attorney in a civil
rights case. Trial courts first determine a lodestar amount: the hours spent
times a reasonable hourly rate. Courts may then increase the amount, usually by
applying a multiplier to the lodestar. The multiplier is to compensate for
extrinsic factors such as the risk of nonpayment (the contingency factor), the
public interest advanced by the case, the difficulty of the issues involved,
and the skill of the attorneys.” (Caldera v. Dep’t of Corr. & Rehab. (2020)
48 Cal.App.5th 601, 604, citing Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1135.)
 
2. 
    Discussion
 
The Parties appear to agree that
the lodestar adjustment method is appropriate, although Defendant argues that a
multiplier is not appropriate. 
 
The Court will use the lodestar adjustment
method and then considers whether a multiplier is appropriate and if so, how
much the multiplier should be.
 
D. 
    Reasonableness
of the Attorneys’ Fees Claimed
 
1. 
    Legal
Standard
 
“Under the lodestar adjustment methodology, the trial court
must initially determine the actual time expended and then ascertain whether
under all the circumstances¿of the case the amount of actual time expended and the monetary charge being
made for the time expended are reasonable. Factors to be considered include,
but are not limited to, the complexity of the case and procedural demands, the
attorney skill exhibited and the results achieved. The prevailing party and fee
applicant bears the burden of showing that the fees incurred were reasonably
necessary to¿the conduct of the litigation,
and were
reasonable in amount. It follows that if the prevailing party fails to meet
this burden, and the court finds the time expended or amount charged is not
reasonable under the circumstances, then the court must take this into account
and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.” (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of N. Am.,
LLC (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240, 247 [cleaned up].)
 
2. 
    Reasonableness
of the Hourly Rates
 
Plaintiffs’ Counsel claim the
following hourly rates:
 
(1)      
$1,250.00
per hour for Counsel Matthew McNicholas;
 
(2)      
$1,000.00
per hour for Counsel Douglas Winter; 
 
(3)      
$900.00
per hour for Counsel Jason Oliver;
 
(4)      
$700.00
per hour for Counsel Abel Nair; 
 
(5)      
$500.00
per hour for Counsel Aleen Sorejian; and
 
(6)      
$225.00
per hour for Paralegal Dawn McGuire.
 
(Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, pp. 10:23–27, 11:2–3.)
 
        The Court has
considered the Declarations of Matthew McNicholas, Douglas Winter, and Jason
Oliver, which directly described the experiences Plaintiffs’ Counsel (and
Paralegal Dawn McGuire) have had.  The
Court also considered the Declaration of Dan Stormer, who offered his opinion regarding
the reasonableness of the requested hourly rates. Finally, the Court considered
the Declaration of Kim Karelis, who offered her opinion as to why the hourly
rates were not reasonable. 
 
Upon considering the materials
presented, the Court determines that the hourly rates for Counsel McNicholas
(who has more than 25 years of legal experience and extensive trial
experience), Counsel Winter (who has more than 30 years of legal experience and
extensive trial experience), Counsel Oliver (who has more than 25 years of
legal experience and extensive trial experience), counsel Nair (who has 20
years of legal experience but not particularly extensive trial experience) and
Paralegal Dawn McGuire (who has almost 40 years of paralegal experience) are
all reasonable. 
 
The Court further determines that
the hourly rate for Counsel Sorejian (who was sworn in as an attorney in 2023) is
unreasonable. The Court will allow a $300.00 per hour rate for Counsel
Sorejian. 
 
3. 
    Reasonableness
of the Number of Hours
 
Plaintiffs’ Counsel claim that
1,149.75 hours of work were incurred on the merits of this matter, which is
comprised of:
 
(1)      
182.75
hours by Counsel Matthew McNicholas;
 
(2)      
317
hours by Counsel Douglas D. Winter;
 
(3)      
230.25
hours by Counsel Jason Oliver; 
 
(4)      
112
hours by Counsel Abel Nair; 
 
(5)      
27 hours
by Counsel Aleen Sorejian; and
 
(6)      
280.75
hours by Paralegal Dawn McGuire.
 
(Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, pp. 10:23–27, 11:2–3.)
 
        (The hours
spent on the fee motion will be discussed separately infra.)
 
        The Court
considered the same declarations as for the hourly rates. The Court also
considered the various invoices submitted in connection with these
declarations. 
 
        The Court
further considered what has occurred in this litigation. 
 
During the first two years of this
matter (2020–2021), the main issue was discovery and the litigation of a Pitchess
motion. 
 
During the third year of this
matter (2022), the Court denied Defendant’s untimely motion for judgment on the
pleadings and granted in part Plaintiffs’ discovery motion. 
 
During the fourth year of this
matter (2023), the Court denied Defendant’s motion for mental health
examinations of Plaintiffs, ruled on trial-related motions in limine, granted
in part Plaintiffs’ unopposed motion for production of documents at trial, held
a six-day jury trial in this matter, and ruled on various post-judgment
motions. Among other things, the Court granted Defendant’s Motion for New Trial
and conditionally ordered a new trial limited to the issue of damages. 
 
        Based on all of
these considerations, it appears to the Court that 1,149.75 hours requested is
reasonable.  
 
The Court therefore awards Plaintiffs’
counsel a lodestar of $902,331,25.
 
4.      Fees
for the Fees Motion
 
        Plaintiffs’ Counsel requests $54,225.00
for work on the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees — as well as a 1.5 multiplier on
that amount. (Reply, p. 10:3–8.)
 
        This is an unreasonable amount of money
to request for a relatively simple copy-and-paste motion that was lightly
opposed by Defendant. (The Court notes that Defendant’s opposition is barely
five pages long.)  There was no special
skill required for this fee motion; although the Court understands the
importance of an attorney's fees motion for an attorney working on a FEHA case,
an associate could have written this motion.
 
        The Court will allow $15,000.00 in total
fees for the work incurred on the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees. The Court does
not award a multiplier on the attorney's fees motion because this motion itself
was not taken on a contingent basis; i.e., by the time the attorney's fees
motion was written, Plaintiffs had already won their trial and attorney's fees
was an all-but certainty.  (The
multiplier enhancement on the merits lodestar will be discussed infra.)
 
 
E. 
    Multiplier
to the Merits Lodestar
 
1. 
    Legal
Standard
 
“The purpose
of the multiplier is to reward the prevailing attorney with an increased fee in
light of the extrinsic Ketchum factors: the importance and difficulty of the litigation;
the novelty of the issues involved; the risk of nonpayment for the attorney's
services (the contingency factor); the skill of the attorney in presenting the
case; and the magnitude of the results obtained.” (Caldera, supra,
48 Cal.App.5th at p. 607, citing Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at
pp. 1132–1134.)
 
“Of course, the trial court is not required to include a fee enhancement to the basic
lodestar figure for contingent risk, exceptional skill, or other factors,
although it retains discretion to do so in the appropriate case; moreover, the
party seeking a fee enhancement bears the burden of proof.” (Ketchum, supra,
24 Cal.4th at p. 1138, emphasis omitted.)
 
2. 
    Discussion
 
Plaintiffs request a multiplier
enhancement of 2.00. (Reply, p. 10:3–6.)
 
        Defendant
argues that no multiplier should be awarded because this case was not complex,
did not require superior skill or expertise, and should not have been difficult
for Plaintiffs’ Counsel given the experience reflected in their declarations.
(Opposition, p. 4:15–21.)
 
        The Court finds
that Plaintiffs’ Counsel have met their burden and that a multiplier is
appropriate in this case.
 
a.  
    Time
Delay of Litigation
 
i.           
Legal
Standard
 
“The adjustment
to the lodestar figure, e.g., to provide a fee enhancement reflecting the risk
that the attorney will not receive payment if the suit does not succeed,
constitutes earned compensation; unlike a windfall, it is neither unexpected
nor fortuitous. Rather, it is intended to approximate market-level compensation
for such services, which typically includes a premium for the risk of
nonpayment or delay in payment of attorney fees.” (Ketchum v. Moses
(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1138; accord Amaral v. Cintas Corp. No. 2 (2008)
163 Cal.App.4th 1157, 1217–1218 and Taylor v. Nabors Drilling USA, LP (2014)
222 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1252.)
 
ii.         
Discussion
 
In contrast to Defense Counsel, who
presumably gets paid monthly, Plaintiffs’ Counsel have not been paid for the more
than four years that this action has been pending. 
 
        FEHA cases are
based on statutes that are designed to protect against discrimination, and
there is a significant chance that FEHA plaintiffs will not win their cases. If a plaintiff’s attorney is paid no more than the lodestar
for a FEHA case, “competent counsel will be reluctant to accept fee award
cases.” (Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 1133 [cleaned up].)¿
 
The normal
interest rate in California is 10%, which is the equivalent of a 1.10
multiplier. However, not all of an attorney’s work occurs at the beginning of
any given year; therefore, giving a multiplier of 1.1 for each year of work
would overcompensate Plaintiffs’ counsel. 
For ease of calculation, the Court assumes that the work was performed
more-or-less evenly throughout the course of any given year. This means a 1.05
multiplier per year is appropriate to compensate Plaintiffs’ Counsel for the
time-value of the money that they would have been paid had the case not been
contingent.¿
 
        Plaintiffs’
Counsel litigated this case from January 2020 to April 2024 without payment. In
consideration of this delay and that the statutes under which Plaintiff sued
were designed to protect the consumer, the Court awards a 1.25 multiplier to
the merits lodestar. This multiplier compensates Plaintiffs’ Counsel for the
time value of the money they would have been paid monthly had the case not been
contingent. 
 
b.  
    Substantive
Factors
 
This case involved gender-based
discrimination and retaliation by the Los Angeles Police Department against two
of its officers. Specifically, Plaintiffs submitted evidence to the Jury for
the proposition that Plaintiffs were differentially considered, investigated,
and punished by the Los Angeles Police Department based on Plaintiffs’ gender.
The Jury considered this evidence and found in favor of Plaintiffs. 
 
The importance of deterring
gender-based discrimination and retaliation by the Los Angeles Police
Department cannot be overstated. Unfortunately, gender-based discrimination and
retaliation claims are neither new nor novel; nonetheless, this case required –
and had – highly-skilled attorneys representing the Plaintiffs. 
 
Here, Plaintiffs’ Counsel exhibited
a high degree of skill throughout most, but not, parts of the litigation.
Specifically, Plaintiffs’ Counsel did well in obtaining evidence during
discovery, which can be particularly difficult considering the privileges of
the City of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Police Department. Plaintiffs’
Counsel also did an excellent job in presenting their case to the Jury,
prevailing on both causes of action tried. 
 
However, Plaintiffs’ Counsel failed
to present adequate (and for some sub-issues, any) evidence regarding damages.
This caused the Jury to err in portions of its damages award, which in turn led
to Defendant’s successful Motion for New Trial. The upcoming retrial on the
issue of damages will be costly for Plaintiffs, Defendant, the Court, and
ultimately the public. These expenses were entirely avoidable and indicate that
Plaintiffs’ Counsel significantly overreached by trying to avoid evidentiary
issues while still obtaining a multi-million damages award. Plaintiffs’
Counsel’s failure to present adequate evidence diminished the magnitude of the
results obtained — an important factor when considering a multiplier. 
 
After taking all of this into
account, the Court finds that a multiplier enhancement of 1.20 times the merits
lodestar is appropriate here. This multiplier enhancement is in addition to the
1.25 multiplier given for the delay in payment. Altogether, this 1.45
multiplier accounts for all of the factors listed in Ketchum and
discussed above. 
 
Including the multiplier of 1.45,
the court awards Plaintiffs’ counsel attorney's fees of $1,308,380.31 plus an
additional $15,000.00 for the attorney's fees motion for a total of $1,323,380.31.
 
F.  
    Interest
 
1. 
    Legal
Standard
 
“A person who is entitled to recover damages
certain, or capable of being made certain by calculation, and the right to
recover which is vested in the person upon a particular day, is entitled also
to recover interest thereon from that day, except when the debtor is prevented
by law, or by the act of the creditor from paying the debt. . . .” (Civ. Code,
§ 3287, subd. (a).)
 
“Every person who is entitled under any
judgment to receive damages based upon a cause of action in contract where the
claim was unliquidated, may also recover interest thereon from a date prior to
the entry of judgment as the court may, in its discretion, fix, but in no event
earlier than the date the action was filed.” (Civ. Code, § 3287, subd. (b).)
 
2. 
    Discussion
 
Plaintiffs request interest at the
rate of 7% per year from the date of the original entry of Judgment (September
20, 2023) until the Judgment is paid. (Reply, p. 10:9–10.)
 
Defendant does not oppose this
request. 
 
The Court agrees with Plaintiffs’
argument and will allow interest on attorneys’ fees to accrue at the rate of 7%
per year as of September 20, 2023. 
 
G. 
    Expert
Costs
 
Plaintiffs argue that they are
entitled to recovery of their expert witness fees. (Motion for Attorneys’ Fees,
p. 14:11.)
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiffs
waived their right to seek these fees. (Opposition, p. 4:22–23.)
 
        The Court
agrees with Plaintiff.  

 
        In arguing for
the Court to exercises its discretion to grant expert costs, Plaintiff cites to
the recent case of Neeble-Diamond v. Hotel California by the Sea, LLC
(2024) 99 Cal.App.5th 551 for the proposition that, in a FEHA case, expert witness
fees are for the Court to decide, and hence should not be included in a
memorandum of costs.  Neeble-Diamond
states, in relevant part:  
 
In Anthony [v. City of
Los Angeles (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1011],   the
court concluded the appellant was not required to file a timely cost memorandum
to preserve its right to seek expert costs that were not recoverable as a
matter of right under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032. As the court
pointed out, the cost memorandum applies only to “cost items to which a party
is entitled ‘as a matter of right’ ” (Anthony, at p. 1015, 83 Cal.Rptr.3d
306), because “rule 3.1700, ... requires the clerk of the court to ‘immediately
enter the costs on the judgment’ if the opposing party does not move to strike
or tax costs. [Citation.] By contrast, costs such as expert witness fees not
ordered by the court, or attorney fees that require a court determination, may
not be ‘immediately enter[ed]’ by the clerk, and instead necessitate a decision
by the trial court, exercising its discretion. In short, there would be no
point in requiring a party to include in its memorandum of costs those cost
items which are awarded in the discretion of the court and thus cannot
be entered by the clerk of the court under rule 3.1700.”  (Neeble-Diamond, supra, 99 Cal.App.5th
at 558.)


        Plaintiff is
correct.
 
        The Court, in
its discretion, will award Plaintiff $16,600.00 in expert witness costs.
 
 
IV.

The Motion for Award of Attorneys’
Fees is GRANTED in part.
