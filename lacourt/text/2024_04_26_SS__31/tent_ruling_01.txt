  Case Number:  22STCV16372    Hearing Date:   April 26, 2024    Dept:  31 SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT  MARSHALL KRUPP, Plaintiff(s),  vs.  KROENKE SPORTS & ENTERTAINMENT LLC, ET AL.,  Defendant(s). ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )       CASE NO: 22STCV16372  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: CONTINUING MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  Dept. 31 1:30 p.m.  April 26, 2024  I. BACKGROUND Plaintiff Marshall Krupp (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants Kroenke Sports & Entertainment LLC, et al. for damages arising from a trip and fall at SoFi stadium.  Defendants Kroenke Sports & Entertainment LLC; Stadco LA, LLC; Pincay RE, LLC; and Chargers Football Company, LLC filed their motion for summary judgment/adjudication as to Plaintiff’s operative complaint. The hearing on the motion is set for April 26, 2024. Defendant Contemporary Services Corporation filed its separate motion for summary judgment against Plaintiff’s complaint. The hearing on the motion is also set for April 26, 2024.  Plaintiff filed two notices of lodging under seal. Plaintiff lodged the following under seal as to each separate motion: (1) Plaintiff’s opposition, (2) Plaintiff’s separate statement, (2) the Declaration of Tom G. Antunovich in support of Plaintiff’s opposition, and (4) Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections to evidence.  No motion to seal has been filed to date.  II. LEGAL STANDARD  Unless confidentiality is required by law, court records are presumed to be open to the public. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd. (c).) Consequently, pleadings, motions, evidence, and other papers may not be filed under seal merely by stipulation of the parties; rather, a prior court order is necessary. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551, subd. (a).) (Emphasis added). California Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(1) states, “[a] party requesting that a record be filed under seal must file a motion or an application for an order sealing the record. The motion or application must be accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify the sealing.” CRC 2.550(d) makes clear that records cannot be sealed without appropriate findings.   Plaintiff references a protective order for the filing under seal. However, the parties' agreement that certain documents be filed under seal is improper and insufficient. (See Savaglio v. Wal–Mart Stores, Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 588, 600).  A prior court order must be obtained. (See CRC 2.551(a); see H.B. Fuller Co. v. Doe (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 879, 888.) The Court is unable to locate any prior order authorizing the documents to be sealed, nor has there been any motion filed to seal to date.   Based on the foregoing, the Court will continue both motions for summary judgment in the interim to provide Plaintiff an opportunity to properly file an application or motion for the requested portions of the documents to be sealed. If the parties are available, the Court will conduct the IDC (scheduled for 3:00 p.m.) immediately after the 1:30 p.m. hearing on this matter.  The Hearing on Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Kroenke Sports & Entertainment LLC; Stadco LA, LLC; Pincay RE, LLC; and Chargers Football Company, LLC is hereby continued to _________________.  The Hearing on Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Contemporary Services Corporation is continued to ____________________.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 25th day of April 2024      Hon.
