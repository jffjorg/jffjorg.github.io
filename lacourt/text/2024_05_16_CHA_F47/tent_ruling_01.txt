RULING: The motion is denied.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant L.A. Tire Tech, Inc. (L.A. Tire
Tech) is a fleet maintenance company who allegedly provided maintenance and
repair services to Defendant/Cross-Complainant SiteOne Landscape Supply, LLC
(SiteOne) pursuant to an oral agreement. 
As of 8/21/21, SiteOne notified L.A. Tire Tech that all of its services
were no longer needed by SiteOne.  L.A.
Tire Tech contends that at that time it had submitted over $180,000.00 in
invoices for services performed by L.A. Tire Tech on the fleet of SiteOne as
requested by SiteOne.  L.A. Tire Tech
contends that, despite repeated demands, SiteOne has failed and refuses to pay
the invoices.   
 
On 12/17/21, L.A. Tire Tech filed this action against SiteOne
for: (1) Goods and Services Rendered (Common Count),
(2) Account Stated (Common Count), (3) Open Book Account (Common Count) and (4)
Breach of Oral Contract.  On 3/7/22, L.A.
Tire Tech filed its operative First Amended Complaint for: (1) Goods and
Services Rendered (Common Count), (2) Open Book Account (Common Count) and (3)
Breach of Oral Contract.  On 3/18/22, SiteOne
answered the First Amended Complaint.  
 
On 10/16/23, this Court granted SiteOne’s motion for
leave to file a cross-complaint against L.A. Tire Tech and Gerard J. Neglio
(Neglio) (collectively, Cross-Defendants), the sole owner of L.A. Tire Tech,
for: (1) Breach of Contract and (2) Express Indemnity.  After meet and confer efforts failed to
resolve the issues Cross-Defendants had with the cross-complaint, on 11/17/23, Cross-Defendants
filed and served their demurrer to the entire cross-complaint and motion to
strike which sought  to strike paragraph
6 from the cross-complaint.  The demurrer
and motion to strike were scheduled for hearing on 1/2/24.
 
On 12/15/23, Cross-Defendants filed and served a Special
Motion to Strike SiteOne’s entire cross-complaint which was originally
scheduled for hearing on 6/21/24 and then, on 12/18/23, rescheduled by Cross-Defendants
to 2/2/24. 
 
On 12/18/23, SiteOne filed and served oppositions to the demurrer
and motion to strike and on 12/22/23, Cross-Defendants filed and served replies
to the oppositions.  On 1/2/24, the Court
sustained the demurrer with 15 days leave to amend and granted the motion to
strike without leave to amend.  (See
1/2/24 Minute Order).  On 1/17/24,
pursuant to this Court’s order, SiteOne filed and served its First Amended
Cross-Complaint.
 
On 1/22/24, SiteOne filed and served its opposition to
the Special Motion to Strike which addressed the original cross-complaint and
on 1/26/24, Cross-Defendants filed and served their  reply to that opposition. 
 
On 2/2/24, the Court denied Cross-Defendants’ Special
Motion to Strike, which addressed the original cross-complaint, as moot due to
the filing of the First Amended Cross-Complaint in response to the ruling on
the demurrer to the original cross-complaint. 
(See 2/2/24 Minute Order). 

 
On 2/21/24, Cross-Defendants filed their answer to the
First Amended Cross-Complaint and on 3/18/24, Cross-Defendants filed and served
the instant Special Motion to Strike which seeks an order, pursuant to CCP
425.16, striking the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FAXC) of SiteOne.  Alternatively, Cross-Defendants seek an order
striking the following portions of the First Amended Cross-Complaint:
 
(1) The purported first cause of action for breach of
contract. (FAXC ¶¶ 20-33.) 
(2) The purported second cause of action for express
indemnity. (FAXC ¶¶ 34-39.) 
(3) The purported third cause of action for declaratory
relief. (FAXC ¶¶ 40-44.)

Cross-Complaint, which provides: “Cross-Defendants’ indemnity obligation under

or breach of [the] ARI Terms.”

[L.A. Tire] subcontractor, supplier, or other third party) or Vendor’s [L.A.
Tire] negligence, gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach of [the] ARI
Terms.’” 
(6) Page 7, lines 2 to 6 of the First Amended
Cross-Complaint, which provides: “Despite repeated requests, Cross-Defendants

this lawsuit as required by the Agreement. Cross-Defendants also refuse to
confirm their agreement to indemnify SiteOne for any other costs or damages
incurred in connection with this action as required by the Agreement. As a

Tire’s breaches of the Agreement set forth above.”
 
SiteOne has opposed the motion and Cross-Defendants have
filed a reply to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Cross-Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice of the
declarations of Gerald Neglio and Ryan C. McKim filed on 12/15/23 in support of
Cross-Defendants’ prior Special Motion to Strike directed at the original
cross-complaint is granted as to the existence of the declarations in the court
file but not as to the truth of any matter asserted in those declarations.  
 
SiteOne’s objections (numbers 1-12) to the declaration of
Gerard Neglio are overruled.
 
Cross-Defendants’ objection (number 1) to the declaration
of Christopher Foster is overruled.
 
Cross-Defendants’ objections (number 1-7) to the
declaration of Frank Dunn are overruled.
 
______
CCP 425.16, the anti-SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public
Participation) statute, sets forth a procedure for striking
complaints/cross-complaints, or portions thereof, which challenge the exercise
of constitutionally protected free speech rights.  See Monster Energy Co. (2019) 7
C5th 781, 788 citing Kibler (2006) 39 C4th 192, 196; Varian Medical
Systems, Inc. (2005) 35 C4th 180, 192.
 
CCP 425.16(b)(1) provides: 
 
“A cause of action against a person
arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person's right of
petition or free speech under the United States Constitution or the California
Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special
motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has
established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the
claim.”
 
Under the anti-SLAPP statute, an “‘act in furtherance of
a person's right of petition or free speech under the United States or
California Constitution in connection with a public issue’ includes: (1) any
written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or
judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, (2)
any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under
consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any
other official proceeding authorized by law, (3) any written or oral statement
or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection
with an issue of public interest, or (4) any other conduct in furtherance of
the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional
right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public
interest.”  CCP 425.16(e).
 
In ruling on a special motion to strike, the court undertakes
a two-step analysis.  First, the court
must determine whether the defendant/cross-defendant has met its burden of
establishing the challenged claim(s) arise out defendant/cross-defendant’s exercise
of a constitutional right of free speech or petition.  Bonni (2021) 11 C5th 995, 1009; Navellier
(2002) 29 C4th 82, 88-89; Jarrow Formulas, Inc. (2003) 31 C4th 728, 733.  Second, if the defendant meets this initial
burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff/cross-complainant to establish the
claim(s) have minimal merit.  Bonni,
supra; Golden Gate Land Holdings LLC (2022) 81 CA5th 82, 89.
 
In determining whether a complaint/cross-complaint arises
from protected activity, the protected activity itself must be the wrong
complained of, and not just evidence of liability or a step leading to a
different act for which liability is alleged. 
See Golden Gate, supra at 90.  Allegations regarding protected activity that
do not form the basis for recovery, but rather  merely provide context, are not covered under
the anti-SLAPP statute.  Trilogy
Plumbing, Inc. (2020) 50 CA5th 920, 933; Aguilar (2012) 207 CA4th
1152, 1163.
 
Here, SiteOne’s breach of contract cause of action is
based on a written contract between L.A. Tire Tech and ARI of which SiteOne claims
to be a third-party beneficiary.  (FAXC
¶¶11, 21, Ex.A thereto).  SiteOne alleges
that L.A. Tire Tech breached the contract by: (1) failing to submit all
invoices for repairs within 30 days of completing the services; (2) failing to
maintain complete and accurate records relating to the services it provided to
SiteOne; (3) failing to conform to generally accepted practices in L.A. Tire
Tech’s field; (4) failing to perform services in a workmanlike and ethical
manner; (5) failing to perform services that were of professional quality; and
(6) by providing goods that were not free of defects. (FAXC ¶¶25-28; Dunn Decl.
¶¶2-5).   
 
The breach of contract claim is also based, in part, on L.A.
Tire Tech’s refusal to indemnify Site One for the costs it has incurred in
defense of this lawsuit based on the indemnity provision in the alleged
contract.  (FAXC ¶¶18, 29, Ex.A, Section
10).  The express indemnity cause of
action is also based on the indemnity provision in the agreement/contract of
which SiteOne claims to be a third-party beneficiary.   (FAXC ¶¶18, 34-39 and Ex.A thereto).  
 
The declaratory relief cause of action merely reflects
that the parties have a dispute regarding their respective contractual
obligations.  
 
While SiteOne alleges that the filing of the underlying
lawsuit “triggered” Cross-Defendants’ indemnity obligation, L.A. Tire Tech’s
alleged breaches of contract, which SiteOne contends caused it damages
including correcting maintenance and repair work that was performed incorrectly
or of inferior quality and costs to ensure SiteOne had complete and accurate
maintenance and repair records for its vehicles and equipment, are not
protected activity.  (See FAXC
¶¶24-28, 33; Dunn Decl. ¶5).
 
An indemnity claim based on the filing of litigation does
not necessarily constitute protected activity for purposes of the anti-SLAPP
statute.  See Wong (2019) 43
CA5th 358, 365, 367.  As noted above, if
the filing of litigation is merely a step leading to a different act for which
liability is asserted and not the core injury-producing conduct, the
application of the anti-SLAPP statute is not triggered.  Id; See also Area 51
Productions, Inc. (2018) 20 CA5th 581, 594; Park (2017) 2 C5th 1057,
1062.   
 
Cross-Defendants have not shown that SiteOne’s
cross-claims arise out L.A. Tire Tech’s protected activity of filing the
underlying complaint.  Rather, SiteOne’s
cross-claims arise out of L.A. Tire Tech’s alleged breaches of the agreement,
including breaching the obligation to indemnify SiteOne for expenses incurred
in defending against the underlying litigation. 
As such, Cross-Defendants have not met their initial burden of establishing
that SiteOne’s cross-claims arise out of protected activity.   
 
However, even if the causes of action in the First
Amended Cross-Complaint could be said to arise from protected activity, SiteOne
has met its burden of establishing its claims have minimal merit.  See Golden Gate Land Holdings LLC,
supra at 89.  In making this
determination, the court must draw every legitimate favorable interest from
SiteOne’s evidence.  See Kinsella
(2020) 45 CA5th 442, 453.
 
The elements of a breach of contract cause of action are:
(1) the existence of a contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance of the
contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s breach, and (4) the
resulting damage.  Richman (2014) 224
CA4th 1182, 1186.  Similarly, the
elements of an express indemnity claim are: (1) the parties’ contractual
relationship, (2) the indemnitee’s performance of that portion of the contract
which gives rise to the indemnification claim, (3) the facts showing a loss within
the meaning of the parties’ indemnification agreement, and (4) the amount of
damages sustained.  Four Star
Electric, Inc. (1992) 7 CA4th 1375, 1380. 

 
Through the declaration of Frank Dunn, SiteOne’s Vice
President for Logistics, SiteOne has provided sufficient prima facie evidence
to support its claims for breach of contract and express indemnity.  (See Dunn Decl. ¶¶2-5).  The evidence makes a sufficient prima facie
showing that the agreement applies to the invoices at issue.  (See Foster Decl., Ex.3).  It also cannot be determined as a matter of
law that L.A. Tire Tech is solely deemed a “maintenance vendor” such that
Section 4.2 of the agreement would not apply. 
The evidence indicates that L.A. Tire Tech performed maintenance
services as well as repairs, inspections, certifications and other services.  (Dunn Decl.; Neglio Decl.).  Additionally, the evidence indicates that L.A.
Tire Tech had access to ARI during the time the majority of the services at
issue were allegedly performed and invoiced (i.e., prior to August 2021).  (Neglio Decl., Ex.2).   
 
Further, sufficient prima facie evidence has been
submitted to establish that L.A. Tire reviewed, or had the opportunity to
review, the terms of the agreement before agreeing to its terms.  (Foster Decl. ¶¶7-11, Ex.1-3).  In ruling on SiteOne’s demurrer to the
original cross-complaint, the Court already determined that the indemnity
provision does not require L.A. Tire Tech to indemnify SiteOne for SiteOne’s
failure to pay for services rendered and properly invoiced by L.A. Tire Tech.  (See 1/2/24 Minute Order).  However, SiteOne is not precluded from
seeking recovery for L.A. Tire Tech’s breaches of the agreement and indemnity
for such breaches as the indemnity provision is not limited to third-party
claims.  (See Dunn Decl. ¶¶2-5;
FAXC, Ex.A Section 10); See Wilshire-Doheny Associates, Ltd. (2000)
83 CA4th 1380, 1396; Dream Theater, Inc. (2004) 124 CA4th 547, 556; Zalkind
(2011) 194 CA4th 1010, 1022, 1026-1027; Hot Rods, LLC (2015) 242 CA4th
1166, 1181-1182.  As such, the agreement
is not procedurally or substantively unconscionable.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied.
