And here is a summary in English text of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that a voluntary dismissal of an action by a plaintiff deprives the court of both subject matter and personal jurisdiction in that case. The Judge has further noted that subsequent orders entered after the dismissal are void and have no effect. The Judge has also highlighted the importance of the concepts of justiciability, standing, and ripeness in determining the court's jurisdiction and the validity of subsequent proceedings. Specifically, the Judge has stated that a party lacks standing if it does not have an actual and substantial interest in the outcome, and that a controversy becomes ripe once it reaches, but has not passed, the point that the facts have sufficiently congealed to permit an intelligent and useful decision to be made. Finally, the Judge has noted that, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivisions (b) and (c), plaintiffs have the right to voluntarily dismiss an entire action or causes of action within a pleading before the commencement of trial, and that such a request is usually effective upon filing, with no further action by the clerk or the court required.
