And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to consolidate two cases, Amer v. Hogan (23SMCV05635) and Portillo v. Hogan (24SMCV02384), which both stem from the same automobile collision on June 8, 2022. The cases were related on May 31, 2024, and the Defendant, Kyle Hogan, has moved to consolidate the cases for trial only. Since there are no procedural hurdles to consolidation and the cases involve common questions of law and fact, the Court has granted the motion. The consolidated case will be designated as Amer v. Hogan, and all proceedings and hearing dates in Portillo v. Hogan will be vacated.
