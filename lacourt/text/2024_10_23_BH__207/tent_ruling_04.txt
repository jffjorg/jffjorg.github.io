BACKGROUND
 
This case stems from a dispute over the remodel of Plaintiff and
Cross-Defendant Glenn Vallecillos, M.D., Inc.’s (“Plaintiff”) surgical
center.  
 
Plaintiff filed the original complaint on August 10, 2022, against
Defendants Michael Keyes dba Global Ocean and Land Construction (“Keyes”) and
Hudson Insurance Company (“Hudson”), alleging twelve causes of action for (1)
breach of written contract; (2) unjust enrichment; (3) intentional
misrepresentation; (4) negligent misrepresentation; (5) unfair business
practices; (6) negligence; (7) declaratory relief; (8) disgorgement of money
paid to unlicensed contractor; (9) recovery on contractors bond; (10)
conversion; and (11) violation of Penal Code section 496.
 
On October 25, 2022, Defendant Hudson filed a cross-complaint for
declaratory relief.  
 
On March 12, 2024, Keyes filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff
Glenn Vallecillos, M.D., Inc. and Glenn Vallecillos, M.D., an individual (together,
“Vallecillos”) alleging ten causes of action for (1) fraudulent inducement; (2)
negligent misrepresentation; (3) breach of oral contract; (4) conversion; (5)
intentional infliction of emotional distress; (6) reasonable value; (7) agreed
price; (8) book account; (9) declaratory relief; and (10) unfair business
practices.  
 
Hudson now moves for an order to deposit the full penalty of Bond
30032721 in the sum of $7,500 with the Court, to be discharged from all
liability as a mere stakeholder, and for $2,500 in attorneys’ fees.  Hudson’s motion is unopposed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
            As a threshold matter, Hudson has
not filed a proof of service demonstrating service of notice of motion and
supporting papers on any of the parties to the action at least 16 court days
prior to the hearing.  (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 1005.)  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
The Court denies Hudson’s motion without prejudice as procedurally
defective.  
 
Hudson shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the notice
with a proof of service forthwith.
