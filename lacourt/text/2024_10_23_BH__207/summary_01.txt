And here is the summary in English:

This is a tentative ruling issued by Judge Michael E. Whitaker in a complex case involving United Clinical Research, Inc., Matrix Clinical Research, Inc., Stan Gersovich, Peyman Banooni, and Fred Shaham. The case involves multiple court actions and arbitration proceedings, with disputes over the validity of the arbitration proceedings and alleged wrongful actions by the defendants.

The arbitrator awarded $2.6 million against the Individual Defendants, but the defendants moved to stay the arbitration proceedings and seek sanctions. The court found that the defendants lack standing to bring these motions, and that the issues of whether to stay the arbitration proceedings are moot.

The court also denied the defendants' motion to strike the entries of dismissal in the 9105 action, and denied United Clinical Research's motion for discovery related sanctions and to compel the deposition of Michael Landver.

The court ordered that the parties provide notice of its rulings and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
