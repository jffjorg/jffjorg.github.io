 Case Number:  23SMCV05635    Hearing Date:   October 23, 2024    Dept:  207 TENTATIVE  RULING       DEPARTMENT   207     HEARING DATE   October    23, 2024     CASE NUMBERS   23SMCV05635 & 24SMCV02384     MOTION   Consolidate     MOVING PARTY   Defendant    Kyle Hogan     OPPOSING PARTY   (none)      MOTION   On December 1, 2023, Plaintiff Daved Amer (“Plaintiff”) filed suit  against Defendant Dennis Kyle Hogan (“Defendant”) alleging a single cause of  action for negligence (Motor Vehicle) stemming from an automobile collision  that occurred on June 8, 2022.  This suit  is designated as 23SMCV05635.     On May 20, 2024, Plaintiffs Ofelia Portillo, Cesar Delgado, and  Allison Delgado against Defendant Kyle Hogan (“Defendant”) alleging a single  cause of action for negligence (Motor Vehicle) stemming from the same automobile  collision that occurred on June 8, 2022.   This suit is designated as 24SMCV02384.     On May 31, 2024, the Court related 23SMCV05635  and 24SMCV02384; both actions are assigned to Department 207.     Defendant now moves to consolidate the actions for trial only.  Defendant’s motion is unopposed.   ANALYSIS   Procedural Requirements               Per The Superior Court of Los  Angeles County, Local Rules, rule 3.3(g):   “Cases may not be consolidated unless they are in the same  department.  A motion to consolidate two  or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in  different departments, have been related into a single department, or if the  cases were already assigned to that department.”  (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule  3.3(g)(1).)  Once the Court relates the  cases, the Court may consolidate the actions and order a joint trial on matters  that “involve[e] a common question of law or fact.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).)               Both cases were related on May 31,  2024, and are currently pending before the same department.  Therefore,  there are no procedural hurdles to consolidation.               Substantive  Requirements   Code of Civil Procedure  section 1048, subdivision (a) provides:   When actions involving a  common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a  joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it  may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning  proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.                          Both  cases involve the same three-way vehicle collision and the same causes of  action alleged against the same Defendant.   Thus, there will inevitably be common questions of law and fact.  Accordingly, the Court finds that consolidation  is warranted.   CONCLUSION AND ORDER   Therefore, the Court grants Defendant’s unopposed motion to consolidate  Portillo v. Hogan (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2024 No. 24SMCV02384) with Amer  v. Hogan (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2023 No. 23SMCV05635).   The Court further orders that the cases are consolidated for trial  only and Amer v. Hogan (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2023 No.  23SMCV05635) is designated as the lead case per California Rules of Court, rule  3.350(b).  The Court further orders that  all proceedings and hearing dates in Portillo v. Hogan (Super. Ct. L.A.  County, 2024 No. 24SMCV02384) are vacated.               Defendant shall provide notice of  the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service of such.        DATED:  October 23, 2024                                                   ___________________________                                                                                           Michael  E.
