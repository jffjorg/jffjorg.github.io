And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Hudson Insurance Company's motion to deposit the full penalty of the bond ($7,500) and be discharged as a stakeholder, as well as its request for $2,500 in attorneys' fees. The motion was procedurally defective because Hudson failed to file a proof of service demonstrating service of notice of motion and supporting papers on any of the parties to the action at least 16 court days prior to the hearing. The judge has ordered Hudson to provide notice of the ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
