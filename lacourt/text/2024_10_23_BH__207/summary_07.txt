The Judge has granted the County of Los Angeles' motion to file a complaint-in-intervention in the personal injury action of its employee, Darryl Hunter. The County seeks to recover workers compensation benefits it has paid to Hunter as a result of a vehicle collision involving Hunter and the defendants. The Judge finds that the County has provided a legal and factual basis to support its request to intervene and that no party has opposed the request. The County is granted leave to file its complaint-in-intervention and is required to serve notice of the order and file proof of service forthwith.
