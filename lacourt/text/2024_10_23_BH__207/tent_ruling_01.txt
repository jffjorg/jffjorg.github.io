  Case Number:  21STCV39105    Hearing Date:   October 23, 2024    Dept:  207 TENTATIVE RULING       DEPARTMENT   207     HEARING DATE   October 23, 2024     CASE NUMBER   21STCV39105 (c/w 21STCV43580)     MOTION   (1)      OSC re: Injunction (2)      Strike Dismissal (3)      Terminating, Issue, and Monetary Sanctions     MOVING PARTY   (1)      Plaintiff United Clinical Research, Inc.; Defendant    Stan Gersovich; and Defendant Matrix Clinical Research, Inc.; Joinder by    Defendants Peyman Banooni and Fred Shaham (2)      Defendants Matrix Clinical Research, Inc. and Stan    Gersovich (3)      Plaintiff United Clinical Research, Inc.     OPPOSING PARTY   Plaintiff Michael Landver        BACKGROUND               The  Arbitration               In  or around June 15, 2020, Plaintiff Michael Landver (“Plaintiff” or “Landver”)  demanded arbitration on his own behalf and derivatively on behalf of nominal  defendant, United Clinical Research, Inc. (“United”) against Defendants Peyman  Banooni (“Banooni”); Stan Gersovich (“Gersovich”); Fred Shaham (“Shaham”)  (Banooni, Gersovich, and Shaham shall collectively be referred to as the  “Individual Defendants”); and Matrix Clinical Research, Inc. (“Matrix”) (Individual  Defendants and Matrix shall collectively be referred to as “Defendants”). (Ex.  1 to Behjatnia Decl.; Baranov Decl. ¶ 3.)      Landver alleges he and the Individual Defendants previously formed  United, a company that conducts clinical trials for drug development, in which Landver  claims a 25% ownership interest. Landver alleges the Individual Defendants  later stopped working with Landver and secretly formed their own company, Matrix,  to conduct such clinical trials. In so doing, Landver alleges the Individual  Defendants violated their fiduciary duties to Landver and misappropriated  United’s business, employees, revenue, contracts, and trade secrets which they  used to start Matrix so they would no longer have to share profits with Landver.   The arbitration was demanded pursuant to the United Shareholder  Agreement, entered into among Landver and the Individual Defendants.  (Ex. 1 to Behjatnia Decl. at Ex. A.)   Matrix was subsequently dismissed from the arbitration proceedings on  the grounds that it was not a party to the United Shareholder Agreement.  (Behjatnia Decl. ¶ 4; Baranov Decl. ¶ 9.)   On July 6, 2020, the Individual Defendants filed counterclaims against  Landver and California Clinical Research (“CCR”) alleging breach of contract;  breach of fiduciary duty and misappropriation of trade secrets, which Landver  answered on July 20, 2020.  (Baranov  Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.)     On or about August 16, 2021, the arbitrator dismissed the Individual  Defendants’ counterclaims against CCR for lack of jurisdiction and granted  issue sanctions against the Individual Defendants for their refusal to  participate in discovery.  (Baranov Decl.  at ¶¶ 8-9; see also July 13, 2022 Baranov Decl. ¶ 14 and Exs. E-G attached thereto.)     According to the July 13, 2022 Baranov declaration filed in opposition  to the Order to Show Cause why this case should not be stayed (“July 13, 2022  Baranov Decl.”), the arbitrator subsequently vacated all hearing dates and  cut-offs in the arbitration and stayed the arbitration proceedings pending the  resolution of this action.  (July 13,  2022 Baranov Decl. ¶ 16.)   Based on documents Landver received in discovery in this action from  Matrix’s accountant, David Gadoshian, CPA, Landver submitted a prove-up packet  in the arbitration proceeding, with notice to the Individual Defendants, and on  August 4, 2024, the arbitrator issued a ruling in Landver’s favor, awarding a  sum of $2.6M against the Individual Defendants. (Baranov Decl. ¶¶ 21-22 and Ex.  D.)   21SMCV01358 Action   On August 11, 2021, United, Banooni, Gersovich, and Shaham filed a  complaint in case number 21SMCV01358 against Landver and Thomas P. Hanrahan, an  arbitrator for the American Arbitration Association, seeking a declaration that  the arbitration proceedings were invalid because the terms of the arbitration  provision had not been complied with and injunctive relief enjoining the  arbitration proceedings.  That case was  voluntarily dismissed in its entirety without prejudice on March 13, 2023.[1]   21STC39105 Action   On October 22, 2021, Landver filed a complaint in his individual  capacity and derivatively on behalf of United against Matrix and the Individual  Defendants in case number 21STCV39105 (“9105 action”).  The parties, allegations, and causes of  action in the 9105 action are substantially similar to those filed in the  arbitration proceedings.   On August 6, 2024, Landver requested voluntary dismissal of the  Individual Defendants without prejudice, which the Court granted on August 7,  2024.  On August 7, 2024, Landver  requested voluntary dismissal without prejudice of Matrix, which the Court  granted on August 8, 2024.   21STCV43580 Action   On November 29, 2011, United, Banooni, Gersovich, and Shaham filed a  complaint against Landver and CCR in case number 21STCV43580 (“3580 action”)  alleging various causes of action for allegedly sabotaging United.  The parties and causes of action are  substantially similar to the counterclaims filed in the arbitration proceedings.   On March 21, 2022, Landver moved to compel arbitration in the 3580  action, which the Court granted on June 24, 2022.    In August 2022, Banooni, Shaham, and Gersovich voluntarily dismissed  their ninth, tenth, and eleventh causes of action, respectively, which were  their only causes of action, leaving only United as the plaintiff in the 3580  action.   On September 28, 2022, Landver filed a notice of withdrawal of motion  to compel arbitration and request to lift the stay.  The Court granted the request and lifted the  stay on October 4, 2022.   Subsequently, the Court consolidated for all purposes the 9105 and  3580 actions on October 11, 2023, designating the 9105 action as the lead case.  (See October 11, 2023 Minute Order.)     MOTIONS   As outlined above, the  procedural history of the various actions in this case is convoluted.  Distilled down, Landver initiated arbitration  proceedings against the Individual Defendants and Matrix.  Defendants stalled discovery in those  proceedings and Landver ultimately obtained issue sanctions against them.  Matrix, however, was ultimately dismissed  from the arbitration proceedings, on the grounds that Matrix was not a party to  the United Shareholder Agreement, in which the agreement to arbitrate was  based.  Thus, Landver initiated the 9105  action against Matrix, but also named the Individual Defendants in these  proceedings.  The arbitrator apparently  stayed arbitration proceedings, pending the resolution of the 9105 action.   Apparently unhappy with the  issue sanctions in the arbitration, Defendants filed their own action (1358  action) challenging the arbitration proceedings, but ultimately voluntarily  dismissed that case.     The parties litigated the 9105  action for three years until Landver obtained third party discovery from  Matrix’s accountant, which Landver used to assemble a prove-up packet in the  arbitration proceedings.  The arbitrator  issued an award of $2.6 million against the Individual Defendants on August 4,  2024.  Landver then dismissed all named  defendants from the 9105  action without  prejudice.   In response, Nominal  Defendant United and Defendants Gersovich and Matrix move for an order to show  cause why arbitration case no. 01-20-0005-5958 should not be stayed.  Defendants Banooni and Shaham have filed a  joinder in the Order to Show Cause Why A Preliminary Injunction Should Not  Issue regarding the Arbitration Proceedings (“OSC”).                 Defendants Gersovich and Matrix also  move for an order striking the entries of dismissal without prejudice against  them and for an order entering dismissal as to all defendants with prejudice.               United further moves to compel  Landver’s deposition and for terminating, issue, and monetary sanctions against  Landver for his failure to appear for deposition.   Landver opposes the OSC and the two motions, and the moving parties  reply.   DISCUSSION   As a threshold matter, because  the Individual Defendants dismissed their claims in the 3580 action and Landver  dismissed the Individual Defendants and Matrix in the 9105 action, Defendants  lack standing to bring the instant motions.[2]  Defendants have not provided any authority that grants them standing to move to  strike, to stay arbitration proceedings, or to move for sanctions after all  their claims and the claims against them have all been voluntarily dismissed.[3]     To the extent the motion to  compel Landver’s deposition and for discovery related sanctions is styled as  being brought by United in its capacity as the remaining plaintiff in the 3580  action, the Court finds that the deposition was noticed by Matrix and Gersovich.  (See Baranov Decl. ¶ 3 and Ex. A.)  Because the deposition was not noticed by or  on behalf of United, United lacks standing to compel compliance with the deposition  notice and to seek discovery related sanctions against Landver.     Further, because all causes of  action involving the Defendants have been dismissed and because the arbitrator  has already awarded Landver $2.6 million against the Individual Defendants, the  issues of whether to stay the arbitration proceedings is moot.     CONCLUSION AND ORDER   For the reasons stated above because the moving parties lack standing  or their claims for relief are moot, the Court    ·        discharges the Order to Show Cause Why A Preliminary  Injunction Should Not Issue regarding the Arbitration Proceedings, and vacates  the Temporary Restraining Order issued on August 26, 2024;       ·        denies Plaintiff United Clinical Research’s  motion for discovery related sanctions and to compel the deposition of Plaintiff  Landver; and   ·        denies Defendants Matrix, Banooni, Gershovich  and Shaham’s motion to strike the entries of dismissal in the 9105 action.     Plaintiff Landver shall provide notice of the Court’s rulings and file  the notice with a proof of service forthwith.      DATED:  October 23, 2024                                                   ___________________________                                                                                           Michael  E.
