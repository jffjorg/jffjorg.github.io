And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is ruling on a motion filed by Counsel, Haig B. Kazandjian, to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Juan Farrow. Counsel is seeking to be relieved due to a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship and a breakdown in communications. The motion is unopposed. However, the judge finds that the motion is procedurally defective because Counsel failed to comply with the requirements for serving the motion on the client. Specifically, Counsel failed to provide proof of service to the client, and the address provided was not confirmed within the past 30 days. Therefore, the judge denies Counsel's motion without prejudice and orders Counsel to provide notice of the court's ruling and file the notice with proof of service forthwith.
