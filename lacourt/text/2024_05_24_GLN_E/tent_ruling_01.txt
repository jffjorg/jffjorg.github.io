Case Name: GARY LEFKOWITZ v. KHALED A. TAWNSEY, et al.
 
[TENTATIVE RULING
DEMURRER]
RELIEF REQUESTED
The second page of Cross-Defendant’s demurrer states, “Please take notice that Lefkowitz
is filing a Demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint filed by Tawansy.” (Dem.
p. 2.)
[The
Court notes that this is Lefkowitz’s demurrer to the Second Amended
Cross-Complaint (SACC) filed by Tawansy, not the Second Amended
Complaint.]
[The
Court notes that Cross-Defendant’s, Lefkowitz, caption indicated that this is a
demurrer and a motion to strike, but no motion to strike was ever filed.]
BACKGROUND
Cross-Complainant,
Khaled A. Tawansy, filed the SACC on 11/09/2021. On 12/22/2023, this Court granted
Lefkowitz’s motion to set aside the default entered on 5/6/2022 as to Tawansy’s
SACC.
Further,
this Court notes how on 6/1/2023, the Court noted how “Lefkowitz's 3rd amended
complaint was dismissed on 4/22/2022. The appeal was dismissed and the remittitur
was issued. Lefkowitz's cross-complaint was dismissed on 8/10/2020 and his
default was taken on 5/6/2022 in the cross-complaint filed by Tawnsey.”
(6/1/2023 Min. Order, p. 1.)
Cross-Complainant,
Khaled A. Tawansy, filed his SACC on 11/9/2021 against Cross-Defendants Gary
Lefkowitz, Franciska K. Von Andrassy, Swiss Corrective Skin Care, LLC. The SACC
alleges six causes of action for: (1) Breach of Oral Contract, (2) Breach of
Contract Implied in Fact, (3) Breach of Implied-In-Law Contract, (4) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty, (5) Conversion, and (6) Accounting.

Meet and Confer
A party filing a
demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)  “The
parties shall meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive
pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least five
days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party
shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a
responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a
demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a
good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why
the parties could not meet and confer.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).) 
Failure
to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(4).)
Here,
Lefkowitz did not attach a declaration stating that he met and conferred. He
stated he met and conferred on February 24, 2024 in the demurrer itself.
LEGAL STANDARDS FOR DEMURRERS
Demurrer
– Sufficiency
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)  When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of
Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  The court “treat[s]
the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and
not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at
747.)  
The
general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not
evidentiary facts.  (Doe v. City of
Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) 
“All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter of pleading … is that
his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable
precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the
nature, source and extent of his cause of action.”  (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp.
(1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)  
On
demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not
the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any
legal theory.”  (Das v. Bank of
America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.)  Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” 
(Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,
119.)  “Generally
it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.”  (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)
Demurrer – Uncertainty
A special demurrer for
uncertainty, CCP section 430.10(f), is disfavored and will only be sustained
where the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e.,
cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or
claims are directed against him/her.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)
ANALYSIS
Preliminary
Matters
Cross-Defendant’s
demurrer is not a model of clarity and several of his arguments are not supported
with any legal authority. 
Further,
Cross-Defendant uploads documents that appear to have been scanned with dark
spots and several portions of the demurrer are completely unable to be read. 
Cross-Defendant
regularly discusses and argues issues that are outside the scope of a demurrer
at the pleading stage.
Additionally,
“A notice of motion must state in the opening paragraph the nature of the order
being sought and the grounds for issuance of the order.” (Cal Rules of Court, rule
3.1110(a).) First, there isn’t really a notice of motion here. Two, to the
extent the second page is considered the notice page, the opening paragraph
simply states, “Please take notice that Lefkowitz is filing a Demurrer to the
Second Amended Complaint filed by Tawansy. It will be heard on May 24, 2024.
Pursuant to the Minute Order of this Court on April 19, 2024, the matter will
be heard on May 24, 2024, at 2:00 p-m. The address of the Courthouse is 600 E.
Broadway, Glendale CA 91206.” (Dem. p. 2.)
The
Court notes it is not entirely clear the ground, or grounds, on which Cross-Defendant
is demurring to the SACC.
First Cause of Action – Breach of Oral Contract
Starting on page 3 of
the demurrer, Lefkowitz has an argument titled “Breach of Oral Contract.”
Lefkowitz
argues that the SACC does not state the terms of the agreement. Lefkowitz also
argues that the key issue here is that there was no contract between Tawansy
and Lefkowitz, Von Andrassy, or Swiss Corrective.
The
Court notes that Lefkowitz provides no legal authority for his argument that
the terms of the agreement must be alleged at the pleading stage.
The
elements of a breach of oral contract cause are: (1) existence of the contract;
(2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance; (3) defendant’s
breach; and (4) damages to plaintiff as a result of the breach. (Aton
Center, Inc. v. United Healthcare Ins. Co. (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 1214, 1230
citing CDF Firefighters v. Maldonado (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1226, 1239
and Stockton Mortgage, Inc. v. Tope (2014) 233 Cal.App.4th 437, 453.)
Lefkowitz
appears to be attacking the first element of “existence of the contract” by
arguing that the SACC does not state the terms of the agreement. 
The
Court finds Lefkowitz’s argument unavailing.
A
cause of action for breach of contract is subject to demurrer if “it cannot be
ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is
implied by conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§430.10(g).) An allegation of an oral agreement must “set[] forth the substance
of its relative terms.”  (Gautier v.
General Tel. Co. (1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 302, 305.) “An oral contract may be
pleaded generally as to its effect, because it is rarely possible to allege the
exact words.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616 citing 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Pleading, §
471, p. 509.)
Here,
Cross-Complainant appears to have alleged the existence of an oral contract and
set forth the substance of its relative terms in ¶ 24 of the SACC by alleging,
“On or about December 18, 2015, Cross-Defendants entered into an oral contract
with :he Cross-Complainant to hold Cross-Complainant's funds for his use and
benefit, to expend those funds only as authorized by him and for his benefit,
and to account for the funds held by them.” (Ibid.)
Therefore,
Lefkowitz’s argument that Cross-Complainant did not state the terms of the
agreement is unavailing. 
Lefkowitz
also argues that there is no discussion as to the consideration to be paid or
the “habilities” of each party.
The
Court does not find this argument on consideration availing. 
Lefkowitz
cites no authority that consideration must be alleged. 
The
Court refers Lefkowitz to several cases.
“Where
the existence of a contract is at issue and the evidence is conflicting or
admits of more than one inference, it is for the trier of fact to determine
whether the contract actually existed. But if the material facts are certain or
undisputed, the existence of a contract is a question for the court to decide.”
(HM DG, Inc. v. Amini (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1100, 1109.)
Further,
“…[T]he question of adequacy of consideration is generally considered as a
question of fact…” (Henderson v. Fisher (1965) 236 Cal.App.2d 468, 475.)
The
court “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,
but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)
Lefkowitz
argues several times that the key issue here is that there was no contract
between Tawansy and Lefkowitz, Von Andrassay, or Swiss Corrective. However,
those arguments are outside the scope of demurrer. 
Lefkowitz
also has arguments on the breach-of-oral-contract cause of action on page 5 of
the demurrer. 
Several
of these arguments cannot be deciphered because they cannot be read by the
Court because of dark spots from scanning. 
Further,
to the extent that some of these arguments can be read, it is unclear how
several of these arguments have anything to do with pleading breach of oral
contract. 
For
example, Lefkowitz argues that Tawansy was not in privity of contract with
Lefkowitz, Von Andrassy, or Swiss Corrective, but those arguments are outside
the scope of this demurrer. 
TENTATIVE RULING -First Cause of Action – Breach of Oral Contract
The elements of a breach
of oral contract cause are: (1) existence of the contract; (2) plaintiff’s
performance or excuse for nonperformance; (3) defendant’s breach; and (4)
damages to plaintiff as a result of the breach. (Aton Center, Inc. v. United
Healthcare Ins. Co. (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 1214, 1230 citing CDF
Firefighters v. Maldonado (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1226, 1239 and Stockton
Mortgage, Inc. v. Tope (2014) 233 Cal.App.4th 437, 453.)
Here,
Cross-Complainant did not allege the second element of a breach of oral
contract claim because Cross-Complainant did not allege his performance or
excuse for nonperformance. Cross-Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave
to amend granted as to the first cause of action.
Unjust Enrichment and Quantum Meruit
Lefkowitz has a section
in his demurrer on pages 4-5 on unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. It is
unclear why this section is in the demurrer because the SACC does not allege
causes of action for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. Further, the
Opposition indicates that there are no causes of action for unjust enrichment
and quantum meruit. Therefore, whatever Lefkowitz’s argument is here, it is
unavailing. 
Third Cause of Action – Breach of Implied-in-Law Contract
As a preliminary matter,
it does not appear that Lefkowitz is demurring to the second cause of action
for breach of implied-in-fact contract because Lefkowitz does not assert any
arguments as to the second cause of action.
On
page 5 of Lefkowitz’s demurrer, Lefkowitz has a section devoted to the third
cause of action for breach of implied-in-law contract. 
Lefkowitz
simply argues, “There is no allegation that Renaissance or 95 Arroyo assigned
the rights they held to Tawansy. Tawansy lacks Privity of Contract.” (Dem. p.
5.)
The
Court finds this argument unavailing. It is unclear what Lefkowitz is trying to
argue. Further, Lefkowitz provides no legal authority that whatever his
argument is, it is grounds for sustaining a demurrer. 
TENTATIVE RULING – Third Cause of Action – Breach of
Implied-in-Law Contract
Lefkowitz’s demurrer to
the third cause of action for breach of implied-in-law contract is OVERRULED.
Lefkowitz’s argument is incomprehensible and no legal authority is cited for
whatever Lefkowitz’s argument is.
Fourth Cause of Action – Breach of Fiduciary Duty
Lefkowitz argues, “The
claim is made that in October 2018 a demand was made by Tawansy, not by
Renaissance or by 95 N. Arroyo. There is a claim that Lefkowitz worked for
Tawansy. There is no claim of any breach of fiduciary duty as to Von Andrassy.
There is no claim that Lefkowitz actually worked for Tawansy. No claim that
Tawansy ever paid Gary Lefkowitz.” (Dem. p. 6.)
TENTATIVE RULING – Fourth Cause of Action – Breach of Fiduciary
Duty
Lefkowitz’s demurrer to
the fourth cause of action is OVERRULED. Lefkowitz’s arguments are largely
incomprehensible. Lefkowitz provides no legal authority for any of his
arguments as to what must be alleged. To the extent that Lefkowitz argues that
there is no claim of any breach of fiduciary duty as to Von Andrassy, the SACC
alleges that “Cross-Defendants have breached their fiduciary duty to the
Cross-Complainant by not returning the money they hold for Cross-Complainant though
demand was made on or about October 2018.” (SACC ¶ 40.) 
Fifth Cause of Action – Conversion
Lefkowitz argues:
The claims is that the funds belonged to Tawansy. There is no
claim that the funds belonged to Tawansy. The funds came from Renaissance
Surgical and from 95 N. Arroyo. The checks in support of this 2d Amended
Complaint show the funds came from Renaissance and 95 N. Arroyo. Without
assignment from Renaissance or 95 N. Arroyo, Tawansy cannot bring this action
as there is no privity of Contract.
(Dem.
p. 6.)
“Conversion is generally described as the
wrongful exercise of dominion over the personal property of another.
[Citation.] The basic elements of the tort are (1) the plaintiff’s ownership or
right to possession of personal property; (2) the defendant’s disposition of
the property in a manner that is inconsistent with the plaintiff’s property
rights; and (3) resulting damages. [Citation.]” (Regent Alliance Ltd. v.
Rabizadeh (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1177, 1181 citing Fremont Indemnity Co.
v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)
 
Here, it is unclear what element of the cause of
action of conversion that Lefkowitz is attacking. It appears as if Lefkowitz
may be arguing that the first element is not alleged because he argues that
there is no claim that the funds belonged to Tawansy. The Court finds this
argument unavailing because Cross-Complainant alleged, “Cross-Defendants have
through intentional conduct taken the funds of the Cross-Complainant for their
own use and benefit and refuse to return those funds though demand was made on
or about October 2018.” (SACC ¶ 45.) By Cross-Complainant alleging “taken the
funds of Cross-Complainant,” it appears that Cross-Complainant alleged the
first element of the plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of personal
property. It is unclear what other arguments Lefkowitz is trying to make with
respect to conversion.
 
TENTATIVE RULING – FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION –
CONVERSION
Lefkowitz’s demurrer to
the fifth cause of action for conversion is OVERRULED.
 
Sixth Cause of Action – Accounting
As to the sixth cause of
action for accounting, Lefkowitz argues, “There is no claim that Renaissance
Surgical or 95 N. Arroyo assigned the claims to Tawansy. There is no privity of
Contract between Tawansy and the Lefkowitz, von Andrassy or Swiss. Renaissance
or 95 N. Arroyo can bring suit. However, all of the Statutes of Limitation are
expired.” (Dem. p. 6.)
 
TENTATIVE RULING – SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION –
ACCOUNTING
Lefkowitz’s demurrer to
the sixth cause of action for accounting is OVERRULED. It is entirely unclear
what Lefkowitz is arguing. Lefkowitz cites no legal authority as to what must
be alleged for an accounting cause of action and makes no argument as to how
Cross-Complainant did not allege those elements. Lefkowitz’s argument is
borderline incomprehensible.
 
Further, Lefkowitz agues that all of the
Statutes of Limitation are expired but cites no legal authority as to what the
statutes of limitations are for any of the causes of action in the SACC nor
does he make any argument as to how they have expired for any of the causes of
action.
 
The Court will not make Lefkowitz’s arguments
for him, nor will it do his research for him to draft his arguments.
 
MISCELLANEOUS ARGUMENTS
Lefkowitz also has a
section titled “Lies to This Court By Mr. Clark and By Tawansy And Earlier By
My. Frieden” in the demurrer on pages 7 – 8.
 
The Court is not entirely clear what Lefkowitz
is arguing in this section, and Lefkowitz cites no legal authority for whatever
argument he is, or isn’t, trying to make.
 
Lefkowitz also has a section titled “Meet and
Confer-February 24, 2024” on pages 8 – 10 of the demurrer. The Court is also
not clear what Lefkowitz is arguing here.
