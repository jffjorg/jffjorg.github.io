And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on information presented before the hearing. The defendant, 1001 Las Lomas, LLC, seeks to compel responses to discovery requests from plaintiffs Jose Blanco and Jacinta Blanco. The defendant argues that the plaintiffs have failed to respond to discovery requests and seeks sanctions for their failure. The court notes that the defendant's motion appears to be filed by one defendant, not multiple defendants. The court will presume that there is one moving defendant and will require clarification on this issue at the hearing. The court is open to discussing continuing the hearing to a date that the additional motion is scheduled on. The defendant should be prepared to address issues of proper service and notice. The court will also require the defendant to clarify which plaintiff the instant motion would apply to on the potential future hearing date.
