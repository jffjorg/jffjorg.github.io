Meet and Confer
A party filing a demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §430.41, subd. (a).) 
“The parties shall meet and confer at least five days before the date
the responsive pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer
at least five days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the
demurring party shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within
which to file a responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the
date on which a demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of
perjury that a good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining
the reasons why the parties could not meet and confer.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §430.41, subd. (a)(2).)
Failure to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer. (Id., §430.41(a)(4).)
Defendant’s
counsel met and conferred. (See Thompson Decl. ¶¶ 2-4.)
LEGAL STANDARDS FOR DEMURRERS
Demurrer
– Sufficiency
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)  When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of
Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  The court “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley
v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) 
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of
the pleading or via proper judicial notice. 
(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.)  A demurrer tests the pleadings
alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it lies only
where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially
noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30,
430.70.)  The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147
Cal.App.4th at 747.)  
The
general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not
evidentiary facts.  (Doe v. City of
Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) 
“All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter of pleading … is that
his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable
precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the
nature, source and extent of his cause of action.”  (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp.
(1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)  
On
demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not
the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any
legal theory.” (Das v. Bank of America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727,
734.)  Demurrers do not lie as to only
parts of causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose
of an entire cause of action to be sustained.” 
(Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,
119.)  “Generally
it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.”  (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)

Demurrer – Uncertainty
A special demurrer for uncertainty, CCP section 430.10(f), is disfavored
and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot
reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what issues must be
admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against
him/her.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat vague,
“ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)
ANALYSIS
The
elements of a cause of action for premises liability are the same as those for
negligence. (Jones v. Awad (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 1200, 1207 citing Castellon
v. U.S. Bancorp (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998) 
The
plaintiff must prove a legal duty to use due care, a breach of such legal duty,
and the breach as the proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury. (Jones
v. Awad, supra, 39 Cal.App.5th at 1207 citing Beacon Residential
Community Assn. v. Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP (2014) 59 Cal.4th
568, 573.) 
The
negligent causing of emotional distress is not an independent tort but the tort
of negligence. (Eriksson v. Nunnink (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 708, 729.)
The traditional elements of duty, breach of duty, causation, and damages apply.
(Id. citing Marlene F. v. Affiliated Psychiatric Medical Clinic, Inc.
(1989 48 Cal..3d 583, 588.)
When
reading the FAC as a whole, Plaintiff stated sufficient facts to allege all
three causes of action for (1) premises liability, (2) general negligence, and
(3) negligent infliction of emotional distress.
Defendant
points to the allegation in the first cause of action regarding Civil Code § 846
and argues that it doesn’t apply to the first cause of action for premises
liability. The Opposition does not make an understandable argument as to how § 846
applies. However, whether or not § 846 applies to the first cause of action
does not appear to be grounds for sustaining the demurrer, because, at the very
least, Plaintiff alleged the elements of premises liability.
On
demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not
the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any
legal theory.” (Das v. Bank of America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727,
734.)
A
special demurrer for uncertainty, CCP § 430.10(f), is disfavored and will only
be sustained where the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably
respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or
denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him/her. 
(Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612,
616.)  Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat vague, “ambiguities can
be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)
Defendant’s
arguments on there being no allegations of “willful failure to warn,” are also unavailing.

Duplicative
Defendant argues that
the premises liability cause of action is duplicative of the general negligence
cause of action. Defendant also argues that the claim for negligent infliction
of emotional distress is duplicative of the first two causes of action for
premises liability and general negligence.
While
Defendant correctly cites Palm Springs Villas II Homeowners Association,
Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 268, 290 for the proposition that a
demurrer was properly sustained without leave to amend as to the cause of
action that contained allegations of other causes and thus added nothing to the
complaint by way of fact or theory of recovery, the Court does not find this
argument availing at the pleading stage.
A
plaintiff may plead alternative theories in varied and inconsistent counts.
(See Klein v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1388; Mendoza
v. Continental Sales Co. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1395, 1402.)
Moreover,
the duplicative standard referenced to by Defendant is not currently listed as
a ground to sustain a demurrer under CCP § 430.10.
CCP
§ 430.10 states in pertinent part:
The party against whom a complaint ... has been filed may object,
by demurrer...to the pleading on any one or more of the following grounds:
(a) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of
action alleged in the pleading.
(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have the legal
capacity to sue.
(c) There is another action pending between the same parties on
the same cause of action.
(d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties.
(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.
(f) The pleading is uncertain. As used in this subdivision,
“uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible.
(g) In an action founded upon a contract, it cannot be
ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is
implied by conduct.
(h) No certificate was filed as required by Section 411.35.
 
(CCP § 430.10(a)-(h).)
 
There is no provision for the case where a complaint includes
duplicative causes of action or splits a primary right.
 
In
Blickman Turkus, LP v. MF Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th
858, 890, the Sixth District Court of Appeal observed that the duplicative
standard referred to by defendant is not ground on which a demurrer may be
sustained. The court of appeal in Blickman noted that the motion to
strike statute that previously authorized a court to strike “irrelevant and redundant”
matter from a pleading, the statute now only empowers to the court to “[s]trike
out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.” (Blickman
at 890.) “The elimination of the reference to redundancy may have rested on
the irreproachable rationale that it is a waste of time and judicial resources
to entertain a motion challenging part of a pleading on the sole ground of repetitiveness.
[Citation.]” (Id.) “This is the sort of defect that, if it justifies any
judicial intervention at all, is ordinarily dealt with most economically at
trial, or on a dispositive motion such as summary judgment.” (Id.)
Additionally,
Opposition argues that the negligence and premises liability actions are not
identical because negligence would cover theories of liability against tortfeasors,
such as outside contractors, vendors, employees, or visitors that negligently
caused harm but did not own or control the Defendant’s store. Opposition argues
that premises liability is grounded in possession of the premises.
At
the pleading stage, the Court does not find Defendant’s arguments on
duplicative causes of action to be persuasive.
TENTATIVE RULING
Defendant’s demurrer to
all three causes of action in the FAC is OVERRULED. Plaintiff stated facts
sufficient to constitute all three causes of action.
The
Court notes that Defendant also filed a motion to strike the second and third
causes of action because they are duplicative of the of the first cause of
action. Defendant’s motion to strike is DENIED as explained in the Court’s
tentative that duplication was not proper grounds to sustain a demurrer.
