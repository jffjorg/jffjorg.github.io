LEGAL
STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INSPECTION DEMANDS
Within
30 days after service of a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the original of
the response to it on the party making the demand, and a copy of the response
on all other parties who have appeared in the action, unless on motion of the
party making the demand, the court has shortened the time for response, or
unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been directed, the court
has extended the time for response. (CCP § 2031.260(a).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand. (CCP § 2031.300(b).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). (CCP § 2031.300(a).) “The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was
the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)
Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion
to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding
party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a
“meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404
citing Weil and Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2006) ¶¶8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to 8:1489,
pp. 8H-29 to hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)
ANALYSIS
Filing Fees/Parties
Defendant lumped
what should have been two motions into one motion. Defendant seeks to compel
responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, from two different
Plaintiffs: Jose Blanco and Jacinta Blanco.
“[P]ayment
of filing fees is both mandatory and jurisdictional.” (Hu vs. Silgan
Containers Corp. (1999) 70 Cal. App. 4th 1261, 1269.)  
Defendant
should have filed one motion pertaining to Jose Blanco and another motion
pertaining to Jacinta Blanco.
If
Defendant wants these motions heard, it can pay the additional filing fee to
the Court before the hearing and show proof of payment of the additional filing
fee before the hearing.
Alternatively,
Defendant is welcome to request the Court to advance and continue the instant
hearing to a date that both motions will be scheduled for; however, Defendant
is warned that all motions must provide sufficient notice to Plaintiff(s).
Further, Defendant would need to clarify who the instant motion would pertain
to on the future hearing date, i.e., will this motion pertain to Jose Blanco or
Jacinta Blanco. Presumably, the additional motion filed will clearly indicate
what discovery method it applies to and which Plaintiff.
Service
16/21
Day Lapse (§1005(b)): Ok
Proof of Service Timely Filed (CRC, Rule 3.1300): Ok
Correct Address (CCP §1013, §1013a): Uncertain
In
the 11/17/2023 Minute Order, the Court heard two hearings on motions to be
relieved as counsel as to Plaintiffs Jose Blanco and Jacinta Blanco. These two
motions to be relieved as counsel, filed by Maria Giragossian on 9/5/2023, were
granted. The instant motion was filed/served on 4/19/2024, which is after
11/17/2023; therefore Plaintiffs Jacinta and Jose would not have been
represented by counsel at the time this motion was filed/served.
The
proof of service lists the parties served as “Attorney for Plaintiffs, in pro
per,” and then it indicates that Plaintiffs Jose Blanco and Jacinta Blanco are
the "Attorney for Plaintiffs, in pro per.” Both Jose and Jacinta were
allegedly served by mail at 15964 Hawthorne Avenue, Fontana, CA 92335.
On
eCourt, there is no address listed for Jose and Jacinta; therefore, it is
unclear as to what address Jose and Jacinta were supposed to be served at. On
the two 9/5/2023 motions to be relieved as counsel, it appears as if Jacinta
and Jose’s address is listed as 15964 Hawthorne Avenue, Fontana, CA 92335,
which matches the address that Defendant served the instant motion.
The
Court will hear argument as to if Jose and Jacinta were properly served. Defendant
should be prepared to come forward with any case law, statutes, or rules of
court to support whatever argument it may have as to what is considered proper
service in the instant scenario when Plaintiffs’ previous counsel withdrew.
Substantive
Analysis
On
4/10/2023, Request for Production of Documents and Other Tangible Items, Set
No. One, was served on Jacinta and Jose’s prior counsel because on 4/10/2023
Jacinta and Jose were still represented by counsel. (See Torsney Decl. ¶ 2.) 
Torsney
states that on 5/8/2023 and 5/31/2023 Plaintiff’s counsel requested extensions
to the discovery response due dates. (Torsney Decl. ¶ 3.) Torsney also states
that after there were no responses from the five offending plaintiffs, their
attorney admitted she was unable to get their cooperation. (Id.) Torsney
states in ¶ 3 of his declaration that he attached a copy of these emails as
Exhibit B; however, the Court notes that Exhibit B does not include what
Torsney alleges it to include. 
Torsney
then states “[t]hat to this date, there has been no response to Defendant(s)
discovery request received in this office and the extension of time to respond
has expired[.]” (Torsney Decl. ¶ 4.) The Court notes that Torsney signed his
declaration attached to the motion on August 10, 2023. 
Therefore,
setting aside other issues that the Court previously addressed with this
motion, it appears as if responses can be compelled since no responses have
been timely provided.

TENTATIVE
RULING 
The
Court notes that Movant refers to itself as “Defendants.” It appears as if this
motion was filed by one Defendant, not multiple Defendants. This motion appears
to be filed by Defendant, 1001 Las Lomas, LLC. The Court will presume there is
one moving Defendant. At the hearing, the Movant should provide clarification
on this issue.

Ordinarily,
this motion appears to provide a basis to compel initial responses and award
sanctions. However, Defendant would need to address whether or not Plaintiffs
were properly served. 
Further, Defendant needs to address how the filing fee
issue should be handled. Defendant should be prepared to address if there are
notice problems if the Court arbitrarily chooses which Plaintiff to hear this
motion to. The Court is open to discussing continuing the instant hearing so it
can be heard on a date that the additional motion is scheduled on. The Court
warns Defendant to be wary of all applicable rules and law regarding notice.
Further, the Defendant would need to indicate which Plaintiff the instant
motion would apply to on the potential future hearing date.
The Court is also open to Defendant presenting proof
of payment of the additional filing fee before the hearing.
Sanctions
In relevant part, § 2031.300(c) states as follows:
Except as provided
in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP § 2031.300(c).)
 
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
Defendant moves for sanctions in the sum of $615.00
for the time and expense in drafting, filing, and presenting this motion. Torsney
indicates that 3 hours was spent on this motion at a rate of $185/hour.
Further, Torsney indicates a filing fee of $60.00.
The Court will hear argument because if the instant
motion is continued to a different date, there would be uncertainty with the
instant sanctions request because it applies to this combined motion. The
instant sanctions request doesn’t delineate between the two potential motions. 
The Court will also require Movant to clarify which
motions Movant is moving as to, and as to which plaintiff.
