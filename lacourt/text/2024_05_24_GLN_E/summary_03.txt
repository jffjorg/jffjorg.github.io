Here is the YAML summary of the tentative ruling:

```
Case Number: 22GDCV01057
Case Name: MARIA GALVAN, an individual; v. INTERNATIONAL COFFEE & TEA HOLDINGS, LLC, and DOES 1-25 inclusive

Case Type: Negligence and Premises Liability

Parties:
  * Plaintiff: Maria Galvan
  * Defendant: International Coffee & Tea Holdings LLC

Heard: May 24, 2024

Tentative Ruling:
  * Defendant's motion for summary judgment/adjudication on Plaintiff's causes of action for negligence and premises liability is DENIED.

Key Issues:
  * Duty of care: Whether the defendant had a legal duty to warn the plaintiff of the dangerous condition
  * Foreseeability: Whether the defendant could have reasonably foreseen that the plaintiff would walk on the wet floor
  * Necessity: Whether the plaintiff was required to walk on the wet floor due to necessity or other circumstances

Legal Standard:
  * The court must grant summary judgment if all the evidence, including uncontradicted inferences, shows that there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Facts:
  * The plaintiff slipped and fell on a wet floor at a coffee shop
  * The defendant argues that the plaintiff knew of the dangerous condition before the incident and therefore had no duty to warn
  * The plaintiff argues that the defendant had a duty to remedy the dangerous condition and that the plaintiff was required to walk on the wet floor due to necessity
