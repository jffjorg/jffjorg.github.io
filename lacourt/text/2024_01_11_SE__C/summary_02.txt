And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's second amended complaint is sustained without leave to amend. This means that the plaintiff's lawsuit is dismissed, and the plaintiff is not allowed to file an amended complaint. The judge has also granted the defendant's request for judicial notice.

The plaintiff, EMERALD SEVEN, LLC, had sued the defendant, CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION, alleging various causes of action, including declaratory relief, injunctive relief, quiet title, gross negligence, and breach of contract. The defendant demurred on multiple grounds, including lack of standing, jurisdiction, failure to state a claim, and failure to comply with administrative remedies.

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff does not have standing to litigate the tax dispute because it is not the taxpayer, and therefore, not the real party in interest. The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff has not exhausted its administrative remedies and has failed to state a claim for gross negligence. Additionally, the judge has ruled that the plaintiff's eighth cause of action is barred by Government Code section 860.2, which states that public entities and employees are not liable for injuries caused by the administration of tax laws and the collection of tax.

The judge has also granted the defendant's request for judicial notice and has sustained the demurrer to the first through ninth causes of action without leave to amend. The judge has also dropped the motion to strike as moot.
