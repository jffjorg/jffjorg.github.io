And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted BLAINE HOLDING & DEVELOPMENT, LLC's motion for attorney's fees and awarded sanctions to Vivera Bio, Inc. for lack of substantial justification in filing its motion for a protective order. The court denied Vivera Bio's motion for a protective order and Blaine's request for sanctions was previously denied without prejudice. The judge found that Vivera Bio did not act with substantial justification and did not identify any circumstances that would make the imposition of sanctions unjust. As a result, Vivera Bio is ordered to pay Blaine and its counsel reasonable sanctions in the amount of $5,400.00 within 60 days of the court's issuance of this order.
