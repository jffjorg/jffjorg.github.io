The court has ordered the defendant to file the cross-complaint within five court days of the issuance of the order. The court has also ordered that responsive pleadings be filed in accordance with the rules of civil procedure. The Judge has cited CCP §428.50 and CCP §426.50 in support of its decision, which states that the court may grant leave to file a cross-complaint in the interest of justice at any time during the course of the action. The court has granted the motion, finding that it would serve the interests of justice to do so, and that it is best to avoid multiplicity or duplicity of actions.
