DEVELOPMENT, LLC v. VIVERA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. 
CASE
NO.:  19NWCV00820
HEARING:  01/11/24
 
#5
 
BLAINE
HOLDING & DEVELOPMENT, LLC’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED. 
 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
No
Opposition filed as of January 8, 2024.       
 
On
September 20, 2023, this Court denied Third-Party Vivera Bio, Inc.’s (“Vivera
Bio”) Motion for a Protective Order. Plaintiff BLAINE HOLDING &
DEVELOPMENT, LLC’s (“Blaine”) request for sanctions was denied without
prejudice. 
 
Blaine
now separately moves for sanctions based on Vivera Bio’s lack of substantial
justification for filing its Motion for Protective Order. 
 
“[T]he
court shall impose a monetary sanction… against any party, person, or attorney
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion for a protective order, unless it
finds that the one subject to sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of sanction unjust.” (CCP
§2031.060(h).) 
 
As
indicated above, no Opposition(s) to the subject Motion have been filed. As
such, there is nothing to show that Vivera Bio acted with substantial
justification and the Court knows of no other circumstances which would make
the imposition of sanctions unjust. 
 
Sanctions
are awarded, as requested, as follows: Vivera Bio, Inc. is ORDERED to pay
Moving Party and their counsel of record reasonable sanctions in the total
amount requested of $5,400.00 no later than 60 days from the Court’s
issuance of this Order. This date may be extended per agreement of the
parties.
