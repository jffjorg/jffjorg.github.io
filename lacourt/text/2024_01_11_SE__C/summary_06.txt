And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this discrimination action. The plaintiff has filed a demurrer to the defendant's First Amended Answer, which asserts 18 affirmative defenses. The judge sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the defendant's affirmative defenses lack factual support and are merely legal conclusions. The plaintiff has also moved to strike the factual denials and admissions contained in the defendant's First Amended Answer. The judge denied this motion, finding that the denials are sufficient and that the trial court should not make factual determinations at this stage in the litigation. The judge has given notice to the moving party and set a hearing date for January 11, 2024.
