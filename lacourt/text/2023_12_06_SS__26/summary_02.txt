And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied William P. Anderson's (Judgment Creditor) motion for an assignment order. The motion sought to assign rent that Michelle Shocked (Judgment Debtor) purportedly receives from a tenant to satisfy the judgment. The judge found that Judgment Creditor did not carry their burden of proof to demonstrate that the court should issue an assignment order. The judge noted that the judgment remains wholly unsatisfied and that the out-of-court statements provided by a private investigator were not admissible. Therefore, the motion is denied.
