And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel responses to form interrogatories and requests for sanctions. The plaintiff, Sisi Missy, Inc. dba CDP Construction, is ordered to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days of the order. The plaintiff is also ordered to pay sanctions of $261.65 to defense counsel within 20 days. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to timely respond to the discovery requests constitutes a misuse of the discovery process and that sanctions are appropriate. The judge awards sanctions based on a lodestar calculation of half-an-hour of attorney time billed at $400.00 per hour and a filing fee of $61.65.
