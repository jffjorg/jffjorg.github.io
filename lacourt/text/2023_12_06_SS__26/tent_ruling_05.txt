ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff Dana Moore (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action
for breach of contract and dental malpractice against Defendants Raymont H.
Johnson Jr., D.D.S. (“Defendant Johnson”) and Practicing the Art of Dentistry
(“Defendant PTAD”) on October 25, 2022. Defendants filed an answer on November 16,
2022. 
 
On April 18, 2023, the Court granted Defendant Johnson’s
Motions to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special
Interrogatories, Set One. (Minute
Order, 04/18/23.) Two orders to show cause regarding compliance with the
discovery orders were held on July 18, 2023 and September 19, 2023. (Minute
Orders, 07/18/23 and 09/19/23.)
 
Defendant Johnson
filed the instant Motion for Terminating Sanctions on October 27, 2023. No opposition has
been filed to date.
 
Legal Standard
 
Where a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts
have discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence or monetary sanctions.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subds. (d), (g); R.S. Creative, Inc. v.
Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) The court should
look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether terminating
sanctions are appropriate. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225,
1246.) Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a willful
discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules. (Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A] penalty as
severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with
discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad
faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) “The court
may impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: 
 
(1)   An
order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.
 
(2)   An
order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed.
 
(3)   An
order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party.
 
(4)   An
order rendering a judgment by default against that party.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)
 
Discussion
 
The Court granted Defendant Johnson’s Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set
One, on April 18, 2023. (Minute Order, 04/18/23; Motion, Foxwell Decl., Exh. D.)
Pursuant to the order, Plaintiff was to serve Defendants with responses and pay
sanctions within 20 days. (Ibid.) Notice of the ruling was served on
Plaintiff on the next date. (Notice of Ruling, filed 04/19/23.) Plaintiff has
not substantially complied with the order to produce documents or pay sanctions,
despite extended meet and confer efforts. (Id. at ¶¶15-16.) 
 
The Court finds that terminating sanctions are warranted for
Plaintiff’s non-compliance with the discovery order. Despite notice of the
Court’s ruling, Plaintiff failed to produce documents as ordered. Nor has
Plaintiff filed an opposition to the instant Motion to dismiss the Complaint. This
further demonstrates that compliance with the Court’s orders cannot be achieved
through lesser sanctions. Although terminating sanctions are a harsh penalty, “[t]he
court [is] not required to allow a pattern of abuse to continue ad infinitum.”
(Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 280.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Raymont T. Johnson, Jr., D.D.S’ Motion for Terminating Sanctions is
GRANTED. THE COURT DISMISSES PLAINTIFF DANA MOORE’S COMPLAINT WITH PREJUDICE.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
