PLAINTIFF/CROSS-DEFENDANT SISI MISSY, INC. DBA CDP CONSTRUCTION IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE

ANALYSIS:
 
On August 17, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Doris
Anderson (“Defendants”) served Form Interrogatories, Set One, on Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
Sisi Missy, Inc. dba CDP Construction (“Plaintiff”) (Motion, Brooke Decl., Exh. A.) Following Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant’s
failure to serve timely responses, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on
September 28, 2023. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) Based on Plaintiff’s failure to timely
respond to the propounded discovery, Defendant is entitled to an order
compelling service of verified responses to the discovery requests without
objections. 
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the sanctions sought are excessive for
a simple and unopposed discovery motion. Under a lodestar calculation,
sanctions are awarded in the amount of $261.65 based on half-an-hour of
attorney time billed at $400.00 per hour and a filing fee of $61.65. (Motion, Brooke Decl., ¶7.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Doris Anderson’s Motion to
Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions,
is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF/CROSS-DEFENDANT SISI
MISSY, INC. DBA CDP CONSTRUCTION IS TO
SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE DISCOVERY REQUESTS WITHOUT OBJECTIONS WITHIN 20
DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. PLAINTIFF/CROSS-DEFENDANT IS ORDERED TO PAY
SANCTIONS OF $261.65 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
