ANALYSIS:
 
Petitioner Maureen McAulay (“Petitioner”), in pro se, filed
the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award against Respondent Paul Mynor
Parades dba Selah Roofing Corporation (“Respondent”) on August 2, 2023. Proof
of personal service was filed on September 26, 2023. 
 
 
 
Legal Standard
 
“Any party to an
arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court to confirm,
correct or vacate the award.  The
petition shall name as respondent all parties to the arbitration and may name
as respondents any other persons bound by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) “If a
petition or response under this chapter is duly served and filed, the court
shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered in this state or another
state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and
confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.)
 
A response to a Petition to Confirm
Arbitration Award that seeks to vacate or correct the award must be served and
filed no later than 100 days after the date of the service of a signed copy of
the award on the respondent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.2.)
 
Discussion
 
Service
of the Petition and Notice of Hearing
 
Code of Civil Procedure, section 1290.4
requires that the Petition and Notice of Hearing be served on Respondent “in
the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the service of such
petition and notice” or “[i]f the arbitration agreement does not provide the
manner in which such service shall be made . . . [s]ervice within this State
shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in an
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subds. (a), (b).) 
 
Petitioner has not shown that the parties’
arbitration agreement provides for the manner of service of the Petition and
Notice of Hearing. (Pet., ¶4 and Attachment 4(b).) It follows that the Petition
and Notice of Hearing must be served in the manner provided by law for service
of a summons, as set forth in Code of Civil Procedure sections 415.10 to
415.95. Respondent was personally served on September 8, 2023. (Proof of
Personal Service by Sheriff, filed 09/26/23, ¶¶2-3.) Therefore, the Court finds
that service of the Petition conforms to Code of Civil Procedure section
1290.4. 
 
Service of
the Arbitration Award and Timing of Service of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288,
1288.4)
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6
requires that “[t]he neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award
on each party to the arbitration personally or by registered or certified mail
or as provided in the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1283.6.) This
requirement may be satisfied by service by the arbitrator, or upon proper
service of the Award with the Petition. (See Murry v. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 796, 799-800.) The
arbitration award is not accompanied by a proof of service. (Pet., Attachment
8(c).) However, Petitioner has demonstrated that the award was served on
Respondent with the instant Petition. (Pet., Attachment 8(c).) 
 
Also, a party
seeking a court judgment confirming an arbitration award must file and serve the
petition no more than four years, but not less than 10 days, after the award is served. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.)
Petitioner has demonstrated compliance with Code of Civil Procedure sections 1288 and 1288.4 by service of the
Petition two months after the award was issued. The Court finds that Petitioner
has complied with Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1283.6, 1288, and 1288.4. 
 
Confirmation
of the Arbitration Award
 
An arbitration award is not directly
enforceable until it is confirmed by a court and judgment is entered.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1287.6; Jones v.
Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.) The court must confirm the award as
made, unless it corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses the
proceeding.  (CCP § 1286; Valsan
Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25
Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) Code of Civil Procedure, section 1285.4 states a
petition under this chapter shall:
 
a)     
Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such
an agreement.
 
b)     
Set forth the names of the arbitrators.
 
c)     
Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the
written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
1285.4.) The Petition complies with the above requirements. It sets forth the
nature of the arbitration agreement and the name of the arbitrator. (Pet., ¶¶4,
6.) A copy of the arbitration agreement is also attached. (Id. at
Attachment 4(b).) Substantively, the Petition demonstrates that Petitioner is
entitled to an award of $7,673.18 from Respondent. (Id. at Attachment
8(c) at pp. 1-2.) 

 
Attorney’s Fees, Costs, and
Interest
 
To the extent Petitioner requests
costs according to proof (Pet., Prayer, ¶¶10(e)-(f)), those are permitted on a
petition to confirm arbitration award. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1293.2; MBNA
America Bank, N.A. v. Gorman (2006) 147 Cal.App.4th.Supp. 1, 7.) Petitioner
may file a memorandum of costs pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1700 with
respect to the filing fees incurred. The interest sought by Petitioner may be
sought by setting forth the interest calculation in the proposed judgment.

 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing,
Petitioner Maureen McAulay’s Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award is GRANTED.
JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN THE AMOUNT OF $7,673.18 PRINCIPAL. COSTS MAY BE SOUGHT PURSUANT TO CAL. RULES OF COURT RULES
3.1700. 
PETITIONER
IS TO FILE A PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER, WHICH MAY INCLUDE
