```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling is as follows: the demurrer to the complaint filed by defendant Xiaoxia Liu is sustained without leave to amend as to the second cause of action for fraud, and overruled as to the first cause of action for breach of contract and third cause of action for money had and received. The defendant is to file an answer to the complaint within 20 days of this order.

The court found that the complaint sufficiently alleges the elements of a cause of action for breach of contract, including the contract, the plaintiff's performance, the defendant's breach, and the resulting damage. However, the court sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action for fraud because the complaint does not address the issue of whether the allegedly fraudulent statements were actionable.

The court also overruled the demurrer to the third cause of action for money had and received, finding that the complaint alleges that the defendant became indebted to the plaintiff in the amount of $20,000.00, and that the defendant's demurrer does not address the allegations in the complaint.

Finally, the court rejected the defendant's argument that they are entitled to recover the entire amount paid for the motor vehicle based on the plaintiff's purported violation of the Automobile Sales Finance Act, and that they are entitled to transfer the action to a court of unlimited jurisdiction based on their damages.
