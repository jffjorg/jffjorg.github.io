ANALYSIS:
 
On June 16, 2023, Plaintiff
Rusnak/Pasadena (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for
breach of contract and fraud against Defendant Xiaoxia Liu (“Defendant”). On
October 18, 2023, Defendant filed the instant Demurrer to the Complaint. Plaintiff
filed an opposition on November 21, 2023. 
 
Discussion
 
The Complaint alleges that the
parties entered into a motor vehicle purchase agreement that included an export
policy and agreement. (Compl., ¶¶7-8.) The export policy prohibits the
purchaser, Defendant, from exporting the vehicle within six months of purchase
and includes a liquidated damages provision in the amount of $20,000.00 for
violation of the policy. (Id. at ¶8.) Defendant breached the export
provision and as a result, Plaintiff suffered damages of $20,000.00. (Id.
at ¶¶9-11.) Defendant knowingly and willingly, agreed and conspired to
fraudulently obtain the vehicle and to export it outside of the United States
in direct breach of the terms of the Agreement. (Id. at ¶14.) Defendant
expressly represented that they would honor the export policy at the time of
purchase and at the time the representations were made, knew them to be false
and to induce Plaintiff’s reasonable reliance. (Id. at ¶¶16-18.)
Plaintiff reasonably relied on the representations and was damaged in an amount
to be proven. (Id. at ¶19.)  
 
The Demurrer is accompanied by a meet and confer declaration as required
by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. (Demurrer, Declaration of Demurring
Party, filed 10/18/23.) Defendant demurs to the Complaint for failure to
allege sufficient facts. (Citing Code Civ. Proc., §430.10, subd. (e).) To the
extent the Demurrer is brought on grounds of uncertainty, Plaintiff is correct
that special demurrers are not permitted in a court of limited jurisdiction.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).) Plaintiff is also correct to point out that
Defendant’s version of facts as set forth in the Demurrer are irrelevant to the
sufficiency of the pleading. 
 
The elements of a cause of action
for breach of contract are (1) the contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance of
the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s breach, and (4)
the resulting damage to the plaintiff.” (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.) Defendant demurs on the grounds that the Complaint
does not sufficiently allege causation of damages and that the allegations of
damages are merely legal conclusions. In opposition, Plaintiff argues that only
ultimate facts are required and have been pled. (Citing McCaughey v.
Schuette (1897) 117 Cal. 223, 225; Green v. Palmer, 15 Cal. 411
(1860) 414-15.) The Complaint alleges the ultimate facts of Defendant’s breach
of the contract and Plaintiff’s resulting damages. (Compl., ¶¶7-11.) These
factual conclusions are the types of ultimate facts that sufficiently support a
cause of action. (See Krug v. Meehan (1952) 109 Cal.App.2d 274, 277.)
The Complaint does not merely allege the legal conclusion that Defendant is
liable for breach of contract, which alone, would be insufficient. Therefore,
the first cause of action is sufficiently alleged to state a claim for breach
of contract. The Demurrer to the first cause of action is overruled.
 
Regarding the second cause of action for fraud, the elements (1) misrepresentation;
(2) knowledge of falsity (or "scienter"); (3) intent to defraud
(induce reliance); (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damage. (Conroy
v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (2009) 45 Cal. 4th 1244, 1255.) Defendant
demurs on the grounds that opinions, which include statements of future events,
are not actionable. (Citing Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469 “Statements or predictions regarding future events are
deemed to be mere opinions which are not actionable.”).] In opposition,
Plaintiff does not address this case law and instead focuses on the elements of
the cause of action. Therefore, the Demurrer to the second cause of action is
sustained without leave to amend. 
 
The third cause of action is for money had and received on the allegation
that Defendant became indebted to Plaintiff in the amount of $20,000.00.
(Compl., ¶22.) Defendant demurs to this cause of action on the grounds that
they paid the full sales price and has not received anything of value for which
they did not pay. This does not address the allegations in the Complaint,
however. Therefore, the Demurrer for failure to sufficiently allege the third
cause of action is overruled. 
 
Finally, Defendant makes an argument that they are entitled to recover
the entire amount paid for the motor vehicle based on Plaintiff’s purported
violation of the Automobile Sales Finance Act (“ASFA”). This would be grounds
for a counter-claim by Defendant to recover the sales price of $94,371.37,
not a demurrer to the entire Complaint. Similarly, Defendant’s request to
transfer this action to a court of unlimited jurisdiction based on their
damages of $94,371.37 is also nor proper on demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc.,
§430.10.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Xiaoxia Liu’s Demurrer to the Complaint is
SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND AS TO THE SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION FOR FRAUD AND
OVERRULED AS TO THE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT AND THIRD
CAUSE OF ACTION FOR MONEY HAD AND RECEIVED. DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AN ANSWER TO
THE COMPLAINT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
