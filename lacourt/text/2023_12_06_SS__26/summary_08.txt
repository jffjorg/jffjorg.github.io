The judge has deemed the Requests for Admissions admitted due to the defendant's failure to comply with the court's rules. The judge has also awarded sanctions to the plaintiff's counsel in the amount of $455.00, which is based on one hour of attorney time billed at $395.00 per hour, plus a $60.00 filing fee. The defendant is ordered to pay the sanctions within 20 days of service of the order.
