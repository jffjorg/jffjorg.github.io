And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to terminate sanctions and dismisses the plaintiff's complaint with prejudice. The court finds that the plaintiff has willfully disobeyed discovery orders and failed to comply with the court's ruling, despite extended meet and confer efforts. The plaintiff was ordered to serve defendants with responses and pay sanctions within 20 days, but failed to do so. The court concludes that terminating sanctions are warranted due to the plaintiff's pattern of abuse and failure to comply with discovery orders.
