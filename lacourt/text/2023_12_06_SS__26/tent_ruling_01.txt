§ 664.6)

Automobile Insurance Company’s Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement is GRANTED.

ANALYSIS:
 
On November 25,
2020, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”)
filed this subrogation action against Defendant Dennis Romero (“Defendant”). Defendant filed an answer on March 9,
2021. On February 3, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a copy of the parties’ settlement agreement with a request for dismissal
and retention of jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The
Court dismissed the action pursuant to the stipulation on the same date. (Stip
and Order, filed 02/03/23.) On November 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant
Motion to Vacate Dismissal, Enforce Settlement and Enter Judgment. To date, no
opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
The instant motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6, which states in relevant part:
 
If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under
section 664.6 meant the litigants themselves, not their attorneys.  (Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10
Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current statute provides that “parties” includes “an
attorney who represents the party” and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., §
664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement must include the signatures of the parties
seeking to enforce the agreement, and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B.
Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) Plaintiff has demonstrated the
settlement agreement complies with the statutory requirements set forth above
as it was signed by both parties and their attorneys. (Motion, Reese Decl.,
Exh. A, p. 3.)

 
Furthermore, the request for
retention of jurisdiction must be made in writing, by the parties, before the
action is dismissed for the Court’s retention of jurisdiction to conform to the
statutory language. (Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 433 [“If,
after a suit has been dismissed, a party brings a section 664.6 motion for a
judgment on a settlement agreement but cannot present to the court a request
for retention of jurisdiction that meets all of these requirements, then
enforcement of the agreement must be left to a separate lawsuit.”].) The
parties’ request for retention of jurisdiction complies with these requirements
because it was made in writing to the Court before the action was dismissed.
(Motion, Reese Decl., Exh. A, ¶3.) 
 
The settlement obligates
Defendant to pay Plaintiff $7,841.14 through an initial payment from
Defendant’s insurer of $4,341.14, followed by Defendant’s monthly payments
starting on March 1, 2023. (Id. at Exh. A, ¶1.) The settlement agreement
also provides that if Defendant defaults, Plaintiff may seek judgment in the settlement
amount, plus costs not to exceed $500.00, less any monies paid. (Id. at
Exh. A, ¶3.) Total payments of $4,401.14 were made
towards the settlement, after which Defendant defaulted. (Id. at ¶7 and
Exh. B.) Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff is entitled to entry of judgment
against Defendant in the amount of $3,440.00 principal ($7,841.14 - $4,401.14)
and $500.00 in costs. (Ibid.) 

 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s
Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement is GRANTED. JUDGMENT TO BE ENTERED IN
PLAINTIFF’S FAVOR AND AGAINST DEFENDANT DENNIS
ROMERO IN THE AMOUNT OF $3,440.00 PRINCIPAL AND $500.00 COSTS.
