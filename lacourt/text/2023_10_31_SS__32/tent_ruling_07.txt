[1] The
Court notes that Plaintiffs did not raise their argument or present evidence about
Trejo’s intent until their reply brief, thereby not giving Defendant a sufficient
opportunity to respond. 


[2] In light
of the Court’s ruling, the Court does not reach Defendant’s separate objection of
the work product privilege.


[3]
Defendant’s opposition only addresses the issue of relevance, and therefore the
Court does not reach the other objections raised.
