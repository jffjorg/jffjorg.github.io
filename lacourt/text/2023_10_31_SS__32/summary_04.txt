And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to deny the application for determination of good faith settlement of the settlements between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The court found that the application did not provide sufficient notice to all parties, including the remaining party, Isaac John Gettis, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6. The court notes that the settlements were unopposed, but the moving party failed to demonstrate that the settlements were made in good faith. The court requires the defendants to provide notice of the ruling and file a proof of service.
