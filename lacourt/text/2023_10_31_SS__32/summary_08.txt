Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Beth Schuster in the case 23STCV06585. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs' allegations do not support punitive damages against Defendant. The Court grants the motion to strike paragraphs 12, 13, and prayer 6 "For punitive damages" without leave to amend. The Court notes that the Plaintiffs did not oppose the motion or request leave to amend, and therefore, have not met their burden. The Court orders Defendant to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
