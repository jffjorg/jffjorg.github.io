Summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to compel further responses regarding Plaintiffs' Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Numbers 66 to 71, as they relate to past incidents. The Court denies the motion to compel further regarding Plaintiffs' Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Numbers 1-2, 6-7, as they relate to Marlene Trejo's statement. The Court finds that Defendant's primary purpose in requiring Target employees to make statements is to assist in anticipation of litigation, and therefore, Trejo's witness statement is protected by the attorney-client privilege. The Court also finds that past accident reports, claims, or lawsuits involving spills may lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, including relating to the issues of notice and habit or custom evidence regarding a failure to clean or warn.
