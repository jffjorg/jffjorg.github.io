Here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Eveleen Martinez, et al, filed a medical malpractice action against the defendants, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, et al, alleging that the hospital's negligence caused the death of their son, Decedent. The defendants argued that they did not breach their duty of care and did not cause Decedent's injuries. The court finds that the defendants have satisfied their initial burden of establishing that they did not breach their duty of care and did not cause Decedent's injuries. The plaintiff has not presented any evidence raising a dispute of material fact, and therefore, the medical malpractice claims fail as a matter of law. The court also finds that the defendants did not commit battery or medical battery because they did not "touch" Decedent and were not responsible for providing informed consent.
