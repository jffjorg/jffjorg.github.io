Summary:
The Tentative Ruling grants the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendants Wells Fargo and Chase, dismissing the breach of contract claim brought by Plaintiff Speedy Fuel, Inc. The court finds that there was no objective manifestation of assent to pay for the transactions, and that the pre-authorizations and completion messages do not constitute a contract. The court also dismisses the claim for goods sold and delivered, as it is based on the same facts as the breach of contract claim.
