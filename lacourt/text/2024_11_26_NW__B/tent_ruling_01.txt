PARTY: NoneEXPEDITED PETITION FOR APPROVAL OFMINOR’S COMPROMISE OF A DISPUTED CLAIM(CCP § 372, CRC Rules 7.950, 7.950.5)TENTATIVE RULING:The Expedited Petition filed on behalf of minor Claimant Justin Yael Bustillo is GRANTED.ANALYSIS:I. BackgroundOn December 10, 2020, Plaintiff Justin Yael Bustillo (“Claimant”) by and through hisguardian ad litem Karen Maria Orozco (“Petitioner”) filed an action for general and motor vehicle negligence against Defendants Edwin de Santiago (“Edwin”), Jose de Santiago (“Jose”), and Does 1 to 100 (collectively “Defendants”). Petitioner was appointed as guardian ad litem for Claimant on February 1, 2021.On April 20, 2023, Petitioner filed a Notice of Settlement.On December 4, 2023, the Court approved a compromise of claim or action or disposition of proceeds of judgment for minor Claimant. However, on June 26, 2024, Petitioner filed a notice of errata, notifying that her name was incorrectly listed as Karen Maria Rodriguez on all prior filings. Petitioner also notified that she would file an amended minor’s compromise with her correct legal name, Karen Maria Orozco.On June 6, 2024, the matter was assigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys Courthouse East. Petitioner was ordered to give notice to all parties in this action within 10 days of service of this notice and file proof of service thereof within 12 days of this notice. The Court notes that Petitioner has failed to file proof of service of the Notice of Case Reassignment.On October 31, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant Expedited Petition to Approve Minor’s Compromise of Disputed Claim on behalf of Claimant.II. Legal StandardCourt approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; CCP § 372.) “‘[W]ithout trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] Nor is the settlement binding [on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.) A minor, like Claimant, “shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.” (CCP § 372(a)(1).) Alternatively, the petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating that he or she has a right to compromise the minor’s claim under Cal. Prob. Code § 3500.Regarding the substance of the Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; CRC Rule 7.950.) (Italics added.)Under CRC Rule 7.950.5, an expedited petition for minor’s compromise without a scheduled hearing is permitted as long as Petitioner uses the required Judicial Council forms and meets certain additional conditions.III. Discussion & ConclusionPetitioner seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive$500.00. $100.00 in costs and $125.00 attorney’s fees will be deducted from Claimant’s settlement amount. (MC-350EX Items 14a. and 14b.) Therefore, Claimant’s net settlement amount is $275.00. (MC-350EX Item 16.)The fee agreement between Petitioner and Petitioner’s counsel is reasonable as it represents a 25% contingency fee of the proposed $500 settlement. (MC-350EX Attachment 18a.) Plaintiff’s counsel represents that, due to lack of medical records kept by the treating clinic, Clinica Medica, Virgin de Guadalupe, Petitioner can only provide back to school notes as proof of Claimant’s full treatment. (Sapir Decl. ¶¶ 3-6; Attachment 9 [back to school note].)Additionally, Petitioner discloses information which bears upon the reasonableness of the compromise. Notably, Petitioner and Plaintiffs Norma Leticia Perez and Jairo Abraham Orozco are to receive $10,000, $6,000, and $500, respectively. (See Item 12b.) The amounts are apportioned based on total medical expenses and severity of bodily injury. (Attachment 12.)Accordingly, the Expedited Petition filed on behalf of minor Claimant Justin Yael Bastillo is GRANTED.Petitioner is ordered to give notice. Court to sign proposed order.
