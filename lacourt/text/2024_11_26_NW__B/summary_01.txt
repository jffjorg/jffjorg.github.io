And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the expedited petition for approval of minor's compromise filed on behalf of Claimant Justin Yael Bustillo. The petition seeks approval of a settlement under which Claimant would receive $500, with $100 in costs and $125 in attorney's fees deducted from the settlement amount. The total net settlement amount would be $275. The judge notes that the fee agreement between the Petitioner and Petitioner's counsel is reasonable, representing a 25% contingency fee of the proposed settlement. The Petitioner has disclosed information that bears upon the reasonableness of the compromise, including the apportionment of settlement amounts to other parties. The judge has granted the petition and ordered the Petitioner to give notice.
