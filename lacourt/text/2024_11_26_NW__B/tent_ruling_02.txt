 Case Number:  21STCV08691    Hearing Date:   November 26, 2024    Dept:  B Petitioner Dwain Jackson’s Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a DisabilityRespondent: NO OPPOSITIONTENTATIVE RULINGPetitioner Dwain Jackson’s Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability is DENIED.BACKGROUNDThis action arises from a September 24, 2020, incident in which Claimant Nathan Jackson (“Claimant”) alleges Defendants Paul Burke (“Burke”), Yordanose Tesfasilase (“Tesfasilase”), and Does 1 to 10 (collectively “Defendants”) negligently entrusted Claimant with an MX350 dirt bike, causing Claimant to sustain serious injuries as a result.On March 5, 2021, Claimant filed an action against Defendant Forum Entertainment LLC (“Forum”) alleging one cause of action for premises liability. On the same day, Claimant also filed an action against Burke and Tesfasilase for general negligence.On March 18, 2021, Petitioner Dwain Jackson (“Petitioner”)’s application for appointment as Claimant’s guardian ad litem was granted.On February 8, 2024, Claimant filed a notice of settlement.On June 5, 2024, the case was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.On October 4, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant Petition to Confirm Minor’s Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability on behalf of Claimant.ANALYSISPetitioner seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive $225,000.00 from Defendants.Legal StandardAn enforceable settlement of a minor’s or incompetent’s claim can only be consummated with court approval. (Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) For this purpose, a petition for approval must be presented to the court and until it is granted, there is no final settlement. (Scruton v. Korean Air Lines Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1606.) Any settlement agreement therefore is voidable by the minor’s guardian ad litem. (Ibid. at 1606.)Prob. Code § 3600, et seq., governs how the settlement proceeds are to be paid. Pursuant to § 3601, the order shall approve payment of reasonable expenses from the settlement as follows:The court making the order or giving the judgment referred to in Section 3600, as a part thereof, shall make a further order authorizing and directing that such reasonable expenses (medical or otherwise and including reimbursement to a parent, guardian, or conservator), costs, and attorney’s fees, as the court shall approve and allow therein, shall be paid from the money or other property to be paid or delivered for the benefit of the minor or incompetent person. (Prob. Code § 3601(a).)In cases pursuant to § 3601, “unless the court has approved the fee agreement in advance, the court must use a reasonable fee standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s fees payable from money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person with a disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 7.955(a)(1).) In doing so, “[t]he court must give consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made between the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a disability and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made, except where the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a disability contemplated that the attorney's fee would be affected by later events.” (CRC Rule 7.955(a)(2).)DiscussionPetitioner seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive $225,000.00. Of the $225,000.00 settlement, $3,320.08 is to be deducted for medical expenses; $56,250.00 for attorney’s fees, and $2,122.33 for costs. Therefore, Claimant’s proposed net settlement amount is $163,307.59.The Petition sets forth information that bears upon the reasonableness of the compromise pursuant to CRC Rule 7.950. (MC-350 Exh. A [medical records].) Additionally, attorney’s fees represent 25% of the total settlement agreement. (MC-350 Attachment 17a.) Claimant’s counsel provides their retainer agreement as Attachment 17a. Costs are reasonable considering the extent of litigation.Petitioner requests that Claimant’s settlement funds be deposited into a blocked account. (See Item 18b(2).) However, Petitioner fails to provide a proposed order on Form MC-355 to depositmoney into a blocked account.Therefore, the Petition is denied for deficiencies.CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, the Court DENIES the petition to confirm minor’s compromise. This Petition has now been denied for deficiencies on multiple occasions. The Court will consider setting an OSC re: sanctions on Petitioner and Claimant’s counsel pursuant to CCP § 583.410 at the hearing.Petitioner to give notice.
