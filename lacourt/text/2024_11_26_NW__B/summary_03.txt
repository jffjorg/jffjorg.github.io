And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to augment or amend their expert witness list. The plaintiff sought to add a new expert witness, David Marcus, to replace Larry Lacombe, who unexpectedly resigned from the case. The judge found that the plaintiff had failed to provide a meet and confer declaration, as required by law, and therefore did not meet the statutory requirements for a motion to augment or amend their expert witness list. Additionally, the judge found that the substitution of Marcus for Lacombe would unduly prejudice the defendants, as Marcus is a trial attorney with decades of experience, while Lacombe is a land title expert.
