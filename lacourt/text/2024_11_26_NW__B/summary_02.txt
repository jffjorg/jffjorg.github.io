And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition to confirm a settlement agreement between Claimant Nathan Jackson and Defendants Paul Burke, Yordanose Tesfasilase, and Does 1 to 10, Forum Entertainment LLC. The settlement agreement would have paid Claimant $225,000.00, but the judge has denied the petition for deficiencies in the petition. The judge has also indicated that they may consider setting an order to show cause for sanctions against the Petitioner and Claimant's counsel. The judge's decision is based on the fact that the petition fails to provide a proposed order to deposit the settlement funds into a blocked account, among other reasons.
