Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for leave to amend the complaint to add a claim for punitive damages. The plaintiff's motion was filed on October 24, 2024, and the complaint was filed on November 2, 2022. The judge found that the plaintiff's motion was timely, but the evidence presented did not meet the high standard of proof required for punitive damages. The plaintiff's deposition testimony was not sufficient to establish a prima facie case for punitive damages, and the judge did not assess credibility or weigh conflicting evidence. The judge also noted that the plaintiff failed to provide expert medical testimony to support their motion, and that the deposition testimony of laypersons cannot be used to satisfy the high burden of showing a substantial probability of prevailing on a punitive damages claim.
