BACKGROUND
 
On October 9, 2019, Plaintiff Zoilo
Doran-Hernandez (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant Deborah Marie
McClaskey (“Defendant”) and DOES 1 through 25, inclusive for: Negligence. The
Complaint alleges that on or about December 21, 2017, Defendant negligently
drove her respective vehicle causing it to collide with Plaintiff’s vehicle.
(Compl., ¶11.) As a result, Plaintiff suffered general and property damages,
and loss of earnings. (Id. at ¶¶12-15.) 
On November 8, 2019, Defendant filed an Answer. 
 
On October 9, 2024, the Court entered
Judgment for Plaintiff in the amount of $6,000.00 in damages after the jury
trial. 
 
On October 22, 2024, Defendant filed a
Memorandum of Costs (“MOC”) seeking $134,760.30 in costs against Plaintiff. 
 
On October 23, 2024, Defendant filed a
Notice of Intent to Move for New Trial. The motion was taken under submission
on December 4, 2024. The Court denied the motion on December 16, 2024. 
 
On November 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Tax Costs. On December 11, 2024, Defendant filed an
Opposition. On December 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Reply. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff Zoilo Doran-Hernandez’s
Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED in part as to the expert witness fees and court
reporter fees, and DENIED in part as to the service of process and models,
enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a
prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any
action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).) “Allowable costs
shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than
merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5, subd. (c)(2).)  “If the items
appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party
seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas
v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th 761, 774.) “On the
other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and
the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Ibid.) 
 
“Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be
served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost
memorandum was served by mail, the period is extended as provided in Code of
Civil Procedure section 1013. If the cost memorandum was served electronically,
the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section
1010.6(a)(4).” (Cal. Rules Ct., rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(1).)
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff Zoilo Doran-Hernandez (“Plaintiff”)
moves to tax costs in the Memorandum of Costs (“MOC”) filled and served by
Defendant Deborah Marie McClaskey (“Defendant”) on October 22, 2024 in its
entirety on the grounds that the claimed costs pre-date the Code of Civil
Procedure Section 998 Offer to Compromise and the Section 998 offer was not
reasonable and made in good faith. 
 
Section
998 Offer
 
“Not less than 10 days prior to commencement of trial or
arbitration (as provided in Section 1281 or 1295) of a dispute to be resolved
by arbitration, any party may serve an offer in writing upon any other party to
the action to allow judgment to be taken or an award to be entered in
accordance with the terms and conditions stated at that time. The written offer
shall include a statement of the offer, containing the terms and conditions of
the judgment or award, and a provision that allows the accepting party to
indicate acceptance of the offer by signing a statement that the offer is
accepted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 998, subd. (b).)
 
“If an offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the
plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award, the costs under
this section, from the time of the offer, shall be deducted from any damages
awarded in favor of the plaintiff. If the costs awarded under this section
exceed the amount of the damages awarded to the plaintiff the net amount shall
be awarded to the defendant and judgment or award shall be entered accordingly.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 998, subd. (e).)
 
“To determine whether a plaintiff has obtained a judgment or
award more favorable than a defendant's offer under section 998, a trial court
must calculate the ‘net judgment,’ considering the status of the litigation at
the time the section 998 offer was outstanding.” (Oakes v. Progressive
Transportation Services, Inc. (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 486, 500.) “To do so,
the court must add to the judgment or award costs incurred by the plaintiff
prior to the offer [footnote omitted], including preoffer attorney
fees in any case in which attorney fees are otherwise awardable as costs.” (Id.)
“The court must then deduct from the judgment or award the defendant's
postoffer costs allowable under section 1033.5 [Citation], and any postoffer
expert witness fees assessed against the plaintiff in the court's discretion.
[Citation.].” (Id.)
 
Here, Plaintiff does not argue whether he obtained a
judgment or award more favorable that Defendant’s offer to compromise under
Section 998. As such, a reasonable person could infer that Plaintiff concedes
he did not obtain a more favorable judgment than Defendant’s Section 998 offer.
Instead, Plaintiff contends the Section 998 offer was not reasonable at the
time it was made. 
 
A pretrial settlement offer under Section 998 must be valid,
reasonable, and made in good faith. When a Section 998 offer is found to be
valid, the burden shifts to the offeree to demonstrate the offer was
unreasonable or was not made in good faith. (Smalley v. Subaru of America,
Inc. (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 450, 458 (Smalley).) “If the actual
judgment is more favorable to the offeror than was the offer, it is prima facie
evidence of the offer's reasonableness.” (Id.) “Whether an offer is made
in good faith is based on whether, at the time it was made, it carried a
reasonable prospect of acceptance by the offeree.” (Id. at 459.) In
determining whether a Section 998 offer had a reasonable prospect of
acceptance, the Court must consider: (1) if the Section 998 offer was within
the “range of possible results” at trial, considering all of the information
the offeror knew or reasonably should have known and (2) if the offeror knew
that the offeree had sufficient information, based on what the offeree knew or
reasonably should have known, to assess whether the offer was reasonable such
that the offeree had a fair opportunity to intelligently evaluate the Section
998 offer. (See Licudine v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2019) 30
Cal.App.5th 918, 924–925 (Licudine).)
 
Like in Smalley, the actual judgment in this case was
more favorable to Defendant than her Section 998 offer. Defendant’s Section 998
Offer was for $60,000.00. After trial, the jury awarded Plaintiff  $6,000.00. This constitutes prima facie
evidence that Defendant’s Section 998 offer was reasonable. 
 
Thus, the burden now shifts to Plaintiff to show that the
Section 998 offer was unreasonable. To meet this burden, Plaintiff must
establish that he did not have sufficient information and time to evaluate the
Section 998 offer when it was made. In Licudine, the court held that “In
assessing whether the 998 offeror knew that the offeree had sufficient
information to evaluate the offer (the second consideration), the offeree needs
information bearing on the issue of liability as well as on the amount of
damages because these are the issues upon which a verdict would rest and
because the 998 offer, if accepted, would be in lieu of that verdict.” (Licudine,
supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at 925.) As a matter of public policy, “ ‘Section 998
must be strictly construed in favor of the party sought to be subjected to its
operation.’ ” (Oakes v. Progressive Transportation Services, Inc. (2021)
71 Cal.App.5th 486, 501.)
 
The Court finds that Defendant’s Section 998 offer was
reasonable for the following reasons: 
 
The Section 998 Offer was made approximately thirteen (13) months
after commencement of the lawsuit, so it was not a premature offer to
compromise. Furthermore, the parties had already engaged in initial discovery
as Plaintiff had already provided initial responses to discovery propounded by
Defendant including information about his purported medical expenses/special
damages. Similarly, Plaintiff had made his own Section 998 offer prior to
receiving one from Defendant. Likewise, Plaintiff does not contend he had insufficient
time to review the Section 998 offer submitted by Defendant.  Plaintiff herself made an offer to settle the
case for $100,000, not significantly more than the offer which plaintiff now
contends was unreasonable and made in bad faith.  
 
On the other hand, Plaintiff appears to argue that the
Section 998 offer was less than his claimed medical expenses of $76,335.85,
which he disclosed via his initial discovery responses. Moreover, Plaintiff
asserts the section 998 offer was less than Defendant’s policy limit of
$100,000.00, which he stated in his own Section 998 offer was reasonable due to
him undergoing recommended surgery and ongoing complaints from the collision. Additionally,
Plaintiff contends Defendant’s counsel withheld she was in possession of
findings from her biomedical expert on September 24, 2020. Plaintiff asserts
the findings from Defendant’s expert is pertinent information that would have
given him pause to contemplate the Section 998 Offer. Nonetheless, Plaintiff
should have known that Defendant would retain an expert in this case to address
the issue of liability. Also, there is no indication that Plaintiff sought
discovery responses from Defendant, which would have possibly lead to the discovery
of Defendant’s expert witness findings. Finally, Plaintiff was at least aware
that Defendant denied liability due to the filing of her Answer to the
Complaint.  
 
Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to show that he lacked
sufficient information to evaluate the issue of liability and amount of damages
such that the Section 998 offer was unreasonable. 
 
Entitlement
to Costs 
 
Alternatively, Plaintiff moves to
tax the service of process fee ($4,010.45), expert fees ($110,139.00), court
reporter fees as established by statute ($702.50), and models, enlargements,
and photocopies of exhibits ($1,298.89) on the grounds that they are
unauthorized and/or unreasonable or unnecessary. 
 
Here, the service of process
fees, court reporter fees as established by statute, and models, enlargements,
and photocopies of exhibits are expressly authorized per Code of Civil
Procedure Section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(4), (a)(11), (a)(13), respectively.  Likewise, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
Section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(5)(A), expert fees are allowable for Section
998 offers. As such, the claimed costs appear to be proper and the burden is on
Plaintiff to show they were not reasonably incurred. 
 
As to the service of process
fees, court reporter fees, and expert fees Plaintiff merely argues Defendant
provides no documentation to show when these charges were incurred, their
necessity, and/or reasonableness. However, a verified MOC is prima facie evidence that the claimed costs are reasonably
incurred. (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1700(a)(1).) With respect to Expert Kenneth
Solomon Plaintiff contends he was retained and much of his work completed prior
to the Section 998 offer. Defendant did submit invoices showing all experts
fees with the exception of Dr. Solomon was used after the Section 998 offer but
reduces the amount requested to $17,767.00 due to incurring less than the
amount requested in the MOC and acknowledging Dr. Solomon was used for services
prior to the Section 998 offer. Similarly, Defendant provided invoices
supporting its claim for costs of 
models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits. By contrast,
Defendant withdrew the request for court reporter fees seemingly acknowledging
that it was seeking transcripts of the proceedings which were not ordered by
the court as raised by Plaintiff’s motion. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff Zoilo Doran-Hernandez’s Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED
in part as to the expert witness fees and court reporter fees, and DENIED in
part as to the service of process and models, enlargements, and photocopies of
exhibits.
