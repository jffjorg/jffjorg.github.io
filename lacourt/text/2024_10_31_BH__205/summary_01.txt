And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Respondent's motion to seal various documents filed in connection with the discovery motion. The documents sought to be sealed include bank account details, financial statements, and confidential business information. The judge found that there is no public right of access to the documents, as they were filed in connection with a discovery motion. The court's decision is based on the "sealed records rule" which codifies the balancing test articulated by the Supreme Court in NBC Subsidiary, Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178. The judge concludes that the documents must remain under seal to protect Respondent's confidential business information and financial records.
