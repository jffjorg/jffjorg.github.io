  Case Number:  23SMCP00651    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2024    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   EDEN REFORESTRATION PROJECTS, et al.  Petitioners, v.  ASPIRATION PARTNERS, INC., et al.,   Respondents.    Case No.:  23SMCP00651     Hearing Date:  October 31, 2024   [TENTATIVE] order RE:   respondent’s MOTIONs to seal    portions of filings relating to    motion for order to show cause    re: contempt         BACKGROUND    This case arises from a dispute over a settlement agreement.  The signatories to the settlement agreement were Petitioners Eden Reforestation Projects and its wholly owned subsidiary Compassionate Carbon on the one hand, and Respondents Aspiration Partners, Inc. and Aspiration Inc. on the other.  A dispute arose over the settlement agreement.  The settlement agreement provided for the resolution of disputes “arising from or relating to” it by JAMS arbitration.   Petitioners commenced an arbitration of the dispute by filing a demand with JAMS.  The Hon. Kirk H. Nakamura (Ret.) was appointed as the arbitrator.  Petitioners filed a motion for summary judgment, which the Arbitrator granted.  (See Attachment 8(c) to Petition.)   The Arbitrator concluded that (1) Respondents breached the Settlement Agreement by not making a $1,000,000 settlement payment, (2) Respondents repudiated the Settlement Agreement and thereby anticipatorily breached the Settlement Agreement, and $1,376,271.19 is the discounted accelerated payment sum due under the Settlement Agreement, (3) the $1,000,000 past due sum is a sum certain and thus Petitioners are entitled to prejudgment interest on that sum which totals $10,958.90, and (4) Respondents are liable for all arbitration costs.  (Id.)  The Arbitrator also granted judgment in favor of Petitioners on their declaratory relief claim.  (Id.) On December 15, 2023, the Arbitrator issued the Award, and JAMS served the Award on the parties on December 5, 2023.  No request to correct the Award was made by any party.   On January 29, 2024, the Court confirmed the arbitration award.  The Court issued judgment in favor of Petitioners and against Respondents (the “Judgment”), including a monetary award.   In aid of its collection efforts, Petitioners sought an order for Respondents to appear for a debtor’s examination.  Petitioners sought Respondents’ appearance through Respondents’ C.E.O., Edwin (Tate) Mill.  The Court issued an order for Mr. Mill to appear for examination.   In connection with the ordered examination, Petitioners issued a subpoena duces tecum for Mr. Mill to bring documents to the examination (the “Subpoena”).  The Subpoena seeks documents relating to Respondents’ assets.   Petitioners moved for an order to show cause re: contempt.  Petitioners argue that Mr. Mill has failed to produce documents, based on references in produced documents to other existing unproduced documents and based on Mr. Mill’s own testimony.   Respondent now seeks to seal documents submitted in connection with Petitioners’ motion for contempt and reply papers.  Respondent requests that this information be sealed because it includes documents related to two general categories of commercially sensitive information: (1) information regarding its finances, including financial statements, bank records and testimony regarding its financial affairs and business operations, and (2) its dealings with business partners, including business development strategies and non-public details regarding its agreements with these parties, including deal structures and pricing.  Respondent argues these documents were filed in conjunction with a discovery motion, and there is no right to public access to records filed or lodged in connection with discovery motions or proceedings.  Alternatively, if there is a right of public access, Respondent’s overriding interest in keeping its financial records and deals with third parties confidential exceeds the right of public access; there is a substantial probability of prejudice absent sealing; the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored, and no less restrictive means exists to achieve this overriding interest.  Petitioners filed a notice of non-opposition to the motions to seal.   LEGAL STANDARD  The “sealed records rule” (effective 2001) codifies the balancing test articulated by the Supreme Court in¿NBC Subsidiary¿(KNBC-TV),¿Inc. v. Superior Court¿(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178. It provides that documents used as a basis of adjudication cannot be withheld from the public under the First Amendment without first obtaining a court¿order to file under¿seal, and that “court must not permit a record to be filed under¿seal¿based solely on the agreement or stipulation of the parties.”¿ (Cal. Rules of Court rule 2.551(a).) The¿sealed¿records rules do not apply to discovery proceedings.  (See¿NBC Subsidiary, 20 Cal.4th at 1208-1209, fn. 25;¿Mercury Interactive Corp. v. Klein¿(2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 60, 100.  “The public has a First Amendment right of access to civil litigation documents filed in court and used at trial or submitted as a basis for adjudication. Substantive courtroom proceedings in ordinary civil cases, and the transcripts and records pertaining to these proceedings, are presumptively open.”  (NBC Subsidiary, 20 Cal.4th at 1208-1209.) ¿However, there is no right of public access to discovery materials filed or lodged in court in connection with discovery motions or proceedings (e.g., privileged material lodged in opposition to motion to compel).¿ (Mercury Interactive Corp., 158 CA4th at 100-101.)¿ The sealed records rule’s presumption of public access applies to court-filed¿discovery materials used at trial or submitted as a basis for adjudication of matters other than discovery motions or proceedings.¿ (Id.)  Discovery materials “submitted as a basis for adjudication” refers to materials submitted in support of and in opposition to substantive pretrial motions, regardless of whether those materials play any role in the trial court’s ultimate ruling on the motion.¿ (Overstock.Com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.¿(2014) 231 CA4th 471, 496.) DISCUSSION Respondent seeks to have various documents filed under seal.  The documents were filed in connection with a discovery motion -- a motion for contempt sanctions and a reply thereto.  Petitioners’ motion argues that Mr. Mill should be subject to a contempt sanction because, though he did produce some documents, his production was insufficient.  This is undeniably a discovery motion.  Accordingly, there is no public right of access to the documents, and the Court need not engage in a balancing test to seal the materials.    CONCLUSION   For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Respondent’s motions to seal.  The following will remain under seal: Mill Motion at p. 3:13 (assets), p. 10:19-25 (assets)  Hosie Declaration at ¶ 9, p. 3:20 (private residential address); ¶ 25(a): p. 11:14 (assets), p. 11:16-22 (assets), p. 12:2 (assets); ¶ 25(b): p. 13:2-4 (debt obligations, confidential negotiations with third parties), p. 13:18 (debt obligations, confidential negotiations with third parties); ¶ 25(c): p. 13:28-14:8 (confidential agreement with third party), p. 14:16-20 (confidential agreement with third party); ¶ 25(d): p. 16:2-3 (assets), p. 16:7-11 (confidential agreement with third party); ¶ 25(e): pp. 16:27-17:8 (confidential agreement with third parties) p. 17:16-23 (confidential agreement with third party); ¶ 25(h): p. 20:6-7 (assets); ¶ 25(i): p. 20:10-11 (assets); ¶ 25(m): p. 21:10-17 (confidential business strategy); ¶ 25(o): p. 22:10-13 (bank account details), p. 22:24-23:6 (bank account details) p. 23:25-28 (bank account details); ¶ 25(p): pp. 23:15-24:4 (confidential business strategy); ¶ 25(q): p. 24:14-25 (fundraising, private bank accounts), p. 25:1-11 (fundraising, confidential business strategy); ¶ 27: p. 26:13-24 (fundraising, confidential business strategy); ¶ 30: p. 28:20-25 (assets)  Ex.
