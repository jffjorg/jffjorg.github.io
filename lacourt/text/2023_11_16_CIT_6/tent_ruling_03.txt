 Case Number:  23PSCV01496    Hearing Date:   November 16, 2023    Dept:  6 CASE NAME:  WCS  Restoration, LLC v. Jing Xiao Defendant Jing  Xiao’s Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint  TENTATIVE  RULING The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend as to  the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Causes of Action in the First Amended  Complaint.  BACKGROUND This is a breach of contract case.  On May 17, 2023, Plaintiff WCS Restoration, LLC filed a complaint against  Defendant Jing Xiao (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 10. On July 10, 2023, Defendant  filed a demurrer to the complaint, which was set for a hearing on August 29,  2023.  On August 11, 2023, the Court  continued the hearing on Defendant’s demurrer from August 29, 2023 to September  27, 2023.  On September 13, 2023, Plaintiff West  Coast Consulting Services LLC dba WCS Restoration LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed the  operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging causes of action for breach  of contract, open book account, account stated, and quantum meruit.                  On October 17, 2023, Defendant filed the instant demurrer to the  FAC as to each cause of action in the FAC. No opposition has been filed. Any  opposition was required to have been filed and served at least nine court days  prior to the hearing pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure,  Section 1005(b). Given that the demurrer is unopposed, there is an inference  that it is meritorious. (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th  1403, 1410.)  LEGAL  STANDARD A  demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other  pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or  content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10; see Donabedian  v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the  function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and  for purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are  assumed to be true. (Id.)   A  demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the  pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially  noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian,  supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be  considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,  881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting  demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co.  (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal  v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider  contents of release not part of court record].)  A  demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete  or discloses some defense that would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc.  v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of  the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are  incorporated by reference into the complaint; or in a  superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189  Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90  Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and  accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the  pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”]).   A  demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner  v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of  Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108  Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed  where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended  successfully. (Id.) If there is any reasonable possibility that the  plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer  without leave to amend. (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70  Cal.2d 240, 245.)     REQUEST FOR  JUDICIAL NOTICE             The Court DENIES  Defendant’s request for judicial notice as to Exhibits A and B. (Evid. Code §  452, subds. (g) and (h).) Defendant has not provided any foundation to show that the records are laws,  resolutions, certified records or acts under Evidence Code sections 452(a), (b)  or (c). Moreover, the court will not take judicial notice of the outcome of an  online search to establish that Plaintiff does not hold a contractor license. California  law does not allow for judicial notice of such matters. (See Jolley v. Chase  Home Finance, LLC (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872, 888-889.)MEET AND CONFER Per Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41,  subdivision (a), the parties were required to meet and confer in person or by  telephone before bringing this demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.  (a).) It is unclear to the Court if counsel for Defendant complied with this  requirement, as the supporting declaration demonstrates that counsel only  communicated on the issues raised in the demurrer via email/letter. (Tatone  Decl., ¶ 8.) Nevertheless, the Court may not overrule a demurrer for failure to  adequately meet and confer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(4).) The  Court will still consider the demurrer but reminds the parties of the need to  comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure.  DISCUSSION             Failure  to File a Fictitious Business Name Statement Defendant contends that the entire FAC is subject to demurrer  because Plaintiff cannot maintain any action upon contract until its fictitious  business name statement has been executed, filed, and published.  “Every person who regularly transacts business in this state for  profit under a fictitious business name shall do all of the following: (a) File  a fictious business name statement in accordance with this chapter not later  than 40 days from the time registrant commences to transact such a new  business. (b) File a new statement after any change in the facts, in accordance  with subdivision (b) of Section 17920. (c) File a new statement when refilling  a fictitious business name statement.” (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17910, subds.  (a)-(c).)  “No person transacting business under a fictitious business name  contrary to the provisions of this chapter, or his assignee, may maintain any  action upon or on account of any contract made, or transaction had, in the  fictitious business name in any court of this state until the fictitious  business name statement has been executed, filed, and published as required by  this chapter. For the purposes of this section, the failure to comply with  subdivision (b) of Section 17917 does not constitute transacting business  contrary to the provisions of this chapter.” (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17918.)  A plaintiff that has not complied with the fictitious business name  filing requirements lacks the capacity to sue in actions on contracts made in  the fictitious name. (See American Alternative Energy Partners II v.  Windridge, Inc. (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 551, 562; Bus. & Prof. Code §  17918.) "Lack of capacity is disclosed. .. where the complaint shows that  an organization does business under a fictitious name but fails to go further  and allege compliance with the fictitious name statute." (5 Witkin, Cal.  Proc. (6th ed. 2022) Pleading §§ 969, 1176; see Pleaters' & Stitchers'  Ass'n v. Davis (1934) 140 Cal.App. 403, 406 [finding that trial court  properly sustained demurrer where "[t]he complaint shows upon its face  that the plaintiff is a voluntary association doing business under a fictitious  name, but, as to whether or not it had filed the certificate required. .. the  record is silent"].)  Here, the FAC alleges that “Plaintiff WEST COAST CONSULTING  SERVICES LLC DBA WCS RESTORATION LLC is, and at all times herein mentioned was,  a California limited liability company, qualified to do business in  California.” (FAC, ¶ 1.) The FAC is based on a purported breach of contract. (Id.,  ¶¶ 5-9.) The FAC, however, contains no allegation that a fictitious business  name statement has been executed, filed, and published. The FAC is therefore  insufficient to show that Plaintiff has standing to maintain this action.  Accordingly, the demurrer is sustained with leave to amend as to  all four causes of action in the FAC.  Unlicensed Contractor Defendant also contends that the entire FAC is subject to demurrer  because Plaintiff cannot maintain any action for the collection of compensation  for work performed because Plaintiff was not a licensed contractor. (See Bus.  & Prof. Code § 7031(a).)  "The plain meaning of the subdivision (a) provision in  section 7031, as construed by our Supreme Court, is 'that, except as expressly  otherwise provided, a contractor may not sue to collect compensation for  performance of 'any act or contract' requiring a license without alleging that  he or she was duly licensed 'at all times during the performance of that act or  contract.'" (Kim v. TWA Construction, Inc. (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th  808, 826 [citing MW Erectors, Inc. v. Niederhauser Ornamental & Metal  Works Co., Inc. (2005) 36 Cal.4th 412, 425].).) The California Supreme  Court has construed section 7031(a) as imposing a complete bar to any recovery  of compensation for unlicensed work ‘by specifying that a contractor is barred  from all recovery for such an 'act or contract' if unlicensed at any time while  performing it.'’ (MW Erectors, Inc., supra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 426.)  Here, Plaintiff has not filed any opposition and a review of  Exhibit A to the FAC seems to indicate that the work performed would require a  contractor’s license. The Court denies the Request for Judicial Notice and does  not make any finding as to whether or not Plaintiff was a licensed contractor.  However, the FAC does not allege that Plaintiff was a licensed contractor.  Thus, the FAC fails to allege sufficient facts to show that Plaintiff has standing  to maintain this action.  Although the Court can sustain the demurrer solely based on the  lack of standing, the Court will still assess the sufficiency of each cause of  action in the FAC to provide guidance to the parties in the event Plaintiff can  properly plead standing.              First Cause of Action             “To prevail on a cause of action for  breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2) the  plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the  defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff.” (Richman  v. Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.) “Ordinarily, a written  contract is sufficiently pleaded if it is set out in full or its terms are  alleged according to their legal effect.” (Hayter Trucking, Inc. v. Shell  Western E&P, Inc. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1, 18.) “In some cases, a  written contract is pleaded by attachment and incorporation in a complaint.” (Id.)              Here, the first cause of action for  breach of contract incorporates the purported contract as Exhibit A to the FAC.  (FAC, ¶ 5.) Plaintiff alleges that “on or about August 08, 2021, a written  agreement was made between Plaintiff and Defendants . . . [and] [b]y the terms  of said agreement, Plaintiff provided services and/or goods to Defendants.”  (FAC, ¶ 5.) Defendant demurs on the ground that Exhibit A does not reflect that  Defendant signed any contract for services and/or goods or to pay for all  services and/or goods.” The Court does not agree. The allegations of the FAC  are taken as true for purposes of the Demurrer and the FAC alleges that the  parties entered into a written agreement. While there are portions of the alleged  agreement that are not signed, there are also portions that appear to reflect a  signature and possibly initials of Jing Xiao. The Court finds that the FAC  would allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action for breach of contract  at this stage of the proceedings.              However, due to the lack of standing  discussed above, the demurrer to the first cause of action in the FAC is  SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amend.  Second  and Third Causes of Action             “A common count is not a specific cause of action,  however; rather it is a simplified form of pleading normally used to aver the  existence of various forms of monetary indebtedness, including that arising  from an alleged duty to make restitution under an assumpsit theory.” (McBride  v. Boughton (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 379, 394.) “When a common count is used  as an alternative way of seeking the same recovery demanded in a specific cause  of action, and is based on the same facts, the common count is demurrable if  the cause of action is demurrable.” (Ibid.)              Here, Defendant contends that the second and third causes  of action are based on the same facts as the first cause of action and seek the  same recovery as the first cause of action (FAC, ¶¶ 10-15) and are also  demurrable due to the absence of a valid written agreement (Dem., pp.  11:20-12:9). Since the Court found that Plaintiff alleged sufficient facts to establish  a claim for breach of contract based on a written agreement, the demurrer would  not be sustained on these grounds.              However, due to the lack of standing  discussed above, the demurrer to the second and third causes of action in the  FAC is SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amend.              Fourth Cause of Action             Defendant demurs to the fourth cause of action for  quantum meruit solely on the ground that such cause of action is subject to  demurrer if the court finds that a valid written agreement exists. (Dem. p  12:10-17.) However, this determination is not proper at the pleading stage as  the court is not determining the validity of any agreement only if sufficient facts  have been pled.  Moreover,  Defendant fails to cite any binding California authority to support his  contention and the federal case cited, DPR Constr. v. Shire Regenerative  Med., Inc. (2016) 204 F. Supp. 3d 1118, 1130-1131, decided a motion for summary  judgment, not a demurrer. Defendant does not cite any authority preventing  Plaintiff from alleging alternative theories of liability. Thus, the demurrer  would not be sustained on these grounds.              However, due to the lack of standing  discussed above, the demurrer to the fourth cause of action in the FAC is  SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amend.  CONCLUSION             The demurrer of  Defendant to the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action in the FAC  is SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amend.    Defendant is ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within  five calendar days of this order.
