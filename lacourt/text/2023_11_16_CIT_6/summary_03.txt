Here is a summary in English:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Jing Xiao to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff WCS Restoration, LLC. The Judge sustains the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend as to the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action in the FAC.

The Judge finds that the FAC would allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action for breach of contract at this stage of the proceedings. However, the Judge sustains the demurrer to the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action in the FAC due to the lack of standing.

The Judge also finds that the FAC does not allege sufficient facts to show that Plaintiff has standing to maintain this action, citing California law and case authority. The Judge denies the request for judicial notice of Exhibits A and B and notes that the Court will not take judicial notice of the outcome of an online search to establish that Plaintiff does not hold a contractor license.

The Judge reminds the parties of the need to comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure and to file a response to the demurrer within 20 days.
