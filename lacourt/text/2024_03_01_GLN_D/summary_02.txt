And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of DeCastro, et al. v. Gasparyan, et al. The case involves a dispute over the purchase of a hospice care business and allegations of fraud and misrepresentation. The court has granted the plaintiffs' motions to compel further responses to written discovery, and has awarded sanctions against the defendant for his untimely opposition to the motions.

The court found that the defendant's responses to the discovery requests were incomplete and inadequate, and that he had failed to provide reasonable explanations for the delays in responding. The court also found that the defendant's opposition to the motions was untimely and that he had not demonstrated substantial justification for the delays.

As a result, the court has awarded sanctions in the amount of $2,000 to the plaintiffs for the motion to compel further responses to the form interrogatories, $800 for the motion to compel further responses to the special interrogatories, and $800 for the motion to compel further responses to the requests for admissions. The court has also ordered the defendant to pay the filing fee for the motions.

The court has also cautioned the defendant that in the future, he must comply with the applicable rules, statutes, and deadlines for filing papers. The court has given the parties an opportunity to review and comment on the tentative ruling, and has set a hearing date for March 1, 2024.
