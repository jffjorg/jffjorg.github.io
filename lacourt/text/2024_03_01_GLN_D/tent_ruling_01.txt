Greystar Real Estate Partners, LLC, et al.DISCOVERY MOTIONS (4 Motions) Moving Party:  Defendant Greystar Real Estate Partners, LLC   Responding Party: Plaintiff Sashile Wood (No Opposition)  RELIEF REQUESTED:Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One  Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One Responses to Request for Production, Set One   Order Deeming Requests for Admissions, Set One, Admitted CHRONOLOGYDate Discovery served:     August 4, 2023   Extensions of time to respond until:   October 13, 2023 (Ex. D)  Date Responses served:  NO RESPONSES SERVED  Date Motion served:   October 26, 2023   Timely OPPOSITION:  No opposition.   ANALYSIS:Interrogatories and DocumentsUnder CCP § 2030.290, “If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,” that party “waives any legal right to exercise the option to produce writings...as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product...”  Under subdivision (b), “The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.”  CCP §2031.300 contains similar provisions with respect to requests to produce documents.In this case, interrogatories and document production demands have been directed to plaintiff and plaintiff has failed to serve timely responses.  Defendant has appropriately moved for orders to compel.  Accordingly, plaintiff has waived the option to produce writings, as well as all objections, and will be ordered to respond.  Requests for AdmissionsUnder CCP § 2033.280, a party who fails to serve a timely response to requests for admissions “waives any objection to the requests….”   In addition, the requesting party may move for an order that “the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction....”   CCP § 2033.280(b).  The Code specifies that “The court shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admissions have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the request for admissions that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  CCP § 2033.280(c).   In this case, requests for admissions were served on plaintiff on August 4, 2023.  Moving defendant extended extensions of time to respond to October 13, 2023.  [Exs. C-D].  Plaintiff did not request or obtain any further extension.  No responses have been served.  Plaintiff failed to serve timely responses and has therefore waived all objections.  Defendant has filed a noticed motion requesting an order that the requests be deemed admitted as truth.  Unless verified responses that are in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220 are served before the hearing, the court must grant the motion.SanctionsWith respect to Requests for Admissions, CCP § 2033.280(c) provides: “It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admissions necessitated this motion.”With respect to interrogatories, under CCP § 2030.290(c), “The court shall impose a monetary sanction… against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  A similar provision applies to document demands.  See CCP § 2031.300(c).CCP § 2023.010 provides that misuse of the discovery process includes “(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where there has been such conduct, under CCP § 2023.030(a), “The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct....If a monetary sanction is authorized” by the statute, “ the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that the other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” CCP § 2023.030(a).  Under CRC Rule 3.1348(a): “The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.”The burden is on the party subject to sanctions to show substantial justification or injustice.  Mattco Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young & Co. (1990, 2nd Dist.) 223 Cal.App.3d 1429, 1436.  In this case, plaintiff has failed to respond to authorized methods of discovery and defendant has submitted evidence that defendant has incurred expenses as a result of the conduct. Since the motions are unopposed, there is no evidence that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust.  Defendant requests $1,021.25 each for the motions in connection with form and special interrogatories and document demands, and $1,075 for the motion to deem Requests for Admissions admitted. The sanctions sought include two hours at $215 per hour to prepare replies, when there are no oppositions, so the replies should be brief.  The sanctions also include one hour in each motion to prepare for and attend the hearing, when all four motions will be heard together.  The sanctions are reduced accordingly as follows: 3 hours for each motion due to lack of opposition and 1 hour added to one motion for appearance time at hearing. RULING:[No opposition]Defendant Greystar Real Estate
