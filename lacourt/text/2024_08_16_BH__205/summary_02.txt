Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiffs' motion to set aside the dismissal of their complaint. The Plaintiffs were involved in a traffic accident caused by the negligence of the Defendants and filed a lawsuit claiming negligence, gross negligence, negligence per se, and willful misconduct/battery. However, the Plaintiffs failed to appear at two hearings, which resulted in the dismissal of the complaint. The Plaintiffs' counsel claimed that the failure to appear was due to technical difficulties with the Court's remote appearance system and a calendaring mistake. The Court has determined that the Plaintiffs' failure to appear was excusable neglect and has granted the motion to set aside the dismissal. The action is reinstated, and a case management conference has been set for September 24, 2024.
