And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendants. The plaintiff, Yosi Yahoudai, had entered into a written contract with the defendants, Craftscape Creations, LLC, CraftScape Designs, LLC, Designs by CraftScape, LLC, and Stylarc, to provide remodeling and reconstruction services for his new backyard. However, the defendants misrepresented the timeline of the project completion and ceased operations, heading towards bankruptcy. Yahoudai paid the defendants a total of $145,392, but they failed to complete the project.

The plaintiff filed a complaint and served the defendants with the complaint. The defendants failed to respond, and the plaintiff requested entry of default and default judgment. The court has granted the plaintiff's request for default judgment, awarding damages in the amount of $157,127.45.

However, the court denied the plaintiff's request for $3,343.92 in attorneys' fees, as Yahoudai is representing himself in this action and is not entitled to recover attorneys' fees under California Civil Code, § 1717.
