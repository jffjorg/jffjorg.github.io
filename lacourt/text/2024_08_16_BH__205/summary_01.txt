```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on GTP's demurrer to the complaint. The Court has determined that GTP does not owe a duty to the plaintiffs based on the facts alleged. The plaintiffs allege that GTP breached its lease agreement with Global Tower Assets Inc. by allowing Starry to install equipment on the rooftop, which caused them physical harm. However, the Court found that the plaintiffs did not allege facts to support a finding of duty, and that GTP did not have a special relationship with the plaintiffs. The Court also considered the Rowland factors, which weigh in favor of limiting any duty of care to the plaintiffs. As a result, the Court sustains GTP's demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend.
