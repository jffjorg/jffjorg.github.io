 Case Number:  23SMCV05724    Hearing Date:   August 16, 2024    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205  J. SCOTT RUNIA, et al.,   Plaintiffs, v.  ARTYOM POGHOSYAN, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  23SMCV05724     Hearing Date:  August 16, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO    SET ASIDE DISMISSAL    BACKGROUND This case arises from a traffic accident.  Plaintiffs J. Scott Runia and Melody Hagedorn were driving home from dinner when their car was struck by Defendants Artyom Poghosyan, Victoria Pinchasov and Suren Khandanyan’s car.  Plaintiffs allege they had completed a lane change when their car was struck by Defendants’ car which was attempting to change into the same lane.  Plaintiffs allege Poghosyan was driving at an unsafe speed and on the wrong side of the road and made an unsafe lane change.   The first amended complaint (“FAC”) alleges claims for (1) negligence, (2) gross negligence, (3) negligence per se and (4) willful misconduct/battery.   Defendants demurred and moved to strike the FAC.  On May 30, 2024, the Court held a hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike as well as a case management conference (“CMC”) (“Hearing No. 1”).  Plaintiffs’ counsel claims he appeared telephonically at Hearing No. 1, but due to technical difficulties with the LA Court Connect system, he was unable to hear the clerk, the Court or the opposing party.  The Court set an OSC re sanctions for Plaintiffs’ failure to appear at Hearing No. 1, for July 1, 2024 (“Hearing No. 2”).  Plaintiffs then failed to appear at Hearing No. 2, resulting in the Court’s dismissal of the complaint without prejudice, for Plaintiffs’ repeated failures to appear.  Counsel claims he did not attend Hearing No. 2 due to a calendaring mistake.     This hearing is on Plaintiffs’ motion to vacate the dismissal.  Plaintiffs seek relief from the dismissal because counsel failed to add Hearing No. 2 to his calendar.  Counsel also claims he was inundated with work in addition to having a “near-death experience” on June 30, 2024.    LEGAL STANDARD Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §473(b), both discretionary and mandatory relief are available to parties when a case is dismissed.  Discretionary relief is available under the statute as “the court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 473(b).)  Alternatively, mandatory relief is available when “accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.”  (Id.)  The purpose of the attorney affidavit provision is to “relieve the innocent client of the burden of the attorney’s fault, to impose the burden on the erring attorney, and to avoid precipitating more litigation in the form of malpractice suits.”  (Hu v. Fang (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 61, 64.)  Mandatory relief is available even if counsel’s neglect was inexcusable.  (SJP Limited Partnership v. City of Los Angeles (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 511, 516–517.)   An application for discretionary or mandatory relief must be made no more than six months after entry of the judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding from which relief is sought.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) “[W]hen relief under section 473¿is¿available, there is a strong¿public¿policy¿in¿favor¿of granting relief and allowing the requesting party his or her day in court[.]” (Rappleyea v. Campbell¿(1994) 8 Cal. 4th 975, 981-82.)  Any doubt in applying section 473, subdivision (b), must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief.  (Bonzer v. City of Huntington Park (1993) 20 Cal. App. 4th 1474,¿1477-1478.)   Where relief is promptly sought and no prejudice would be done to the opposing party, only very slight evidence is required to justify the setting¿aside of a default.  For this reason, orders denying relief under section 473 are carefully scrutinized on appeal. (¿Rappleyea v. Campbell¿(1994) 8 Cal..4th 975, 980;¿Elston v. City of Turlock¿(1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 233.) DISCUSSION The mandatory relief provision of §473(b) refers to both “default judgment or dismissal”.  The inclusion of “dismissal” by the Legislature was intended to “put plaintiffs whose cases are dismissed for failing to respond to a dismissal motion on the same footing with defendants who are defaulted for failing to respond to an action.”  (Jackson v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Inc. (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 166, 175.).   However, although the language of the mandatory provision, on its face, affords relief from unspecified ‘dismissals’ caused by attorney neglect, “our courts have, through judicial construction, prevented it from being used indiscriminately by plaintiffs’ attorneys as a ‘perfect escape hatch’ to undo dismissals of civil cases.”  (Nacimiento Regional Water Management Advisory Committee v. Monterey County Water Resources Agency (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 961, 967.)   Courts have construed the provision as reaching only dismissals that are “procedurally equivalent to a default.”  (Jackson, 32 Cal.App.4th at 174.)  Dismissals that are sufficiently distinct from a default, thereby falling outside the scope of the mandatory provision, include “dismissals for failure to prosecute, dismissals for failure to serve a complaint within three years, dismissals based on running of the statute of limitations and voluntary dismissals entered pursuant to settlement.” (Leader v. Health Industries of America Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603, 620.)   Here, the dismissal was due to Plaintiffs’ repeated failures to appear which constitutes a failure to prosecute.  Accordingly, mandatory relief is not available.   However, the Court concludes discretionary relief is warranted due to technical difficulties relating to Hearing No. 1 and Plaintiffs’ counsel’s calendaring mistake as to Hearing No. 2.  Counsel attests he attended Hearing No. 1 telephonically, but due to technical difficulties with the Court’s remote appearance system, he could not hear the court or the opposing party.  (Runia Decl. ¶7.)  He timely filed a declaration with the Court explaining his failure to appear at Hearing No. 1.  (Ex. F to Runia Decl.)   As to Hearing No. 2, counsel attests he was inundated with work and forgot to add the hearing to his calendar.  (Runia Decl. ¶¶ 10-11.)  Calendaring errors can constitute excusable neglect.  (Comunidad en Accion v. Los Angeles City Council (2013) 219 Cal.App. 4th 1116, 1132-1135 (failing to calendar date on litigation calendar was excusable neglect); Bouvett v. Layer¿(1940) 40 Cal.App.2d 43, 47¿(court properly granted relief pursuant to¿Section 473¿where counsel entered wrong date for hearing on motion and this mistake caused counsel to miss hearing).)  The calendaring mistake here appears to be an isolated incident in an otherwise vigorous prosecution of the case.         Moreover, Plaintiffs’ motion to set aside dismissal is timely.  The Court dismissed the action on July 1, 2024, and Plaintiffs promptly filed their motion to set aside on July 9, 2024, within six months of the dismissal.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.)        In sum, given the showing of excusable neglect and the strong policy favoring a resolution of cases on their merits, the Court grants the motion to set aside dismissal.   Plaintiffs also request that the Court “allow the discovery process to continue from where it left off such that Defendants cannot change their initial responses to written discovery and that Plaintiffs’ diligent efforts in drafting a forty-six page meet and confer letter are not for naught.”  Plaintiffs’ request is premature and, in the absence of a clear discovery dispute before the Court, the import and effect of the relief sought is unclear.  Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request concerning the discovery process.     CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion to set aside dismissal.  The action is reinstated.  The Court sets a case management conference for September 24, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.      IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: August 16, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
