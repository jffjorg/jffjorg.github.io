Moreton, Jr. Judge of the Superior Court     Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   DENNIS J. STANKIE,   Plaintiffs, v.  SANTA MONICA BAY WOMAN’S CLUB, et al.,     Defendants.    Case No.:  23STCV16690     Hearing Date:  August 16, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:    PLAINTIFF’S MOTION     FOR LEAVE TO FILE AMENDED     COMPLAINT    BACKGROUND This case arises from an alleged assault.  Plaintiff Dennis Stankie was visiting Defendant Santa Monica Bay Woman’s Club (the “Club”) when he claims an administrator of the Club assaulted him.  The unnamed administrator yelled at Plaintiff to “get out” and then pushed him.   Plaintiff is appearing in pro per and filed a form complaint with four causes of action for (1) general negligence, (2) intentional tort, (3) premises liability, and (4) elder abuse.  Plaintiff then amended the Complaint to substitute Does 1 and 2 with Defendants Becky Upchurch and Peter Abbay.   This hearing is on Plaintiff’s motion for leave to further amend his Complaint to add causes of action for battery, assault, negligent hiring and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Plaintiff argues these causes of action better reflect the merits and theories of the case after receiving discovery from Defendants.   LEGAL STANDARD Code of Civ. Proc. § 473(a)(1), provides, in relevant part: “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer.¿ The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this code.”¿ Under California Rules of Court Rule, Rule 3.1324, subdivision (a),¿a motion to amend a pleading shall:¿ (1) include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments;¿ (2) state what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph and line number, the deleted allegations are located; and¿ (3) state what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the additional allegations are located.¿¿ ¿ In addition, under California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, subdivision (b),¿a¿separate declaration¿must accompany the motion and must specify:¿¿ (1) the effect of the amendment;¿ (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper;¿ (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and¿ (4) the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier.¿ ¿¿ The Court’s discretion to grant leave “should be exercised liberally in favor of amendments, for judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed matters in the same lawsuit.”¿ (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court¿(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.)¿ Ordinarily, the Court will not consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading in ruling on a motion for leave since grounds for a demurrer or motion to strike are premature.¿¿The Court, however, does have discretion to deny leave to amend where a proposed amendment fails to state a valid cause of action as a matter of law and the defect cannot be cured by further amendment.¿ (See¿California Casualty General Ins. Co. v. Superior Court¿(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 281 (overruled on other grounds by¿Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co.¿(2000) 23 Cal.4th 390).)¿¿ DISCUSSION Plaintiff has not filed the declaration required under CRC Rule 3.1324.  There is no declaration identifying the amendments, their effect, and the information that prompted the amendment.  Accordingly, the Court denies the motion for leave to amend.   CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.    IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: August 16, 2024     ___________________________ Edward B.
