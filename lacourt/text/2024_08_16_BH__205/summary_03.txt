English-text summary:
The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Dennis Stankie's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The motion was made without notice to the adverse party and without a declaration as required by California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324. The judge notes that the court's discretion to grant leave to amend should be exercised liberally, but in this case, the plaintiff failed to provide the required declaration and therefore the motion is denied.
