And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute over an oil and gas lease. The plaintiff, Gardena Neighbors LLC, filed a complaint against the defendant, WG Holdings SPC, LLC, et al., alleging causes of action for declaratory relief, breach of lease, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, ejectment, nuisance, and trespass. The defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike certain allegations from the plaintiff's complaint.

The court found that the plaintiff's causes of action that suggest a right under the lease are defective due to the plaintiff's lack of standing. The court also found that the plaintiff failed to provide notice of default as required by the lease, and that the plaintiff's claims are not based on a valid contract.

The court granted the defendant's motion to strike the prayer for attorney's fees, as the plaintiff's complaint does not contain a cause of action that would entitle the plaintiff to recover attorney's fees authorized by law, contract, or statute.

The court denied the defendant's demurrer in part, finding that the plaintiff's declaratory relief, ejectment, nuisance, and trespass causes of action are sufficient to state a claim. The court also granted the defendant's demurrer in part, finding that the plaintiff's contract and implied covenant causes of action are defective.

The court ordered the defendant to give notice of its ruling and scheduled a hearing for oral argument on the issue of whether the lease has terminated on its own, without an event of default.
