And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to vacate a judgment that dismissed a case without prejudice. The plaintiff, Sadrack Ngue Ngue, filed a complaint against CarMax Auto Superstores California, LLC, alleging various causes of action. The defendant filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which was granted by the court. The court also granted the plaintiff 45 days to amend the complaint, but the plaintiff failed to do so. The court then ordered the case dismissed without prejudice.

The plaintiff is now seeking to vacate the judgment, but the motion does not state any legal grounds for doing so. The judge notes that the plaintiff is in pro per and must follow the procedures set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) in order to seek relief. The judge is giving the plaintiff an opportunity to submit a declaration or affidavit attesting to his mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect as to why he failed to file an amended complaint, and to include a proposed amended pleading that addresses the reasons the court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend previously. The hearing is continued to October 21, 2024, to allow the plaintiff to do so.
