COURT’S [TENTATIVE] RULING RE: 
 
MOTION FOR
  LEAVE TO AMEND 



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]:
 
Plaintiffs Jan Weissman and Jan Weissman as Trustee
of the Jan Weissman Revocable Trust Dated July 17, 2022, move for leave to
amend their complaint.
This court grants Plaintiffs’ motion.
 
I.               
BACKGROUND 
 
On April 17,
2023, Plaintiffs Jan Weissman, an individual, and as Trustee of the Jan
Weissman Revocable Trust Dated July 17, 2002 (“Plaintiffs”), filed a complaint
alleging breach of written contract, breach of implied warranty, breach of the
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, financial elder abuse, and
declaratory relief against Defendants Craig Vandagriff Construction, Inc.,
Craig Vandagriff, and Jody Vandagriff (collectively, “Defendants”), Brytin
Construction, AC Interiors, Inc., Vargas Custom Plaster, Inc., American
Plumbing Professionals, and Does 1 to 50.
 
On August 2,
2024, Plaintiffs filed their first motion for leave to amend the complaint. On
August 16, 2024, Defendants filed their opposition. On August 22, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed their reply.
 
On August 29,
2024, this court denied without prejudice Plaintiffs’ first motion for leave to
amend the complaint because Plaintiffs did not comply with California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324. (08/29/24 Minute Order.) Specifically, Plaintiffs failed to
“include the date of discovery and reasons for any delay besides
‘inadvertence.’” (08/29/24 Minute Order p. 3.)
 
On September 10,
2024, Plaintiffs filed their amended motion for leave to amend the complaint
(the “Motion”). On October 2, 2024, Defendants filed their opposition. On
October 8, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their reply.
 
II.            
PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS
 
A
motion for leave to amend a pleading must comply with the procedural
requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, which requires a
supporting declaration to set forth explicitly what allegations are to be added
and where, and explicitly stating what new evidence was discovered warranting
the amendment and why the amendment was not made earlier. The motion must also
include (1) a copy of the proposed and numbered amendment, (2) specifications
by reference to pages and lines the allegations that would be deleted and
added, and (3) a declaration specifying the effect, necessity and propriety of
the amendments, date of discovery and reasons for any delay. (See Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324 (a), (b).)
 
Plaintiffs’
Motion includes a copy of the proposed amended complaint. (Ex. 1.) The Motion
also specifies the proposed changes to the complaint. (Motion pp. 8-9.)
Further, Plaintiffs’ counsel’s declaration specifies the effect of the
amendments, necessity and propriety of the amendments, date of discovery and
reasons for any delay. (Uray Declaration ¶¶ 5, 8-10, 17.)  Accordingly, Plaintiffs complied with
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324.
 
III.          
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Leave
to amend is permitted under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(a) and section 576. The policy favoring amendment and resolving all matters in
the same dispute is “so strong that it is a rare case in which denial of leave
to amend can be justified.” (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184
Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428.) “Although courts are bound to apply a policy of great
liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint at any stage of the
proceedings, up to and including trial [citations], this policy should be
applied only ‘where no prejudice is shown to the adverse party . . ..
[citation]. A different result is indicated ‘where inexcusable delay and
probable prejudice to the opposing party’ is shown. [Citation].” (Magpali v.
Farmers Group (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.) 
 
“Time and
knowledge are important factors to be considered when granting or denying
a¿motion¿to¿amend.” (Stockton v. Ortiz (1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 183, 194.)
“If the¿motion¿to¿amend¿is timely made and the granting of the¿motion¿will not
prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to¿amend¿and
where the refusal also results in a party being deprived of the right to assert
a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious defense, it is not only error
but an abuse of discretion.” (Morgan v. Superior Court of Cal. In and For
Los Angeles County (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) 
 
IV.          
DISCUSSION 
 
Plaintiffs request to amend their
complaint as they are entitled to treble damages that they inadvertently left
out of the complaint. (Motion p. 4; Uyeno Declaration ¶ 5.) Plaintiffs
argue they will suffer prejudice if the Motion is not granted because they
would lose the right to seek damages they are entitled to under Civil Code section
3345. (Uyeno Declaration ¶ 17.) Plaintiffs state that minimal discovery has
been done, the case is not at issue, trial has not been set, there is currently
no discovery cut-off date, and they can conduct discovery on Plaintiffs’ treble
damages claim. (Uyeno Declaration ¶¶ 14-16.)
 
In
support of their Motion, Plaintiffs submit a declaration by their counsel.
(Uyeno Declaration.) Plaintiffs’ counsel’s declaration states that in October
2023, Plaintiffs propounded discovery on Defendants. (Uyeno Declaration ¶ 6.)
Defendants served their responses in January 2024. (Uyeno Declaration ¶ 7.) In
March 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel conducted research on Plaintiffs’ Financial
Elder Abuse claim and discovered Plaintiffs had a right to seek treble damages.
(Uyeno Declaration ¶¶ 8, 10.) Plaintiffs’ counsel states that he met and
conferred with Defendants’ counsel about the issue in April 2024. (Uyeno
Declaration ¶ 12.) When the parties reached no informal resolution, Plaintiffs’
counsel raised the issue with this court at a Trial Setting Conference on June
24, 2024. (Uyeno Declaration ¶ 12.) Plaintiffs subsequently filed the Motion.
 
In
opposition, Defendants argue there is no reasonable excuse for Plaintiffs’
delay because Plaintiffs knew or should have known about the facts necessary to
plead damages under Civil Code section 3345 at the time they filed the
complaint. (Opposition p. 6.) Defendants further argue that Plaintiffs’
original complaint shows Plaintiffs knew about the alleged facts that would
apply to Civil Code section 3345 and Plaintiffs’ proposed first amended
complaint repeats facts plead in the original complaint. (Opposition pp. 6-7.)
Finally, Defendants argue that they will suffer prejudice if Plaintiffs are
permitted to amend their complaint because a substantial amount of time has
passed since Plaintiffs filed the complaint, the case has been at issue since
July 10, 2024, and extensive written discovery has been performed to date.
(Opposition pp. 7-8.)
 
In
reply, Plaintiffs argue Plaintiffs submitted a declaration showing “[w]hen the
facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered” and Defendants
have not shown they would be prejudiced by the amendment. (Reply p. 2.) 
 
Defendants
argue that Plaintiffs knew or should have known about the facts necessary to
seek treble damages when they filed the complaint.  But Plaintiffs have identified why the claim
for treble damages was not included in the original complaint. (Uray
Declaration ¶¶ 8, 10.) 
 
Further,
“it is an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend where the opposing party
[is] not misled or prejudiced by the amendment.” (Kittredge Sports Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048.) This court has broad
discretion to liberally grant leave to amend so long as such amendment does not
prejudice the other party.  Although this
case was filed more than a year ago, no trial date has been set. Further, the
parties have propounded and responded to some written discovery, but there is
no discovery cut-off date set. (Uyeno Declaration ¶ 16.)  Accordingly, this court finds that the
amendment will not prejudice Defendants.
 
V.             
CONCLUSION
¿ 
Accordingly, this court grants the Motion
with ten days to amend.
