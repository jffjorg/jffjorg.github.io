And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend their complaint. The plaintiffs originally filed a complaint alleging breach of written contract, breach of implied warranty, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, financial elder abuse, and declaratory relief. However, they inadvertently left out a claim for treble damages under Civil Code section 3345. The plaintiffs' counsel discovered the right to seek treble damages in March 2024 and filed the motion to amend in September 2024. The defendants opposed the motion, arguing that the plaintiffs should have known about the claim for treble damages at the time they filed the original complaint and that the amendment would prejudice them. The judge found that the amendment would not prejudice the defendants and granted the motion. The plaintiffs have 10 days to amend their complaint.
