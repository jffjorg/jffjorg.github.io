 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
DEMURRER TO THE ANSWER OF FELIX ADALBERTO SANCHEZ 



 
Background
 
This action arises
from a motor vehicle collision that occurred on September 6, 2023. On December 1,
2023, Plaintiffs Mehrdad Farkhan and Aila Farkhan (“Plaintiffs”) filed a
Complaint against Defendants Felix Adalberto Sanchez (“Defendant”) and DOES 1
through 20, inclusive, alleging a cause of action for negligence. 
On February 6,
2024, Defendant filed an Answer to the Complaint, in which Defendant sets forth
15 affirmative defenses. 
On February 13,
2024, Plaintiffs filed a demurrer to the first, second, third, fourth, fifth,
sixth, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth affirmative defenses in
the Answer. On March 27, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition to the demurrer,
to which Plaintiffs replied on March 27, 2024.
Defendant’s sole
argument in opposition to the demurrer is that Plaintiffs failed to meet and
confer in good faith prior to filing the demurrer. 
Meet and Confer 
            Before filing a demurrer, the demurring party
is required to meet and confer “in person, by telephone, or by video conference
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to the demurrer for the
purposes of determining whether an agreement can be reached through a filing of
an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be raised in the
demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)
            The Court finds that the
meet and confer requirement has not been met. The declaration of Plaintiffs’
counsel, Brian Paya (“Paya”), in support of the demurrer does not set forth meet
and confer efforts between the parties. The Court will still assess the merits
of the demurrer since failure to meet and confer does not provide a basis for overruling
the demurrer. However, the Court reminds the parties of the need to comply with
the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
Demurrer Standard
 
            “A party against
whom an answer has been filed may object, by demurrer . . . to the answer” on
the grounds that: “(a) [t]he answer does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a defense” or “(b) [t]he answer is uncertain.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.20, subd. (a)-(b).)
            “[T]he
determination whether an answer states a defense is governed by the same
principles which are applicable in determining if a complaint states a cause of
action.” (South Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725,
732.) “A demurrer reaches only the contents of the pleading and such matters as
may be considered under the doctrine of judicial notice.” (Ibid., internal
quotations omitted.) “[A] demurrer does not . . . admit contentions, deductions
or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading.” (Ibid.) In
assessing a demurrer to the answer, “each so-called defense must be considered
separately without regard to any other defense.” (Id. at p. 733.) An
answer must not set forth mere legal conclusions but must articulate “facts
averred as carefully and with as much detail as the facts which constitute the
cause of action and are alleged in the complaint.” (FPI Development, Inc. v.
Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 384.) 
            “[T]he answer to
a complaint must include [a] statement of any new matter constituting a
defense. The phrase new matter refers to something relied on by a defendant which
is not put in issue by the plaintiff . . . [and] where matters are not
responsive to essential allegations of the complaint, they must be raised in
the answer as new matter.” (Walsh v. West Valley Mission Community College
Dist. (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1532, 1546, emphasis in original.) 
            Although courts
construe pleadings liberally, sufficient facts must be alleged to support the
allegations pled to survive a demurrer. (Rakestraw v. California Physicians'
Serv. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) Where a demurrer is
sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on the party who
filed the pleading subject to demurrer to show the court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Ibid.) 
Analysis
 
            Plaintiffs demur
to the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, twelfth, thirteenth,
fourteenth, and fifteenth affirmative defenses in Defendant’s Answer.
Plaintiffs contend that each of the challenged affirmative defenses fails to
state facts to support the defense or is uncertain. 
            The Court does
not find that the Answer is uncertain because it is not so unclear where
Plaintiffs are not apprised of the issues that must be met. (Bacon v. Wahrhaftig
(1950) 97 Cal.App.2d 599, 605.) Thus, the Court OVERRULES the demurrer of
Plaintiffs to the Answer on the grounds of uncertainty.
            “[T]he primary
function of a pleading is to give the other party notice so that it may prepare
its case.” (Harris v. City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203,
210.) “[A] defect in a pleading that otherwise properly notifies a party cannot
be said to affect substantial rights.” (Ibid.) An affirmative defense is
only required to put a plaintiff on notice of such defense raised in the
answer. (Ibid.) A ruling grounded on the inadequacy of an answer “would
be unfair . . . if the [answer] . . . give[s] notice to the plaintiff[]
of a potentially meritorious defense.” (Jones v. Dutra Construction Co.
(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 871, 876, emphasis in original.)
            The Court has reviewed Defendant’s Answer and the challenged
affirmative defenses set forth therein. The Court finds that each affirmative
defense puts Plaintiffs on notice of such defense. Thus, the Court finds that
the affirmative defenses at issue in the demurrer are not insufficiently articulated
and Plaintiffs can prepare their case. Under Harris v. City of Santa Monica,
supra, 56 Cal.4th 203, 210, the Court finds that the Answer
states sufficient facts to constitute the affirmative defenses set forth
therein. Defendant has described each affirmative defense with sufficient
clarity for Plaintiffs to prepare their case. 
Conclusion
Based on the
foregoing, the Court OVERRULES the demurrer of Plaintiffs to Defendant’s Answer
in its entirety.
