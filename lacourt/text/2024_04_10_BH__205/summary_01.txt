Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees. The plaintiff, Network Experts, Inc., sought attorneys' fees in the amount of $137,666.56 under Civ. Code § 3426.4 and CCP § 1021.5. The court found that the plaintiff was not entitled to attorneys' fees under either statute. The court noted that there was no judicial finding of willful and malicious misappropriation of trade secrets, which is required under Civ. Code § 3426.4. Additionally, the court found that the plaintiff did not establish entitlement to attorneys' fees under CCP § 1021.5 because the action did not result in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest.
