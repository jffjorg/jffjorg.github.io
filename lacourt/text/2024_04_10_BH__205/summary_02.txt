And here is a brief English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the Plaintiffs against the Defendant's Answer. The Plaintiffs contend that the Defendant's affirmative defenses are insufficiently articulated and fail to state facts to support the defense. The Judge finds that the Defendant's Answer does provide sufficient notice to the Plaintiffs of the affirmative defenses raised, and therefore, the demurrer is overruled. The Judge also notes that the meet and confer requirement has not been met, but this failure does not provide a basis for overruling the demurrer. The ruling is tentative and subject to change before the hearing date of April 10, 2024.
