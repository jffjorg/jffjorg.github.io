 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES 



 
Background
 
Plaintiff Network
Experts, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) provides computer sales, consulting, and IT
services to clients throughout southern California. (Complaint, ¶ 14.) On February
23, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendants Beverly Hills IT
Services, Beverly Hills IT, and Mostafa Karabalei Ahmad Baboli aka Stephan
Parsa (“Baboli”) (collectively “Defendants”) and DOES 1 through 50, alleging
causes of action for: (1) misappropriation of trade secrets; (2) breach of
promissory note; (3) breach of fiduciary duty; (4) breach of duty of loyalty;
(5) unfair competition; (6) intentional interference with prospective economic
relations; (7) negligent interference with prospective economic relations; (8)
conversion, and (9) trespass to chattel. 
The Complaint
alleges the following: Defendant Baboli used to be an employee of Plaintiff and
is the principal of Defendants Beverly Hills IT Services and Beverly Hills IT
(collectively the “Entity Defendants”) who served as an independent contractor
for Plaintiff. (Complaint, ¶ 23.) Defendant Baboli was hired by Plaintiff as a
field employee. (Complaint, ¶ 18.) In or about late 2021, Defendant Baboli
informed Plaintiff that he consulted with his accountant and decided to form
the Entity Defendants for tax purposes. (Complaint, ¶ 19.) Defendant Baboli
insisted that Plaintiff no longer employ him but instead contract with the Entity
Defendants and make all payments to the Entity Defendants. (Complaint, ¶ 19.) Defendant
Baboli informed Plaintiff that the Entity Defendants would contract with
Plaintiff as an independent contractor, servicing Plaintiff’s clients, while
also servicing clients of the Entity Defendants as well. (Complaint, ¶ 19.)
Plaintiff acquiesced to appease Defendant Baboli and the Entity Defendants.
(Complaint, ¶ 20.) Plaintiff alleges that, in or around December 2022, it
learned that Defendants secretly engaged in unlawful conduct to poach
Plaintiff’s clients for their competitive business, while purporting to service
those clients on Plaintiff’s behalf as Plaintiff’s contractors. (Complaint, ¶
24.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Baboli borrowed $9,540 pursuant to a
promissory note (the “Promissory Note”), which he has failed to repay.
(Complaint, ¶¶ 34-38.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants unlawfully used and
continue to use Plaintiff’s trade secrets and confidential information.
(Complaint, ¶ 42.) 
On April 27, 2023,
default was entered against the Entity Defendants. 
On May 2, 2023,
default was entered against Defendant Baboli. 
On August 28,
2023, Plaintiff filed a Request for Entry of Default Judgment against
Defendants. 
On September 20,
2023, Defendants filed a motion to vacate the default entered against them. 
On November 3,
2023, after hearing oral argument and taking the matter under submission, the
Court granted Defendants’ motion to vacate default in part. (11/03/23 Minute
Order.) The Court vacated the default as to Defendant Baboli only but denied
the motion to vacate as to the Entity Defendants. (11/03/23 Minute Order.) 
On November 8,
2023, Defendant Baboli filed an Answer to the Complaint. 
On November 17,
2023, the Entity Defendants filed a Motion for Reconsideration as to the
Court’s November 3, 2023 order. 
On December 26,
2023, Plaintiff filed a Request for Default Judgment as to the Entity
Defendants. 
On February 20,
2024, after hearing, the Court denied the Entity Defendants’ motion for
reconsideration. Also, on such date, the Court held a Status Conference re:
Default Judgment. The Court reviewed Plaintiff’s default judgment application
concerning the Entity Defendants and the Court granted in part and denied in
part Plaintiff’s request for default judgment as to the Entity Defendants.
(02/20/24 Minute Order at p. 10.) The Court awarded Plaintiff judgment in the
sum of $90,000.00 and granted injunctive relief. (Id.) The Court
indicated that Plaintiff could not seek damages pursuant to its claim for
unfair competition; however, the Court found that Plaintiff specified
$90,000.00 in damages as to its other claims. (Id. at p. 8.) The Court
also stated that the attorneys’ fees provision in the Promissory Note was not
enforceable against the Entity Defendants. (02/20/24 Minute Order at p. 10.) 
On March 4, 2024,
the Court entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against the Entity
Defendants consistent with its February 20, 2024 order. The Court’s judgment
states that “[a]ny request for attorney fees will be subject to a filed and
noticed motion in this matter.” (Judgment at p. 2:5.) 
On March 7, 2024,
Plaintiff filed and served the instant Motion for Attorneys’ Fees in which Plaintiff
seeks attorneys’ fees against the Entity Defendants in the amount of
$137,666.56. On March 27, 2024, Defendants filed an opposition to the motion,
to which Plaintiff replied on April 3, 2024. 
Request for Judicial Notice
            The
Court GRANTS Defendants’ request for judicial notice pursuant to California
Evidence Code sections 452 and 453. 
Motion for Attorneys’ Fees
Standard
 
            “In general, a
prevailing party may recover attorney’s fees only when a statute or agreement
of the parties provides for fee shifting.” (Kirby v. Immoos Fire Protection,
Inc. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1244, 1248.) “It is well established that
the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to
the discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the
absence of an abuse of discretion.” (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 618, 623.) The fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily “begins
with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended
multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales,
Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) “The reasonable hourly
rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (Margolin v.
Regional Planning Com. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.)  
            “[A] computation
of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to
a determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Margolin v.
Regional Planning Com., supra, 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.) The
lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors
specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the
legal services provided. (See Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49
[discussing factors relevant to proper attorneys’ fees award].) Such an
approach anchors the trial court’s analysis to an objective determination of
the value of the attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not
arbitrary. (Id. at p. 48, fn. 23.) The factors considered in determining
the modification of the lodestar include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Mountjoy v.
Bank of Am. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 271.) “[T]he burden
is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove that the fees it seeks are
reasonable.” (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th
44, 98.) “[A]n award of attorney fees may be based on counsel’s declarations,
without production of detailed time records.” (Raining Data Corp. v.
Barrenechea (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1365.) 
            Where a party is
challenging the reasonableness of attorney’s fees as excessive that party must
attack itemized billing with evidence that the fees claimed were not
appropriate or obtain the declaration of an attorney with expertise in the
procedural and substantive law to demonstrate that the fees claimed were
unreasonable. (Premier
Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008)
163 Cal.App.4th 550, 563-564.) “[I]t is the burden of the
challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient
argument and citations to the evidence and arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not
suffice.” (Id. at p. 564.) It is well
established that the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees
is committed to the discretion of the trial court. (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084,
1096.)  
            A “court should
defer to the winning lawyer’s professional judgment as to the tasks completed
in an action because he won, and might not have, had he been more of a
slacker.” (Moreno v. City of Sacramento (9th Cir. 2008) 534 F.3d 1106,
1111.) A losing party cannot litigate tenaciously then be heard to complain
about the time spent or tasks performed by the prevailing party in response. (City
of Riverside v. Rivera (1986) 477 U.S. 561, 580, fn.11.)  Where a defendant does not produce evidence
contradicting the reasonableness of counsel’s hourly rates, the Court will deem
an attorney’s hourly rate as reasonable. (Goglin v. BMW of North America,
LLC (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 462, 473.)
Analysis
 
The
Lack of a Notice of Motion
            “A notice of motion must state in
the opening paragraph the nature of the order being sought and the grounds for
the issuance of the order.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1110(a).)
            Here, the Court finds that Plaintiff
did not file a notice of motion setting forth the nature of the order being
sought and the grounds for the issuance of the order. Plaintiff merely filed a
caption page which sets forth the date, time, and department of the hearing on
the motion for attorneys’ fees, which is followed by a memorandum of points and
authorities in support of the motion. Plaintiff failed to comply with
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1110(a). Defendants, however, do not indicate
any prejudice or even address the lack of a properly noticed motion. 
            As such, the Court will consider the
motion on its merits. However, Plaintiff is reminded to comply with the
requirements of the California Rules of Court. 
The
Defendants’ Lack of Standing to Oppose the Motion
            On reply, Plaintiff argues that the
Entity Defendants may not oppose the motion because they have been defaulted.
The Court agrees with Plaintiff.
            “The entry of default terminates a
defendant’s rights to take any further affirmative steps in the litigation
until either its default is set aside or a default judgment is entered.” (Devlin
v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385.) “A
defendant against whom a default has been entered is out of court and is not
entitled to take any further steps in the cause affecting plaintiff’s right of
action; he cannot thereafter, until such default is set aside in a proper
proceeding, file pleadings or move for a new trial or demand notice of
subsequent proceedings.” (Id. at p. 385-386.)
            Here, default and default judgment
have been entered against the Entity Defendants. As such, the Entity Defendants
lack grounds to contest Plaintiff’s motion and have no standing to contest such
motion. 
            As to Defendant Baboli, Plaintiff
alleges that he lacks standing to oppose the motion because the motion does not
even request attorneys’ fees against him. The Court is unsure as to why
Defendant Baboli is opposing the motion for attorneys’ fees given that
Plaintiff is not requesting attorneys’ fees against Defendant Baboli at this
time. However, the Court will still consider the arguments raised in the opposition
as Defendant Baboli is entitled to file pleadings in this action given that his
default was set aside. The Court will treat the arguments raised in the
opposition as only being set forth by Defendant Baboli. 
 
 
Plaintiff’s
Entitlement to Attorneys’ Fees Under Section 3426.4 of CUTSA
            Plaintiff contends that it is
entitled to attorneys’ fees pursuant to Civ. Code § 3426.4. Defendant Baboli
contends that there is no finding of willful and malicious misappropriation of
trade secrets pursuant to Civ. Code § 3426.4 to warrant an award of attorneys’
fees. As will be explained below, the Court agrees with Defendant Baboli. 
            “If a claim of misappropriation is
made in bath faith . . . or willful and malicious misappropriation exists, the
court may award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party.”
(Civ. Code § 3426.4.) “In order to justify fees under Civil Code section
3426.4, the court must find that a willful and malicious misappropriation
occurred.” (Vacco Industries, Inc. v. Van Den Berg (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th
34, 54.) “That requirement is satisfied . . . by the jury’s determination, upon
clear and convincing evidence, that defendants’ acts of misappropriation were
done with malice.” (Ibid.) “[M]alice may be proven either expressly by
direct evidence probative of the existence of hatred or ill-will, or by
implication from indirect evidence from which the jury may draw inferences.” (Ajaxo
Inc. v. E*Trade Group Inc. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 21, 66-67.) 
            Defendant Baboli argues that the
Court’s February 20, 2024 ruling does not reflect any judicial finding of
willful and malicious misappropriation to warrant an award of attorneys’ fees.
(Opp’n at p. 5:20-26.) The Court fails to see the relevance of Plaintiff’s
argument on reply that a separate action filed by Defendant Baboli in Mostafa
Baboli aka Stephan Parsa vs. Network Experts, Inc., et al., LASC Case No.
23STCV31366 (the “Employment Action”), which was filed by Defendant Baboli against
Plaintiff (Baboli Decl., Exh. B.), shows willfulness or maliciousness in this
action. (Reply at p. 3:1-7.)
            The Court notes its February 20,
2024 ruling concerning Plaintiff’s default judgment application against the
Entity Defendants does not reflect a judicial finding of willful and malicious
appropriation. In its moving papers, Plaintiff cites to Vacco, supra,
5 Cal.App.4th 34, 54, which was issued by the Second District Court of Appeal
and is binding on this Court. Vacco, supra, 5 Cal.App.4th
34, 54 explicitly states that fees under Civ. Code § 3426.4 will be justified
only where the Court makes a finding that willful and malicious
misappropriation occurred. Here, on reply, Plaintiff does not dispute the
argument of Defendant Baboli that there was no judicial finding of willful and
malicious misappropriation. There has been no determination by a jury or this
Court that the Entity Defendants willfully or maliciously misappropriated trade
secrets. Also, fees under Civ. Code § 3426.4 are permissive and not mandatory. 
            The Court therefore finds that
Plaintiff is not entitled to attorneys’ fees under Civ. Code § 3426.4.
Plaintiff’s
Entitlement to Attorneys’ Fees Under CCP § 1021.5
            Plaintiff argues that it is entitled
to attorneys’ fees pursuant to CCP § 1021.5. Defendant Baboli argues that
Plaintiff is not entitled to attorneys’ fees pursuant to such section of the
Code of Civil Procedure. 
“Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, a court may
award attorneys’ fees to a successful party against one or more opposing
parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important
right affecting the public interest.” (Davis v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (2016)
245 Cal.App.4th 1302, 1328.) CCP § 1021.5 “provides explicit
statutory authorization for a private attorney general award where the litigant
vindicates a public policy resting on Constitution or statute.” (Ibid.,
internal quotations omitted.) “[E]ligibility for a section 1021.5 attorney fees
is established when (1) plaintiffs’ action has resulted in the enforcement of
an important right affecting the public interest, (2) a significant benefit,
whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, has been conferred on the general public or
a large class of persons, and (3) the necessity and financial burden of private
enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate.” (Id. at p.
1328-1329.) An award of attorneys’ fees pursuant to CCP § 1021.5 “is to
encourage suits that enforce common interests of significant importance, but
which do not involve any individual’s financial interests to the extent
necessary to encourage private litigation to enforce the right.” (Id. at
p. 1329, citation omitted.) “[A] party need not prevail on every claim presented
in an action in order to be considered a successful party” within the meaning
of CCP § 1021.5. (Sweetwater Union High School Dist. v. Julian Union
Elementary School Dist. (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 970, 982.) 
            The Court finds that Plaintiff has
not shown entitlement to attorneys’ fees pursuant to CCP § 1021.5. It is the
responsibility of this Court to “determine the significance and benefit and the
size of the class receiving that benefit by realistically assessing the gains
that have resulted in a particular case.” (Baxter v. Salutary Sportsclubs,
Inc. (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 941, 946.) The Court fails to see
how this action confers a significant benefit on members of the public or a
large class of persons. The Complaint only seeks to enforce the rights of
Plaintiff and not any third parties. Plaintiff presents no legal authority to
support its contention that it is entitled to attorneys’ fees under CCP §
1021.5 because the Court’s February 20, 2024 order conferred a significant
benefit on the general public. (Motion at p. 5:19-20.) The Court’s judgment as
to the Entity Defendants only concerns relief awarded to Plaintiff and not to the
public generally or to a large class of persons.
            Accordingly, the Court also finds
that Plaintiff is not entitled to attorneys’ fees pursuant to CCP § 1021.5. Plaintiff
has failed to establish any of the factors articulated in Davis v. Farmers
Ins. Exchange, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th 1302, 1328-1329.

Conclusion
Based on the
foregoing, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees.
