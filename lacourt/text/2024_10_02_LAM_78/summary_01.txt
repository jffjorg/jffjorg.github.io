Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to compel further responses to requests for admissions and form interrogatories in a quiet title action brought by 1525 COLORADO, LLC (Plaintiff) against MANIBEN CORP., et al. (Defendants). The Plaintiff filed the motion to compel further responses to requests for admissions (RFAs) Nos. 12-16 and form interrogatories, Set One, as to No. 17.1. The Defendants opposed the motion.

The judge held an informal discovery conference to discuss discovery matters in dispute and found that the Plaintiff's motions to compel further responses to RFAs Nos. 12-16 were granted. The judge also granted the motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1.

The judge's ruling is based on the facts that the Plaintiff's requests for admissions are relevant to the case and that the Defendants' responses were incomplete or evasive. The judge also found that the Plaintiff met the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2033.290(b)(1) and 2030.300(b)(1) and that the Defendants' objections to the requests for admissions on the grounds of relevance were without merit.

The judge ordered the Defendants to provide further responses to the requests for admissions and form interrogatories within 20 days and denied the Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions without calculating the amount. The judge also encouraged the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement and to submit on the tentative ruling.
