RESPONDING PARTY: Non-Party McFarlane Girls, Inc.

RULING: The motion is placed off calendar.  
 
On 4/20/23, Plaintiff Gary Grant (Plaintiff) filed this
action against Defendant One876 Caribbean Restaurant, LLC (Defendant) for: (1)
Failure to Provide Required Meal Periods (Labor Code 226.7, 510, 512, 1194,
1197; IWC Wage Orders); (2) Failure to Provide Required Rest Periods (Labor
Code 226.7, 512; IWC Wage Orders); (3) Failure to Pay Overtime Wages (Labor
Code 510, 1194, 1198; IWC Wage Orders); (4) Failure to Pay Minimum Wages (Labor
Code 1194, 1197; IWC Wage Orders); (5) Failure to Timely Pay Wages During
Employment (Labor Code 204); (6) Failure to Pay All Wages Due to Discharged and
Quitting Employees (Labor Code 201, 202, 203); (7) Failure to Maintain Required
Records (Labor Code 226, 1174; IWC Wage Orders); (8) Failure to Furnish
Accurate, Itemized Wage Statements (Labor Code 226; IWC Wage Orders) and (9)
Unfair and Unlawful Business Practices.  
 
After Defendant failed to respond to the complaint,
default was entered against Defendant on 6/14/23.  Thereafter, on 7/25/23, the Court entered
default judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$26,371.85.
 
Plaintiff contends that Defendant misled Plaintiff to
believe he was employed by Defendant when Plaintiff was actually employed by
McFarlane Girls, Inc.  Plaintiff contends
that during his workers compensation filing against Defendant after the default
judgment, he discovered that Defendant was a mere shell to cover up McFarlane
Girls, Inc. (the Alter Ego Entity) which Plaintiff claims holds the assets and
liabilities for the business that employed Plaintiff.  (Idrees Decl.).
 
Plaintiff contends that there was no active entity that
existed at the inception of Plaintiff’s employment.  Rather, Defendant, while bearing the same name
as the restaurant Plaintiff was employed in, did not exist as an entity until 11/3/21,
which occurred after Plaintiff was already employed.  (Idrees Decl. ¶4, Ex.B).  Plaintiff contends the Alter Ego Entity was
not registered as an active entity with the California Secretary of State until
filing the first Statement of Information on 12/22/22.  (Id. ¶5, Ex.C).
 
Plaintiff notes that Defendant and Alter Ego Entity both
have their principal and mailing address registered to 20869 Lassen Street,
Chatsworth, CA 91311 – the address where One876 Caribbean Restaurant operates.  (Id. ¶6).  Additionally, the owner of both Alter Ego
Entity and Defendant, Trudy Gray, is also listed as the agent for service of
process under both Alter Ego Entity and Defendant.  Id.  Defendant and Alter Ego Entity are both listed
as a “Restaurant” business.  (Id. 
¶7, Ex.D).  Public
records also show Alter Ego Entity is recognized as the entity that operates
One876 Caribbean Restaurant and have their business phone number registered as
(818) 678-9252, which is the phone number for store operations of One876
Caribbean Restaurant. (Id. ¶8, Ex.E).
 
On 11/17/23, Plaintiff filed the instant motion seeking
an order amending the Default Judgment entered on 7/25/23 to add McFarlane
Girls, Inc. as an alter ego judgment debtor pursuant to CCP 187.    
 
The proof of service attached to the motion indicates
that it was served by U.S. mail on Trudy Gray c/o One876 Caribbean Restaurant,
LLC & McFarlane Girls, Inc. at 20869 Lassen Street, Los Angeles, CA 91311.  McFarlane Girls, Inc./Alter Ego Entity has
not appeared in the action.  Since there
is no opposition or other response to the motion, the motion must be personally
served on McFarlane Girls, Inc./Alter Ego Entity to ensure it had proper notice
and opportunity to be heard.
