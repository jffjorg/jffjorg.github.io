SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of the sale of a fencing company,
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant KSJV3, Inc. dba Five Star Fence (Five Star), from
Defendants/Cross-Complainants Yusheng Shew (Shew) and Jill Van (Van) to
Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants Gevork Voskanian (Voskanian) and Mary Keryan
(Keryan).  
 
On 10/20/23, Voskanian, Keryan and Five Star filed this
action against Shew and Van for: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Breach of Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (3) Fraud and Deceit, (4) Negligent
Misrepresentation, (5) Accounting, (6) Declaratory Relief, 
(7) Unjust Enrichment, (8) Conspiracy, (9) Intentional
Interference and (10) Negligent Interference. 

 
On 12/18/23, Shew and Van filed and served the subject
cross-complaint against Voskanian, Keryan and Five Star for: (1) Fraud – Promise Without Intent to Perform, (2) Breach
of Stock Purchase Agreement, (3) Breach of Secured Promissory Note, (4) Breach
of Guaranty, (5) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (6)
Judicial Foreclosure of UCC-1 Lien, (7) Interference With Contract, (8)
Accounting and (9) Declaratory Relief.   

 
On 12/26/23, Shew and Van filed and served a demurrer,
with a 3/8/24 hearing date, to the 1st – 5th and 7th
and 8th causes of action in the complaint.  On 2/22/24, Voskanian, Keryan and Five Star
filed their First Amended Complaint for: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Breach of

served the instant demurrer to the 1st cause of action for Fraud –
Promise Without Intent to Perform, 5th cause of action for Breach of
Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, 7th cause of action
for Interference With Contract and 9th cause of action for
Declaratory Relief in Shew and Van’s cross-complaint.  Shew and Van have opposed the demurrer.     
 
The Court notes that Shew and Van have not filed a
response to the First Amended Complaint (i.e., neither an answer nor demurrer
to the First Amended Complaint).
 
ANALYSIS
 
The notice of demurrer indicates that it is based on CCP
430.10(e), (f) and (g).  (See
Notice of Demurrer, p.2:2-9).  The
demurrer document indicates that Shew and Van demurrer to the 1st, 5th,
7th and 9th causes of action solely on the ground that
the 1st, 5th, 7th and 9th causes of
action fail to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action, CCP
430.10(e).  (Demurrer, p.3:5-23).  However, the demurrer document incorrectly
identifies the 1st cause of action as Negligence (Legal
Malpractice), the 5th cause of action as Negligence (Legal
Malpractice) and incorrectly refers to it as the 2nd cause of
action, the 7th cause of action as Breach of Contract and
incorrectly refers to it as the 3rd cause of action, and the 9th
cause of action as Breach of Contract and incorrectly refers to it as the 3rd
cause of action.  Id.
 
1st cause of action – Fraud – Promise
Without Intent to Perform
 
The elements of a fraud cause of action are: (1) false
representation by defendant, (2) intent to deceive or induce reliance, (3)
justifiable reliance by plaintiff, (4) resulting damages.  Service by Medallion, Inc. (1996) 44
CA4th 1807, 1816.  Fraud claims must be
pled with specific facts showing how, when, where, to whom and by what means
the misrepresentations were made.  Lazar
(1996) 12 C4th 631, 645.  
 
A promise made without intending to perform it, or
promissory fraud, is actionable as fraud. 
Engalla (1997) 15 C4th 951, 973. 
The elements of a claim for promissory fraud are: (1) a promise made
regarding a material fact without any intention of performing it; (2) the
existence of the intent not to perform at the time the promise was made; (3)
intent to deceive or induce the promisee to enter into a transaction; (4)
reasonable reliance by the promisee; (5) nonperformance by the party making the
promise; and (6) resulting damage to the promisee.  Gruber (2020) 48 CA5th 529, 540 citing
Behnke (2011) 196 CA4th 1443, 1453.
 
Contrary to the assertions in the demurrer, Shew and Van
have pled each of the necessary elements with the required factual
specificity.  (See Cross-Complaint
¶¶28-32).
 
 
 
5th cause of action – Breach of the Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
 
Every contract includes an implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing that neither party will do anything to interfere with the
other party’s right to receive the benefits of the agreement.  Howard (2010) 187 CA4th 498, 528
citing Restatement 2d Contracts, §205.  The
exact nature and extent of the duty depends on the nature and purpose of the
underlying contract and the parties’ legitimate expectations arising from the
contract.  Howard, supra.  Generally, breach of the implied covenant
gives rise only to contract damages; however, in the insurance context, breach
of the implied covenant is also actionable in tort allowing for the recovery of
extracontractual damages.  See Foley
(1988) 47 C3d 654, 683-684; State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.
(1970) 9 CA3d 508, 528; California Capital Insurance Co. (C.D.
California 2020) 472 F.Supp.3d 754, 758-761; Chu (2021) 60 CA5th 346,
356-357.
 
Here, the breach of implied covenant claim seeks the same
damages and the breach of contract claim. 
As such, it is duplicative and unnecessary.  Since this case does not involve an insurance
contract between the parties, the defect in the breach of the implied covenant
of good faith and fair dealing cause of action cannot be cured by
amendment.    
 
7th cause of action – Intentional
Interference
 
The elements of an intentional interference with contract
cause of action are: (1) a valid contract between plaintiff and a third party;
(2) defendant’s knowledge of this contract; (3) defendant’s intentional acts
designed to induce a breach or disruption of the contractual relationship; (4)
actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship; and (5) resulting
damage.  Pacific Gas & Electric
Co. (1990) 50 C3d 1118, 1126.
 
Contrary to Voskanian and Keryan’s contention, the
cross-complaint sufficiently alleges their interference with contractual
relationships between Shew and Van and third parties.  (Cross-Complaint ¶¶14(a)-(b), 60-61).  The cross-complaint also sufficiently alleges
the remaining elements of the claim. 
(Cross-Complaint ¶¶62-67).
 
9th cause of action – Declaratory Relief
 
When an actual controversy relating to the legal rights
and duties of the parties to a contract arises, a person interested under the
contract may seek a declaration from the court of his or her rights or duties
under the contract.  See CCP
1060.  Such remedies are cumulative and
do not preclude additional relief based on the same facts.  CCP 1062.
 
Here, the cross-complaint sufficiently sets forth the
basis for a declaratory relief cause of action. 
Since Voskanian and Keryan also make a claim for declaratory relief in
their First Amended Complaint, they cannot now deny the existence of an actual
controversy.  See Ludgate
Insurance Co. (2000) 82 CA4th 592, 604. 

 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is overruled as to the 1st, 7th
and 9th causes of action and sustained without leave to amend as to
the 5th cause of action. 
Answer is due within 30 days.
