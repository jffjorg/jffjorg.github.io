And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion of attorneys Mansour Jafarian and Russell M. Rad to be relieved as counsel for defendants Mahyar Louie and Fran Louie. The motion was filed on March 1, 2024, citing a breakdown in the working relationship. The attorneys claimed to have served the clients by email and U.S. mail, but there is no evidence that the clients responded to confirm the email addresses. Additionally, the defendants were not notified of the continued hearing date on April 10, 2024. As a result, the court denied the motion without prejudice.
