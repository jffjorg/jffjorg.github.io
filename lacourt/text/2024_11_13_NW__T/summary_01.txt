And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 24VECV03310, involving ALLY BANK as the plaintiff and ORTIZ as the defendant. The plaintiff is seeking a writ of possession to repossess a vehicle from the defendant. The judge has granted the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession, finding that the defendant has breached the Retail Installment Sales Contract and has no right to possess the vehicle. The judge has also waived the requirement for the plaintiff to post an undertaking, as the account balance exceeds the value of the vehicle and no equity exists for the defendant.
