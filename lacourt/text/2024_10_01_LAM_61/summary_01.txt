And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication of the second cause of action for breach of contract. The plaintiff, RAJ HAIR INTERNATIONAL PVT. LTD., argued that there were no triable issues of fact regarding the existence of a payment agreement between the parties and the defendant's failure to pay. The judge found that the plaintiff had made a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issues of material fact and that the defendant failed to present evidence creating a triable issue of fact. The defendant, EXTENSIONS PLUS, INC., had argued that the plaintiff's hair products were of poor quality, but the judge found that this was not relevant to the breach of contract claim. The judge also rejected the defendant's arguments that the plaintiff was unable to obtain separate adjudication of liability and damages and that the plaintiff's claims were barred by contractual duress. The judge granted the plaintiff's motion, allowing the plaintiff to proceed with its claims for damages and prejudgment interest.
