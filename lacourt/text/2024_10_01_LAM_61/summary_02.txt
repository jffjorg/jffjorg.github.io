And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion to compel further responses to requests for production and a motion for protective order. The plaintiff, Xinwu Cheng, is seeking to compel the defendant, City of Fontana, to produce additional documents in response to his discovery requests. The defendant is seeking a protective order to prevent the disclosure of certain information related to a DEA investigation.

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for protective order, finding that it was untimely and unsupported by good cause. The judge has also awarded sanctions against the defendant and its counsel in the amount of $1,575.00.

The judge has continued the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production, pending the outcome of an informal discovery conference with the court. The judge requires the defendant to produce additional evidence concerning the status of the DEA investigation and its relation to the evidence sought.

The judge's decision is based on the official information privilege, which permits a public entity to object to disclosure of information acquired in confidence by a public employee. However, the judge has found that the defendant has not demonstrated good cause to withhold production of the requested documents.

The judge has also cited the public interest in solving drug-related crimes, which outweighs the necessity for disclosure in the interest of justice.
