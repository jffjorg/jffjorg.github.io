English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, finding that the Plaintiff has carried its initial burden on the motion. The Plaintiff, 6263 Manchester, LLC, seeks to evict the Defendant, Orb Tertius, LLC, from the property located at 6224 West Manchester Avenue in Los Angeles, California, due to the Defendant's failure to pay rent for the months of October, November, and December 2020. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has established all the necessary elements of an unlawful detainer action, including the Defendant's failure to pay rent, the service of a Three-Day Notice to Pay or Quit, and the Defendant's failure to pay the unpaid rent within the statutory notice period. The Judge also notes that the LA County Tenant Protection Resolution, which was previously relied upon by the Defendant, is no longer applicable since it expired on January 31, 2022. The Judge's ruling is without prejudice to a timely filed and properly proven 1179 Motion for relief from the forfeiture of eviction.
