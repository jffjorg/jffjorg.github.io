BACKGROUND Factual  On February 24, 2020, Plaintiff, 6232 Manchester LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint for Unlawful Detainer against Defendant, Orb Tertius, LLC, and DOES 1 through 10. This action involves the real property located at 6224 West Manchester Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90045. Plaintiff asserts that it is the owner and landlord of the Property and rents the property to Defendant based on a commercial lease dated July 27, 2015.   On December 5, 2023, this Court DENIED a Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendant Orb Tertius, LLC.   Now, Plaintiff, 6232 Manchester LLC files its Motion for Summary Judgment.   B. Procedural  On January 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Summary Judgment.   On January 16, 2024, Defendant, Orb Tertius, LLC filed an ex parte application to continue the hearing on the Motion for Summary Judgment, Related Dates, and Trial.   On January 17, 2024, this Court continued the motion for summary judgment, and allowed oppositions papers to be filed by January 24, 2024.   On January 24, 2024, Defendant Orb Tertius, LLC filed an opposition.   On January 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply brief.   II. ANALYSIS¿¿  Legal Standard   In a UD proceeding, a "motion for summary judgment may be made at any time after the answer is filed upon giving five-days notice. Summary judgment shall be granted or denied on the same basis as a motion under Section 437c." (Code Civ. Proc., § 1170.7.)  The function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) CCP Section 437(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.)As to each claim as framed by the complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a defense. (CCP § 437c(p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520. ) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.”¿ (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)Once the moving party has met that burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.¿To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)  In an unlawful detainer action or other action brought under chapter 4 of title 3 of part 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure (commencing with section 1159), notice of a motion for summary judgment must be given in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure sections 1010.6 or 1013 and 1170.7.  Discussion  Plaintiff files this Motion for Summary Judgment, or alternatively, Motion for Summary Judgment based on the following issues: (1) First, Defendant failed to pay rent for the months of October, November and December 2020; (2) Plaintiff served a Three-Day Notice to Pay or Quit based on this non-payment; (3) Defendant failed to pay the unpaid rent within the three-day statutory notice period; and (4) Defendant failed to vacate the Property within the statutory notice period.   Preliminarily, this Court notes that Defendant is mistaken that Plaintiff must comply with certain procedure filings such as the separate statement, even though a separate statement is ordinarily required by Code of Civil Procedure section 437c((b)(1).  A Separate Statement is not required for a UD motion for summary judgment per Code of Civil Procedure section 437c(s), which exempts UD MSJs from many other procedural requirements applicable to other civil cases.    Unlawful Detainer  The basic elements of unlawful detainer for nonpayment of rent contained in Code of Civil Procedure section 1161, subdivision (2), are (1) the tenant is in possession of the premises; (2) that possession is without permission; (3) the tenant is in default for nonpayment of rent; (4) the tenant has been properly served with a written three-day notice; and (5) the default continues after the three-day notice period has elapsed.” (Kruger v. Reyes (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th Supp. 10, *16.) CACI 4302 more fully sets out the necessary elements:[Name of plaintiff] claims that [name of defendant] [and [name of subtenant], a subtenant of [name of defendant],] no longer [has/have] the right to occupy the property because [name of defendant] has failed to pay the rent. To establish this claim, [name of plaintiff] must prove all of the following:1. That [name of plaintiff] [owns/leases] the property; 2. That [name of plaintiff] [rented/subleased] the property to [name of defendant];3. That under the [lease/rental agreement/sublease], [name of defendant] was required to pay rent in the amount of $[specify amount] per [specify period, e.g., month];4. That [name of plaintiff] properly gave [name of defendant] three days’ written notice to pay the rent or vacate the property; 5. That as of [date of three-day notice], at least the amount stated in the three-day notice was due; 6. That [name of defendant] did not pay the amount stated in the notice within three days after [service/receipt] of the notice; and7. That [name of defendant] [or subtenant [name of subtenant]] is still occupying the property.  Here, Plaintiff cites to the declaration of Milton Sznaider (“11/22/23 Sznaider Decl.”), as to which Plaintiff argues that Defendant previously admitted many of the required elements of an unlawful detainer action. For example, Plaintiff argues that Defendant previously admitted that Defendant operates its restaurant as a commercial tenant of Plaintiff (11/22/23 Sznaider Decl., ¶¶ 3, 5); that Defendant did not pay rent from April 2020 through May 2021 (11/22/23 Sznaider Decl., ¶ 6); and that Defendant still had not paid any rent for the unpaid period from April 2020 through May 2021 (Id. ¶ 7.)  Next, Plaintiff argues that it is the owner and landlord of the property and rents the property to Defendant based on a commercial lease. (Complaint, Exhibit 1.) Plaintiff contends that the Sznaider Declaration admits to Defendant’s breach of the commercial lease by failing to pay rent for October, November, and December 2020. (11/22/23 Sznaider Decl., ¶¶ 6-7.)  As to the 3-day notice to pay rent or quit, Plaintiff contends this is attached as Exhibit 2 to the Complaint and proof of service of such is attached as Exhibit 3 of the Complaint, and attached as Exhibits 2 and 3 to the Stone Declaration in support of the MSJ.  Plaintiff also contends that Sznaider declaration confirms Defendant failed to pay rent within the three-day period and is still occupying the property. (11/22/23 Sznaider Decl., ¶¶ 6-7.)   But continued occupancy is not admitted in that Sznaider declaration.  The 1/24/24 Sznaider Declaration also does not admit that Defendant remains in possession, although that is a reasonable inference to draw from the fact that his declaration requests relief form forfeiture, and such relief can only be granted if the tenant has not yet been divested of possession, such as after a trial or other proceeding where the Landlord won the right of possession but the Sheriff had not yet given the landlord restitution of the premises.  The Opposition brief also argues that this Court should grant relief from forfeiture under Code of Civil Procedure section 1179.  The first sentence of the second paragraph of Section 1179 makes it clear that an application for relief from forfeiture may only be made “prior to restoration of the premises to the landlord,” which further supports the inference of continued occupancy drawn from the 1/24/24 Sznaider Declaration.    The Court takes of judicial notice of the County Resolution which as amended says that the protections for commercial tenants in LA County expired as of January 31, 2022, regardless of when the debt arose. Based on this limited time and now expired resolution, this Court denied Defendant’s previous Motion for Summary Judgment, which was based on an attempt to defend against this UD case based on the already-expired moratorium. This Court also previously noted that Defendant failed to provide any evidence that it complied with the resolution’s requirement of providing timely notice to the landlord indicating that nonpayment of rent was because of financial impacts relating to COVID-19, and that the tenant’s notice also depended on the number of employees – another lack of evidence Defendant failed to provide on its previous motion for summary judgment.  Neither of the Sznaider Declarations fulfils the timeliness element of the resolution, even if it were still applicable in a commercial UD case which it is not, and even if verbal notice were permissible when the LA County Tenant Protections were in place (which they were, depending on the size of the tenant as to which the Court has no evidence before it).     Here, because of the expiration of the County Resolution, and the fact that Plaintiff can establish that: (1) Defendant failed to pay rent for the months of October, November and December 2020; (2) Plaintiff served a Three Day Notice to Pay or Quit based on this nonpayment; (3) Defendant failed to pay the unpaid rent within the three (3) day statutory notice period; and (4) Defendant failed to vacate the Property within the statutory notice period and by reasonable inference remains in possession, the Plaintiff has carried its initial burden on a Motion for Summary Judgment.   In opposition, Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to satisfy its burden on this motion because Defendant is entitled to relief against a forfeiture of a lease or rental agreement, and because of the operation of the LA County Tenant Protection Resolution.  Defendant asserts it was entitled to be protected from eviction for failure to pay rent because Defendant states its provided verbal notice to Plaintiff that Defendant was unable to pay its rent or other financial obligations under the lease in full because it lost income by the COVID-19 pandemic and increased expenses directly related to health impacts of COVID-19 pandemic. (Declaration of Sznaider, ¶ 13.)   This Court agrees with Plaintiff’s reply brief that Plaintiff offers no admissible evidence that there are triable issues of MATERIAL facts because Defendant has the burden of proving its affirmative defense of an eviction moratorium and the defense evidence fails to establish or even raise a triable issue as to the application of the LA County resolution after February 1, 2023.   As such, the Motion is GRANTED  The Court’s ruling on this motion is without prejudice to a timely filed and properly proven 1179 Motion for relief from the forfeiture of eviction.  The Court had granted 1179 motions before, provided the tenant can satisfy the condition for the granting of such a motion as stated in the last sentence of Section 1179, i.e., full payment of rent due.  The Court would expect tender of the full amount owing under the 3-day notice by certified funds at or before the hearing on any 1179 motion.
