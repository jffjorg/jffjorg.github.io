The plaintiff is an out-of-state resident and has opposed the motion, arguing that the amount of the undertaking requested is excessive and that the defendant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its claim. The court has found that the defendant has a possibility of success sufficient for a granting of the motion, but has tentatively ruled that the amount of the undertaking requested is excessive and will take oral argument to consider a lower amount.
