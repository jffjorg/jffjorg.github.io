  - "This provision permits judicial review only after HCD makes an adverse determination."
  - "There is no general provision for a local government to seek judicial approval of its own determination."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the City's requests for judicial notice of certain documents related to the City's housing element review by HCD. The judge has also granted Jha's requests for judicial notice of various documents, including some related to the City's housing element review and others related to the Builder's Remedy.

The judge has denied the City's motion to strike certain paragraphs and references in Jha's complaint, finding that the City's argument that Jha cannot plead the prerequisite absence of a substantially compliant housing element to assert reliance on the Builder's Remedy is dependent on the correctness of the City's position that HCD approval is not necessary.

The judge has also denied the City's demurrer, finding that the City's argument that Jha's preliminary application vested the Project in the housing element as one of the local ordinances, policies, and standards in effect when the application was submitted is confusing and unclear.

The judge has found that the City's housing element was not substantially compliant, and that HCD has not approved the City's housing element. The judge has also found that Jha's preliminary application was submitted after the City's adoption of its housing element, and that Planning staff understood that the City's housing element was not in substantial compliance.

The judge has noted that the City's argument that the one-year rezoning requirement is inapplicable because the City timely adopted its housing element within one year of its October 15, 2022 deadline does not affect the court's interpretation of the statutory scheme.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling suggests that the City's housing element was not substantially compliant, and that Jha may be able to assert reliance on the Builder's Remedy. The ruling is subject to change based on further submissions and argument.
