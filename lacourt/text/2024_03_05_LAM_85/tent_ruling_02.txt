[3] On February
8, 2024, this court issued a decision in New Commune
which denied mandamus but agreed with HCD on this issue.  RJN Ex. E. 



[4] On January 25, 2024, the City sent a letter to Jha’s counsel
outlining the grounds for the demurrer and motion to strike.  Wong Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  Despite a Google Meet video conference on
January 29, 2024, the parties failed to reach any agreement.  Wong Decl., ¶¶ 6-7.  The City has satisfied the requirement to
meet and confer.


[5] Jha
correctly notes (Opp. at 14) that a court’s determination of housing element
substantial compliance is not independent; the Housing Element Law authorizes a
court to adjudicate substantial compliance in only two instances. First, if the
Attorney General brings suit alleging a housing element’s non-compliance, a
court may determine whether the adopted housing element is substantially
compliant.  §65585(l).  Second, a local government may bring suit for
a judicial determination of substantial compliance after HCD determines
non-compliance and other procedural requirements take place.  §65589.11(d). 
This provision permits judicial review only after HCD makes an adverse
determination.  There is no general
provision for a local government to seek judicial approval of its own
determination.  


[6]
The City makes a confusing argument that Jha’s preliminary application vested
the Project in the housing element as one of the local ordinances, policies,
and standards in effect when the application was submitted (§65589.6(o)), but
not in any existing state laws or absence of state regulatory actions.  Dem. at 12. 
Neither the court nor Jha understand what the City means.  See Opp. at 17.
The City further argues that, while a HCD approved housing
element enjoys a rebuttable presumption of substantial compliance, there is no
presumption of invalidity simply because of the absence of HCD approval.  As a result, Jha cannot plead the
prerequisite absence of a substantially compliant housing element to assert
reliance on the Builder’s Remedy.  Dem.
at 12; Reply at 7.  This argument is
wholly dependent on the correctness of the City’s position that HCD approval is
not necessary.
 


[7]
The City argues that the one-year rezoning requirement is inapplicable because it
timely adopted its housing element within one year of its October 15, 2022
deadline.  Reply at 6.  The fact that the City is not subject to the
re-zoning penalty does not affect the court’s interpretation of the statutory
scheme.


[8] The Attorney General agrees with HCD. 
The Attorney General’s opening brief in Housing Defense contended
that no local jurisdiction can declare or certify that its housing element is
substantially compliant with Housing Element Law without HCD review.  RJN Ex. D. 
HCD is the sole government agency statutorily vested with the power to
make such findings.  Ex. D.
            Jha adds that Planning’s own staff
understood that the City’s housing element was not in substantial compliance
when she submitted her preliminary application. 
On June 12, 2023, Planning issued an Appeal Recommendation Report
that recommended the City Council deny Jha’s appeal.  RJN Ex. F, p.1.  In part, Planning explained that Jha submitted
her Project’s preliminary application on June 24, 2022.  Ex. F, p. 18. 
The Project therefore had vesting rights to the regulatory environment
in place after the City had adopted a substantially compliant housing element
but before HCD issued certification of substantial compliance.  RJN Ex. F, p. 18.  Jha points out that Planning staff never
argued that the City’s housing element was in substantial compliance before her
preliminary application.  Opp. at 17.


            [9] The
City moves to strike paragraphs within the second cause of action (Pet.,
¶¶117-129) and other references to the HAA, Housing Element Law, or Builder’s
Remedy (Pet., ¶¶ 23-24, 26-28, 31).  Mot.
Strike at 4-5.  The City makes this
motion on the same basis as the demurrer – that the Builder’s Remedy does not
apply because the City has a substantially compliant housing element before
Jha’s preliminary application.  The
motion is denied for the same reasons the demurrer is overruled.
