  Case Number:  23STCP03499    Hearing Date:   March 5, 2024    Dept:  85 
Janet Jha v. City of
Los Angeles and City Council, 23STCP03499


Tentative decision on (1) demurrer:
overruled; (2) motion to strike: denied  



 
            
Respondents City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles City Council
(“City Council”) (collectively, “City”) demur to the second cause of action of
the Petition filed by Petitioner Janet Jha (“Jha”).  The City also moves to strike portions of the
Petition.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, oppositions, and replies, and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the
Case
            1. The Petition
            Petitioner
Jha filed the Petition against the City on September 21, 2023, alleging (1)
mandamus based on a violation of the Permit Streamlining Act (“PSA”); (2) mandamus
based on a violation of the Housing Accountability Act (“HAA”); (3) mandamus
based on a violation of the Density Bonus Law; and (4) declaratory relief.  The Petition alleges in pertinent part as
follows.
 
            a.
Governing Law
            When
the Legislature enacted the Housing Element Law, it declared that local
governments need to designate and maintain a supply of land and adequate sites
for the development of housing sufficient to meet the locality’s housing need
for all income levels.  Pet., ¶21.  
            The
HAA provides an avenue for developers to provide housing for very low, low-, or
moderate-income households (sometimes referred to as “low-cost housing”) when a
local government fails to adopt a housing element in substantial compliance
with the Housing Element Law.  Pet., ¶22.  The local government shall approve housing,
and not condition that approval in a matter rendering that housing project
infeasible, unless the local government can make certain written findings based
upon a preponderance of the evidence. 
Pet., ¶23.  
            A
local jurisdiction cannot determine whether its adopted element is in
substantial compliance with the Housing Element Law.  Pet., ¶25. 
It must submit a draft housing element to the State Department of
Housing and Community Development (“HCD”), which must issue findings before the
local jurisdiction adopts the housing element. 
Pet., ¶25.  If HCD finds the draft
element is not substantially compliant, the local jurisdiction must either revise
the draft to address any issues or adopt the draft housing element with written
findings explaining why it substantially complies with the Housing Element Law.  Pet., ¶25. 
It must then submit the adopted housing element to HCD for it to find whether
it substantially complies with the Housing Element Law.  Pet., ¶25. 
In a March 16, 2023 memorandum, HCD advised that a local jurisdiction’s
housing element is only in substantial compliance with the Housing Element Law on
the date HCD issues a letter finding to that effect.  Pet., ¶26.
            The
Housing Element Law requires local governments to update their housing element
in eight-year cycles.  Pet., ¶27.  The City had not adopted a substantially
compliant housing element by the time the current cycle began on October 15,
2021.  Pet., ¶27.  Although it drafted a housing element on November
24, 2021, HCD found on February 22, 2022 that it was not substantially
compliant.  Pet., ¶28.  The City revised and resubmitted the draft
housing element on April 28, 2022, and HCD found it substantially compliant on
May 11, 2022.  Pet., ¶28.  The City adopted the housing element on June
14, 2022, and HCD certified its compliance with the Housing Element Law on June
29, 2022.  Pet., ¶28.  
            Under
Government Code[1] sections
65589.5(o)(1) and 65941.1(a), a housing development applicant who submits a complete
preliminary application is vested with the zoning and general plan standards in
effect at the time of submission.  Pet.,
¶30.  This includes entitlement to the
Builder’s Remedy if submitted when the jurisdiction does not have a compliant
housing element, even if it adopts one during the entitlement process.  Pet., ¶31. 
HCD confirmed as much in a June 2023 Notice of Violation issued to La
Cañada Flintridge and in an October 2023 Letter of Technical Assistance to
Santa Monica.  Pet., ¶32, Ex. A.
            
            b.
The Project
            On
June 23, 2022, Jha submitted a preliminary application for a 40-unit project
with 20% set aside as affordable to lower-income households (“Project”) at
13916 W. Polk Street.  Pet., ¶53.  Because the City found the Project was
complete on June 24, 2022, development rights in effect on that date vested for
the Project.  Pet., ¶54.  
            Jha
proposed a housing project that reserved 20% of the units for low-cost housing while
the City was out of compliance with the Housing Element Law.  Pet., ¶55. 
Under the Builder’s Remedy, the City was barred from disapproving the
Project unless it made one of the written findings required under section 65589.5(d).  Pet., ¶55.
            On
August 11, 2022, Jha filed an Affordable Housing Referral Form with the City’s
Affordable Housing Services Section. 
Pet., ¶57.  The City signed this
form on December 12, 2023.  Pet.,
¶64.  After a meeting with City staff on
December 9, 2022, Jha was allowed to submit a PSA development application.  Pet., ¶66. 
Jha submitted the application and paid the fees on December 21,
2022.  Pet., ¶66.  
            On
January 26, 2023, the City sent Jha a 39-page Project Review letter.  Pet., ¶67. 
The Project Review asserted the application was incomplete and did not
comply with objective zoning standards.  Pet.,
¶67.   The
Project Review further said that, although the Project was eligible for the
Builder’s Remedy, HAA does not specify the entitlement process that a local
government can require.  Pet., ¶68.  The City Planning Department’s (“Planning”)
position was that a general plan amendment (“GPA”) and rezoning amendment were
the proper entitlement path.  Pet.,
¶68.  This is not an entitlement at all,
but rather a legislative action.  Pet.,
¶68.  
            Section
65589.5(d) does provide an entitlement path. 
Pet., ¶71.  If HCD does not find a
local jurisdiction’s housing element substantially compliant by the
jurisdiction’s statutory deadline, the local jurisdiction may not use section
65589.5(d)(5) to deny a qualifying affordable housing project.  Pet., ¶72. 
HCD’s Notice of Violation to La Cañada Flintridge explained that a jurisdiction
shall not disapprove a housing development project for low-cost housing, or
condition approval in a manner that renders the housing development project
infeasible for development for such households, without one of five written
findings.  Pet., ¶71, Ex. A.
            On
April 5, 2023, Jha resubmitted revised application materials in response to the
Project Review.  Pet., ¶81.  The City sent a second Project Review asserting
the application was incomplete for failure to comply with City code
standards.  Pet., ¶¶ 82-83.  The letter emphasized that the City would not
process the development application unless Jha sought legislative rezoning that
she did not want.  Pet., ¶85.
            Jha
appealed the City’s incompleteness determination of her application.  Pet., ¶86. 
The City Council’s Planning and Land Use Management Committee (“PLUM”) recommended
denial of the appeal, and the City Council denied it on June 27, 2023.  Pet., ¶¶ 92-93.
            On
May 16, 2023, the City wrote Jha a letter asserting that the preliminary
application’s submittal had expired and that Jha’s vested rights therefore had
terminated.  Pet., ¶95.  Section 65941.1(d)(2) states that if a public
agency determines that the application for the development project is incomplete,
the development proponent shall submit the specific information necessary to
complete the application within 90 days of receiving the agency’s written
identification of the necessary information. 
Pet., ¶99.  This means that the
90-day period resets with every new completeness determination.  Pet., ¶99.  The City wrongly interpreted the statute to
mean that an applicant has only a single 90-day clock after the first written
incompleteness determination.  Pet.,
¶100.  Planning argued that even if Jha
were entitled to approval pursuant to the Builder’s Remedy, it no longer
applied because Jha’s vesting rights had expired and the City’s Housing Element
was now in substantial compliance with the Housing Element Law.  Pet., ¶104.
            After
Jha received the City’s May 16 letter, she asked HCD to clarify the preliminary
application expiration provision.  Pet.,
¶103.  HCD confirmed that the application
remains valid after a second incompleteness determination so long as the
applicant resubmits within 90 days of that determination.  Pet., ¶103. 

 
            c.
Causes of Action
            The
first cause of action seeks mandamus for violation of the PSA.  The PSA requires public agencies to compile
lists of the information required from an applicant for a development project.  Pet., ¶109. 
It also has strict timelines when an agency must determine whether an
application is complete.  Pet., ¶109.  Agencies can only judge whether an
application is complete based on the items in the checklist.  Pet., ¶109.
            The
City’s Project Reviews violated the PSA because they treated project
consistency with a zoning ordinance or general plan as an item necessary for an
application to be complete.  Pet.,
¶110.  The City refused to process an
application based on a substantive decision regarding project consistency.  Pet., ¶110. 
Section 65931 defines development projects as activities involving the
issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other
entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.  Pet., ¶111. 
This does not include rezonings or GPAs. 
Pet., ¶111.  Courts have held that
applicants cannot use the PSA to compel legislative changes to a zoning
ordinance or a general plan.  Pet.,
¶111.  Conversely, the City cannot demand
an applicant to seek such changes through a PSA completeness determination.  Pet., ¶111. 
The City refused to accept Jha’s development application based on
purported non-compliance with substantive zoning standards and criteria, not
because of incomplete information.  Pet.,
¶114.  
            The
second cause of action seeks mandamus for violation of the HAA.  The City unlawfully disapproved the Project
and failed to proceed in the manner required by law.  Pet., ¶117. 
The City disapproved the low-cost housing Project without making one of
the findings under Section 65589.5(d)(1)-(5) and also did not support such
findings by a preponderance of evidence in the record.  Pet., ¶121. 
Although Jha submitted the preliminary application before the City’s
Housing Element was deemed substantially compliant with the Housing Element Law,
the City attempted to deny her the Builder’s Remedy.  Pet., ¶122. 

            The
third cause of action seeks mandamus for violation of the Density Bonus
Law.  The Project reserved 20% of the
units for low-cost housing.  Pet.,
¶128.  This entitled the Project to two
incentives or concessions and a waiver or reduction of any development
standards that will physically preclude the Project at the proposed density.  Pet., ¶128. 
The City denied Jha those incentives without making the public health
and safety findings required under the HAA. 
Pet., ¶129.
            The
fourth cause of action seeks declaratory relief.  The City has avoided obligations under state
law through its refusal to process housing development projects that qualify
under the Builder’s Remedy.  Pet., ¶132.
 
            d.
Prayer for Relief
            Jha
seeks a writ of mandate compelling the City to review and process development
applications pursuant to the PSA and SB 330. 
Pet. Prayer, ¶¶ 1-2.           Jha
also seeks a writ of mandate (1) voiding the June 27, 2023 denial of the PSA
appeal based on violation of section 655589.5(d), (2) compelling Planning to
accept and process the Project application, and (3) compelling the City and
Planning to take all steps necessary to process the application, approve the
Project, and issue all related approvals within 60 days.  Pet. Prayer, ¶3.  Jha also seeks a declaration concerning the City’s
violations.  Pet. Prayer, ¶7.
            Jha
also seeks attorneys’ fees, costs, and fines under section 65589.5.  Pet. Prayer, ¶¶ 8-10.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
September 25, 2023, Jha served the City with the Petition and Summons.
            On
November 8, 2023, the parties stipulated to extend the deadline for all responsive
pleading to February 1, 2024.
 
            B.
Demurrers
            Demurrers
are permitted in administrative mandate proceedings.  CCP §§1108, 1109.  A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the
pleading alone and will be sustained where the pleading is defective on its
face. 
            Where
pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect by way of a demurrer or
motion to strike or by motion for judgment on the pleadings.  CCP §430.30(a); Coyne v. Krempels,
(1950) 36 Cal.2d 257.  The party against
whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may object by demurrer or
answer to the pleading.  CCP §430.10.  A demurrer is timely filed within the 30-day
period after service of the complaint. 
CCP § 430.40; Skrbina v. Fleming Companies, (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th
1353, 1364. 
            A
demurrer may be asserted on any one or more of the following grounds: (a) The
court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the
pleading; (b) The person who filed the pleading does not have legal capacity to
sue; (c) There is another action pending between the same parties on the same
cause of action; (d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties; (e) The
pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; (f)
The pleading is uncertain (“uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible);
(g) In an action founded upon a contract, it cannot be ascertained from the
pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is implied by conduct;
(h) No certificate was filed as required by CCP §411.35 or (i) by §411.36.  CCP §430.10. 
Accordingly, a demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the
grounds for a demurrer must appear on the face of the pleading or from
judicially noticeable matters.  CCP
§430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan, (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.  The face of the pleading includes attachments
and incorporations by reference (Frantz v. Blackwell, (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 91, 94); it does not include inadmissible hearsay.  Day v. Sharp, (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d
904, 914.   
            The
sole issue on demurrer for failure to state a cause of action is whether the
facts pleaded, if true, would entitle the plaintiff to relief.  Garcetti v. Superior Court, (1996) 49
Cal.App.4th 1533, 1547; Limandri v. Judkins, (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326,
339.  The question of plaintiff’s ability
to prove the allegations of the complaint or the possible difficulty in making
such proof does not concern the reviewing court.  Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty
Co., (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 47.  The
ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all
facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.  Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher,
(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403. 
Nevertheless, this rule does not apply to allegations expressing mere
conclusions of law, or allegations contradicted by the exhibits to the
complaint or by matters of which judicial notice may be taken.  Vance v. Villa Park Mobilehome Estates,
(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 698, 709. 
            For
all demurrers filed after January 1, 2016, the demurring party must meet and
confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer. 
CCP §430.31(a).  As part of the
meet and confer process, the demurring party must identify all of the specific
causes of action that it believes are subject to demurrer and provide legal
support for the claimed deficiencies.  CCP
§430.31(a)(1).  The party who filed the
pleading must in turn provide legal support for its position that the pleading
is legally sufficient or, in the alternative, how the complaint,
cross-complaint, or answer could be amended to cure any legal
insufficiency.  Id.  The demurring party is responsible for filing
and serving a declaration that the meet and confer requirement has been met.  CCP §430.31(a)(3).   
            If
a demurrer is sustained, the court may grant leave to amend the pleading upon
any terms as may be just and shall fix the time within which the amendment or
amended pleading shall be filed.  CCP
§472a(c).  It is an abuse of discretion
to grant a motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend if there
is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of
action.  Dudley v. Department of
Transportation (“Dudley”) (2001), 90 Cal. App. 4th 255, 260.  However, in response to a demurrer and prior
to the case being at issue, a complaint or cross-complaint shall not be amended
more than three times, absent an offer to the trial court as to such additional
facts to be pleaded that there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be
cured to state a cause of action.  CCP
§430.41(e)(1).
 
            C.
Governing Law[2]
            1. The Housing Element Law
            The Legislature finds
that the provision of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income households
requires the cooperation of all levels of government.  §65580(c). 
The Housing Element Law details the substantive requirements that each
housing element must include. 
§65583(a)-(c).
            At least 90 days prior
to adoption of a revision of its housing element, or 60 days prior to the
adoption of a subsequent amendment thereto, the local jurisdiction agency shall
submit a draft element revision or draft amendment to HCD.  §65585(b)(1). 
In the preparation of review findings, HCD may consult with any public
agency, group, or person and shall receive and consider any written comments
from such entities regarding the draft or adopted element or amendment under
review.  §65585(c).
            HCD shall review the
draft and report its written findings to the planning agency within 90 days of
its receipt of the first draft submittal for each housing element revision, or
60 days of its receipt of a subsequent draft amendment or an adopted revision
or adopted amendment to an element. 
§65585(b)(3).  In its written
findings, HCD shall determine whether the draft element or draft amendment
substantially complies with the Housing Element Law.  §65585(d). 

            Prior to the adoption of
its draft element or draft amendment, the legislative body shall consider the
findings made by HCD if they become available within the time limits set in
section 65585.  §65585(e).
            If HCD finds that the
draft element or draft amendment does not substantially comply with this
article, the legislative body shall either change the draft element or
amendment to so comply or adopt the draft element or draft amendment without
changes.  §65585(f).  If the legislative body adopts without
changes, it shall include in its resolution of adoption written findings that explain
why the legislative body believes the draft element or draft amendment
substantially complies with the Housing Element Law despite HCD’s
findings.  §65585(f)(2).
            The legislative body shall
submit a copy to HCD promptly after adopting the element.  §65585(g). 
HCD shall then review it and report its findings to the planning
agency within 60 days of submission. 
§65585(h).  
“Despite the
mandatory nature of many of the Housing Element Law’s provisions compliance has
been mixed statewide.”  Martinez v.
City of Clovis, (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 193, 226.  The Legislature has amended the Housing
Element Law multiple times since 2017, and a 2018 amendment, AB 72, increased
HCD’s oversight powers.  Id.  AB 72 added HCD’s ability to review any local
government action that is inconsistent with an adopted housing element and to
revoke its findings of substantial compliance until the local jurisdiction
complies.  Id. at 226, n. 9; §65585(i),
(j).
The Housing Element
Law provides that a local government that fails to adopt a housing element that
has been found to be in substantial compliance within 120 days of the statutory
deadline is required to complete mandatory rezoning within one year instead of
the permitted three years.  §65583.2(c).  If the one-year requirement applies, the local
government’s housing element cannot be found to be in substantial compliance
until that city has completed the rezoning. 
§65588(e)(4)(C)(iii).
A local government that fails to substantially comply with the
Housing Element Law is subject to enforcement action by the Attorney General.  §65585(l). 
A failure to adopt a housing element found by HCD to be in substantial
compliance makes the local government ineligible for certain program funding.   §65589.11. 
A local government that is compliant with Housing Element Law
requirements is awarded preference for certain state funding programs.  §65589.9. 
A “compliant housing element” is defined for purposes of this preference
as “an adopted housing element that has been found to be in substantial
compliance with the requirements of this article by [HCD] pursuant to Section
65585.”  §65589.9(f)(2). 
 
            2. The
Housing Accountability Act 
            a. Legislative
Findings and Intent
            The
Legislature recognizes the lack of housing as a critical problem that threatens
the economic, environmental, and social quality of life in California.  §65589.5(a)(1)(A).  It adopted the HAA in 1982 to “significantly
increase the approval and construction of new housing for all economic segments
of California’s communities by meaningfully and effectively curbing the
capability of local governments to deny, reduce the density for, or render
infeasible housing development projects and emergency shelters.”  §65589.5(a)(2)(K).   To date, the goal remains
unfulfilled.  Id.
            The HAA reflects the
Legislature’s findings that “the availability of housing is of vital statewide
importance,” and that providing the necessary housing supply “requires the
cooperative participation of government and the private sector in an effort to expand
housing opportunities and accommodate the housing needs
of Californians of all economic levels.” 
§65580(a)-(b).  
            Effective
January 1, 2018, the Legislature significantly amended the HAA to strengthen
its provisions, expand its applicability, and increase local governments’
liability for violations.  The HAA found that California is in a housing
crisis that is “partially caused by activities and policies of many local governments
that limit the approval of housing, increase the cost of land for housing, and
require that high fees and exactions be paid by producers of housing,” §65589.5(a)(1)(B).
 The consequences of those actions
include discrimination against low-income and minority households, lack of
housing to support employment growth, imbalance in jobs and housing, reduced
mobility, urban sprawl, excessive commuting, and air quality deterioration.  §65589.5(a)(1)(C).
            Many local governments do not give
adequate attention to the economic, environmental, and social costs of
decisions that result in disapproval of housing development projects, reduction
in density of housing projects, and excessive standards for housing development
projects.  §65589.5(a)(1)(D).  The state’s
homeownership rate was at its lowest level since the 1940s and ranked 49 out of
the 50 states.  §65589.5(a)(2)(E). 
The lack of supply and rising costs are compounding inequality and limiting
advancement opportunities for many Californians.  §65589.5(a)(2)(F).
            The HAA should be “interpreted and implemented in a
manner to afford the fullest possible weight to the interest of, and the
approval and provision of, housing.” 
§65589.5(a)(2)(L). 
            It
is the intent of the Legislature that the conditions that would have a
specific, adverse impact upon the public health and safety under either section
65589.5(d)(2) and 65589.5(j)(1) arise infrequently.  §65589.5(a)(3).
            It
is the policy of the state that a local government not reject or make
infeasible housing development projects that contribute to meeting the need
determined pursuant to the HAA without a thorough analysis of the economic,
social, and environmental effects of the action and without complying with
section 65589.5(d).  §65589.5(b).
 
            b.
Project Approval Based on Vested Rights
            Section
65589.5 is referred to colloquially as the “anti-NIMBY law.”  Schellinger Brothherrs v. City of
Sebastopol, (2009) 19 Cal.App.4th 1245 1253, n. 9.  Subject to certain exceptions, a housing
development project shall be subject only to the ordinances, policies, and
standards adopted and in effect when a preliminary application which included
all the information required by section 65941.1(a) was submitted.  §65589.5(o)(1).  
            A housing development project “shall be deemed consistent,
compliant, and in conformity with an applicable plan, program, policy,
ordinance, standard, requirement, or other similar provision if there is
substantial evidence that would allow a reasonable person to conclude that the
housing development project or emergency shelter is consistent, compliant, or
in conformity.” §65589.5(f)(4). 
            Section
65589.5(j)(1) provides: 
 
“When a proposed housing development project complies with
applicable, objective general plan, zoning, and subdivision standards and
criteria, including design review standards, in effect at the time that the
housing development project's application is determined to be complete, but the
local agency proposes to disapprove the project or to impose a condition
that the project be developed at a lower density, the local agency shall
base its decision regarding the proposed housing development project upon written
findings supported by a preponderance of the evidence on the record that both
of the following conditions exist: 
(A) The housing development project would have a specific,
adverse impact upon the public health or safety unless the project is
disapproved or approved upon the condition that the project be developed at a
lower density. As used in this paragraph, a “specific, adverse impact” means a
significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on
objective, identified written public health or safety standards, policies, or
conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed complete. 
(B) There is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate
or avoid the adverse impact identified pursuant to paragraph (1), other than
the disapproval of the housing development project or the approval of the
project upon the condition that it be developed at a lower density.” (emphasis
added). 
 
            Section 65589.5(j) applies to market rate housing as well
as affordable housing.  Honchariw v.
County of Steinhaus, (2011) 200
Cal.App.4th 1066, 1070.  The HAA applies to all residential housing
developments and takes away the agency’s ability to deny residential projects
based on subjective development policies.  Id. at
1072-77.     
            “Disapprove
the housing development project” includes any instance in which a local agency
“votes on a proposed housing development project application and it is
disapproved”, “fails to comply with the timer periods specified in Section
65950” or fails to meet the time limits specified in Section 65913.3.  §65589.5(h)(6).
            If the court finds that an agency acted in bad faith in
disapproving a project in violation of the HAA, the appropriate remedy is an
“order or judgment directing the local agency to approve the housing
development project.” §65589.5(k)(1)(A)(ii).  “Bad faith” “includes, but
is not limited to, an action that is frivolous or otherwise entirely without
merit.” §65589.5(l).  
            The local jurisdiction bears the burden of proving that its
decision conforms to the conditions specified in section 65589.5. 
§65589.6.   
 
            c.
The Builder’s Remedy
            A local agency shall
not disapprove a housing development project for very
low, low-, or moderate-income households, or an emergency shelter, or condition
approval in a manner that renders the housing development project infeasible
for development for the use of very low, low- or moderate-income households,
including through the use of design review standards, unless it makes written
findings, based upon a preponderance of the evidence in the record, for one of five
 conclusions: 
            (1) the local jurisdiction
has adopted a housing element in substantial compliance with the HAA and has
met or exceeded its share of the regional housing need allocation pursuant to
section 65584 for the planning period for the income category proposed for the
housing development project, provided that any disapproval or conditional
approval shall not be based on any of the reasons prohibited by section
65008.  §65589.5(d)(1).
            (2) the proposed
housing development would have a specific, adverse impact on the public health
or safety that cannot be feasibly mitigated without rendering the project
unaffordable or infeasible.  A specific,
adverse impact on public health or safety does not include inconsistency with
the zoning ordinance or general plan land use designation.  §65589.5(d)(2)(A); 
            (3) denial of the
project is required to comply with specific state or federal law, and there is
no feasible method to comply without rendering the project unaffordable or
infeasible; 
            (4) the proposed
land for the project is zoned for, and surrounded on at least two sides by,
agriculture or resource preservation purposes; 

            (5) the housing
development project or emergency shelter is inconsistent with both the
jurisdiction’s zoning ordinance and general plan land use designation as
specified in any element of the general plan as it existed on the date the
application was deemed complete, and the jurisdiction has adopted a revised
housing element in accordance with Section 65588 that is in substantial
compliance with the Housing Element Law. 
§§ 65589.5(d)(1)-(5).  
            Section 65589.5(d)(5)
means that, when the local government does not have a housing element in substantial
compliance with the Housing Element Law, it cannot disapprove an applicable
project based on inconsistencies with the jurisdiction’s zoning ordinance or
general plan land use designation.  This
is colloquially referred to as the “Builder’s Remedy.”  
            A “housing
development project” includes any mixed-use development consisting of
residential and nonresidential uses with at least two-thirds of the square
footage designated for residential use. 
§65589.5(h)(2).  “Housing for very
low, low-, or moderate-income households” includes buildings where 20% of the
units are sold or rented to lower income households.  §65589.5(h)(3).  
            “Deemed complete”
means the applicant has submitted a preliminary application pursuant to section
65941.1 or, if the applicant has not submitted a preliminary application, has
submitted a complete application pursuant to section 65943.  §65589.5(h)(5).  
            “Disapproval of a
housing development project” includes whenever a local agency votes on a
proposed housing development project application and the application is
disapproved, including any required land use approvals or entitlements
necessary for the issuance of a building permit.  §65589.5(h)(6)(A).
            A
“specific, adverse impact” is a “significant, quantifiable, direct, and
unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified written public health or
safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the
application was deemed complete.” §65589.5(j)(1)(A).  The Legislature’s
intent is that conditions that would have a specific, adverse impact upon the
public health and safety should arise infrequently. 
§65589.5(a)(3).   
 
            d. Consistency
with Other Laws
            New
housing developments constructed within the coastal zone shall, where feasible,
provide housing units for persons and families of low or moderate income.  §65590(d). 
Where it is not feasible to provide these housing units in a proposed
new housing development, the local government shall require the developer to
provide such housing, if feasible to do so, at another location within the same
city or county, either within the coastal zone or within three miles thereof.  Id.
            Nothing in
the HAA relieves the local agency from complying with, inter alia, the
Coastal Act or the California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”). 
§65589.5(e).  Nothing in the HAA, aside from
section 65589.5(o), shall be construed to prohibit a local agency from
requiring the housing development project to comply with objective,
quantifiable, written development standards, conditions, and policies
appropriate to, and consistent with, meeting the jurisdiction’s share of the
regional housing need.  §65589.5(f)(1).  However, the development standards, conditions,
and policies shall be applied to facilitate and accommodate development at the
density permitted on the site and proposed by the development.  Id.
 
            D.
Statement of Facts
            1.
The City’s Evidence
            The
City first submitted its draft housing element to HCD for review on July 7,
2021.  RJN Ex. 1.  On September 3, 2021, HCD informed the City
that although the draft addressed many statutory requirements, it still
required revisions to comply with the Housing Element Law.  RJN Ex. 1. 
The letter included an appendix of required revisions.  RJN Ex. 1.
            To
remain on an eight-year planning cycle, the City needed to adopt a compliant
housing element within 120 calendar days of the October 15, 2021 statutory due
date.  RJN Ex. 1.  Under section 65588(e)(4), a failure to do so
would require the City to revise its housing element every four years until it
has adopted two consecutive elements before the statutory deadline.  RJN Ex. 1.
            The
City adopted a housing element on November 24, 2021.  RJN Ex. 2. 
On February 22, 2022, HCD acknowledged that this element addressed most
of the requirements at issue in the September 3, 2021 notice.  RJN Ex. 2. 
However, an additional revision was still necessary to fully comply with
the Housing Element Law.  RJN Ex. 2.  The element’s programs and actions needed to
include metrics and milestones to target significant and meaningful
affirmatively furthering fair housing outcomes. 
RJN Ex. 2.  Once the City revised
and re-adopted the housing element to comply with the identified requirements,
it would meet the statutory requirements of the Housing Element Law.  RJN Ex. 2.
            On
April 28, 2022, the City submitted a revised draft housing element update to
HCD.  RJN Ex. 3.  On May 11, 2022, HCD informed the City that
the revised draft element met the statutory requirements outlined in HCD’s February
22, 2022 letter.  RJN Ex. 3.  The housing element would comply with the Housing
Element Law when the City adopted the revisions and submitted the adopted
element to HCD pursuant to section 65585. 
RJN Ex. 3.  HCD recommended that the
City expeditiously adopt these changes and submit them to HCD so that the City
may regain housing element compliance. 
RJN Ex. 3.
            On
June 14, 2022, HCD received the City’s newly adopted housing element.  RJN Ex. 4. 
On June 29, 2022, HCD confirmed that the adopted housing element is in
full compliance with the Housing Element Law and found it to be substantially
the same as the element reviewed by HCD on May 11, 2022.  RJN Ex. 4. 
HCD cautioned that the City still needed to timely and effectively
implement all programs therein.  RJN Ex.

            2.
Jha’s Evidence
            a.
Legislative History of SB 330
            The
September 2019 Senate Floor Analysis of SB 330, the Housing Crisis Act of 2019,
explains that it amends both the HAA and PSA. 
RJN Ex. G.  In amending the PSA,
SB 330 established a procedure for filing an initial application and provides
that a housing development project shall be deemed to have a complete initial
application upon providing information specified.  Ex. G, p. 5. 
HCD shall adopt a standardized form that applicants may use for the
purposes of satisfying a complete application. 
Ex. G, p. 6.  
In amending the HAA, SB 330 prohibited a local agency from
applying ordinances, policies, and standards to a development after submission
of its complete preliminary application. 
Ex. G, p. 6.  The analysis
explains that the bill would prohibit cities from changing the rules on
builders who are going through the approval process.  Ex. G, pp. 6-7.
 
            b.
HCD’s Clarifying Memorandum
            On
March 16, 2023, HCD sent all 539 local jurisdictions a memorandum clarifying
what they must do to avoid the consequences of non-compliance under the Housing
Element Law.  RJN Ex. A.  A jurisdiction first needs to submit a draft
housing element to HCD at least 90 days before adoption.  Ex. A. 
HCD will then issue findings determining whether the draft element is
substantially compliant.  Ex. A.  
            A
local jurisdiction cannot not adopt the draft element until it had received and
considered HCD’s findings.  Ex. A.  If a jurisdiction submits an “adopted”
element to HCD before either submitting a draft element or considering HCD’s
findings thereon, HCD will consider the “adopted” element a draft element for
purposes of both HCD review and statutory compliance.  Ex. A.
            If
HCD finds the draft element not substantially compliant, the jurisdiction may revise
the draft to address the findings.  Ex.
A.  If it chooses instead to adopt the
draft element without changes, it must include written findings explaining why
the jurisdiction believes that the draft substantially complies.  Ex. A. 
The jurisdiction must then submit the adopted element to HCD for its findings.  Ex. A. 

            In
other words, a jurisdiction does not have the authority to determine for itself
whether the adopted element is in substantial compliance with the Housing
Element Law.  Ex. A.  It can only provide reasoning why HCD should
find that it is.  Ex. A.  A jurisdiction is “in compliance” as of the
date of HCD’s letter finding the adopted element in substantial compliance.  RJN Ex. A.
 
            c.
La Cañada Flintridge
            On
June 8, 2023, HCD sent a Notice of Violation to La Cañada Flintridge for denial
of a housing project.  RJN Ex. B.  La Cañada Flintridge denied the housing
project appeal because the city asserted that its housing element, adopted on
October 4, 2022, complied with the Housing Element Law and the Builder’s Remedy
did not apply.  Ex. B.
            The
Notice of Violation explained that the city did not have a compliant housing
element on October 4, 2022.  RJN Ex.
B.  On December 3, 2021, HCD issued
findings that La Cañada Flintridge’s draft element required significant
revisions.  Ex. B.  On October 4, 2022, La Cañada Flintridge
adopted a housing element that failed to address HCD’s findings.  Ex. B. 
On December 6, 2022, HCD found the adopted element still required
critical revisions to comply with state law. 
Ex. B.  On February 21, 2023, the
city adopted a housing element that addressed HCD’s new findings.  Ex. B. 
On April 24, 2023, HCD found that the city was not in substantial
compliance.  Ex. B.  The city passed the housing element over a
year after the October 15, 2021 deadline and, under section 65588(e)(4)(C)(iii),
was required to complete the required rezoning before HCD could find the
element in substantial compliance.  Ex.
B.  
Based on this chronology, the Notice of Violation advised the
city that it was still not in compliance with the Housing Element Law and could
not backdate its housing element compliance to circumvent the Builder’s Remedy
for the project at issue.  Ex. B.
            On
December 29, 2023, the Attorney General filed an opening brief in Housing
Defense.  RJN Ex. D.  The brief asserted that La Cañada Flintridge wrongly
assumed that it could retroactively self-certify its housing element as
substantially complaint.  Ex. D.  However, no local jurisdiction can declare or
certify that its housing element is substantially compliant with Housing
Element Law without HCD review.  Ex.
D.  HCD is the sole government agency
statutorily vested with the power to make such findings.  Ex. D. 
The Attorney General agreed with HCD that, pursuant to section
65588(e)(4)(C)(iii), La Cañada Flintridge was required to complete the required
rezoning before HCD could find its housing element to be in substantial
compliance.  Ex. D.
 
            d.
Redondo Beach
            On
May 8, 2023, HCD sent the City of Redondo Beach a Letter of Technical
Assistance regarding a developer’s appeal for a proposed housing project.  RJN Ex. C. 
The city’s incompleteness determination for the developer’s application indicated
that the Builder’s Remedy did not apply because the city’s housing element
adopted on July 5, 2022 substantially complied with the Housing Element Law.  Ex. C. 
The applicant submitted the preliminary application after the city adopted
the housing element but before HCD’s September 1, 2022, letter finding the
adopted element to be in substantial compliance.  Ex. C.
            The
Letter of Technical Assistance stated that a local jurisdiction does not have
the authority to determine that its adopted element is in substantial
compliance.  Ex. C.  The compliance date is the date of HCD’s
letter finding the adopted element is in substantial compliance.  Ex. C. 
For the city, this date was after the applicant submitted a preliminary
application.  Ex. C.[3]
 
            e.
Jha’s Application
            On
June 12, 2023, Planning issued an Appeal Recommendation Report recommending
that the City Council deny Jha’s appeal. 
RJN Ex. F, p.1.  In part, Planning
explained that Jha submitted her preliminary application on June 24, 2022.  Ex. F, p. 18. 
The Project therefore had vesting rights to the regulatory environment
in place after the City had adopted a substantially compliant housing element
but before HCD issued certification of substantial compliance.  RJN Ex. F, p. 18.  On June 29, 2022, HCD deemed the housing
element to be in full compliance with the Housing Element Law.  RJN Ex. F, p. 18.  To maintain those vesting rights, Jha needed
to submit a Development Project Application by December 21, 2022, and make the
application complete within 90 days of the first letter determining the
application was incomplete.  RJN Ex. F,
p. 18.  
            Planning
again acknowledged that Jha submitted a vesting Preliminary Application on June
24, 2022, before HCD certified the City’s adopted housing element.  RJN Ex. F, pp. 20-21, 30.  However, Jha failed to submit a completed Development
Project Application on time to maintain vesting rights.  RJN Ex. F, p. 21.  The preliminary application therefore no
longer had any force or effect.  RJN Ex.
F, p. 30.
 
            E. Analysis
            The
City demurs to the Petition’s second cause of action seeking mandamus for
violation of the HAA.[4]  Jha accurately states that
the City’s demurrer is based entirely on an argument that it had a
substantially compliant housing element when Jha submitted her preliminary
application and the Builder’s Remedy does not apply.  Opp. at 11.
            The
pertinent facts are as follows.  On
April 28, 2022, the City submitted a revised draft housing element update to
HCD.  RJN Ex. 3.  On May 11, 2022, HCD informed the City that its
revised draft element met the statutory requirements outlined in HCD’s February
22, 2022 letter.  Ex. 3.  HCD stated that the housing element would
comply with the Housing Element Law when the City adopted the revisions and
submitted the adopted element to HCD pursuant to section 65585.  Ex. 3. 
HCD recommended that the City expeditiously adopt these changes and
submit them to HCD so that the City may regain housing element compliance.  Ex. 3.
            On
June 14, 2022, HCD received the City’s newly adopted housing element.  RJN Ex. 4. 
Jha submitted her preliminary application on June 23, 2022.  Pet., ¶53. 
On June 29, 2022, HCD confirmed that the adopted housing element is in
full compliance with the Housing Element Law and found it to be substantially
the same as the element reviewed by HCD on May 11, 2022.  RJN Ex. 4. 

At issue is whether the Builder’s Remedy applies because Jha
submitted her preliminary application before HCD’s June 29, 2022
certification.  The
Petition asserts the City unlawfully disapproved of her Project including
low-cost housing without making one of the findings under section 65589.5(d)(1)-(5).  Pet., ¶121. 
Jha submitted her preliminary application before the City’s housing element
was deemed substantially compliant with the Housing Element Law, and the City wrongly
denied her rights under the Builder’s Remedy. 
Pet., ¶122.  
            The
City argues that, at a minimum, it had a substantially compliant housing
element as of June 14, 2022 when it adopted the revised housing element text
that HCD twice determined to be substantially compliant on May 11 and June 29,
2022.  The City argues that section
65583’s list of requirements for a substantially compliant housing element does
not include a post-adoption written determination by HCD of substantial
compliance.  Dem. at 11.  Nor is there anything in the HAA’s text,
including the Builder’s Remedy provision (§65589.5(d)(5)) and the vesting
provision (§65589.5(o), stating that a HCD post-adoption determination fixes
the date that a jurisdiction has adopted a substantially compliant housing
element.  HCD’s June 29, 2022 post-adoption
determination of substantial compliance relates back to the City’s June 14, 2022
adoption of the housing element.  Dem. at
9, 10; Reply at 4.  
            The City contends that there are
two ways a local jurisdiction may obtain a determination of substantial
compliance.  First, HCD may determine
that the housing element is substantially compliant.  §65585(d), (e), (h), (i).  If HCD makes this determination, there is a
rebuttable presumption of substantial compliance in any action challenging the
validity of the housing element. 
§65589.3.  Second, a court may
adjudicate and determine that the adopted housing element is substantially
compliant.  §65585(l); 65587(b.  Thus, a housing element’s substantial
compliance is not solely dependent on a HCD post-adoption determination because
a court may separately decide that a housing element is substantially
compliant.  Dem. at 11.[5]
            To
require HCD’s post-adoption certification of a housing element’s substantial
compliance would impermissibly read a non-existent requirement into the
Government Code.  CCP §1858 (court may
not “insert what has been omitted…”); DiCampli-Mintz v. County of Santa
Clara, (2012) 55 Cal.4th 983, 992 (court may not rewrite the law
under the guise of construction). Further, allowing the date of HCD
determination to fix the date of substantial compliance would unfairly place
the City’s ability to enforce its planning and zoning codes at the whim of
HCD’s workload-influenced timelines.  Dem.
at 11.[6]
 
a. Interpretation
of the Housing Element Law
The City’s argument requires interpretation of the Housing Element
Law.  In construing a statute, a court
must ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of
the law.  Brown v. Kelly Broadcasting
Co., (1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 724.  The
court first looks to the language of the statute, attempting to give effect to
the usual, ordinary import of the language and seeking to avoid making any
language mere surplusage.  Brown v.
Kelly Broadcasting Co., (1989) 48 Cal 3d 711, 724.  Significance, if possible, is attributed to
every word, phrase, sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative
purpose.   Orange County Employees
Assn. v. County of Orange, (1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 833, 841.  The statutory language must be harmonized
with provisions relating to the same subject matter to the extent
possible.  Id.  Statutes are not construed in isolation and
every statute must be read and harmonized with the statutory scheme.  People v. Ledesma, (1997) 16 Cal.4th
90, 95.   
“’The statute's words generally provide the most
reliable indicator of legislative intent; if they are clear and unambiguous, ‘[t]here
is no need for judicial construction and a court may not indulge in it.
[Citation.]’” MCI Communications Services, Inc. v. California Dept. of Tax
& Fee Administration, (“MCI”) (2018) 28 Cal. App. 5th 635, 643.  If a statute is
ambiguous and susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, the court
may resort to extrinsic aids, including principles of construction and
legislative history.  MacIsaac v. Waste Management Collection
& Recycling, Inc., (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1082 (quoting Riverview Fire Protection Dist. v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd.,
(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1120, 1126).  
Where ambiguity still remains, the court
should consider “reason, practicality, and common sense.”  Id. at 1084.  This requires consideration of the statute’s
purpose, the evils to be remedied, public policy, and contemporaneous
administrative construction.  MCI,
supra, 28 Cal.App.5th at
643.  The enactment must be given a
reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent with the apparent purpose
and intent of the lawmakers, practical rather than technical in nature, and
which, when applied, will result in wise policy rather than mischief or
absurdity.  Lungren v. Deukmejian,
(1988) 45 Cal. 3d 727, 735.  

Section 65585 governs the process for local jurisdictions to
prepare and submit housing elements to the HCD for compliance certification.  At
least 90 days prior to adoption of a revision of its housing element, the local
jurisdiction shall submit a draft element revision to HCD.  §65585(b)(1). 
HCD shall review the draft and report its written findings whether the
draft element substantially complies with the Housing Element Law within 90
days of its receipt.   §65585(b)(3),
(d).  Prior to the adoption of its draft
element, the legislative body shall consider the findings made by HCD if they
are timely made.  §65585(e).  If HCD finds that the draft element does not
substantially comply, the legislative body shall either change the draft
element to comply or adopt the draft element without changes.  §65585(f). 
If the legislative body adopts without changes, it shall include in its
resolution of adoption written findings that explain why it believes the draft
element substantially complies with the Housing Element Law despite HCD’s
findings.  §65585(f)(2).  The planning agency shall submit a copy to
HCD promptly after adopting the element. 
§65585(g).  HCD shall then
review it and report its findings to the planning agency within 60 days of
submission.  §65585(h).  
The City had not completed
this procedure as of Jha’s June 24, 2022 preliminary application.  Section 65585(g) requires a local
government to submit a copy of a housing element or amendment to HCD promptly
following its adoption.  HCD shall then
review it and report its findings to the planning agency within 60 days of
submission.  §65585(h).  HCD had not reviewed and determined
compliance until after Jha’s preliminary application.  
Section 65589.5(d)(5) expressly states that
the Builder’s Remedy applies unless the local government “has adopted a revised
housing element in accordance with Section 65588 that is in substantial
compliance with this article.”  “This
article” means the Housing Element Law.  Jha
correctly argues (Opp. at 11) that section 65589.5(d)(5) has two
requirements.  The housing element must
substantially comply with the Housing Element Law and be adopted “in
accordance with Section 65588.” 
§65589.5(d)(5).  
Section 65588, in turn, specifies that HCD
may find the sixth revision element substantially compliant with the Housing
Element Law per section 65585. 
§65588(e)(4)(A).  Section 65585(g)
provides that the planning
agency shall submit a copy to HCD promptly after adopting the element.  Section 65585(h) provides that HCD “shall, within 60 days, review adopted housing elements or
amendments and report its findings to the planning agency.”  The City’s argument that the Housing Element
Law does not require a post-adoption determination of substantial compliance by
HCD is contradicted by section 65585(g) and (h).  A post-adoption HCD determination is a
mandatory Housing Element Law requirement. 

The City responds that this interpretation
elevates form over substance. 
Substantial compliance with the Housing Element Law means “’actual
compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective
of the statute’, as distinguished from ‘mere technical imperfections of
form.’”  Fonseca v. City of Gilroy,
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1185.  Reply
at 10.  The City’s argument answers
itself.  There is no actual compliance
with Housing Element Law procedure if a local jurisdiction can adopt a housing
element without final HCD certification under section 65585(h).
The court’s conclusion that a post-adoption
HCD determination is required is supported by other parts of the Housing
Element Law, particularly the rezoning deadline penalty for late housing
element adoption.  For an adopted housing
element to be timely, sections 65583(c)(1)(A), 65583.2(c), and
65588(e)(4)(C)(i) require that a city’s housing element be found by HCD to be in substantial compliance with the Housing
Element Law.  Without such a finding, the
city must complete rezoning within a year after the statutory deadline.  §§ 65583(c)(1)(A)), §65583.2(c), 65588(e)(4)(C)(i).  Additionally, that city’s housing element
cannot be found to be in substantial compliance until it has completed the
rezoning.  §65588(e)(4)(C)(iii).  It would not make sense to require HCD
approval of a housing element’s substantial compliance to avoid late penalties
but not for substantial compliance generally.[7]
Jha adds (Opp. at
12) that HCD may review any local government action that is inconsistent with
an adopted housing element and revoke its findings of substantial compliance
until the local jurisdiction complies. 
§65585(i), (j).  HCD’s authority
to revoke a substantial compliance finding indicates that a post-adoption HCD
determination is necessary in the first place. 

Jha also cites section 65589.9, which provides that a
local government that is compliant with Housing Element Law requirements is
awarded preference for certain state funding programs.  §65589.9. 
A “compliant housing element” is defined for purposes of this preference
as “an adopted housing element that has been found to be in substantial
compliance with the requirements of this article by [HCD] pursuant to Section
65585.”  §65589.9(f)(2).  Opp. at 12.
The City replies that section 65589.9(a)’s definition of a “compliant
housing element” only applies when awarding extra points or preference in the
scoring of competitive housing and infrastructure programs and has nothing to
do with the Builder’s Remedy.  Reply at 5.  True, but statutes are not construed in
isolation and the various provisions of the Housing Element Law should be
construed in harmony if possible.  People
v. Ledesma, supra, 16 Cal.4th at 95.   
Finally, the court’s
interpretation to require HCD post-adoption approval is supported by the fact
that the HAA must be interpreted
and implemented in a manner to afford the fullest weight to the interest of and
approval of housing.  §65589.5(a)(2)(L).  The City notes that courts
have refused to apply rules of liberal construction to ignore the statutory
language or construe it to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the
face of the statute or from its legislative history.  Reznitskiy v. County of Marin (2022)
79 Cal.App.5th 1016, 1036.  This argument
begs the question; the requirement of HCD approval is part of the HAA as
properly interpreted.  
            As a matter of statutory
interpretation and harmonizing the statutory scheme, the Housing Element Law
requires HCD post-adoption approval of a local government’s housing
element.  
 
            b. HCD, the Attorney General,
and Planning Staff Agree With The Court’s Interpretation
On May 11, 2022, HCD informed the City that its revised housing
element will comply with the State Housing Element Law “when the revisions are
adopted and submitted to HCD, pursuant to Government Code section 65585.”  RJN Ex. 3. 
This language clearly shows that HCD believed that an adopted housing
element is not substantially compliant until HCD has approved it.
On March 16, 2023, HCD sent a clarifying
memorandum to all local jurisdictions. 
RJN Ex. A.  The memorandum outlined
the process for submitting a draft housing element to avoid the consequences of
non-compliance under the Housing Element Law. 
Ex. A.  HCD emphasized a
jurisdiction is not “in compliance” until the date of HCD’s letter finding the
adopted element in substantial compliance. 
Ex. A.  
            In a June 8, 2023 Notice of
Violation to La Cañada Flintridge, HCD explained that the city, which asserted that
its housing element complied with the Housing Element Law, could not be backdated
to the adoption date to circumvent the Builder’s Remedy for the project at
issue.  RJN Ex. B.
            On May 8, 2023, HCD sent the
City of Redondo Beach a Letter of Technical Assistance regarding the applicant’s
appeal for a proposed housing project. 
RJN Ex. C.  The applicant
submitted the preliminary application after the city adopted the housing
element but before HCD’s letter finding the adopted element to be in substantial
compliance.  Ex. C.  The city’s incompleteness determination
indicated that the applicant did not have a Builder’s Remedy because the city’s
adopted housing element substantially complied with the Housing Element Law.  Ex. C. 
The Letter of Technical Assistance stated that a local jurisdiction does
not have the authority to determine that its adopted element is in substantial
compliance.  Ex. C.  The substantial compliance date is the date
of HCD’s letter finding the adopted element was in substantial compliance.  Ex. C. 

            The City contends that the La Cañada
Flintridge matter is not analogous because HCD determined that La Cañada Flintridge’s
adopted housing element was not substantially compliant after the applicant
filed its preliminary application.  In the
Redondo Beach matter, the developer submitted a preliminary application
before HCD determined that Redondo Beach had a substantially compliant draft
housing element.  Here, HCD approved the
City’s draft housing element as substantially compliant before Jha submitted
her preliminary application.  Reply at
4-5.
While the City is correct that both matters
are factually distinguishable, HCD’s position in both was plain that it must
determine an adopted housing element’s substantial compliance under the Housing
Element Law, and substantial compliance cannot be backdated to avoid a
Builder’s Remedy. 
Courts generally defer to an agency’s
interpretation when that agency possesses special familiarity with the legal
and regulatory issues at issue.  Reddell v. California Coastal Com.,
(2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 956, 965.  Jha cites Boling v. Public Employment Relations Bd. (2018) 5
Cal.5th 898, 911, which stated that an agency’s construction has greater weight
when the legal text is technical, obscure, complex, open-ended, or entwined
with issues of fact, policy, and discretion. 
Opp. at 15.  
The City replies that HCD’s interpretation
is not absolute.  Reply at 10-11.  The courts independently interpret the law,
giving deference to the determination of the agency appropriate to the
circumstances of the agency action.  Fonseca
v. City of Gilroy, (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1193.  HCD’s informal interpretation of statutory
requirements is not binding on a court, and the weight afforded to such
interpretations depends ultimately on the court’s assessment of its
reasonableness.  Reply at 10-11.  
It is true that HCD’s interpretation is
informal and not binding.  For an ambiguous statute, the agency's "construction
... is entitled to consideration and respect, [but] it is not binding and it is
ultimately for the judiciary to interpret[.]" Murphy v. Kenneth Cole
Prods., Inc., (2007) 40 Cal. 4th 1094, 1105, n.7. The agency’s
interpretation is entitled to consideration if such construction has a
reasonable basis.  Ontario Community
Foundations, Inc. v. State Bd. of Equalization, (1984)35 Cal.3d 811, 816.  The City fails to show the HCD’s
interpretation of an element’s compliance date is unreasonable.[8]

Finally, the City argues that HCD’s
interpretation requiring post-adoption certification is tantamount to an
underground regulation.  Reply at 8-9.  This is an issue raised for the first time in
reply and need not be considered.  Regency Outdoor Advertising v. Carolina Lances, Inc.,
(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1333 (new evidence/issues raised for the first time
in a reply brief are not properly presented to a trial court and may be
disregarded).  In any event, HCD’s
letters are received in this case only to show HCD’s interpretation of the
Housing Element Law.

 
             c. Public Policy
            The City’s policy argument is that a
requirement of post-adoption certification by HCD of a housing element’s
substantial compliance unfairly places the City’s ability to enforce its
planning and zoning codes at the whim of HCD’s workload-influenced
timelines.  Dem. at 11.  
Jha responds by citing the Senate Floor
Analysis of SB 330, which explains that SB 330 would prohibit cities from
changing the rules on builders who are going through the approval process.  RJN Ex. G, pp. 6-7.  Jha argues that the City’s position would
leave developers in limbo.  In this case,
the City adopted a housing element in November 2021 only for HCD to find it
non-compliant in February 2022.  RJN Exs.
1-2; Pet., ¶28.  Under the City’s
interpretation, every applicant between the November 2021 date of adoption and the
February 2022 HCD determination of non-compliance would not know whether the
City could defeat any assertion of the Builder’s Remedy.  Opp. at 18.
            The City replies that a requirement
of HCD post-adoption finding of substantial compliance would also result in
limbo.  Developers would not know when
this determination would materialize, even if HCD had already confirmed the
substantive terms comply with the Housing Element Law.  Reply at 8.
Public
policy only comes into play where plain language, statutory purpose, and
principles of construction and legislative history do not resolve the
interpretation issue.  See MCI,
supra, 28 Cal.App.5th at
643; Lungren v. Deukmejian, (1988) 45 Cal. 3d 727, 735.  Policy arguments do not favor
either party.[9]
            
F. Conclusion
            The City fails to demonstrate that
its adopted housing element substantially complied with the Housing Element Law
before HCD’s July 29, 2022 post-adoption determination to that effect.  This procedure
had not been completed by the date of Jha’s preliminary application.  Under the HAA, Jha may invoke the Builder's Remedy
in section 65589.5(d).  In doing so, the
City still can require the Project to comply with
objective, quantifiable, written development standards, conditions, and
policies appropriate to, and consistent with, meeting the jurisdiction’s share
of the regional housing need. 
§65589.5(f)(1).  The demurrer is
overruled and the motion to strike is denied.  The City has 20 days’ leave to answer only.
