And here is a summary in English text:

Judge Gary Y. Tanaka has issued a tentative ruling granting defendant Nicholas Mondek, M.D.'s motion for summary judgment in the case of Carolina Mendez-Arguello, et al. v. Provide Little Company of Mary Medical Center, et al. The plaintiffs alleged medical malpractice during the labor and delivery of minor Carolina Mendez-Arguello, but the defendant claimed that it complied with the standard of care. The judge found that the defendant met its initial burden by showing that one or more elements of the cause of action could not be established, and that the plaintiffs failed to provide specific facts to show that a triable issue of material fact existed. The judge also found that the defendant's expert testimony showed compliance with the standard of care, and that the plaintiffs failed to provide expert testimony to controvert this opinion. As a result, the judge granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
