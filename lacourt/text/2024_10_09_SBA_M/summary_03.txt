And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant Ruby Bravo's motion to vacate the default and default judgment entered against her on February 28, 2024. The judge found that the default was entered due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect on Bravo's part. The judge further found that the default was entered without any written opposition from the plaintiff, and therefore granted the motion. The judge ordered Bravo to file and serve her proposed answer within 3 days of the ruling, and to give notice of the ruling.
