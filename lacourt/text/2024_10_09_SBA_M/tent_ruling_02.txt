Nicholas Mondek, M.D.’s
Motion for Summary Judgment 
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING

Nicholas Mondek, M.D.’s Motion for Summary Judgment is
granted. 
 
Background
 
Plaintiffs filed the Complaint on March 14, 2023. Plaintiffs
allege the following facts. Plaintiffs allege medical malpractice involving the
labor and delivery of minor Carolina Mendez-Arguello. The minor infant suffered
neurological injuries due to Defendants’ negligence. 
 
             Motion for Summary Judgment

The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the
parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations,
trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”  (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal. App. 4th 1110, 1119.)
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden
is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.”  (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal. App. 4th 1510, 1519.)  A
defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication “has met his or
her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has
shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.”  CCP § 437c(p)(2).  “Once the defendant . . . has met that
burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a triable issue
of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense
thereto.” CCP § 437c(p)(2).  “If the
plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.”  Avivi
v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal. App. 4th 463, 467.
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the
court must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except
evidence to which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all
reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, in the light most
favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.”  (Avivi,
159 Cal.App.4th at 467; CCP § 437c(c).)
 
Defendant moves for an order granting summary judgment. The motion is made on the
grounds that the Complaint has no merit, and that Defendant complied with the
standard of care. 
 
Defendant has met its initial burden to show that
Plaintiffs’ causes of action have no merit by showing that one or more elements
of the cause of action cannot be established. 
(Defendant’s Separate Statement of Facts and Supporting Evidence, 1-12.)
Plaintiffs have not met their burden, pursuant to CCP § 437c(p)(2), to provide
specific facts to show that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the
cause of action. Plaintiffs filed no separate statement of facts which, in and
of itself, is a ground to grant this motion. CCP § 437c(b)(1)(3). In fact,
Plaintiffs filed a notice of non-opposition.
 
The standard of care with respect to acts of medical
professionals is exclusively within the knowledge of experts, and, thus,
whether the medical professional met or breached the standard of care can only
be established by expert testimony.  See, Landeros v. Flood (1976) 17 Cal.3d
399, 410.  Here, Defendant submitted the
expert testimony of Thomas Schares, M.D., M.B.A. Dr. Schares testifies that Defendant
complied with the applicable standard of care. 
(Declaration, Thomas Schares, M.D., M.B.A., ¶¶ 1-18.) Plaintiffs have not
met their burden to provide expert testimony to controvert the opinions of
Defendant’s expert.  See, Willard v. Hagemeister (1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 406, 412.
 
            Thus, for the foregoing reasons,
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is granted. 

            Defendant
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
