And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court issued a minute order on March 16, 2023, stating that Happy Sky Inc. is the owner of the property and is deemed in possession of the property. The matter was stayed as to Novelette D. Woods, with the Court advising Plaintiff's counsel to refer the matter to the United States Attorney's Office. A new eviction case was later filed, and a trial was held with a finding for Woods. Now, Plaintiff seeks clarification on the Court's minute order, specifically regarding who has the right to possession of the premises. The Court is unclear on what ambiguity exists and will discuss the matter further at a motion hearing.
