And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, which adds new claims and allegations to the original complaint. The plaintiff seeks to amend its complaint to add claims for fraud in the contract formation, breach of contract, and interference with a contractual relationship. The defendants do not oppose the motion. The judge finds that granting the motion will not prejudice the defendants, particularly since they have not served written discovery on the plaintiff or taken any deposition. The court agrees with the plaintiff that the case has progressed very little, and the defendants have not yet served their third amended cross-complaint. Therefore, the motion is granted, and the plaintiff is allowed to file the second amended complaint.
