And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend their complaint regarding allegations that the defendants built structures that encroach onto the plaintiffs' property, including a portion of a pool and irrigation system. The court notes that the plaintiffs had been aware of the encroachment since 2022 but only recently discovered that the defendants' pipes were the cause of the damage to their property. The court finds that the plaintiffs' delay in bringing the motion was not unjustified and that the defendants have been on notice of the concerns regarding the encroaching structures since 2022. The court grants the motion and suggests that counsel discuss any additional discovery that might be required due to the new allegations.
