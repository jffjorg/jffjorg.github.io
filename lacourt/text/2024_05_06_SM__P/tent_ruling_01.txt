Ruling
Chiaverini
v. Busiashvili, et al. Case No.: 19SMCV00196
Hearing
Date: May 6, 2024
Motion:
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint
Plaintiffs Chiaverini allege their neighbors defendants
Busiashvili built
structures that encroach onto their property, including a portion of a pool and
irrigation system. Plaintiffs seek leave to amend their complaint.
Courts
liberally exercise discretion to allow amendments to pleadings at any time. Desny
v. Wilder (1956) 46 Cal.2d 715, 751. Leave may be denied when the party seeking
amendment delayed without justification. Melican v. Regents of Univ. of
Calif. (2007) 151 CA4th 168, 176. A motion for leave to amend must
state when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered and the reasons why the request for the amendment was not
made earlier. Cal. Rules of Court 3.1324(b).
 
A court can deny leave to amend after long,
inexcusable delay, where there is cognizable prejudice, such as discovery
needed, trial delay, critical evidence lost or added preparation expense. See,
e.g., Solit v. Tokai Bank (1999) 68 Cal. App. 4th 1435, 1448; Atkinson
v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal. App. 4th 739, 761. In considering whether
there was unjustified delay, the court should consider whether the party, “was
not diligent in offering the amendment after knowledge of the facts….” Solit,
supra, at 1448.
Plaintiffs
argue no new causes of action are being added, just facts, including that the
drainage system failed, damaging their property, and the pool being built
exceeds the parameters of its permit. Plaintiffs add that both the second and
sixth causes of action will request injunctive relief.
Plaintiffs
filed the complaint in 2019. On January 6, 2023 plaintiffs’ garage was flooded,
allegedly by runoff from defendants’ property. Both parties were aware the
drainage pipes encroached onto plaintiffs’ property as early as October 6,
2022. Cirlin Decl., ¶ 8. Although the damage to the garage occurred in 2023, it
was not until a few weeks ago when plaintiffs’ soil engineer Chrysoveergis identified
defendants’ pipes as the cause. Plaintiffs also contend they were informed by
Chrysoveergis that the pool should have been constructed as “freestanding” to
conform to building codes. Id. at ¶ 9. 
Defendants
argue plaintiffs had time to bring issues regarding the pool to the court, as
the deposition of LA Dept. of Building and Safety’s PMQ Williams was taken on
October 19, 2022. However, the risk of bodily injury and property damage was
only made known to plaintiffs a few weeks ago. Defendants argue plaintiffs were
aware of the drainage pipes’ encroachment and the flooding of their garage long
ago. However, plaintiffs were unaware the garage flooding was allegedly caused
by the drainage pipes until notified by Chrysoveergis a few weeks ago. This
satisfies Cal. Rules of Court 3.1324(b).   
Defendants argue
they need discovery to establish a proper defense to these new facts. This is
not a sufficient reason to deny the motion. No new causes of action are being
introduced, and defendants have been on notice of concerns regarding
encroaching structures since 2022. Defendants argue the allegations regarding
the drainage system are vague. However, the allegations only need to make
defendant aware of the nature, source
and extent of the claims in a manner sufficient to enable preparation of a
defense (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531,
549-550); plaintiffs have done so.           
The motion is GRANTED. Counsel should be prepared to
discuss with the court what additional discovery, if any, might be required due
to the new allegations.
