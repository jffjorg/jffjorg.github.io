SM
10000 Property LLC v. Leong, et al., Case No. 23SMCV05128
Hearing
date May 6, 2024
Plaintiff
SM 10000 Property, LLC’s Motion for Attorneys Fees and Costs
The court
granted summary judgment to plaintiff SM 10000 and against defendant Leong in
this unlawful detainer action. Plaintiff seeks attorneys fees per Civil Code
§1717. The court previously continued the hearing to allow Leong to file opposition.
SM argues
Leong improperly submitted supplemental briefing without leave of court and the
initial opposition was untimely. The court has discretion to overlook
late-served papers and resolve the matter on the merits. E.g., Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1300(d); Gonzalez v. Santa Clara County Dept. of
Social Services (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 162, 168. Leong submitted the initial opposition for
the sole purpose of requesting a continuance. 
Leong objects to the Olsen declaration as presenting new evidence in
reply. Generally, new evidence and legal argument are
not permitted in reply papers. Jay v. Mahaffey (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th
1522, 1537-1538. Leong may present argument regarding the new evidence
during oral argument.
SM is entitled to recover attorney fees and costs pursuant to Civil Code
§1717 and the lease, which included an attorney fees provision. Olsen Decl. ¶
3, Exh. 1 at ¶ 34. Under this provision, prevailing party is entitled to
reasonable attorney fees not to exceed $50,000. 
SM seeks
$32,590 in fees. Olsen Decl. ¶ 6, Exhs. 2-2.3. The hourly rates charged of $250-$300/hour
is not unreasonable, given the nature of the work and experience of counsel.
Olsen Suppl. Decl. at ¶¶ 2-8.
This case
was heavily litigated. Plaintiff responded to a demurrer and filed ex parte to
advance the hearing date, drafted a motion for summary judgment, conducted
discovery and prepared for deposition and trial. 
Leong argues
SM’s fees and costs are unreasonable, particularly time spent on the instant
motion of $5,715.00. Olsen Decl. ¶ 6. While SM filed the motion and reply, the
fees claims are excessive, as it would mean close to 20 hours at $275/hour in
preparing the motion and responding to Leong’s oppositions. This is excessive,
and the court reduces this to 10 hours at $275=2,750.
Leong argues
certain entries are not reasonable, such as 9.4 hours for a deposition that
never occurred. This is not persuasive because the deposition was only rendered
moot because of the ruling on summary judgment.
Motion
GRANTED as to all costs requested and fees, minus $2,965 in fees, as per above.
