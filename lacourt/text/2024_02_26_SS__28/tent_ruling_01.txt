PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Sunworld
asks the Court to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission,
set one, and award sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD  
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission
are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this
waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied:  
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and
2033.230.  
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely
response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the
truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as
for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).  
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it
finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”

Proc., § 2033.280.)
