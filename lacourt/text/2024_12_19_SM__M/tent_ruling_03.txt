Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
387(a) provides that “any person, who has an interest in the matter in
litigation...may intervene in the action or proceeding.”  Section 387(a) is to be construed liberally
in favor of intervention. (Simpson Redwood Co. v. State of California,
(1987) 196 Cal. App. 3d 1192, 1201.) Section 387 authorizes intervention when a
party has a direct, not consequential, interest in the matter in litigation. (Kobernick
v. Shaw, (1977) 70 Cal. App. 3d 914, 919.) In addition to a direct
interest, intervention must not enlarge the issues raised by original parties,
and not tread on the rights of the original parties to conduct their own
lawsuit. (Kuperstein v. Superior Court (1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 598, 600.) Leave
to intervene will be denied if the reasons for intervention are outweighed by
the rights of the original parties to conduct their lawsuit on their own terms.
(Rominger v. County of Trinity, (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 755, 660-661.)

ANALYSIS
 
Proposed Intervenor Omar Aljumaiah
(Intervenor) moves for leave to intervene as a matter of right. Intervenor claims
that he has an interest in the subject property as an eligible tenant-bidder
under Civil Code § 2924m, and therefore seeks to quiet title to the property in
his favor. Pursuant to Section 387, Intervenor is entitled to intervene and
assert this claim of quiet title. However, the proposed intervention will
expand the scope of the pleadings.
 
In addition to intervening on the
basis of quiet title, Intervenor also asserts a claim for interpleader. The
interpleader statute provides two separate bases for bringing an interpleader
action. Subdivision (a) of the statute pertains to a complaint in interpleader
brought by a defendant “against whom an action is pending upon a contract, or
for specific personal property . . . .” (CCP § 386 (a).) Subdivision (b)
pertains to a complaint in interpleader brought by “[a]ny person, firm,
corporation, association or other entity against whom double or multiple claims
are made, or may be made, by two or more persons which are such that they may
give rise to double or multiple liability . . . .” (CCP § 386(b).) A
complaint in interpleader allows an obligor to require parties with conflicting
claims to litigate those claims against each other, instead of against the
obligor. (CCP § 386(b).) The purpose of interpleader is to prevent a
multiplicity of suits and double vexation. (City of Morgan Hill v. Brown
(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1114, 1122.) An interpleader action may not be maintained
upon the mere suspicion of double vexation. (Westamerica Bank v. City of
Berkeley (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 598, 607-608.) The plaintiff must allege
facts showing a reasonable probability of double vexation, or a valid threat of
double vexation. (Ibid.)  
 
Intervenor explains that he
received conflicting demands for rent payments from the parties to the action,
and therefore also seeks to intervene to interplead the disputed rent with the
Court. Thus, the proposed complaint in intervention seeks to determine the
rights of rents paid for the subject property. Of course, the current action
does not seek adjudication of such rights. Any disputes over rent are
entirely unrelated to and would not affect the underlying questions of title
and foreclosure. Thus, the proposed intervention/interpleader will
impermissibly expand the issues. Intervenor has the ability to file an
independent action rather than unnecessarily expanding the scope of this
litigation with the proposed pleading. Therefore, the Court is inclined to
grant the intervention as to the first cause of action for quiet title, but not
the proffered pleading which includes a second cause of action for
interpleading rents.
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED
without prejudice.
