Legal
Standard
 
Courts have an inherent power to
enforce compliance with their orders and rulings through contempt proceedings.
(In re M.R. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 49, 56.) Courts also have statutory
authority to enforce compliance with their orders. (CCP § 128(a)(4).) CCP
section 1209(a)(5) expressly provides the Court with the power to punish
“[d]isobedience of any lawful judgment, order, or process of the
court.”  
 
Contempt is any act, in or out of
court, “which tends to impede, embarrass or obstruct the court in the discharge
of its duties.” (In re Shortridge (1893) 99 Cal. 526, 532.) Contempt
committed in the immediate view and presence of the Court may be punished
summarily, but contempt committed outside the Court’s presence requires an
affidavit presenting the facts constituting the contempt. (CCP § 1211(a).)
“When the contempt is not committed in the immediate view and presence of the
court, or of the judge at chambers, an affidavit shall be presented to the
court or judge of the facts constituting the contempt, or a statement of the
facts by the referees or arbitrators, or other judicial officers.” Thereafter,
an order to show cause must be issued and a hearing on the facts must be held
by the court. (Arthur v. Superior Court (1965) 62 Cal.2d 404,
407-408.)  
 
To justify the application, the
requirements “can be easily satisfied with a declaration under penalty of
perjury[.]” (M.R., supra, 220 Cal.App.4th at 63.) The declaration need
only make a prima facie showing of the following elements: “(1) the
making of the order; (2) knowledge of the order; (3) ability of respondent to
render compliance; and (4) willful disobedience of the order.” (People v.
Superior Court (1965) 239 Cal.App.2d 99, 104; see also In re
Morelli (1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 819, 832-33.) Although not required, the
alleged contemnor may respond to the affidavit and OSC by counteraffidavits or
declarations.  The counter-affidavits serve as the “answer” to the
charging allegations in the original affidavit. (Lyon v. Superior Court,
supra, 68 Cal.2d at 452.) The alleged contemnor may still assert his or her
defenses entirely at the hearing. (CCP § 1217.)
 
Civil contempt proceedings are
quasi-criminal in nature because of the penalties which may be imposed. (In
re Kreitman (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 750, 754.) The punishment for contempt is
up to five days' imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $1,000 for each contempt.
(See CCP § 1218(a).) Thus, “guilt must be established beyond a reasonable
doubt.” (Ross v. Sup. Ct. (1977) 19 Cal.3d 899, 913.)  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff Bel-Air Association moves
for an order to show cause finding Defendants Shahram Balakhani and Monroe
Investment Group, LLC (“Defendants”) in contempt of the preliminary injunction
issued by this Court on October 2, 2024 (the “PI”). Relevantly, the PI enjoined
Defendants from engaging in the following activities and requiring them to
notify any lessees or other occupants of or guests at the property not to
engage in any of the following, and requiring their best efforts to prevent the
following:
 
C. From allowing
residents, guests, suppliers, and/or vendors (or people transporting residents
or guests to or from the 1859 Bel Air Road property) to park or stop in
no-parking areas while at, or while arriving at or departing from the property,
or to otherwise block or impede traffic.
 
Generally, Plaintiff claims that
Defendants are impeding and blocking the road near the subject property. Plaintiff
presents charging affidavits from its members. A neighbor, Suphamongkhon, claims
that she encountered vehicles that blocked the street and impeded traffic on
Bel Air Road because of an event held at 1859 Bel Air Road on multiple
occasions over a period spanning four days, from October 23, 2024, until
October 26, 2024. (Suphamongkhon Decl. at 1:21-23.) For example, she observed a
Town & Country delivery truck illegally parked near the 1859 Bel Air Road
property at the same time that she saw people gathering around and going to and
from the 1859 Bel Air Road property. (Suphamongkhon Decl. at 1:5-8; Ex. 1.)
Then on October 25, 2024, she encountered obstacles while driving down the
street near her house. (Suphamongkhon Decl. at 1:9-16; Exs. 2-5.) On October
26, 2024, she encountered a blocked street that impeded her ability to drive in
her neighborhood because of the event at 1859 Bel Air Road, which forced her to
stop her car because the street was blocked. (Suphamongkhon Decl. at 1:17-20;
Exs. 6-7.) Another neighbor, Castaldi, had to navigate stopped cars side by
side on both sides of the street, large trucks stopped next to parked cars, and
event attendants in the street next to stopped cars. (Castaldi Decl. at
1:6-17.) Counsel for plaintiff inspected the site himself to find piles of
event equipment in the street, parked trucks, cordoned off cars, and people
with dollies walking down the center of the street between parked vehicles on
one side and event equipment of the other. (Wolpert Decl. at 1:10-19.) Plaintiff
shows that Defendants had notice of the entry and the effectiveness of the PI
19 days before the first of these violations. (10/3/24 Notice.) The above facts
lead to an inference of willful disobedience. Plaintiff therefore shows a prima
facie case of contempt and an OSC should issue.
 
Accordingly, the motion for OSC re:
contempt is GRANTED. The Court will set an OSC Re: Contempt set for January 7,
2025, at 9:30 a.m. Defendants are ordered to show cause as to why they should
not be held in contempt of court for violating the PI, why a fine of $1,000 per
violation of the PI should not be imposed on them, and why they should not be
ordered to pay reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of $9,600.00.
