And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for leave to amend the complaint to correct prior counsel's error and delete unnecessary pages. The proposed amendment is insubstantial and does not expand the scope of discovery or require the parties to undertake further discovery. However, the amendment would hinder the defendant's motion for summary adjudication. Therefore, the motion for leave to amend will be considered after the summary adjudication motion is heard. The motion is continued to January 23, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.
