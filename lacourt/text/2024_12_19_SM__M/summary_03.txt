And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion for leave to intervene filed by Omar Aljumaiah, a proposed intervenor who claims an interest in the subject property as an eligible tenant-bidder. The proposed intervenor seeks to quiet title to the property and also to interplead the disputed rent with the court. The judge has ruled that the proposed intervenor may intervene as a matter of right to seek quiet title, but has denied the motion without prejudice as to the request for interpleader. The judge has found that the proposed intervention would impermissibly expand the issues in the current action, and that the proposed intervenor has the ability to file an independent action rather than intervening in this case.
