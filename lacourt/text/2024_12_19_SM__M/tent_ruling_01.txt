MOTION:                  Motion
for Leave to Amend to File Third Amended Complaint
HEARING DATE:   12/19/2024
 
Legal
Standard
 
If a party
wishes to amend a pleading after an answer has been filed, or after a demurrer
has been filed and after the hearing on the demurrer, or if he or she has
already amended the pleading as a matter of course, the party must obtain permission
from the court before amendment. (CCP §§ 473(a)(1), 576.) 
 
Motions
for leave to amend the pleadings are directed to the sound discretion of the
court. “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be
proper, allow a party to amend any pleading . . ..” (CCP § 473(a)(1); see CCP §
576.) Policy favors liberally granting leave to amend so that all disputed
matters between the parties may be resolved. (See Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422,
1428.) Absent prejudice to the adverse party, the court may permit amendments
to the complaint “at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial.”
(Atkinson v. Elk Corp.
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761 [internal quotes omitted].) Where leave is
sought to add entirely new claims, the court may grant leave to amend if the
new claims are based on the same general set of facts, and the amendment will
not prejudice the opposing party. (Austin
v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 596, 600-602; Glaser v. Meyers (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 770, 777 [holding
trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting amendment of complaint,
which originally alleged constructive eviction, to allege retaliatory eviction
where the new claim was based on the same general set of facts].)
 
Although
denial is rarely justified, a judge has discretion to deny leave to amend if
the party seeking the amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced
the opposing party. (Morgan v. Superior
Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530; Hirsa v. Superior Court
(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490). An opposing party is prejudiced where the
amendment would necessitate a trial delay along with a loss of critical
evidence, added preparation expense, increased burden of discovery, etc. (Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488 [leave properly
denied where plaintiff sought leave on the eve of trial, nearly two years after
the complaint was originally filed and gave no explanation for the delay which
prejudiced defendant who did not discover or depose many of the witnesses who would
support the new allegations and had not marshaled evidence in opposition of the
new allegations].)
 
Procedurally,
a motion for leave to amend must state with particularity what allegations are
to be amended. Namely, it must state what allegations in the previous pleading
are proposed to be deleted and/or added, if any, and where, by page, paragraph,
and line number. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(2)-(3).) The motion must be accompanied
by a declaration specifying: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for
amendment was not made earlier. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(b).) The motion must also be
accompanied by the proposed amended pleading, numbered to differentiate it from
the prior pleadings or amendments. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(1).) It is within the
court’s discretion to require compliance with Rule 3.1324 before granting leave
to amend. (Hataishi v. First American Home Buyers Protection Corp. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 1454, 1469.)
 
Analysis
 

Plaintiffs Haig Tacorian, Gilda
Tacorian, and Bowmont Holdings, LLC move for an order granting leave to file
their proposed Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”). The TAC does not make any
substantive changes to the allegations, ask for new relief, or add any new
claims. Instead, Plaintiffs propose that they omit certain pages from Exhibits
B-1, B-2, and B-3, which they contend do not comprise the contracts at
issue. Plaintiffs explain that current counsel substituted into this matter on
June 28, 2023. (Cowles Decl., ¶ 2.) Through discovery and investigation
relating to responses to Defendant Geosoils Consultants, Inc.’s written
discovery, Plaintiffs realized that not all of the documents attached as
Exhibits B1, B2 and B3 were the correct contracts. (¶ 3). Instead, only the
first page of each exhibit are the contracts. As a result, Plaintiffs believe
that the SAC needs to be amended to correct prior counsel’s error and delete
all but the first pages of Exhibits B1-B3.
 
Given the insubstantial change
proposed, the Court is inclined to grant leave. The record does not show that
any delay stemming from prior counsel’s mistake and current counsel’s
investigation efforts have caused any substantial prejudice to
Defendant. The deletions do not expand the scope of discovery or require the
parties to undertake further discovery. However, amendment would hinder Defendant’s
filed motion for summary adjudication. Thus, the motion for leave to amend will
be considered after the summary adjudication motion is heard.
 
Accordingly, the motion is
