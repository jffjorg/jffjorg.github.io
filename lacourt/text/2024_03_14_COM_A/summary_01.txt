And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Lakewood Regional Medical Center, Inc. (Lakewood) in the case Rosa SanFilippo v. Paramount Meadows Nursing Center, LP, et al.

The Judge has overruled Lakewood's demurrer to the fourth cause of action for elder abuse, finding that the allegations are sufficient to meet the heightened pleading standards. The Judge has also denied Lakewood's motion to strike the fifth cause of action for elder abuse, finding that the allegations are not improper.

The Judge has found that Lakewood had advance knowledge of decedent's condition and failed to provide medical care, despite knowing the probability of harm to Decedent. The Judge has also found that Lakewood's conduct was despicable and constitutes malice, oppression, or fraud, which warrants recovery of punitive damages and attorney's fees.

The Judge has ordered Lakewood to file an answer within 10 days and has denied the motion to strike.
