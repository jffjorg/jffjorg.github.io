Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant Mona Fenderson to Plaintiff Anthony C. Chatmon Sr.'s complaint for quiet title to real property. The Plaintiff alleges that the real property was transferred to his trust, while the Defendant alleges that the transfer was invalid due to a prior recorded deed by Marion Chatmon, Trustor's daughter. The Judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the Plaintiff's complaint is sufficient and that the Defendant has not established that the action is barred by the statute of limitations. The Judge has also rejected the Defendant's argument that the Plaintiff failed to include a legal description of the property in the complaint, finding that the attached exhibits provide sufficient information. The Judge has ordered the Defendant to answer the complaint within 10 days.
