SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
September 2, 2021 and September 8, 2021, Plaintiff 608 Mateo, LLC filed a
complaint and first amended complaint for unlawful detainer against Arts
Districts Patients Collective, Inc., et al. regarding 608 South Mateo St. and
609 Imperial St., Los Angeles. On January 3, 2022, the court granted summary
judgment in favor of Plaintiff in part. On January 24, 2022, the court entered
judgment against James Shaw, Arts District Patients Collective, Inc., and AWA
Oasia, LLC, whereby the court both granted possession and entered holdover
damages in the amount of $208,840.41. On March 7, 2022, the court awarded
Plaintiff $40,860 in attorney fees. The court entered an amended judgment for
$251,224.31 on March 22, 2022. Plaintiff, Judgment Debtor claimed an additional
$28,895.13 in post judgment costs.
 
On
February 3, 2023, the court denied the motion for assignment order and/or
turnover order in aid of execution of judgment and for restraining order. A
notice of stay was filed by Arts Patient Collective, Inc. on February 8, 2023.
The stay was lifted on November 7, 2023, following the dismissal of the
bankruptcy. 
 
RULING: Denied.
Evidentiary
Objections to the Declaration of James Shaw: Overruled.
 
Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor 608 Mateo, LLC (608 Mateo) moves
for appointment of a receiver against Defendant/Judgment Debtor, Arts District
Patients Collective, Inc. The motion also contains a request for injunctive
relief preventing “ADPC and Shaw and those acting in concert 6 with them from
interfering with the Receiver's ability to collect 7 the Income and the assets
of ADPC to the extent they exist.” Defendant/Judgment Debtor Arts District
Patients Collective, Inc. challenges the necessity of the appointment of
receivership. Plaintiff in reply reiterates the prior court tentative ruling
“granting” the unopposed motion, and the necessity of a receiver.
Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor also engages in a challenge to the authority cited
in opposition. Plaintiff concludes with any denial of the necessity for a bond.
 
The request arises due to stymied efforts at collection on
the judgment. 608 Mateo represents only successfully collecting $298 in total.
608 Mateo cites to the prior court tentative ruling, whereby the court issued a
“Granted” order, but the court docket shows the motions in fact went
off-calendar. [Declaration of Steven Revitz, Ex. 6.] The court declines to
defer to the prior tentative ruling, and instead reviews the motion under its
own criterial.
 
608 Mateo cites to the necessity of the receiver pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 708.620, which states: “The court may appoint a receiver to enforce the judgment where the
judgment creditor shows that, considering the interests of both the judgment
creditor and the judgment debtor, the appointment of a receiver is a reasonable
method to obtain the fair and orderly satisfaction of the judgment.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 708.620.)
 
Missing from the motion is any actual authority regarding
the basis for the receiver. Notwithstanding, a receiver may be appointed “after judgment, to carry the judgment into effect.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 564, subd. (b)(3).) (Plaintiff references “CCP section 564(a)(4)”
in reply (6:7-12).)
 
Plaintiff also disputes the
argument in opposition regarding the potential for reversal of the judgment.
The court declines to consider this collateral consideration, and instead
addressees the criteria for appointment of a receiver assuming an enforceable
judgment
 
The appointment of a receiver is an equitable remedy, and
should be used only when necessary and where other legal remedies are
unavailable. (Rogers v. Smith (1946)
76 Cal.App.2d 16, 21).  Receivership is a
provisional remedy, in which a court appoints an officer and agent of the court
to take charge of and actually manage property involved in litigation, in order
to preserve it for disposition in accord with the final judgment.  (Shannon
v. Superior Court (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 986.)  Appointment of a receiver is a drastic
provisional remedy that the court should only grant when facts are presented by
admissible evidence that clearly establish a receiver is necessary to protect
the property and maintain the status quo. (Barclay
Bank of California v. Superior Court (1977) 69 Cal. App. 3d 593, 597; City and County of San Francisco v. Daley
(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 734, 744).
 
It’s not clear what other means were utilized for said
collection from the application. 608 Mateo concedes that Judgment Debtor likely
lacks assets sufficient for satisfaction of the debt, but references a pending
cannabis license, which may hold some value. Judgment Debtor in fact presents a
very extensive declaration regarding an uncollected $45,000,000 judgment held
by judgment debtor, as well as other liens taking unchallenged precedence over
the instant judgment. [Declaration of James Shaw.]
 
Even with the admission regarding the unlikelihood of
collection, the court also finds a glaring concern from the lack of any indication
or identification of what entity the receiver would oversee. Other than a
request for a receiver and identification of a nominated person, the motion
lacks basic information on the intended target of the receivership. 
 
Even assuming 608 Mateo generally means for the receiver to
somehow manage the business entity identified as Arts District Patients
Collective, Inc. in some capacity, the court still finds the admission
regarding the lack of any real assets rendering the receivership an overly
expensive appointment with no net benefit in the form of collection on the
judgment. (Alhambra-Shumway Mines, Inc. v.
Alhambra Gold Mine Corp. (1953) 116
Cal.App.2d 869, 873-874; see Santacroce
Bros. v. Edgewater-Santa Clara Inc. (1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 584, 586–587.)
Again, the opposition lists extensive, unchallenged pre-existing debts taking
priority. The reply lacks any dispute to the subject representations. The court
declines to consider creditor priority or other potential means allowing
judgment creditor to potentially improperly wedge ahead of other superseding
creditors.
 
Again, even if the court still considered the motion, the
paucity of information prevents the court from considering any order appointing
a receiver, including the bond amount. (Code Civ. Proc. 567; Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1178; Southern California Sunbelt Developers, Inc. v. Banyan Limited
Partnership (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 910, 928-929.) The dismissal of the bond
requirement in the reply due to the lack of any “ongoing business” entity
[9:1-2] directly relates back to the fundamental question of what the receiver
will oversee.
 
The motion for preliminary injunction also lacks any cited
authority. Judgment Debtor only apparently seeks a prohibitory injunction. 
 
“[T]he general rule is that
an injunction is prohibitory if it requires a
person to refrain from a particular act and mandatory if it
compels performance of an affirmative act that changes the position of the
parties.” (Davenport v. Blue Cross
of California (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 435, 446.) “An injunction designed to preserve the status quo as
between the parties and to restrain illegal conduct is prohibitory,
not mandatory, and does not require heightened appellate scrutiny.” (Oiye v. Fox (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th
1036, 1048.) “The granting of a mandatory
injunction pending trial is not permitted except in extreme cases where the
right thereto is clearly established.” (Teachers Ins. & Annuity Assn. v. Furlotti (1999) 70
Cal.App.4th 1487, 1493.) 
 
The court considers both irreparable harm and the likelihood
of prevailing on the merits. (Millennium
Rock Mortg., Inc. v. T.D. Service Co. (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 804, 812.) “An
evaluation of the relative harm to the parties upon the granting or denial of a
preliminary injunction requires consideration of: ‘(1) the inadequacy of any
other remedy; (2) the degree of irreparable injury the denial of the injunction
will cause; (3) the necessity to preserve the status quo; [and] (4) the degree
of adverse effect on the public interest or interests of third parties the
granting of the injunction will cause.’” (Vo
v. City of Garden Grove (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 425, 435.) “‘[T]he more
likely it is that plaintiffs will ultimately prevail, the less severe must be
the harm that they allege will occur if the injunction does not issue .... [I]t
is the mix of these factors that guides the trial court in its exercise of
discretion.’” (Right Site Coalition v.
Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 336, 342.) “The
ultimate questions on a motion for a preliminary injunction are (1) whether the
plaintiff is 'likely to suffer greater injury from a denial of the injunction
than the defendants are likely to suffer from its grant,’ and (2) whether there
is ‘a  reasonable probability that the
plaintiffs will prevail on the merits’” (Huong
Que, Inc. v. Luu (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 400, 408. Procedurally, an
application for a preliminary injunction, must be based upon sufficient
evidence.  (CCP §527(a); Bank of America v. Williams (1948) 89
Cal.App.2d 21, 29.) 
 
In summary, the motion lacks insufficient support given the
admitted lack of collectible assets, necessity of the receiver given the lack
of collectible assets, an unidentified entity for the receiver to oversee,
improper dismissal of the bond requirements, and otherwise insufficient
description of any threat to corporate assets for purposes of the prohibitory
injunction, especially given the lack of any “ongoing business.”
 
The motion is therefore denied in its entirety.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
