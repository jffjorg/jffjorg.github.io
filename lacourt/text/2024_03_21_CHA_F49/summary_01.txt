And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the plaintiffs/cross-defendants to the cross-complaint filed by the defendant/cross-complainant Hermosa Investments, LP is taken off calendar as moot. This is because the defendant timely filed a first amended cross-complaint, which renders the demurrer unnecessary. The judge is sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend and ordering the moving party to give notice.
