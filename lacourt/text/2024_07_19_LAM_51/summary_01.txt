English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees and costs in part. The plaintiff seeks $31,875.00 in attorneys' fees and $3,433.20 in costs, while the defendant requests a reduction of the fees to $12,863.50 and costs to $2,523.25. The court finds that the hourly rates of the attorneys are reasonable, but reduces the requested amount of fees by $8,410 due to concerns about the reasonableness of some billing entries. The court also reduces the requested costs by $59.80 due to unnecessary parking expenses. The final amount of fees and costs awarded is $26,838.40.
