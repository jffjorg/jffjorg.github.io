Court will note, however, that the hourly rate for Mr. Barry requested in the motion is
higher than the hourly rate Mr. Barry requests in his declaration. Barry Decl.,
¶ 22: “Please note, I am only seeking an hourly rate of $600 for services
rendered after January 13 1, 2022 through March 31, 2023. I am only seeking an
hourly rate of $625 for services rendered 14 after April 1, 2023.”] 
 


[2]Plaintiff
contends that Defendant failed to bring a Motion to Tax Costs so the challenges
should be overruled. The Court notes that Plaintiff, for their part, did not
file a separate memorandum of costs but rather only attached cost as an Exhibit
to this fee motion. As such, the time to file a Motion to Tax Costs may not
have even commenced since the Costs Memorandum has yet to be filed.
