And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a fee motion filed by Plaintiff. The ruling notes that Plaintiff's request for an hourly rate of $600 for services rendered after January 13, 2022, and $625 for services rendered after April 1, 2023, is higher than the rate requested in his declaration. The Court also points out that Plaintiff did not file a separate memorandum of costs, but rather attached it as an Exhibit to the fee motion, which may mean that the time to file a Motion to Tax Costs has not yet begun. The Court will consider these factors when making a final decision on the fee motion.
