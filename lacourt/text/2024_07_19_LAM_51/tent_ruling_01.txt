STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On October 19, 2022, Plaintiff Blanca Mazariegos (Plaintiff)
filed a Complaint against Defendant General Motors, LLC (Defendant) with two
causes of action for: (1) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability under
the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act; and (2) Breach of Express Warranty
under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The Complaint concerns
Plaintiff’s purchase of a 2022 Chevrolet Silverado, VIN 1GCPWBEK2NZ117813.
 
On November 21, 2022, Defendant filed an Answer. 
 
On March 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement. 
 
On April 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for attorneys’
fees and costs. On April 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed an amended motion. On May 31,
2024, Defendant filed an opposition. On June 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
A prevailing buyer in an action under Song-Beverly “shall
be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the
aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on
actual time expended, determined by the Court to have been reasonably incurred
by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such
action.”  (Civ. Code, § 1794(d).) By permitting buyers who prevail under
Song-Beverly to recover their attorneys’ fees, “our Legislature has provided
injured consumers strong encouragement to seek legal redress in a situation in
which a lawsuit might not otherwise have been economically feasible.” (Murillo v. Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc.
(1998) 17 Cal.4th 985, 994.)   
 
The prevailing party has the burden of showing that the
requested attorney fees are reasonable. (Robertson
v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785,
817.) The party seeking attorney fees “is not necessarily entitled to the
compensation of the value of attorney services according to [his or her] own
notion or to the full extent claimed . . . .”  (Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807,
816.) If the “time expended or the monetary charge being made for the time
expended are not reasonable under all circumstances, then the court must take
this into account and award fees in a lesser amount.” (Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99,
104.)   
 
A calculation of attorneys’ fees for a Song-Beverly action
begins with the “lodestar” approach, under which the Court fixes the lodestar
at “the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate.” (Margolin v. Regional Planning
Com. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004-1005.) “California courts have
consistently held that a computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable
value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an appropriate
attorneys’ fee award.” (Ibid.)  
 
“It is appropriate for a trial court to reduce a fee award
based on its reasonable determination that a routine, non-complex case was
overstaffed to a degree that significant inefficiencies and inflated fees
resulted.”  (Morris v. Hyundai Motor
America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 39.) It is also appropriate to reduce a
fee award based on “inefficient or duplicative efforts” in the billing record.
(Id. at p. 38.) However, the analysis
must be “reasonably specific” and cannot rely on general notions about the fairness
of the fee award. (Kerkeles v. City of
San Jose (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 88, 102.) Moreover, in conducting the
analysis, courts are not permitted to tie any reductions in the fee award to
some proportion of the buyer’s damages recovery. (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24,
39.)   
 
The lodestar figure may also be adjusted, based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided. (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49; PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.App.4th 1084, 1095.) The factors considered in determining the
modification of the lodestar include the nature and difficulty of the
litigation, the amount of money involved, the skill required and employed to
handle the case, the attention given, the success or failure,¿and other circumstances in the case. (EnPalm, LLC v.¿Teitler¿Family Trust¿(2008)
162 Cal. App. 4th 770, 774 (emphasis in original).) A negative modifier was
appropriate when duplicative work had been performed. (Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank,¿N.A.¿(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.)¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff requests $31,875.00 in attorneys’ fees and $3,433.20
in costs for a total of $35,308.20. Defendant requests that the court reduce
the attorneys’ fees to $12,863.50 and costs to $2,523.25. 
 
Four attorneys were involved at various junctures in this
case. (Barry Decl., ¶ 17.) C. Richard Lara was the handling attorney ($350
hourly rate). (Barry Decl., ¶ 17; Lara Decl., ¶ 6.) The involvement of David N.
Barry ($600 hourly rate before 3/31/23, $625 thereafter) “became necessary
given the facts and complexity of the case, the litigation posture of Defense,
and given this case was approaching trial.” (Barry Decl., ¶¶ 17, 22.) Otis R.
Hayes ($500 hourly rate) and Jeramy D. Templin ($350 hourly rate) also worked
on the case. (Hayes Decl., ¶ 5; Templin Decl., ¶ 7.)
 
Prevailing Party
 
Here, the parties entered a Settlement Agreement that provided
for GM to pay Plaintiff $54,000.00, inclusive of loan payoff, representing a
full repurchase in exchange for the Subject Vehicle; that Plaintiff is the
prevailing party; and that attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses incurred by
Plaintiff would be paid in compliance with Civil Code § 1794(d) by way of
motion. (Barry Decl., Exh. 4.) 
 
Lodestar
Fees  
 
The lodestar method looks at the time spent on a matter
multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. (Serrano, supra 20 Cal.3d at 49). The two-step
process begins with the lodestar method, which is the time spent on the matter
multiple by the hourly rate. After the lodestar method, the second step is
determining whether a multiplier should be applied. The factors that Courts
look at to determine if a multiplier is reasonable are: 1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1132). 
 
“In determining hourly rates, the court must look to the
“prevailing market rates in the relevant community.” (Bell v. Clackamas County¿(9th Cir.2003) 341 F.3d 858, 868.) The
rates of comparable attorneys in the forum district are usually used. (See¿Gates v. Deukmejian¿(9th Cir.1992) 987
F.2d 1392, 1405.) In making its calculation, the court should also consider the
experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees.” (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy¿(2013)
215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009.) 
 
Plaintiffs argue the hourly rates are reasonable. Here, the
requested hourly rates are as follows according to the Motion, p. 14:
·        
David N. Barry: 16.4 hours at $675/hour[1]
·        
Otis R. Hayes: 8.5 hours at $500/hour
·        
Brian Kim: 2.8 hours at $350/hour
·        
C. Richard Lara: 41.9 hours at $350/hour
·        
Jeramy D. Templin: 2.6 hours at $350/hour
The court finds that these hourly rates are reasonable based
on the hourly rate of similarly situated attorneys in the Los Angeles area.
Based on the Laffey Matrix, attorneys with similar years of experience as
Plaintiffs’ counsel as identified above have comparable, if not a higher hourly
rate. However,
billing at a high rate comes with the expectation that the attorney also works
in an efficient manner that reflects the premium paid for his or her services.
The court considers this fact in addressing the reasonableness of the hours
expended, below.  
 
Thus, the hourly rates are appropriate. 
 
 
Reasonableness
of Hours Billed  
 
To determine if the requested amount is reasonable,
California courts utilize the lodestar method. The two-step process begins with
the lodestar method, which is the time spent on the matter multiple by the
hourly rate. After the lodestar method, the second step is determining whether
a multiplier should be applied. The factors that Courts look at to determine if
a multiplier is reasonable are: 1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions
involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which
the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4)
the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)  
 
Although a verified fee bill is “prima facie evidence the
costs, expenses and services listed were necessarily incurred,” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d
677, 682), ultimately, Counsel still has the burden to demonstrate the
reasonableness of charges. (Mikhaeilpoor,
supra, 48 Cal.App.5th at p. 247.) The
court has reviewed the fee bill submitted by Counsel and the proposed
reductions by Defendant.
 
Plaintiffs
contend that the billable hours are reasonable. The total amount billed is 72.2
hours. While Plaintiff is to be commended for not billing for all work and assigning
much of the work to a junior associate billing at $350 per hour, the hours billed
for this unremarkable lemon law case with no dispositive motions and very
little other motion work seems high. Upon further  review of the billing, the Court questioned
the reasonableness of some billing entries.
 
Pleadings, Motions,
& Discovery
 
Boilerplate filings serve a useful purpose. They increase
productivity by allowing for simple edits to existing documents. Thus,
utilizing templates is to be commended when it results in efficiency. However,
if templates are employed but attorneys are still billing significant time to
make minor changes, such use of legal resources is unwarranted and any such
bill is unreasonable, particularly if the attorney is billing at a high hourly
rate. (Mikhaeilpoor, supra, at p. 250.) Here, the court found
instances where the time spent for minor cut and paste edits to templates was
unreasonable.
 
 
i.                   
Discovery
Requests to Defendant
The Court reviewed the time spend for drafting discovery
requests, reviewing discovery, responding to discovery, a  motion to compel a deposition, preparing meet
and confer letters, drafting an IDC statement and drafting memos to file. Drafting
discovery motions and meet and confer letters, and memos to file for a
sophisticated, highly practiced Lemon Law firm is template or clerical work.
Responding and reviewing discovery is similar to cookie cutter work. An IDC
Statement is to be a memorandum measured in pages that is supposed to concisely
state the issue. The Court reviewed the IDC statement in this case. It could
not have reasonably taken 3.5 hours of attorney time to write. The Court is
mindful of the purpose of an IDC. It is supposed to save costs and not generate
3.5 hours of billable time. Accordingly, these fees are unreasonable. 
 
ii.                 
Fee
motion
Counsel billed 12.2 hors for a fee motion. This looks like
many that this Court has reviewed. It is simply an accounting and a template. A
seasoned Lemon Law firm should spend no more than 7 hours on this motion in
this matter. 
 
iii.               
Travel Time
Counsel billed for 3.3 hours totaling $1,410 traveling to and
from court. This Court agrees that this charges are unreasonable on their face.

 
As such, the Court reduces the
requested lodestar by $8,410. In all other respects, the billings are proper
and reasonable. To be clear, the Court finds the reasonable amount of fees,
based upon its experience and knowledge of this type of litigation, the lack of
novelty and complexity of this case, and the professed specialization of
Plaintiff’s counsel is $23,465. 
 
Costs: 
 
            Plaintiffs
request $3,433.20 in costs and expenses. The memorandum of Costs is attached to
the Barry Decl. as Exhibit 7.[2]
“Items on a verified cost bill are prima facie evidence the costs, expenses and
services listed were necessarily incurred, and when they are properly
challenged the burden of proof shifts to the party claiming them as costs.” (Hadley, supra, 167 Cal.App.3d at 682).
Under CCP § 1794(d) “If the buyer prevails in an action under this section, the
buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum
equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees
based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably
incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of
such action.”
             
Defendant argues that the Court
should reduce the requested amount by $909.15. This is based on parking and mileage,
filing fees, future estimated court reporter fees, and future jury fees.
 
            The
requested costs are appropriate. Moreover, while the reporter charge was
estimated at the first hearing, the charge has been incurred as of this, the
subsequent hearing. Thus, as of today, the $550 for a future hearing is an
“incurred cost” However, the Court agrees that parking of 59.80 for attending
the CMC and Post-Mediation status Conference was unnecessary. These were hardly
critical appearances that required in person appearance as opposed to appearing
remotely, which would have generated no costs.  Thus, the Court reduces the costs by $59.80. 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED, in the amount of $23,465
and costs in the amount of $3,373.40 for a total of $26,838.40 payable within
45 days of service of this order. 
 
 
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
