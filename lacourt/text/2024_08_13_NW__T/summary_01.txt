As for the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production, as well as deeming Requests for Admission admitted. The Judge finds that the Defendant failed to respond to the discovery requests and did not provide a satisfactory explanation for the delay. As a result, the Judge imposes monetary sanctions on the Defendant and his counsel in the amount of $1,335.00 and $1,343.91, respectively. The Judge also reduces the hours expended by the Plaintiff's counsel to 3 hours for each motion and awards the Plaintiff a total of $2,678.91 in sanctions. The Judge orders the Defendant and his counsel to serve verified responses without objections within 10 days and to pay the sanctions by September 13, 2024.
