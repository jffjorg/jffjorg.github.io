Introduction Plaintiff Georgiy Avetisov (Plaintiff) moved to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One (FI), Special Interrogatories, Set One (SI), and Requests for Production of Documents, Set One (RPD) against Defendant Franklin Lopez (Defendant).  Plaintiff separately moved to deem Requests for Admission, Set One (RFA) admitted against Defendant.  Plaintiff requested monetary sanctions against Defendant and his Counsels, Mike Hurey and Kleinberg Lerner, in the amount of $3,035.00 for the FI, SI, RPD Motion and, separately, in the amount of $2,831.41 for the RFA Motion.  Oppositions were due July 31, 2024 and none were filed.  No declaration from defendant's counsel was filed to explain why the responses were not served.  At a minimum, even if not opposing the motion, there should have been a good faith declaration to the court to explain this situation. Discussion A party that has not received timely responses to written interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admissions is entitled to an order compelling responses without objections and an order deeming the matters specified in the requests as admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc. secs. 2030.290, 2031.300, and 2033.280.)  A motion to compel initial discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate statement.  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)  Plaintiff served the four discovery demands upon Defendant.  (James Howard (Howard) Decl. par. 1.)  Despite multiple attempts to meet and confer, Defendant failed to respond.  (Howard Decl. pars. 2-6.)  Because responses have not been served, Plaintiff met their burden on both motions. Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to FI, SI, and RPD is GRANTED.  Plaintiff’s motion to deem RFAs admitted is GRANTED. Under Code of Civil Procedure secs. 2030.290(c) and 2031.300(c), sanctions shall be imposed unless the Court finds that the responding party acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of a sanction unjust.  Sanctions under section Code of Civil Procedure sec. 2033.280(c) are mandatory.  Without any opposition, Defendant failed to show substantial justification or circumstances making sanctions unjust.  Plaintiff’s Counsel asserted that their cost for filing was $60 (for FI, SI, RPD Motion) and $68.91 (for RFA Motion).  Plaintiff was charged an hourly rate of $425.  (Howard Decl. par. 7.)  The amount requested by Defendant is excessive and unreasonable because no substantive opposition or substantive reply was filed on either motion.  The Court reduced the hours expended to 3 hours for each motion.  The Court awards Plaintiff $1,335.00 for the FI, SI, RPD Motion and $1,343.91 for the RFA Motion.  The sanctions are levied against Defendant and Defendant’s two Counsels, jointly and severally. Plaintiff’s Request for Sanctions in Both Motions is GRANTED at the reduced amounts.  IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
