MOVING PARTIES: Defendant
Akos Circle dba Renovatio Custom Build (“Defendant”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: None  
 
            The Court has considered the moving papers. No opposition
or reply papers were filed. 
 
            On January 9, 2024, Nicholas Astor (“Plaintiff”) filed his Complaint
against Akos Circle dba Renovatio Custom Build, et al. for: (1) breach of
contract; (2) negligence; (3) negligence; (4) breach of contract; (5)
professional negligence; (6) accounting; (7) recission; (8) fraud; (9)
disgorgement; (10) action on contractors bonds; and (11) action on disciplinary
bond. 
 
            On May 5, 2024, Defendant filed the instant demurrer to
Plaintiff’s Complaint (the “Demurrer”) with motion to strike (the “Motion”).  
 
            On May 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against the same defendants for the same eleven
causes of action. 
 
A plaintiff is entitled to amend at
least once without leave to court before the answer or demurrer is filed; or if
defendant demurs, before the opposition is due on the hearing on the demurrer.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 472, subd. (a).)
            
Plaintiff filed his FAC on May 21,
2024 and served it on each party on May 15, 2024. While the filing of the FAC
was less than nine court days before the hearing for the instant demurrer,
Plaintiff served the FAC more than nine court days before the hearing.
Therefore, the demurrer is taken off calendar as moot.   
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
         
Dated this 30th day of May 2024
