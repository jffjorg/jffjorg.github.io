And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered a motion by defendant Karlen Galstyan to set aside a default entered against him on July 12, 2021. The motion is based on alleged mistakes by Galstyan's counsel and a stipulation to consolidate pending matters. The court has evaluated Galstyan's motion under three theories of relief: discretionary relief under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473, mandatory relief under the same statute, and relief under the court's equitable powers.

The court denies Galstyan's motion for discretionary relief because it is untimely. The court also denies Galstyan's motion for mandatory relief because it is not in proper form, as Galstyan failed to file a proposed answer to the complaint. Finally, the court denies Galstyan's motion for relief under the court's equitable powers because he has not shown a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense and has not acted diligently in seeking to set aside his default.

The court orders Galstyan to give notice of this ruling to the plaintiffs.
