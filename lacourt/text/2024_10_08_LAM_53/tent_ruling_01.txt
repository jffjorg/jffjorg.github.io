REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The court grants plaintiffs

Revocable Living Trust dated February 23, 2016, Phil Devore, as the trustee of
the Edward S. Devore and Estelle L Devore Inter Vivos Trust, and Devore &
Devore’s request for judicial notice. 
(Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION
Defendant and cross-complainant Karlen Galstyan (“Galstyan”) moves the
court for an order setting aside the default entered against him on the complaint
filed by plaintiffs Don Devore, Paul Devore, Scott R. Devore, as trustee of the
Scott R. Devore Revocable Living Trust dated February 23, 2016, Phil Devore, as
the trustee of the Edward S. Devore and Estelle L Devore Inter Vivos Trust, and
Devore & Devore (the “Devore Plaintiffs”) on July 12, 2021, in Case No. 20STCV34214.  (RJN Ex. F.) 
The court notes that it is unclear the type of relief that Galstyan
seeks in his motion.  Specifically, Galstyan’s
notice of motion states that he is seeking relief pursuant to the court’s
inherent and equitable powers, as well as section 473, subdivision (b), and his
supporting memorandum of points and authorities appears to address the
requirements for all theories of relief together.  (Notice of Mot., p. 2:4; Mot., pp. 7:10-22, 10:5-8
[stating that “[Galstyan’s] counsel made a mistake in failing to file a
responsive pleading to the” Devore Plaintiffs’ Complaint] [emphasis added],
11:14-17 [stating that the Devore Plaintiffs “are merely taking advantage of
the mistake, surprise, inadvertence, or neglect of their adversary, [Galstyan]]
[emphasis added], 11:19-21 [requesting the court to set aside Galstyan’s
default “[b]ased on the equitable powers of this Court].)  The court therefore evaluates Galstyan’s
motion as to each theory of relief. 
First, to the extent that Galstyan requests discretionary relief under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), the court denies that
request because it is untimely since (1) “[u]nder the discretionary relief
provision (§ 473(b)), a motion to set aside a default judgment must be made no
more than ‘six months’ after the default—not the default judgment—is
entered[,]” and (2) Galstyan filed the pending motion on September 11, 2024,
more than six months after his default was entered on July 12, 2021.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Jimenez
v. Chavez (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 50, 59; RJN Ex. F.)
            Second, to the extent that Galstyan
requests mandatory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (b), the court denies that request because Galstyan’s motion is not
“in proper form” within the meaning of section 473.
            The court acknowledges that (1)
default judgment has not been entered against Galstyan, such that his motion
“is made no more than six months after entry of judgment” and is therefore
timely, and (2) counsel for Galstyan has stated, in her declaration, that she
“failed to file a responsive pleading” by relying on a stipulation to
consolidate the pending matters.  (Jimenez,
supra, 97 Cal.App.5th at p. 60 [the mandatory relief provision “requires
the underlying default to be vacated if a motion to vacate the default judgment
is filed within six months of the date the default judgment was entered”]; Karapetian
Decl., ¶ 13.)  The court finds that
counsel’s assertion that she failed to file a responsive pleading is sufficient
to show that Galstyan’s default was taken against him based on his counsel’s
mistake.  (Karapetian Decl., ¶ 13
[“Relying on this stipulation, I failed to file a responsive pleading”].)  
However, Galstyan did not file a proposed answer to Devore Plaintiffs’
Complaint in support of his motion, nor did he propose to file the answer that
the court ordered stricken, and therefore his motion is not in proper
form.  (Jimenez, supra, 97
Cal.App.5th at p. 63 [“The phrase ‘in proper form’ encompasses the mandate,
expressly included in the discretionary relief provision (§ 473(b)), that the
motion be ‘ “accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to
be filed . . . .” ’”].)  Thus, the court
must deny Galstyan’s motion on this ground.[1]  (Ibid. [noting that, although the
motion was timely, “it was nonetheless properly denied because it was
unaccompanied by a proposed responsive pleading”].)  
Third, the court finds that Galstyan has not shown that he is entitled
to relief pursuant to the equitable powers of the court because Galstyan has
not shown (1) a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense since he did
not show that extrinsic fraud or extrinsic mistake occurred, and (2) that he
acted diligently in seeking to set aside his default.  (Kramer v. Traditional Escrow, Inc. (2020)
56 Cal.App.5th 13, 29 [a party seeking relief under the court’s equitable
powers must satisfy the elements of a stringent-three pronged test: a
satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense, a meritorious defense, and
diligence], 30 [“A defendant has a satisfactory excuse if it shows that an
extrinsic fraud or extrinsic mistake occurred”].) 
ORDER
            The court denies defendant and cross-complainant
Karlen Galstyan’s motion to set aside default.
The court orders plaintiffs Don Devore, Paul Devore, Scott R. Devore,
as trustee of the Scott R. Devore Revocable Living Trust dated February 23,
2016, Phil Devore, as the trustee of the Edward S. Devore and Estelle L Devore
Inter Vivos Trust, and Devore & Devore to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
