I.             INTRODUCTION
 
On October 19, 2023, Rafi Ourfalian and
Benjamin Aydindzhyan, counsel for Defendant, Victory Bistro Cafe, filed this Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel.  
 
II.           LEGAL
STANDARDS 
 
California Rule of Court rule 3.1362
(Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to
be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general
terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client
relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is
brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section
284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved
as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion
and declaration on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
 
The court has discretion to allow an
attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that there
is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of
justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
III.          DISCUSSION 
 
Rafi Ourfalian and Benjamin Aydindzhyan
seek to be relieved as counsel of record for Defendant for the following reasons:
“The attorney-client relationship has deteriorated as the principle of Victory
Bistro has ceased all communications with our office.  The client has also ceased making payments for
attorneys services and has failed to give assurances that any such payment will
be made in the future.  On June 23 and
24, 2022 attorney Benjamin Aydindzhyan contacted the client via email and
phone, respectively, to schedule a date and time to discuss and plan a course
of action for the case.  The client
failed to respond.  Thereafter, Mr.
Aydindzhyan made more attempts to get into contact with the client, the last of
which was on March 27, 2023, to no avail.  As such, we can no longer represent Victory
Bistro as the communication between the client and our office is no longer
existent and we have yet to receive payment on outstanding invoices for
services rendered or any assurance that any such payments can and will be made
in the future.”  (MC-052.)   
 
Absent a showing of resulting
prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 406.)
 
Upon review, the Court finds the Motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  
 
IV.          CONCLUSION   
The
unopposed Motion is granted and effective upon the filing of the proof of
service of this signed order upon Defendant.  
 
                Counsel to give
notice.
