MOTION
FOR NON-STATUTORY JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendants
Chris Furie, et al.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Baha
Tan Toksoz
 
 
I.          FACTUAL AND
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 
 
This is a breach of contract case.  According to the complaint, Plaintiff, Baha
Tan Toksoz, reached out to Chris Furie (“Furie”), a real estate broker, for
assistance in purchasing a property located at 943 N. Laurel Avenue in Los
Angeles, California.  Instead of
assisting Plaintiff with the purchase of 943 N. Laurel Avenue, Furie proposed
the purchase of 944 N. Laurel Avenue in Los Angeles, California (“Subject
Property”).  Furie represented that he
and his company, 944 Laurel, LLC (“944 Laurel”), were in the process of
purchasing the property from its owner, Alex Goodson (“Goodson”).  On November 5, 2019, Plaintiff eventually
entered into an oral lease agreement with Furie for the Subject Property.  The oral agreement had an option to
purchase.  
 
Pursuant to the agreement, Furie directed Plaintiff to
deposit $118,500 into escrow.  The escrow
deposit would be used by Defendants to purchase the Subject Property from
Goodson.  Furie assured Plaintiff that
those funds would be returned if escrow did not close.  Plaintiff was also directed to obtain
insurance for the property and to provide proof of same to the escrow.  However, in May of 2020, Furie notified
Plaintiff that escrow had terminated and that Plaintiff’s deposit of $118,500
was forfeited as liquidated damages.  Plaintiff did not know there was a liquidated
damages clause, let alone agree to said clause, nor was he given notice that the
escrow funds were in jeopardy.  Plaintiff
was further unaware that Furie and 944 Laurel were the previous owners of the
Subject Property, that they had sold it to Goodson, that Goodson had filed a
notice of recission for the Subject Property on April 1, 2018, and that Goodson
initiated litigation against Furie and 944 N. Laurel over misrepresentations
concerning the Subject Property.  That
litigation, filed on October 24, 2019 in Los Angeles Superior Court, Case No.
19STCV38262, was ongoing for nearly the entire duration of Plaintiff’s dealings
with Furie.  Plaintiff alleges that Furie
never intended to sell the Subject Property to Plaintiff and used Plaintiff’s deposit
of $118,500 to extract themselves out of the lawsuit with Goodson.
 
On April 30, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against
Defendants, Furie and 944 Laurel, LLC, for (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Breach
of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (4)
Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, (5) Fraud, (6) Misrepresentation,
(7) Negligence, (8) Conversion, and (9) Violation of Penal Code § 496.  The First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), which is
the operative pleading, was filed on August 30, 2021.
 
Defendants now move for judgment on the pleadings as to the
Third Cause of Action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Ninth Cause of Action
for Violation of Penal Code section 496. 
 
Plaintiff opposes and Defendants reply. 
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
            “A motion
for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer,
and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by
matters that can be judicially noticed.¿ [Citations.]”¿ (Burnett v. Chimney
Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1057 1064.)  The court must assume the
truth of all properly pleaded material facts and allegations, but not
contentions or conclusions of fact or law.¿ (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318; Wise v. Pacific Gas and Elec. Co. (2005) 132
Cal.App.4th 725, 738.)¿ “A judgment on the pleadings in favor of the defendant
is appropriate when the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(3)(B)(ii).)”¿ (Kapsimallis
v. Allstate Ins. Co. (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 667, 672.)¿ “Presentation of
extrinsic evidence is therefore not proper on a motion for judgment on the
pleadings.¿[Citation.]”¿ (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 995, 999.)¿ “The common law ground for a motion for judgment on the
pleadings is identical to the statutory ground[.]”  (Korchemny v. Piterman (2021) 68
Cal.App.5th 1032, 1055.)  Allegations are
to be liberally construed.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.)   
 
            If the
motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted, it may be granted with or
without leave to amend.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (h)(1).) 
“Where a demurrer is sustained or a motion for judgment on the pleadings is
granted as to the original complaint, denial of leave to amend constitutes an
abuse of discretion if the pleading does not show on its face that it is incapable
of amendment.”  (Virginia G. v. ABC Unified School Dist.¿(1993)
15 Cal.App.4th 1848, 1852 (emphasis added).) 
 
III.       JUDICIAL NOTICE 
 
            Plaintiff requests judicial notice of the complaint filed in
Los Angeles County Superior Court Case No. 19STCV38362, Alex Goodson v. 944
Laurel, LLC, et al., (the “Goodson Complaint”).  A copy of the complaint is attached as
Exhibit 1 to Plaintiff’s Opposition.
 
            Defendants object
to the request on the grounds that the Goodson Complaint does not appear on the
face of the FAC and therefore may not be considered in the disposition of this
motion.  
 
            The Court
overrules the objection and grants Plaintiff’s request.  The Goodson Complaint is filed in Los Angeles
Superior County Superior Court and is therefore a record of the court of this
state.  Pursuant to Evidence Code section
452, subdivision (d)(1), the Goodson Complaint is the proper subject of
judicial notice.  However, the Court
takes judicial notice of the existence of the Goodson Complaint, but not the
truth of the matters alleged therein.
 
IV.       EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS
 
            Defendants object to Exhibits 2 through 9 attached to the
Opposition on the grounds that they lack foundation, lack authentication, and
are inadmissible hearsay.   The objections are sustained.  The objections are sustained for the
additional reason that the exhibits are extrinsic matters that appear beyond
the four corners of the FAC. 
 
V.        DISCUSSION 
 
            Defendants
argue the FAC fails to state causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and
violation of Penal Code section 496.  The
Court addresses each argument in turn. 
 
            A. Third
Cause of Action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty
 
            “The
elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty are the existence of
a
fiduciary relationship, its breach, and damage proximately
caused by that breach.”  (Knox v. Dean
(2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 417, 432-33.)  No fraudulent
intent is required.  (See Civ. Code, §
1573 (defining “constructive fraud”).)
 
            Defendants
argue that the FAC does not adequately allege the existence of fiduciary
relationship between Defendants and Plaintiff. 
A review of the FAC supports Defendant’s argument.  The FAC generally alleges that Furie was a
real estate broker “who represented the lease option and eventual sale of the
[Subject Property] to Plaintiff.”  (FAC, ¶¶
62, 63.)  “As a real estate broker, Defendant
owed fiduciary duties to Plaintiff.” 
(FAC, ¶ 63.)  However, missing
from the FAC are allegations showing that Furie was acting as Plaintiff’s real
estate broker in connection with the Subject Property.  Absent such allegations, the FAC does not
establish a fiduciary duty arose between Furie and Plaintiff.  Rather, as alleged, this case concerns the
sale of the Subject Property with Furie as the seller and Plaintiff as the
buyer.  (See FAC, ¶¶ 16, 20.  Nor could a fiduciary relationship arise
between 944 Laurel and Plaintiff because 944 Laurel is not a real estate broker.  
 
            Plaintiff contends the Third Cause of Action is sufficiently
pled because it is unquestionable that Plaintiff contacted Furie in his
capacity as a real estate broker for assistance in purchasing the property at
943 N. Laurel Avenue.[1]  However, as stated above, this case concerns
the property at 944 N. Laurel Avenue. 
There is no allegation to show that Plaintiff engaged Furie as a real
estate broker to purchase the Subject Property. 
The FAC portrays Furie as the seller of the Subject Property, nothing
more.  (See FAC, ¶¶ 20, 22.)  The FAC does not state a cause of action for
breach of fiduciary duty.
 
            B.  Ninth Cause of Action for Violation of Penal
Code Section 496
 
            “Section
496, subdivision (a) (section 496(a)) defines the criminal offense of what is
commonly referred to as receiving stolen property.  As amended in 1972 (Stats. 1972, ch. 963, §
1, p. 1739), it provides in relevant part: ‘Every person who buys or receives
any property that has been stolen or that has been obtained in any manner
constituting theft or extortion, knowing the property to be so stolen or
obtained, or who conceals, sells, withholds, or aids in concealing, selling, or
withholding any property from the owner, knowing the property to be so stolen
or obtained,” is subject to incarceration.” 
(Siry Inv., L.P. v. Farkhondehpour (2022) 13 Cal.5th 333, 346.)  
 
            In Switzer
v. Wood (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 116, the Court of Appeal discussed the crimes
constituting theft, stating in relevant part:
 
A
violation of section 496(a) may, by its own terms, relate to property that has
been “stolen” or “that has been obtained in any manner constituting
theft or extortion.” (§ 496(a), italics added.) As reflected in Bell v.
Feibush, supra, 212 Cal.App.4th at p. 1048, 151 Cal.Rptr.3d 546, the
issue of whether a wrongdoer's conduct in any manner constituted a “theft” is
elucidated by other provisions of the Penal Code defining theft, such as Penal
Code section 484. In 1927, the Legislature consolidated the crimes of larceny,
embezzlement, and theft by false pretense in Penal Code section 484,
subdivision (a), under the single term “theft.” (Bell v. Feibush, at p.
1048, 151 Cal.Rptr.3d 546; see also People v. Vidana (2016) 1 Cal.5th
632, 640–641, 206 Cal.Rptr.3d 556, 377 P.3d 805 [although the distinctive substantive
elements of each offense remained the same, each constituted the crime of
“theft”]; People v. Gomez (2008) 43 Cal.4th 249, 255, fn. 4, 74
Cal.Rptr.3d 123, 179 P.3d 917.) Section 484, subdivision (a), states as
follows: “Every person who shall feloniously steal, take, carry, lead, or drive
away the personal property of another, or who shall fraudulently appropriate
property which has been entrusted to him or her, or who shall knowingly and
designedly, by any false or fraudulent representation or pretense, defraud any
other person of money, labor or real or personal property, or who causes or
procures others to report falsely of his or her wealth or mercantile character
and by thus imposing upon any person, obtains credit and thereby fraudulently
gets or obtains possession of money, or property or obtains the labor or
service of another, is guilty of theft.” (Italics in original.)
 
(Switzer, 35 Cal.App.5th at pp. 126-127.)
 
            “Section
496(c), similar to some provisions in other statutory schemes, articulates a
right to special civil remedies when a violation of section 496(a) has
occurred.  Subdivision (c), as also
amended in 1972, states that any person who has been injured by a violation of
section 496(a) ‘may bring an action for three times the amount of actual
damages, if any, sustained by the plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable
attorney's fees.’” (Siry Inv., L.P., 13 Cal.5th  at. pp. 346-47, footnotes omitted.)  A criminal conviction is not a prerequisite to
recovery of treble damages.  (Switzer,
supra, 35 Cal.App.5th at p. 126.)
 
            Defendants
argue that criminal intent is not adequately pled as required for a violation
of Penal Code section 496.  Rather,
Plaintiff has simply alleged nonperformance amounting to a commercial
default.  In support, Defendants point to
paragraphs 40, 45, 49, and 50 of the FAC, which allege, in relevant part:
 
“Defendants
through their misrepresentations appeared never able or willing to perform
under the agreement between the parties.” (FAC, ¶ 40.)
 
“These funds
were deposited into escrow on behalf an oral agreement between the parties that
those funds would be used by Defendants to repurchase the Subject Property.
Defendants represented that the $118,500 would be protected and would be
returned to Plaintiff should escrow not close on the Subject Property.”  (FAC, ¶ 45.)
 
“Defendants
failed to inform Plaintiff that the deposit into escrow was not protected and
that it was subject to liquidated damages, to which Plaintiff had not notice
and had not agreed. Instead Defendants always represented that it was
completely protected.”  (FAC, ¶ 49.)
 
“Defendants
breached these duties in that they failed to protect Plaintiff’s interest in
the property, failed to close escrow, failed to keep Plaintiff informed
regarding the property, made numerous serious material misrepresentations
regarding the close of escrow on the property to deflect any investigations by
Plaintiff.”  (FAC, ¶ 50.)
 
            Defendants’
argument lacks merit.  Although the
foregoing allegations resemble nonperformance of a contract, the FAC also sets
forth allegations that suggest the agreement was a sham. Specifically, the FAC
alleges that “Defendant was deliberately preventing any disclosure that the
sale was not taking place and that Plaintiff’s money would not be returned to
him” (FAC, ¶ 31), and that “Defendants used Plaintiff’s money to attempt to
extract themselves out of the lawsuit with Alex Goodson” (FAC, ¶ 38).  Liberally construed, these allegations show
that Defendants obtained Plaintiff’s money under false pretenses.  As the Court of Appeal observed in Switzer,
supra, fraudulently obtaining property, or obtaining property under
false pretenses, is theft within the meaning of the Penal Code section
496.  (Switzer, 35 Cal.App.5th at
pp. 126-127.)  The Ninth Cause of
Action is adequately pleaded.   
 
V.        CONCLUSION         
            Accordingly,
the motion as to the Third Cause of Action is GRANTED.  The motion as to the Ninth Cause of Action is
DENIED.  Leave to amend is GRANTED. 

            Plaintiff
is ordered to serve and file the Second Amended Complaint within 15 days of
this order. 
            Defendants
are ordered to serve and file their responsive pleading within 30 days of service
of the amended pleading.
            Defendants
to give notice.
