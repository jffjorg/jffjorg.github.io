Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for a protective order and vacated the third-party examination of Hiroshi Kaho scheduled for December 13, 2023. The subpoena issued to Mr. Kaho is also quashed. The court finds that Judgment Creditor no longer has a money judgment, as the judgment has been partially satisfied and the reasonable royalty provision is an injunctive remedy. Additionally, Judgment Creditor does not satisfy Section 708.120, subdivision (a) of the Code of Civil Procedure, as the affidavit filed does not show that Mr. Kaho personally possesses property belonging to the Judgment Debtors or is personally indebted to them in an amount exceeding $250.
