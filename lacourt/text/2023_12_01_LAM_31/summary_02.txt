Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendants (Chris Furie and 944 Laurel, LLC) against the plaintiff (Baha Tan Toksoz). The plaintiff is suing the defendants for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of Penal Code section 496.

The judge has granted the motion as to the Third Cause of Action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty, finding that the plaintiff has not adequately alleged the existence of a fiduciary relationship between the parties.

However, the judge has denied the motion as to the Ninth Cause of Action for Violation of Penal Code section 496, finding that the plaintiff has adequately pleaded the allegations of fraudulently obtaining property under false pretenses.

The judge has granted leave to amend the complaint and ordered the plaintiff to serve and file a second amended complaint within 15 days. The defendants are ordered to serve and file their responsive pleading within 30 days of service of the amended pleading.
