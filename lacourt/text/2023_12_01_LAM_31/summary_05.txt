And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion for Examination of Mr. Kaho. The judge has determined that there is no money judgment at issue, and therefore, does not need to address Mr. Kaho's remaining arguments. The judge also notes that it is unclear whether Judgment Creditor seeks to examine Mr. Kaho in his individual or representative capacity, and that the civil subpoena and Application for Order are unclear in this regard. The judge will likely revisit these issues at the upcoming court hearing.
