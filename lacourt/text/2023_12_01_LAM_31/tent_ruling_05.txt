[1] Mr. Kaho also advances the following
arguments: (1) Ajinomoto has offered to provide a sworn declaration to confirm
that Ajinomoto Foods has assumed the obligations of the Judgment Debtors; (2)
section 708.300 permits a judgment creditor to obtain documents in
post-judgment proceedings from a judgment debtor, not a third party; and (3) Mr.
Kaho has no obligation to appear for the examination because Judgment Creditor
has not provided proof that it satisfied section 708.120, subdivision (f).  Given the Court’s disposition of the Motion on
the grounds there is no money judgment at issue, the Court need not address Mr.
Kaho’s remaining arguments. 


[2] The Court also notes that it is unclear
whether Judgment Creditor seeks to examine Mr. Kaho in his individual capacity
or representative capacity.  If the
Judgment Creditor is seeking the examination of a representative of Ajinomoto
Foods, then the civil subpoena is erroneously directed to Mr. Kaho individually.
 The Application for Order is also
similarly unclear as it is directed to Mr. Kaho as a third party.
