BACKGROUND
            On March 24, 2023, plaintiff Mario
Rey filed a complaint against Pathway Vet Alliance LLC and Homero Hernandez dba
The Village Petacular Grooming, and Does for (1) negligence, (2) premises
liability, and (3) negligence per se. 
            On November 20, 2023, defendant

            On January 17, 2024, plaintiff filed
a request for dismissal as to the 3rd cause of action only.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context. 
Taylor v. City of Los Angeles
Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. 
Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.”  SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.  “The only issue
involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.
DISCUSSION
Defendant Homero Hernandez demurs
to the 3rd cause of action for negligence per se on the ground that it
fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action.
The complaint alleges that on March
26, 2021, at 1930 South Pacific Coast Highway, Redondo Beach, plaintiff was
inside the animal facility, when a cat escaped from its cage and bit plaintiff
on the hand.  Plaintiff’s hand became
swollen and thereafter required surgery due to severe infection.  Defendants failed to properly restrain the
cat so as to prevent the risk of harm to plaintiff.  Defendants failed to provide proof the cat’s
license tag number, owner information and vaccination records to plaintiff within
48 hours in violation of Penal Code §988(a). 
Complaint, ¶¶15, 18-22.
CASE
MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE
            The Court intends to conduct the
Case management Conference.
As noted above, plaintiff filed a
request for dismissal as to the 3rd cause of action.
The demurrer is thus MOOT.
Moving defendant is to give notice
of ruling.
