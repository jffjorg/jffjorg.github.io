And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

On February 2, 2024, the court issued a tentative ruling in the case of Halkias vs. Kuhn. The defendants, Rory Kuhn and Je'Nai Kuhn, filed a motion to leave to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiffs, Theodore Halkias and Jill Halkias, and to add their children as cross-complainants. The motion was granted, and the defendants are ordered to file their cross-complaint within five days. The court found that the proposed cross-complaint arises out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the complaint and that it would be in the interest of justice to allow the defendants to file the cross-complaint. The court also noted that the defendants acted in good faith and did not act in bad faith.
