And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted plaintiff Lusine Boyajyan's motions to compel defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC to respond to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demands for inspection and copying. The defendant failed to respond to these discovery requests, despite having over six weeks to do so. The court finds that the defendant did not act with substantial justification and therefore orders the defendant to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,986.65. The court also deems the truth of the matters specified in the plaintiff's requests for admission to be admitted. The judge's tentative ruling orders the defendant to serve verified responses to the discovery requests within 30 days and to pay the sanctions within the same time period. The court finds that the plaintiff reasonably incurred all expenses claimed and orders the defendant and its counsel, Clark Hill LLP, to be jointly and severally liable for all sanctions.
