  Case Number:  22STCV09946    Hearing Date:   July 3, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendant Greystar
California, Inc.’s Motion to Set Aside Default
Defendant
Greystar California, Inc. (Greystar) moves to set aside its default.  
Greystar shows adequate grounds for relief from
default.  Code of Civil Procedure section
473(b) provides, “The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party
or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect.” 
“Because the law favors disposing of cases on their merits, ‘any doubts
in applying section 473 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking
relief from default.’ ”  (Rappleyea
v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980.)
Greystar’s default resulted from mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  Plaintiff
first requested Greystar’s default on April 3, 2024.  (Cardoso Decl., ¶ 23.)  The clerk rejected the request.  (Ibid.)  Greystar’s counsel mistakenly “assumed it was
[rejected] because the demurrer had been filed.”  (Id., ¶ 24.)  Ultimately, the clerk entered Greystar’s
default on May 7.  The next day, Greystar
filed a declaration of demurring party in support of automatic extension.  The declaration’s signature is dated May 6.  Greystar narrowly missed obtaining an
automatic extension.  Greystar shows it
attempted to file a timely responsive pleading and would have done so but for a
minor, excusable mistake.
