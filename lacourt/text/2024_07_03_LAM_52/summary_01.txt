Judge's Tentative Ruling on Motion to Set Aside Default

On July 3, 2024, the court issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Greystar California, Inc.'s motion to set aside default. The court found that Greystar showed adequate grounds for relief from default, as its default resulted from mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. Specifically, Greystar's counsel mistakenly assumed that the plaintiff's request for default was rejected, and the clerk entered the default on May 7, 2024. Greystar filed a declaration of demurring party in support of automatic extension, but narrowly missed obtaining an automatic extension. The court granted Greystar's motion to set aside default and vacated the default entered against it. The demurrer filed by Greystar will be heard as scheduled on July 29, 2024, and the final status conference and jury trial will be continued to January 2025.
