And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant, American Honda Motor Co. Inc. The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff's second cause of action for fraudulent inducement is defective and must be re-pleaded. The motion to strike is denied as moot, as the demurrer has been sustained and the second cause of action is no longer viable. The judge's ruling is based on the grounds that the plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege a direct transaction between the parties, and that the complaint lacks specific allegations of agency between the defendant and the dealership that sold the vehicle to the plaintiff.
