  Case Number:  23VECV02156    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2023    Dept:  107 [Tentative] Ruling
 
The Demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. The Motion to Strike is
DENIED as moot.
 
 
BACKGROUND
 
The Plaintiff alleges the following: This is a Lemon Law case. On July 15,
2021, Plaintiff purchased a certified pre-owned 2018 Acura MDX (VIN:
5J8YD3H35JL004571), which was manufactured by Defendant American Honda Motor
Co. Inc. The Subject Vehicle was delivered to Plaintiff with serious defects
and nonconformities to warranty and developed other serious defects and
nonconformities to the warranty relating to the computerized driver-assistance safety
systems called “Honda Sensing.” It is further alleged that Defendant had
exclusive knowledge of this defect since 2016 and knowingly sold the defective
vehicle to Plaintiff. Based on this knowledge, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant
had a duty to disclose the defect but failed to do so. Instead, Defendant is
alleged to have actively concealed the defect. Due to this defect, Plaintiff
presented the subject vehicle to an authorized repair facility several times.
 
On May 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative complaint against Defendant
American Honda Motor Co. Inc., alleging:
 

Violation of Song-Beverly
     Act – Breach of Express Warranty
Fraudulent Inducement –
     Concealment

 
On November 27, 2023, Defendant filed a demurrer directed at the second
cause of action and a motion to strike as to Plaintiff’s claim for punitive
damages. On November 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed his opposition. On December 6,
2023, Defendant filed its reply. 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Legal Standard
 

Demurrer

 
A demurrer is an objection to a
pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the face of the
complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.¿Code Civ.
Proc. § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.)¿The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a
pleading “by raising questions of law.”¿(Postley v. Harvey (1984) 153
Cal.App.3d 280, 286.)¿“In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose of
determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a
view to substantial justice between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 452.)¿The
court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly
pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . . .”
’ ”¿ (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)¿In applying
these standards, the court liberally construes the complaint to determine
whether a cause of action has been stated.¿(Picton v. Anderson Union High
School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.) 
 

Motion Strike 

 
“The court may, upon a motion
made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms
it deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter
inserted in any pleading. (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an
order of the court.”¿(Code Civ. Proc. § 436.) “Immaterial” or “irrelevant”
matters include allegations not essential to the claim, allegations neither
pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or a demand for
judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 431.10, subds. (b)(1)-(3).) 
 
Judicial Notice
 
Defendant requests the Court to take judicial notice of the following
documents: (1) Safety Recall Report to NHTSA published in May 2015 cited at
Paragraph 32 of Plaintiff’s Complaint; (2) Safety Recall Report to NHTSA
published in May 2015 cited at Paragraph 32 of Plaintiff’s Complaint; (3) Honda
Tech Line Summary Article ATS 170204 published in February 2017 cited at
Paragraph 53 of Plaintiff’s Complaint; and (4) Honda Technical Service Bulletin
17-064 published in September 2017 cited at Paragraph 55 of Plaintiff’s Complaint.
The request is granted pursuant to Evidence Code § 452(c) and (h) as to the
documents’ existence only. 
 
Plaintiff requests the Court to take judicial notice of a conformed copy of
the second amended complaint filed in Dhital v Nissan North America, Inc.,
No. RG19009260 in Alameda County. The request is granted pursuant to Evidence
Code §452(d) as to the document’s existence only. 
 
Discussion
 
As a preliminary matter, the Court finds that Defendant has abided by the
meet and confer requirements set forth under Code of Civil Procedure §§ 430.41 and 435.5. (Atkinson Decl. ¶¶ 3-4, Exh. B.) 
 

Demurrer

 
Defendant first argues that the second cause of action is subject to
demurrer because it has not been adequately pleaded as it fails to sufficiently
allege a duty to disclose.
 
To state a claim for fraudulent
inducement-concealment, Plaintiffs must allege: (1) the defendant “concealed or
suppressed a material fact,” (2) the defendant was “under a duty to disclose
the fact to the plaintiff,” (3) the defendant “intentionally concealed or
suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff,” (4) the
plaintiff was “unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had
known of the concealed or suppressed fact,” and (5) “as a result of the
concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff must have sustained
damage.” (Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 276, 310–11.)  
 
Absent a fiduciary relationship
between the parties (which Plaintiffs do not allege here), a duty to disclose
can arise in only three circumstances: (1) the defendant had exclusive
knowledge of the material fact; (2) the defendant actively concealed the
material fact; or (3) the defendant made partial representations while also
suppressing the material fact. (Bigler-Engler, supra, 7 Cal.App.5th at
311; LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 336.) The California
Supreme Court “has described the necessary relationship giving rise to a duty
to disclose as a ‘transaction’ between the plaintiff and defendant ….” (Bigler-Engler,
supra, 7 Cal.App.5th at p. 311; Warner Construction Corp. v. City of Los
Angeles (1970) 2 Cal.3d 285, 294 [“In transactions which do not involve
fiduciary or confidential relations”]; Hoffman v. 162 North Wolfe LLC
(2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 1178, 1187–89 [rejecting concealment claim where
plaintiffs “were not involved in a transaction with the parties they claim
defrauded them”]; LiMandri, supra, 52 Cal.App.4th at p. 337 [“such a
relationship can only come into being as a result of some sort of transaction
between the parties”].) 
 
Defendant argues there is no
transactional relationship alleged that would support a duty to disclose, and
instead, Plaintiff merely alleges that Defendant had “excusive knowledge” of
the purported defect. (Demurrer at pg. 7.) Defendant points out that the
complaint alleges that Defendant issued recalls and published accessible
information regarding the purported defect between 2015 and 2018. (Ibid.;
Compl. ¶¶ 27-64.)  However, it is alleged
Plaintiff visited and purchased the subject vehicle from Acura of Sherman Oaks.
(Compl. ¶ 84.) As a result, Defendant asserts that the complaint contains no
allegations of any direct dealing with Defendant. Thus, Defendant argues that
under Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 276 these
allegations are deficient.  
 
To distinguish Bigler-Engler,
Plaintiff relies on Dhital v. Nissan North America (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th
828 and argues that the duty to disclose element has been satisfied because it
is alleged that the dealership that sold the subject vehicle to Plaintiff was
Defendant’s agent for the purpose of selling vehicles. (Opposition re: Demurrer
at pg. 4.) Thus, Plaintiff asserts that a transaction exists between the
parties. (Ibid.)
 
The California Supreme Court granted review of Dhital on February 1,
2023, however, the request for depublication was denied. (Dhital v. Nissan
North America (Cal. 2023) 304 Cal.Rptr.3d 82, 83). As review has been
granted, Dhital is not binding authority but may have persuasive value.
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1115(e)(1). The plaintiffs in Dhital sued
Nissan for Song-Beverly violations. They alleged the transmission was faulty
and unreliable, and that it placed them at risk for an accident though they did
not allege they had actually been injured. The pleading included a claim for
fraudulent inducement. Plaintiffs alleged that Nissan concealed defects it had a
duty to disclose in order to induce the purchase. The trial court sustained
Nissan’s demurrer to the fraudulent inducement cause of action on the basis
that it was barred by the economic loss doctrine. Within its decision reversing
the lower court’s decision, the appellate court found that: 
 
“[a]t the
pleading stage (and in the absence of a more developed argument by Nissan on
this point), we conclude Plaintiff’s allegations are sufficient. Plaintiff
alleged that they bought the car from a Nissan dealership, that Nissan backed
the car with an express warranty, and that Nissan’s authorized dealerships are
its agents for purposes of the sale of Nissan vehicles to consumers. In light
of these allegations, we decline to hold Plaintiff’s claim is barred on the
ground there was no relationship requiring Nissan to disclose known defects.”
 
(Dhital, supra, 84 Cal.App.5th at pp. 727-729.)
 
However, unlike the Defendant in Dhital, Defendant here has set
forth a satisfactory argument as to why it should not be summarily presumed
that an agency relationship existed between Defendant and the dealership that
sold the subject vehicle to Plaintiff. “[A] dealer or retailer may in a
layman's view be an agent of the [manufacturer], but he is not an agent in the
legal sense of that relationship.” (Avalon Painting Co. v. Alert Lumber Co.
(1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 178, 184; see also Herremans v. BMW of N. Am., LLC,
No. (C.D.Cal. 2014) 2014 WL 5017843, at *6 [“[t]he relationship between
automobile manufacturers and their dealers has been examined by a host of
courts throughout the country, all of which have agreed that dealers are not
‘agents’ of manufacturers.”].) 
 
Plaintiff’s complaint includes the conclusory allegation that Defendant’s
authorized dealerships are its agents. (Compl. ¶ 116.) Yet, the complaint fails
to set forth facts that Acura of Sherman Oaks, let alone any of Defendant’s
authorized dealerships, are agents of Defendant. Critically, “fraud must be pleaded specifically; general and
conclusory allegations do not suffice.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996)
12 Cal.4th 631, 645); Kuehl v. GM LLC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
215644, *9 (“Conclusory allegations of agency, without facts supporting the
allegation, are insufficient to establish an agency relationship for pleading
purposes.”) Friedman v. Mercedes Benz USA LLC, No. 12-cv-7204 GAF, 2013
WL 8336127, at *6 (C.D. Cal. June 12, 2013) (rejecting allegation that
"Keyes, an authorized Mercedes dealership, served as Mercedes'
agent"); Keegan v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 838 F. Supp. 2d 929,
953 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (rejecting allegation that "Honda's dealers . . . are
its agents" as conclusory and unsupported by factual allegations).
 
Accordingly, because the
complaint fails to sufficiently allege a direct transaction between the
parties, the demurrer to second cause of action is sustained on this ground
with leave to amend. In the interest of judicial economy, the Court declines to
address Defendant’s remaining arguments.
 

Motion to Strike

 
Because the Court has sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action,
Defendant’s motion to strike directed at Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages
is moot. Accordingly, the motion to strike is denied as moot.
