**Case Summary**

Case Number: 22STCV40862
Hearing Date: April 16, 2024
Department: 53 Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles - Central District

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Jane Doe
* Defendants: Church of Scientology International, Bridge Publications, Inc., and Religious Technology Center (joined by defendant Gavin Potter)

**Summary of Tentative Ruling**

The court has made a tentative ruling on two motions: (1) Plaintiff's motion to seal documents and (2) Defendants' motion to compel arbitration.

**Tentative Ruling**

1. **Sealing of Documents**: The court grants Plaintiff's motion to seal documents numbered as CSI 00024-32, attached as exhibits 6 and 8 to the "Supplemental Declaration of Sarah Heller in Support of Church Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration" filed by defendants Church of Scientology International, Bridge Publications, Inc., and Religious Technology Center on February 8, 2024. The court finds that there exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record since the documents set forth Plaintiff's name and reflections of a highly personal nature.
2. **Compel Arbitration**: The court grants Defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The court finds that Defendants have met their burden to show that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable. The court determines that the arbitration agreement is not invalid under the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (EFAA) or McGill v. Citibank (2017) 2 Cal.5th 945. The court also rejects Plaintiff's contention that the arbitration provision is unconscionable.

**Key Points**

* The court grants Plaintiff's motion to seal documents numbered as CSI 00024-32.
* The court grants Defendants' motion to compel arbitration.
* The court determines that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable under the EFAA and McGill.
* The court rejects Plaintiff's contention that the arbitration provision is unconscionable.
