[1] On
February 14, 2024, the court issued an order noting several procedural defects
with the parties’ papers, including that the opposition papers filed by
plaintiff Jane Doe violated California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113.  The court continued the hearing on the motion
to compel arbitration in order to allow the parties to file (1) an amended
opposition that complied with rule 3.1113, and (2) amended reply memoranda in
response to the amended opposition. 


[2] On
February 8, 2024, the moving defendants filed an incomplete application to file
these documents under seal.  In its
February 16, 2024 order, the court noted deficiencies with the request to seal
and continued the hearing on the motion to compel arbitration to give the
defendants an opportunity to file a revised application to seal that complied
with California Rules of Court, rules 2.550-2.551.  (Feb. 14, 2024 Order, p. 2:18-22.)  Defendants (1) Religious Technology Center
and (2) Church of Scientology International and Bridge Publications, Inc.
separately filed, on February 28, 2024, notices of their intent not to file
these exhibits under seal. 


[3] As
set forth above, the court has sustained Church Defendants’ evidentiary
objection to Plaintiff’s October 13, 2023 declaration in its entirety because
it does not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 2015.5.  The court therefore has not evaluated the
facts set forth in that declaration.

Paragraph 1 of the Agreement makes clear that “I” refers to Plaintiff.  (Heller Decl., Ex. 1, Agreement, ¶ 1.)
