 Case Number:  23STCV30834    Hearing Date:   April 16, 2024    Dept:  53 Ramirez v. California Landmark
Group  23STCV30834 
Ex
Parte Application  4/16/24
The
court finds that plaintiff (1) has not satisfied the requirement of California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1202, subdivision (c), that an applicant for an ex parte
order must make an affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing
competent testimony based on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate
danger, or other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte, and (2) has not
satisfied the requirement of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1204,
subdivision (b), that an ex parte application must be accompanied by  a declaration regarding notice stating the
matters set forth in that subdivision.  
The
court therefore denies plaintiff’s ex parte application.
The court
orders plaintiff to give notice of this order.
