Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted a motion to continue the trial, which was originally set for November 4, 2024. The court will be dark on that date, so the trial date has been changed to November 25, 2024. However, this new date conflicts with the defense's preplanned vacation. The court has decided to grant the motion because it continued the trial on its own motion, without consulting the parties, and therefore must be sensitive to conflicts caused by its own actions. The court will work with counsel to re-set the trial date to a date that is convenient for all parties and the court. The judge also notes that the case is old, having been filed in February 2021, and will work hard to find a trial date as soon as practicable.
