And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the judgment creditor's application to extend a lien that was automatically created when the order for a debtor's examination was served. The lien was created on October 5, 2023, for Jona Rechnitz and October 6, 2023, for Jadelle, and is set to expire soon. The judgment creditor is seeking to extend the lien for another year, but the judgment debtors argue that the motion is procedurally improper and should be brought on a noticed motion.

The judge is inclined to grant the request, citing the balance of hardships in favor of the judgment creditor. The judge notes that the examinations have been continued on numerous occasions, and that the judgment debtors have not provided assurance that no harm will occur if the motion is granted. The judge also balances the procedural point against the judgment creditor, who seems to have been not diligent in bringing the motion.

The judge concludes that the policy behind the statute favors allowing the lien to be extended, as it allows the judgment creditor to find out where the assets are so that the creditor can start to collect on the judgment. The judge grants the application and extends the liens for one additional year, to October 5, 2025, and October 6, 2025, respectively.
