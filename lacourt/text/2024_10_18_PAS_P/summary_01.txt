And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a homeowner's claim for water damage against multiple defendants. The defendants have demurred to the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, arguing that the claims are time-barred by the statute of limitations. The judge has sustained the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff has failed to meet the burden of pleading the delayed discovery rule with sufficient particularity. The judge has also denied the defendants' motion to strike the allegations of the Second Amended Complaint as moot. The case is dismissed without leave to amend.
