Summary:

The judge has granted the City of Los Angeles's motion for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing Ashleigh Robinson's personal injury lawsuit. The City argued that Robinson failed to comply with the six-month claims presentation requirement under Government Code section 911.2(a) and that the court lacks jurisdiction over the Complaint. The judge found that Robinson's failure to file her claim within the required time period bars her cause of action, and that the City's investigation and denial of her claim did not waive its ability to assert the timeliness defense. The judge also found that Robinson failed to seek leave to file a late claim under Government Code section 911.4, and that the statutory period for filing such an application has lapsed. As a result, the judge granted the City's motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend.
