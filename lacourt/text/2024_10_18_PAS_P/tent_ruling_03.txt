 Case Number:  24AHCV00094    Hearing Date:   October 18, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING  DEFENDANT CITY OF LOS ANGELES’S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGSI.         INTRODUCTION              This action arises from an alleged  personal injury sustained by Plaintiff Ashleigh Robinson on June 15, 2023.  Plaintiff claims that she was injured when the lid of a trash bin, operated by  Deros Salza, an employee of Defendant City of Los Angeles (“City”), struck her  while she was near her home. Plaintiff alleges that the incident occurred due  to the negligent operation of the trash bin by the City’s employee.   Plaintiff submitted a Claim for  Damages to the City on January 2, 2024. On January 23, 2024, the City denied  Plaintiff’s claim for two reasons: (1) the claim was filed beyond the six-month  claims presentation period required under Government Code section 911.2(a), and  (2) the claim alleged that Plaintiff was harmed in the City of Pasadena, not  Los Angeles. On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff  filed the instant action. The City filed its answer on March 26, 2024.  Subsequently, on September 9, 2024, the City filed the present motion for  judgment on the pleadings. On October 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed her opposition to  the City’s motion. Meet and Confer Before filing a judgment on the  pleadings pursuant to this chapter, the moving party shall meet and confer in  person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to  the motion for judgment on the pleadings for the purpose of determining whether  an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in  the motion for judgment on the pleadings...” (Code Civ. Proc., § 439(a).) The  moving party shall file and serve with the motion for judgment on the pleadings  a declaration concerning the parties meet and confer efforts.¿ (Code Civ.  Proc., § 439(a)(3).)¿¿  Here, Plaintiff’s counsel, Caspar  Jivalagian, states that no meaningful effort was made by the City to meet and  confer regarding the issues presented in this motion. According to Mr.  Jivalagian, he attempted to initiate the meet-and-confer process on October 2,  2024, but Deputy City Attorney Olivia Bona refused to engage in a discussion on  the merits of the motion. Instead, Ms. Bona insisted that Plaintiff voluntarily  dismiss the complaint without addressing the legal arguments Plaintiff intended  to raise in opposition to the motion. Code of Civil Procedure section  439(a)(4) provides that "a determination by the court that the  meet-and-confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to grant or deny  the motion for judgment on the pleadings." Therefore, even though the meet-and-confer  process may have been insufficient, this does not provide a sufficient basis  for granting or denying the motion for judgment on the pleadings.    II.        LEGAL STANDARD "A motion for judgment on the  pleadings is analogous to a general demurrer but is made after the time to file  a demurrer has expired." (International Assn. of Firefighters, Local  230 v. City of San Jose (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1196.) If the party  moving for judgment on the pleadings is a defendant, there are only two  permissible grounds for bringing the motion: the court lacks subject matter  jurisdiction or the complaint "does not state facts sufficient to  constitute a cause of action against that defendant." (Code Civ. Proc., §  438, subd. (c)(1)(b)(ii).)              “Because  the motion is, in effect, a general demurrer, the same rules apply.” (Sofias  v. Bank of America¿(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 583, 586.) Therefore, when  determining whether a complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a  cause of action, the court must treat the complaint as “admitting all material  facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact  or law.” (Schonfeldt v. State of California (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1462,  1465.)              If the  court grants the motion, it may permit the opposing party to amend the  pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (h)(1).) If granting leave to amend,  the court must allow the party 30 days to file the amended pleading. (Id.,  § 438, subd. (h)(2).) But “[i]f there is no liability as a matter of law, leave  to amend should not be granted.” (Schonfeldt v. State of California, supra, 61  Cal.App.4th at 1465.)    III.      ANALYSIS             The City  moves for judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiff’s Complaint. Specifically,  the City requests judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that Plaintiff  failed to comply with the claims presentation requirement, the Court lacks  jurisdiction over the Complaint, and the Complaint fails to state a cause of  action with sufficient facts. Claims presentation and Jurisdiction. Defendant argues that Plaintiff  failed to comply with the six-month claim presentation requirement under  Government Code section 911.2(a), which mandates that a claim for injury to  person or property must be presented to a public entity within six months of  the accrual of the cause of action. Defendant asserts that Plaintiff’s cause of  action accrued on June 15, 2023, the date she was allegedly injured by a trash  bin lid operated by City of Los Angeles employee Deros Salza. However,  Plaintiff did not file her claim with the City until January 2, 2024, which  Defendant contends exceeds the statutory six-month deadline. Defendant refers to Exhibit B,  which shows that Plaintiff was informed by the City that her claim was untimely  because it was filed after the six-month deadline. The City also advised  Plaintiff that her only recourse was to “apply for leave to present a late  claim under Government Code sections 911.4 and 912.2” (Bona Decl., Exh. B).  In opposition, Plaintiff argues that the  City’s investigation and subsequent denial of her claim waived its ability to  assert the timeliness defense. Plaintiff refers to Exhibit F, a letter from the  City which states that the denial was based on the merits of the claim rather  than its timeliness (Jivalagian Decl., Ex. F)¿. Plaintiff contends that the  City's failure to mention the timeliness issue in its denial letter should  preclude Defendant from now relying on that defense. However, Government Code section  911.2(a) imposes a strict statutory deadline, and compliance with this deadline  is a jurisdictional prerequisite to maintaining a lawsuit against a public  entity. The fact that the City investigated the claim does not excuse  Plaintiff’s failure to file within the required six months, nor does it waive  the need for Plaintiff to seek leave to file a late claim under Government Code  section 911.4. On January 23, 2024, the City properly notified Plaintiff of the  untimeliness of her claim and provided clear instructions on how to potentially  cure the issue by applying for leave to file a late claim. Despite this notice,  Plaintiff failed to take the necessary steps to remedy her late filing. Although Plaintiff argues that the  City waived its ability to challenge the timeliness of her claim due to its  investigation and formal denial, this does not overcome the jurisdictional bar  created by her untimely submission. The City’s denial of the claim was based on  both the jurisdictional issue and the untimeliness of the claim, as reflected  in the record (Exh. F and Exh. B). Plaintiff cannot disregard the notice of  untimeliness and fail to take corrective action. Her failure to seek relief  under Government Code section 946.6 further bars her cause of action. As such,  the Court finds that Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the time requirements  for presenting her claim under Government Code section 911.2(a) bars her cause  of action. Government Code section 911.4  requires that any application to present a late claim be filed within a  reasonable time, but no later than one year after the accrual of the cause of  action. The application must state the reason for the delay and include the  proposed claim. Since the June 15, 2024 deadline for filing an application to  present a late claim has passed, the Court cannot grant Plaintiff leave to  amend the complaint to seek such relief. The statutory period has lapsed, and  therefore, Plaintiff cannot cure the defect in her claim. Accordingly, Defendant is entitled  to judgment on the pleadings on this issue.
