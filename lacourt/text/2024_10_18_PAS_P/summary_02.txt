And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Citibank's motion to stay the proceedings. Citibank argued that Edith, a Nevada limited liability company, cannot maintain its cross-claims in California because it did not obtain a certificate of registration from the California Secretary of State before transacting intrastate business in the state. However, the judge found that Edith's claims do not fall within the narrow exception to the registration requirement and that Edith may proceed with its cross-complaint. The judge also noted that Edith's business activities in California were limited to a single transaction in 2020 and that Edith is no longer in business. Therefore, the judge denied Citibank's motion to stay the proceedings.
