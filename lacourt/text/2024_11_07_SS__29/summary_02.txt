And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion to consolidate three separate cases (Case No. 22STCV28547, Case No. 22STCV29023, and Case No. 23STLC05506) for all purposes. The motion was filed by Progressive Express Insurance Company and the Estate of Wade Hampton Link IV, seeking to combine the cases into a single proceeding. The judge found that while there are some overlapping factual issues among the three actions, the benefits of consolidation for all purposes are outweighed by the risk of unnecessary cost, delay, prejudice, and potential confusion of issues for the jury. The judge concluded that the cases should be tried separately, as the liability issues may not be the focus of the trial, and the jury may need to evaluate the evidence relating to causation and damages separately for each plaintiff.
