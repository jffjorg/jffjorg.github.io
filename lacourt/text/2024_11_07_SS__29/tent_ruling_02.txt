 Case Number:  22STCV28547    Hearing Date:   November 7, 2024    Dept:  29 Laurie v. Estate of Wade Hampton Link IV
22STCV28547
Motion to Consolidate
 
Tentative
 
The motion is denied.
 
Background
 
Moving parties seek to consolidate three cases pending in
Los Angeles County Superior Court.  All of the cases, the moving
parties assert, arise out of the same series of accidents on or near Ventura
Boulevard in Los Angeles, California.
 
In this case, the first filed action (Case No.
22STCV28547), Plaintiff John D. Laurie (“Laurie”) filed a complaint on August
31, 2022, asserting causes of action for negligence against Defendants Estate
of Wade Hampton Link IV (the “Estate”), Link Engineering Incorporated (“LEI”),
and Does 1 through 20 (the “Laurie Action”). 
Laurie alleges that the accident occurred on September 8, 2020, on
Ventura Boulevard near Vanalden Avenue in Tarzana.
 
On July 10, 2024, the Estate filed its answer.
 
On filing, the Laurie Action was assigned to Department
29 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
 
In the second filed action (Case No. 22STCV29023),
Plaintiff Elahe Mokhtarzadeh (“Mokhtarzadeh”) filed a complaint on September 6,
2022, against Wade Hampton Link (“Link”), LEI, and Does 1 through 50 (the
“Mokhtarzadeh Action”).  Mokhtarzadeh
alleges that the accident occurred on September 9, 2020, at or near the
intersection of Ventura Boulevard and Sylvia Avenue in Tarzana.
 
On February 14, 2023, LEI filed its answer.
 
November 20, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to
name the Estate as Doe 1.
 
On April 25, 2024, Progressive Express Insurance Company
(“Progressive”) filed an answer in intervention.
 
On filing, the Mokhtarzadeh Action was assigned to
Department 29 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 

 
In the third filed action (Case No. 23STLC05506), Geico
General Insurance Company (“GEICO”) filed a complaint on August 28, 2023,
against LEI and Does 1 through V (the “GEICO Action”).  GEICO alleges that the accident involving its
insured (Annie Theresa Busche) occurred on September 8, 2020, at or near the
intersection of Ventura Boulevard and Sylvia Avenue in Tarzana.
 
On filing, the GEICO Action was assigned to Department 26
of the Spring Street Courthouse.  On
September 16, 2024, the Court made a finding that the GEICO Action and the Laurie
Action are related and transferred the GEICO Action to Department 29 of the
Spring Street Courthouse.
 
On October 16, 2024, the Court granted the motion of Progressive
Express Insurance Company (“Progressive”) to intervene.  On October 22, 2024, Progressive filed its
answer in intervention.
 
On September 3, 2024, Progressive and the Estate filed a motion
to consolidate the Laurie Action, the Mokhtarzadeh Action, and the GEICO Action
for all purposes.  Plaintiff Laurie filed
an opposition on September 17, 2024.  The
Court denied the motion, without prejudice, and without addressing the merits
of the motion, on procedural grounds.
 
On October 7, 2024, Progressive and the Estate filed a
new motion to consolidate the Laurie Action, the Mokhtarzadeh Action, and the
GEICO Action for all purposes.  Notice of
the motion was filed in all three cases. 
Plaintiff Lauire filed an opposition on October 22, and Progressive and
the Estate filed a reply on October 31.
 
Legal Standard
 
“When actions involving a common question of law or fact
are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or
all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions
consolidated and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may
tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048,
subd.  (a).)
 
“The purpose of consolidation is to enhance trial court
efficiency by avoiding unnecessary duplication of evidence and the danger of
inconsistent adjudications.  (See Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon Shield
Claimants Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978-979.)
 
There are two types of consolidation: a complete
consolidation for all purposes, and a more limited consolidation for trial or
certain other specific purposes (such as pre-trial discovery).  (Hamilton
v. Asbestos Corp., Ltd. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147; Sanchez
v. Super. Ct. (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1391, 1396; see also 3 Weil &
Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (2024), ¶¶
12:340-341.3.)  When cases are consolidated for all purposes, “the
two actions are merged into a single proceeding under one case number and
result in only one verdict or set of findings and one judgment.”  (Hamilton,
supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1147; see also Sanchez, supra, 203
Cal.App.3d at p. 1396.)  In a consolidation for limited purposes,
“the two actions remain otherwise separate.”  (Hamilton,
supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1147; see also Sanchez, supra, 203
Cal.App.3d at p. 1396.) 
 
“Consolidation under Code of Civil Procedure section 1048
is permissive, and it is for the trial court to determine whether the
consolidation is for all purposes or for trial only.” (Hamilton,
supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1149.)
 
The trial court should not consolidate actions where
prejudice would result to any party.  (See State Farm Mutual
Auto. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1956) 47 Cal.2d 428, 430.)
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.350, establishes a
number of procedural requirements for a motion to consolidate:
 
“(a) Requirements of motion
 
(1)  A notice of motion to consolidate must:
 
(A)  List all named parties in each case, the
names of those who have appeared, and the names of their respective attorneys
of record;
(B)  Contain the captions of all the cases
sought to be consolidated, with the lowest numbered case shown first; and
(C)  Be filed in each case sought to be
consolidated. 
 
(2)  The motion to consolidate:
 
(A)  Is deemed a single motion for the purpose
of determining the appropriate filing fee, but memorandums, declarations, and
other supporting papers must be filed only in the lowest numbered case;
(B)  Must be served on all attorneys of record
and all nonrepresented parties in all of the cases sought to be consolidated;
and
(C)  Must have a proof of service filed as part
of the motion.”
 
Discussion
 
Progressive and the Estate seeks an order consolidating
for all purposes the Laurie Action, the Mokhtarzadeh Action, and the GEICO
Action.  Plaintiff Laurie opposes the motion.
 
The
Court finds that all procedural requirements of the motion are satisfied.
 
Turning to the substance
of the motion, Progressive and the Estate contend that the vehicle owned by
Link Engineering was involved in several collisions on September 8, 2020, and
that consolidating the matters will promote judicial efficiency, as parties and
witnesses will need to be deposed only once instead of multiple times, and a
single trial will be less costly, they argue, than three separate trials. 
 
These three related
cases involve three separate accidents, apparently on the same day, at three
close but separate locations.  This is not
a chain reaction accident situation but rather three separate accidents.  One vehicle, driven by Link and owned by LEI,
was involved in all three accidents.  The
plaintiffs in the Laurie Action and in the Mokhtarzadeh
Action, and the insured in the GEICO Action, are all different.
 
There
are certainly some overlapping factual issues among the three actions, as
moving parties argue, such as whether Link was under the influence or
experiencing a medical emergency.  Consolidation would, at least to some degree, promote
efficiency and streamline the proceedings.
Given the
underlying facts, however, there appears to be at least a substantial
likelihood that the liability issues will not be focus of trial.  Rather, trial may well focus on issues of
causation and damages, which are not common as among the plaintiffs.  Most of the time at trial may well be spent
on the testimony of treating medical providers and expert witnesses relating to
causation and damages, and the jury must evaluate the evidence relating to these
issues separately for each plaintiff, whether at one trial, two trials, or
three.  Requiring all of the plaintiffs
to attend a lengthy trial (and potentially depositions) involving multiple
issues in which they have no interest would not promote efficiency or
streamline the litigation process.
Considering all of
the evidence and argument from the parties, the Court concludes that the
benefits of consolidation for all purposes are outweighed by the risk of
unnecessary cost, delay, prejudice, and potential confusion of issues for the
jury.  (See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.
v. Superior Court (1956) 47 Cal.2d 428, 430-431.)  Accordingly, the motion to consolidate these
matters for all purposes is denied.
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES the motion to
consolidate Case No. 22STCV28547,
Case No. 22STCV29023, and Case No. 23STLC05506.
 
Moving Party to give notice.
