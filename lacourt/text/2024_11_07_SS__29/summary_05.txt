```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to strike the amendment to the cross-complaint. The amendment added the United States Postal Service as a defendant, and the plaintiff argues that the defendants knew of the USPS's involvement at the time of filing the cross-complaint, which makes the amendment improper under California Code of Civil Procedure section 474. The judge finds that the defendants did not have actual knowledge of the USPS's involvement at the time of filing the cross-complaint, and therefore, the amendment is not improper. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has no standing to assert a statute of limitations defense on behalf of the USPS, and therefore, the motion to strike is denied.
