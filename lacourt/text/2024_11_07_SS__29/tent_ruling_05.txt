23STCV13237
Plaintiff’s Motion to Strike Amendment to Cross-Complaint
Tentative
The motion to strike is DENIED.
Background
On June 9, 2023, Yolanda Blackwell (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against 3751 Wesix QOZ, LP; 3751 Wesix QOZ, LLC (collectively “Defendants”);
and Does 1 through 100, asserting  a cause
of action for premises liability arising out of an alleged trip and fall on
June 18, 2021, on premises located at 3751 West Sixth Street in Los Angeles.
(Complaint, ¶¶ 7-11.)
 
On September 6, 2023, Defendants filed an answer to the
complaint.  On the same day, they filed a
cross-complaint for indemnity, apportionment of fault, and declaratory relief against
Roes 1 through 50.  
 
On October 10, 2024, Defendants amended the
cross-complaint to name United States Postal Service as Roe 1.
 
On October 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to
strike the amendment to Defendants’ cross-complaint. Defendants filed an
opposition on October 25. No reply has been filed.
 
Trial is scheduled for June 11, 2025.
 
Legal
Standard
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 435, “Any party, within the
time allowed to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to
strike the whole or any part thereof.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 435, subd. (b)(1).)
Code of Civil Procedure section 436 provides as follows:
“The court may, upon a motion
made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms
it deems proper:
(a) Strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.
(b) Strike out all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state, a court rule, or an order of the court.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 436.)  In ruling on a motion to
strike, the court must assume the truth of the properly pleaded facts in the
complaint or other pleading. (Turman v. Turning Point of Central California,
Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)
“Before filing a motion to strike pursuant to this
chapter, the moving party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with
the party who filed the pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for
the purpose of determining if an agreement can be reached that resolves the
objections to be raised in the motion to strike.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 435.5, subd. (a).)
Code of Civil Procedure section 474 provides, in relevant
part: 
“When
the plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defendant, he must state that fact
in the complaint …, and such defendant may be designated in any pleading or
proceeding by any name, and when his true name is discovered, the pleading or
proceeding must be amended accordingly .…” 
In general, an amendment to a pleading to provide the true
name of a Doe defendant relates back to the date the pleading was filed; this
allows a plaintiff, effectively, to extend or enlarge the statute of
limitations period. (Bernson v. Browning-Ferris Industries (1994) 7
Cal.4th 926, 932.) 
For a Doe amendment to relate back to the date of filing of
the original complaint, however, Plaintiff must have been genuinely ignorant of
the defendant’s identity at the time the original complaint was filed. (Woo
v. Super. Ct. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 169, 177.) 
As the Court of Appeal has explained, in determining whether a
plaintiff is “ignorant of the name of a defendant” under section 474: 
“The
test is whether, at the time the complaint was filed, the plaintiff was
ignorant of the facts giving [her] a cause of against the person. The focus is
on the fact that the plaintiff knew, not on whether the plaintiff subjectively
knew she had a cause of action based on those facts. While the plaintiff’s
ignorance must be genuine, and the plaintiff cannot claim ignorance simply
because she did not know all the details of the person’s involvement, the
plaintiff is not barred from invoking section 474 merely because she suspected
the person of wrongdoing based on an incomplete set of facts.” 
(Hahn v. New York Air Brake LLC (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th
895, 899-900 [citations omitted]; see also, e.g., McClatchy v. Coblentz,
Patch, Duffy & Bass, LLP (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 368, 374 [plaintiff
must have “knowledge of sufficient facts to cause a reasonable person to
believe liability is probable”]; General Motors Corp. v. Super. Ct.
(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 580, 585 [plaintiff may rely on section 474 even if he
has a “suspicion of wrongdoing” by defendant].) 
The test is actual ignorance. For purposes of section 474, a
plaintiff has no “duty to exercise reasonable diligence to obtain facts she
‘should have known.’” (Hahn, supra, 77 Cal.App.5th at p. 900; accord
General Motors, 48 Cal.App.4th at pp. 594-596.) 
Section 474 is to be “liberally construed” in favor of the
pleader. (General Motors, 48 Cal.App.4th at p. 593 [collecting cases].)
Request
for Judicial Notice
Plaintiff
requests that the Court take judicial notice of the complaint in this
action.  Although the request is almost
certainly unnecessary, it is granted.
Discussion
As a preliminary matter, the Court finds that
the meet and confer requirement is met. 
(Light Decl., ¶ 6.)
Plaintiff contends that Defendants’ amendment
to cross-complaint adding the United States Postal Service (“USPS”) is improper
under Code of Civil Procedure section 474 because Defendants knew of USPS at
the time of filing their cross-complaint. 
Assuming that is true (and it should be noted
that Defendants argue that they did not know of the culpability of USPS when
they filed the cross-complaint), the result is that the Court would not apply
the relation back rule to the Roe amendment. 
And so USPS could argue that the statutes of limitations for Defendants’
causes of action in the cross-complaint against USPS were not tolled by the
filing of the cross-complaint.
But USPS has not appeared, and it is unclear whether
USPS has even been served.  If and when
USPS appears, it may assert whatever defenses it has, including (if applicable)
a statute of limitations defense.  
Plaintiff, however, has no standing to assert
this statute of limitations defense on behalf of USPS.  Indeed, Plaintiff has no interest in any
allocation of responsibility as between USPS and Defendants. 
For that reason, as well as that the Court
concludes that Plaintiff has not shown that Defendants had actual knowledge
of sufficient facts to cause a reasonable person to believe that the liability of
USPS was probable (as opposed to a mere suspicion), the motion is denied.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion to strike.
Moving Party is
to give notice.
