And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of McDonnell v. Shah, granting the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiff to respond to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production. The plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests, and the defendant did not need to show anything more to support the motions. The judge also denied the defendant's requests for sanctions, as the plaintiff had not opposed the motions and the court did not find that the plaintiff acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances made the imposition of sanctions unjust. The court orders the plaintiff to provide written, verified, code-compliant responses to the discovery requests within 15 days of notice.
