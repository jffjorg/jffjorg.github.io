And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion filed by Defendant Li for determination of good faith settlement and has concluded that the settlement between Plaintiff Keniatta Thompson and Defendant Li was made in good faith. The court has considered the various factors set forth in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates, including the rough approximation of Plaintiff's total recovery, the settling defendant's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, and the allocation of the settlement proceeds among plaintiffs. The court has also taken into account the fact that a settling defendant should pay less in settlement than he would if found liable after trial.

The court has determined that the settlement amount of $50,000 is "in the ballpark" given Defendant Li's proportionate share of the liability, after discounting for Defendant Li's defenses as to liability, causation, and damages. The court has therefore granted Defendant Li's motion for determination of good faith settlement and has ordered that Defendant Li's cross-complaint be dismissed as against Defendant Reyes.
