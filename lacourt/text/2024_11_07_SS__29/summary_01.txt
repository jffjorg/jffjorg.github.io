The court finds that all legal requirements are met and that the proposed settlement and fees are fair and reasonable. As a result, the petition is approved. The court also sets a hearing to ensure that the funds from the settlement are deposited into a blocked account. The moving party is ordered to provide notice of this hearing. The court allows counsel to appear by phone or video conference instead of in person, and excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem.
