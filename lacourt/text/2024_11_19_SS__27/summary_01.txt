Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion to strike the allegations for punitive damages brought by the plaintiff, Benjamin Leiser, against the defendant, Shelter Clean Services. The plaintiff alleges that Shelter Clean had actual notice of the dangerous condition on the bike path, which caused Leiser's injury, and failed to repair the concrete despite knowledge of the defect. The judge finds that the allegations meet the standard required to support a claim for punitive damages, as they suggest that Shelter Clean's conduct demonstrates a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others. The judge also rejects the defendant's arguments that the plaintiff failed to allege corporate ratification and that the prior lawsuit, Joshua Marx v. City of Los Angeles, et al., is irrelevant to the case. The judge concludes that the motion is denied and sets a hearing date for November 19, 2024.
