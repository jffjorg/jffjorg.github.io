And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is issued by a Judge in the case of Dipu Haque, et al. v. Michael Ball, et al. The case involves an in pro per defendant, Michael Ball, who allegedly breached contracts with Plaintiffs by refusing to grant them access to financial records. The Plaintiffs have invested $20 million in businesses established by the Defendant. The Court has previously granted Plaintiffs' Motion for leave to file their Second Amended Complaint, which alleges various causes of action, including breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud.

The Plaintiffs now file a Motion to Continue Trial to complete discovery and harmonize the scheduling with a related case. The Court agrees that good cause exists for continuing the trial date, as the Plaintiffs have shown that they will not have sufficient time to respond to the Second Amended Complaint and complete discovery prior to the final status conference and trial. The Court grants the Motion to Continue Trial and sets the trial date for May 28, 2024, with the final status conference to be held on May 18, 2024.
