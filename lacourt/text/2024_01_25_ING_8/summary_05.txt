And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, 16539 South Main Street, LLC. The demurrer argues that the plaintiff's complaint does not state facts sufficient to allege the causes of action against the defendant and is uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible. The judge has sustained the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend.

The judge notes that the pleadings are unclear as to the nature of the relationship between the defendant and the other parties, and that the plaintiff is required to include allegations of heightened foreseeability if it alleges that the defendant was the owner of the subject premises.

The judge also notes that the plaintiff's complaint does not adequately allege the defendant's duty to protect its employees and guests, and that the defendant's demurrer is sustained as to the negligence and premises liability causes of action.

The judge grants the defendant 20 days to amend its demurrer and orders the defendant to give notice of the court's ruling.
