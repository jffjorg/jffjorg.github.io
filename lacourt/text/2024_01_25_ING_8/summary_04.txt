And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in a case where Enchant Christmas, LLC (the defendant) filed a motion to compel arbitration with Svetlana Sanfilippo (the plaintiff). The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant alleging various employment-related claims, including disability discrimination, sex discrimination, and wrongful termination. The defendant argues that the plaintiff signed an employment agreement that includes an arbitration clause, which requires disputes to be resolved through arbitration rather than litigation.

The judge notes that the arbitration clause states that the law of Delaware will apply, but neither side provided any Delaware law citations in their briefs. The judge is inclined to continue the hearing and allow the parties to address this issue before ruling on the motion to compel arbitration.

The plaintiff argues that the arbitration agreement is invalid because it is procedurally and substantively unconscionable. The judge finds that this issue may raise questions about fraud in the inception and is inclined to continue the hearing to allow the parties to address these issues.

The judge is also seeking supplemental briefing on the law of Delaware regarding unconscionability and whether Delaware law recognizes both procedural and substantive unconscionability as a defense to a petition to compel arbitration.
