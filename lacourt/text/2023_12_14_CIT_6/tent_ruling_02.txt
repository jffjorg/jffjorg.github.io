   [1] The Court  notes that Lincoln brought this motion under both the statutory grounds and  common law grounds for a motion for judgment on the pleadings. While there are  differences between those types of motions they have no effect here, and thus  the Court declines to address any such issues.   [2] The Court also  agrees that the Complaint fails to contain any indication or statements that  the attorneys are authorized by the City Attorney to bring this suit on behalf  of the City of El Monte.    [3] The Court  further notes that the statute provides for the available remedies and  Plaintiff should only seek those remedies allowed by statute if leave to amend  is granted.
