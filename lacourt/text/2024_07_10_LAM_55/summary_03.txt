And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has reviewed the evidence presented by both parties and has determined that the Defendant's motion to strike the Plaintiff's complaint for defamation is denied. The Judge found that the Defendant failed to meet the burden of proof required under the anti-SLAPP statute, and that the Plaintiff has shown a probability of prevailing on the merits of the claim.

The Judge ruled that the Defendant's certified translated transcript of the video does not show that the alleged statements were made, and that the Plaintiff's declaration stating that he personally observed the alleged statements is sufficient to meet the burden of proof.

The Judge also ruled that the Defendant's argument that the statements were truthful opinions is not supported by the evidence, and that the Plaintiff has shown that the statements are actionable because they imply a provably false assertion of fact.

Finally, the Judge ruled that the Plaintiff has shown a probability of prevailing on the merits of the claim, and that the Defendant's motion to strike the complaint is denied.
