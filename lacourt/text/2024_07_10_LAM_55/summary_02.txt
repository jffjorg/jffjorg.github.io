And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is on the demurrer of Doe 1 Defendant Petite Chateau, Inc. to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiffs Francisa Rivera and Donald Paz. The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants, including Petite Chateau, Inc., failed to remediate uninhabitable conditions in their rental unit. The Defendant, a homeowner association, contends that the FAC fails to state facts to constitute a cause of action against it because it is not a landlord or lessor of the Plaintiffs' unit. The Judge agrees with the Defendant and sustains the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend. The Judge also grants the Defendant's request for judicial notice of its Articles of Incorporation and recorded Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC&Rs).
