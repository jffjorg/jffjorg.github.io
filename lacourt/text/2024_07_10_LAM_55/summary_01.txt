And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the demurrer of the defendants (SIOF 1 PROPERTIES, LLC, MARTIN MUOTO, ARI HORN, and GRAY LUSK) to the Second Amended Complaint. The demurrer was filed in response to the allegations of breach of contract, violation of California's Unfair Competition Law, breach of fiduciary duty, and other claims made by the plaintiffs (PHOOD FARMACY 2 LLC, ROBERT ANCILL, THELMA ANCILL, and THE NEXT IDEA CONSULTING, LLC).

The judge finds that the Second Amended Complaint adequately alleges the defendants' intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, and therefore overrules the demurrer as to these claims. The judge also finds that the complaint sufficiently alleges the defendants' oral promise to allow the plaintiffs to share commercial real estate space, and that the defendants' disruption of this relationship caused at least a partial loss of benefits to the plaintiffs.

The judge notes that the complaint must be repleaded to adequately allege the misrepresentation claim, as it lacks particular descriptions of misrepresentations and financial statements allegedly made by the defendants. However, the judge overrules the demurrer as to this claim, finding that the allegations of misrepresentation are sufficient to survive a demurrer.

The judge orders the defendants to answer the complaint within 20 days.
