 Case Number:  23STCV02147    Hearing Date:   July 10, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Demurrer of DOE 1 Defendant Petite Chateau, Inc. to First Amended Complaint.
BACKGROUND
FRANCISA RIVERA and DONALD PAZ (“Plaintiffs”) filed a First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against ALMA AGUILAR, an individual and trustee and
DOEs (Defendants), alleging that, as owner and lessor, and unknown DOEs, Defendants
failed to remediate uninhabitable conditions involving roof leaks, mold, and
cockroach infestation. Plaintiffs’ causes of action are (1) Breach of Implied
Warranty of Habitability, (2) Negligence, (3) Breach of Implied Covenant of
Quiet Use and Enjoyment, (4) Nuisance, (5) Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress, and (6) Violation of Business & Professions Code, Section 17200. 
On 1/26/24, Plaintiffs filed an amendment substituting
PETITE CHATEAU, INC. for Doe 1 (“Defendant”). Defendant has filed a demurrer to
the FAC. Plaintiffs oppose the demurrer. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Demurrers are to be sustained where a pleading fails
to plead adequately any essential element of the cause of action. Cantu v.
Resolution Trust Corp. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 879-880. Because a
demurrer challenges defects on the face of the complaint, it can only refer to
matters outside the pleading that are subject to judicial notice.” Arce ex
rel. Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471,
556. Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of
successfully stating a cause of action. Schulz v. Neovi Data Corp.
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 86, 92.
JUDICIAL NOTICE
The Court grants Defendant’s Request for Judicial
Notice of its Articles of Incorporation and recorded Covenants, Conditions and
Restrictions (CC&Rs).
ANALYSIS
Defendant, a homeowner association, contends that the
FAC fails to state facts to constitute a cause of action against it because it
is not a landlord or lessor of Plaintiffs’ unit. The Court agrees. 
Homeowner associations’ activities only relate to matters
of damage to common areas or to separate interests that arise out of damage to
the common area. E.g., Glen Oaks Ests. Homeowners Assn. v. Re/Max Premier
Properties, Inc. (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 913, 919–920. 
Further, there must be privity of contract with the
lessor in order for a tenant to sue a defendant for breach of the implied
covenant of quiet enjoyment. Marchese v. Standard Realty & Dev. Co.
(1977) 74 Cal. App. 3d 142, 147–148.
Here, the FAC contains no allegation that Defendant
maintained any common area, but instead it repeatedly references the “Rental
Unit” (e.g., FAC, ¶ 10). Also, Plaintiffs unsupportively allege that the nature
of DOE 1’s responsibility is unknown (FAC, ¶ 5). These allegations are not
sufficient to attach liability against Defendant for any of the causes of
action in the FAC.
Plaintiffs’ opposition indicates a desire to assert allegations
that Defendant maintained common areas causing damages. The Court therefore will
allow leave to amend.
CONCLUSION
The Court sustains the demurrer with 20 days’ leave to
amend.
