And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed by the plaintiff, Junkers2Jewels LLC and Matthew Pelanne. The defendants, La-Doris McClaney, Gregory Bass, and Patricia Grandison, demurred to the complaint alleging that the plaintiffs do not have standing to sue and that the complaint does not state a cause of action.

The judge finds that the defendants' demurrers are sustained with leave to amend. The judge notes that the plaintiffs have not adequately alleged facts showing an injury to themselves rather than to the buyer, FWA Properties, Inc., which is not a party to the action. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs' assertion that they are entitled to bring the claims as intended third-party beneficiaries is unsupported by the pleadings.

The judge permits the plaintiffs to amend the pleadings to properly plead those theories. The judge also denies the defendants' motions to strike as moot since the demurrers have been sustained.

Finally, the judge sets a hearing on an Order to Show Cause Re: Why Attorney Phoenix Thottam, Counsel for Plaintiffs, should not be sanctioned and referred to the State Bar of California for disciplinary action for providing false citations to legal authority to the court.
