And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling continuing the hearing on the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by defendants K&K Realty Group, Inc. and Kelvin Cornish. The Court has determined that the declaration of Plaintiff's counsel, Kent Sharp, provides a sufficient basis for the continuance, which is allowed under Code of Civil Procedure Section 437c(h). The Court had previously denied an ex parte application to continue the hearing, but that denial was without prejudice to the Plaintiff renewing the request. As a result, the trial in the case will also be continued, with a possible new date of February 24, 2025. The Court will discuss new dates for the hearing and trial with the parties, and will also consider the impact on the Plaintiff's ex parte applications to advance the hearing dates on their motions to compel discovery.
