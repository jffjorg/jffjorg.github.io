 Case Number:  24STCV08362    Hearing Date:   November 5, 2024    Dept:  57 Defendant's demurrer to the cause of action for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability in Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint ("FAC") is sustained without leave to amend on statute of limitations grounds.  The Court discerns no changes in the FAC that would compel the Court to conclude that, unlike the initial complaint, the FAC avoids the statute of limitations on that claim.Defendant's demurrer to the cause of action for fraud in the FAC is sustained with leave to amend on statute of limitations grounds. The lone change in the FAC from the initial complaint is that the FAC alleges that the statute of limitations on the fraud claim was tolled under the class action tolling doctrine established in American Pipe & Construction v. Utah (1974) 414 U.S. 538, by dint of a federal class action case,  O'Connor v. Ford Motor Co., which Plaintiffs alleged was filed on July 26, 2019.  The class action tolling doctrine provides that an individual claim of a member of a class action is tolled from the date the class action was filed until the date certification of the class was denied. Plaintiffs fail to allege that they were members of the class in the O'Connor case.  They also fail to allege if and when class certification was denied in O'Connor.   The allegations in the FAC thus are insufficient to bring the Plaintiffs' fraud claim within the ambit of the class action tolling doctrine.  Because it is reasonably possible that the Plaintiffs can amend their complaint so as to avoid that pleading defect, the Court is giving Plaintiffs leave to amend.   Plaintiffs must serve and file their Second Amended Complaint by November 26, 2024.
