And here is the English-text summary:

The judge issues a tentative ruling on a future court hearing. The defendant has filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's claims for breach of implied warranty of merchantability and fraud. The judge sustains the demurrer to the breach of implied warranty of merchantability claim without leave to amend, finding that the plaintiff's first amended complaint does not avoid the statute of limitations on that claim. The judge sustains the demurrer to the fraud claim with leave to amend, finding that the plaintiff's allegations regarding the class action tolling doctrine are insufficient. The plaintiff must file a second amended complaint by November 26, 2024, to avoid the pleading defect.
