 Case Number:  21STCV47364    Hearing Date:   November 5, 2024    Dept:  57 Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 437c(h), the Court is continuing the hearing on the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by Defendants K&K Realty Group, Inc. and Kelvin Cornish.  In the Court's view, the declaration of Plaintiff's counsel Kent Sharp provides a sufficient basis for the Court to grant a Section 437c(h) continuance of the hearing on the motion.  The Court recognizes that, on October 17, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiff's ex parte application to continue the hearing.  The ex parte application was not made pursuant to Section 437c(h).  The Court's denial of the ex parte application was without prejudice to the Plaintiff renewing the request for a  continuance, albeit under Section 437c(h) and in connection with the Plaintiff's opposition to the motion or summary judgment or summary adjudicationThe Court's decision to continue the hearing on the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by Defendants K&K Realty Group, Inc. and Kelvin Cornish means that the trial in this case will have to be continued as well.   The Court has reached that conclusion reluctantly.  The Court has identified February 24, 2025 as a possible new date for the trial.At the hearing today, the Court will discuss with the parties a new date for the hearing on the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication and what the new dates for the trial and the hearing on the motion  mean for Plaintiff's ex parte applications on calendar today to advance the hearing dates on the Plaintiff's motions to compel the deposition of Defendant Kevin Wheaton and to compel K&K Realty Group, Inc. and Kelvin Cornish to provide further responses to Plaintiff's requests for production of documents.
