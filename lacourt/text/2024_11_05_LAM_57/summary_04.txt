And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff's claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and recovery of the reasonable value of services are all based on the assumption that there was a written contract between the plaintiff and the defendants. However, the complaint fails to allege this written contract, and the retainer agreement attached to the complaint is between the plaintiff and third parties, not the defendants. The plaintiff's claim for breach of contract is also based on an oral agreement, which is voidable and time-barred under Business and Professions Code Section 6148.

The judge has sustained the defendants' demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of contract and to the third cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, with leave to amend. The judge has also sustained the defendants' demurrer to the second cause of action for recovery of the reasonable value of services, as this claim is time-barred under the statute of limitations.

The judge has also sustained the defendants' motion to strike the prayer for relief in the complaint for punitive damages, as punitive damages are not available on contract claims.

The plaintiff is directed to file and serve a Second Amended Complaint by November 26, 2024.
