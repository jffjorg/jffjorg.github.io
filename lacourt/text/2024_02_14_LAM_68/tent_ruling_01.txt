ATTORNEY: Damian Moos
CLIENT:
 Defendant, Solgen Construction, LLC
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel
of Record
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
Plaintiff Rex Wise alleges defendants Solgen Construction,
LLC, Sunlight Financial, LLC and Cross River Bank, denies ever executing a
30-year loan agreement for the financing of solar panels to Plaintiff’s
residence. Plaintiff sought to cancel the contracts, but defendants refused. 
 
Plaintiff alleges a Public Injunction enjoining Solgen
Construction, LLC from engaging in solar panel installations without adhering
to certain standards, due to prior fraudulent activities.
 
On August 1 and 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint and
first amended complaint for Fraudulent Concealment; Negligence; Violations of
The Elder Abuse And Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act (Welfare &
Institutions Code §15610.07, Et Seq.); Violations Of The Rosenthal Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act (Civil Code §1788, Et Seq.); Violations Of The Home
Solicitation Sales Act (Civil Code §1689.5, Et Seq.); Violations Of Business
And Professions Code §7150, et seq.; Violations Of The Truth In Lending Act (15
U.S.C. § 1601, Et Seq.); Violations Of The Credit Services Act (Civil Code
§1789.10, Et Seq.); and, Violations Of The Unfair Competition Law (Business
& Professions Code §17200, et seq.)
 
On November 1, 2023, Sunlight Financial LLC filed a notice
of stay of proceedings based on the filing of a Chapter 11 Bankruptcy petition
on October 31, 2023. On November 2, 2023, the court stayed the entire case.
 
RULING: Granted.
Counsel for defendant Solgen
Construction, LLC moves to be relieved as counsel of record, due to
unspecified “professional considerations.” “The determination whether to grant
or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the
trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66
Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.) The court accepts the necessity of client
confidentiality, and will meet counsel in chambers, if requested. (Bus. &
Prof. Code, § 6068, subd. (e); Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court, supra,
66 Cal.App.4th at p. 1133; Aceves v. Superior Court (1996) 51
Cal.App.4th 584, 590- 593.)
 
The motion otherwise complies with all procedural
requirements. The motion is therefore granted. The corporate entity cannot
appear in the action without representation from an admitted attorney. (Merco Constr. Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal
Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724, 731.)
 
Status Conference re: Bankruptcy Proceedings set for August
2, 2024.
 
Order not effective until service on the client. 
 
Moving
attorney to provide notice.
