The motion was filed due to "professional considerations" and the judge accepted the necessity of client confidentiality. The judge will meet with counsel in chambers if requested. The motion complies with all procedural requirements, and the corporate entity cannot appear in the action without representation from an admitted attorney. A status conference regarding bankruptcy proceedings has been set for August 2, 2024.
