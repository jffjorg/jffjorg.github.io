Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the case pending the conclusion of arbitration. The court finds that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable, despite the plaintiff's arguments that it is procedurally and substantively unconscionable. The court rules that the arbitration agreement is mutual and does not produce one-sided outcomes. The case is stayed pending the conclusion of arbitration, and the parties are ordered to file a joint status conference report before a post-arbitration status conference hearing.
