 Case Number:  24STCV04945    Hearing Date:   October 16, 2024    Dept:  57 Pending before the Court is the motion of Defendant Kris Kharmandalian to compel Plaintiff Kal Prop, LLC to provide further responses to the Defendant's Special Interrogatories, Set One ("SROGs").  Plaintiff provided only objections to the SROGs.  The Court is granting the motion as to SROG Numbers 1-35, but denying it as to SROG Numbers 36-66.  In granting the motion in part, the Court accepted the separate statement that Defendant submitted along with its motion even though the separate statement did not comply in  full with California Rule of Court 3.1345.Defendant violated Code of Civil Procedure Section 2030.030(a)(1) in propounding more than 35 SROGs without  an accompanying declaration attesting to the need for interrogatories in excess of that number.  This is known as "the Rule of 35."  (Catanese v. Superior Court (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1164-1165 ["Catanese"].)    Plaintiff properly objected to SROG Numbers 36-66 based on the Rule of 35.   Therefore, Plaintiff need not provide further responses to those SROGs.  In the Court's view, however, Plaintiff's objections to SROG Numbers 1-35 are not well-grounded and Plaintiff must provide further responses to them. First, contrary to what Plaintiff' asserts in its objections, SROG Numbers 1-35 are not vague, ambiguous or overbroad.  Nor do, as Plaintiff also asserts, SROG Numbers 1-35 violate the prohibition in  Section 2030.060(d) on interrogatories that include a "preface or instruction" not approved by the Judicial Council.  The definitions in the SROGs to which Plaintiff objects in this regard are permissible under Section 2030.060(e). Finally, SROG Numbers 1-35 do not violate the requirement in Section 2030.060(d) that an interrogatory be "full and complete."   This requirement is known as the "self-containment" rule, meaning that the information necessary for the responding party to formulate an answer to an interrogatory must be contained within the interrogatory itself such that there is no need for the responding party to "resort . . . to other materials in order to [answer]."  (Catanese, supra, 46 Cal.App.4th at p. 164.)  The Court of Appeal in Catanese applied the self-containment rule to interrogatories that incorporated questions and answers in multiple volumes of a deposition.  The Court of Appeal held that the incorporation of that material outside of the interrogatories violated the self-containment rule.  (Id. at pp, 164, 166).   Presumably here, Plaintiff invoked the self-containment rule in its objections because SROG Numbers 1-35 call on the Plaintiff to consult various contentions in its complaint in order to answer the interrogatories.  The Court is unaware of any precedent, however, supporting the application of the self-containment rule in this context.  The absence of such precedent makes sense  for two reasons. First, application of the self-containment rule to interrogatories that refer to contentions in a complaint would be at odds with Section 2030.010(b), which expressly authorizes contention interrogatories.  Second, the self-containment rule is intended to make it easy for the responding party to answer an interrogatory by limiting what the party has to look at in answering.  It is not difficult, however, for a responding party to look at its own complaint to answer an interrogatory. Even though the Court is granting the Defendant's motion in part, the Court is denying Defendant's request for an order imposing sanctions on the Plaintiff for asserting what Defendant says were meritless objections.  Defendant is itself at fault for violating the Rule of 35. Additionally, Defendant's attempt to meet and confer with the Plaintiff before filing the motion, as required by Sections 2016.040 and 2030.300(b)(1), came late and was half-hearted.
