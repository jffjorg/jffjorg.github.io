And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the declaratory relief claims of the parties, Steven Gordon and the Saul Brandman Foundation. The dispute centers on Gordon's authority to amend the Governing Agreements of the LLCs, which he formed with Saul Brandman. The Court finds that Gordon's authority is determined exclusively by Section 12.9 of the Governing Agreements, which requires any amendments to be in writing and approved by the Manager (Gordon) and non-Manager Members (the Foundation).

The Court also finds that the phrase "alter the distribution of . . . distributions . . ." in Section 12.9 is ambiguous, but the Foundation's interpretation that it means actions that affect both the manner and timing of distributions is the better one. Therefore, Gordon's amendments that affect the timing of distributions require the Foundation's consent.

The Court's ruling does not address the Foundation's claims against Gordon for breach of fiduciary duty, which are separate and distinct from the declaratory relief claims. The Court has also not opined on whether an amendment, either in theory or in practice, constitutes a breach of Gordon's fiduciary duty to the Foundation.
