I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Danny Bakewell, Sr.
(Bakewell) sued Defendants Kevin Cohee (Cohee), OneUnited
Bank (OneUnited) and Does 1 through 20 pursuant to an April 15, 2020, First
Amended Complaint alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract; (2)
Fraud and Deceit; (3) Declaratory Relief; (4) Unfair Competition; (5) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty; and (6) Fraudulent Sale of Securities. 
The claims arose from allegations
that in January 2000, Bakewell agreed to purchase preferred stock from
OneUnited in the amount of $250,000.00. (FAC ¶ 6.) Bakewell alleges that Cohee,
the CEO and Chairman of OneUnited, orally represented and personally guaranteed
that Bakewell could redeem the preferred stock shares at any time upon request
and receive $250,000.00 plus any accumulated dividends. (FAC ¶ 6.) Bakewell
states that he never received the preferred stock certificates. (FAC ¶ 7.) When
Bakewell tried to redeem his stock in 2019, Defendants denied the request and
contended that Bakewell had no right to redeem the preferred shares. (FAC ¶ 9.)
Bakewell subsequently filed this lawsuit. 
B. Relevant Procedural History
This action was tried in July 2024.
Only the causes of action for breach of contract, fraud (with jury instructions
as to false promise and intentional misrepresentation at trial), and breach of
fiduciary duty went to trial by jury. 
On July 19, 2024, the jury rendered
a verdict in favor of Bakewell on all causes of action. 
On August 8, 2024, the Court signed
and entered judgment and on August 13, 2024, the Clerk sent notice of entry of
judgment to the parties. 
C. Motion Before the Court
On October 8, 2024, Bakewell filed a
motion to amend judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 187 and
Code of Civil Procedure section 473 subdivisions (a) and (d). The Court specially
set it and ordered a briefing schedule, providing Defendants with statutory
time to oppose the motion.
On October 18, 2024, the Defendants
opposed the motion. 
On October 23, 2024, Bakewell filed
his reply.
 
II. Motion
A. Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 187
provides that: “When jurisdiction is, by the Constitution or this Code, or by
any other statute, conferred on a Court or judicial officer, all the means
necessary to carry it into effect are also given; and in the exercise of this
jurisdiction, if the course of proceeding be not specifically pointed out by
this Code or the statute, any suitable process or mode of proceeding may be
adopted which may appear most conformable to the spirit of this Code.” 
Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (a)(1) provides, in relevant part: “The court may, in
furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to
amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any
party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any
other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or
demurrer. The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the
adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any
pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an
answer to be made after the time limited by this code.” 
Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (d) provides that: “The court may, upon motion of the injured
party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders
as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on
motion of either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void
judgment or order.” 
B. Analysis
First, Bakewell argues that the
Court has the authority to amend the judgment to hold Cohee jointly and
severally liable for Bakewell’s damages award pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 187 (Code. Civ. Proc., § 187.) Bakewell argues that, in
holding OneUnited liable, the jury implicitly found that Cohee, acting within
the scope of his employment, caused the complained of harm to Bakewell. (Mot. p.
4:1-5.) Bakewell argues that the judgment should be amended “to maintain
consistency with the jury’s findings and the legal doctrine of respondeat
superior.” (Mot. p. 4:5-6.)
In support of his assertion that
the Court has the authority to do so, Bakewell cites two cases that suggest Code
of Civil Procedure section 187 authorizes courts to amend judgments to add an
alter ego of an original judgment debtor. (see Highland Springs
Conference & Training Genter v. City of Banning (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th
267; see also, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Weinberg (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th
1.) As noted by Defendants, these cases cited are distinguishable from the
circumstances here because Bakewell does not allege that Cohee is the alter ego
of OneUnited. 
It is true, as Bakewell argues on
reply, that the language of section 187 is not exclusive to alter ego cases,
and indeed, the statute has been invoked to allow the amendment of judgments in
cases involving successor corporations. (Reno-Tahoe Specialty, Inc. v.
Mungchi, Inc. (C.D. Cal. 2020) 468 F.Supp.3d 1236.) 
However, amending the judgment to add
Cohee as jointly and severally liable for the damages is not akin to adding an
alter ego or successor of an already liable defendant. The Court agrees with
Defendants that there is no basis to amend the judgment in this way. (Mac v.
Minassian (2022) 76 Cal.App.5th 510, 520-521.) To the extent Plaintiff
believed that the verdict form should have made clear that a finding of
liability for one defendant would have necessitated liability for the other, it
was necessary to make that argument – which could then have been opposed by
Defendant and resolved by the Court --  before the verdict and jury instructions were
submitted to the jury.
Thus, the Court does not have the
authority to amend the judgment as requested under Code of Civil Procedure
section 187. 
Next, Bakewell argues that the
Court should amend the judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473.
Bakewell asserts that the $956,058.00 should be modified from a “non-economic
damages” award to an “economic damages” award. (Mot. pp. 4-5.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 473 subdivision (d) grant Courts authority to correct
mistakes. (Code. Civ. Proc., § 473 subd.) 
Here, there is an indication that
the judge made a clerical error in signing a Judgment characterizing the
damages as it did. The verdict form signed by the Jury Foreperson indicated at
Question No. 6 that it was awarding $956,058.00 against “OneUnited Bank [in] Economic
Damages.” (Exhibit A to the Declaration of Rickey Ivie in support of Reply
Brief.) However, the Judgment provided to the Court, which the Court signed, indicated
at Question 6 that the damages were awarded against OneUnited Bank for
“Non-Economic” damages. (Exhibit B to the Declaration of Rickey Ivie in support
of Reply Brief.)
Accordingly, this does appear to be
a proper use of the Court’s authority under section 473 subdivision (d) to
correct a clerical mistake. 
Thus, the Court does not have the
authority to amend the judgment as requested under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473. 
Accordingly, the motion to amend
judgment is GRANTED to correct the clerical order that the $956,058.00 in
damages against OneUnited Bank are for Economic Damages, and the motion is
otherwise DENIED.   
 
III. Conclusion
Plaintiff Danny Bakewell Sr.’s
Motion to Amend Judgment is GRANTED to correct the clerical order that the
$956,058.00 in damages against OneUnited Bank are for Economic Damages, and the
motion is otherwise DENIED. Plaintiff is ordered to lodge an Amended Judgment within
three business days.Superior

  OneUnited Bank’s Motion to Tax Costs 



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Danny Bakewell, Sr.
(Bakewell) sued Defendants Kevin Cohee (Cohee), OneUnited Bank (OneUnited) and
Does 1 through 20 pursuant to an April 15, 2020, First Amended Complaint
alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Fraud and Deceit; (3)

Bakewell subsequently filed this lawsuit. 
B. Relevant Procedural History
This action was tried in July 2024.
Only the causes of action for breach of contract, fraud (with jury instructions

C. Motion Before the Court
On August 22, 2024, Bakewell filed and
served an Amended Memorandum of Costs seeking $90,505.05 in costs. 
On September 10, 2024, Defendant OneUnited
Bank filed the instant motion to tax costs. 
On October 2, 2024, Bakewell opposed
the motion.
On October 8, 2024, OneUnited
replied. 
The motion was continued to be
heard along with Bakewell’s motion to tax Defendants’ costs.
 
II. Motion
A. Legal Standard
¿Allowable costs under Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5 must be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, rather
than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation, and must be reasonable
in amount. An item not specifically allowable under Section 1033.5(a) nor
prohibited under subdivision (b) may nevertheless be recoverable in the
discretion of the court if they meet the above requirements (i.e., reasonably
necessary and reasonable in amount). If the items appearing in a cost bill appear
to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show
that they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v. California State
Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774 (Ladas).) 
Moreover, a verified memorandum of costs is prima facie
evidence that the costs, expenses, and services therein listed were necessarily
incurred. (Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256,
266.) A party seeking to tax costs must provide evidence to rebut this prima
facie showing. (Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1266 (Jones),
superseded by statute on other grounds in Code Civ. Proc., § 998, subd. (c)(1)
[whether costs permissible from filing of complaint or from date of 998
offer].) Mere statements unsupported by facts are insufficient to rebut the
prima facie showing that costs were necessarily incurred. (Jones, supra,
at p. 1266.)¿On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are
put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs. (Ibid.) 
Whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to the
litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and its decision is
reviewed for abuse of discretion. (Ladas, supra, 19 Cal.App.4th
at p. 774.) Because the right to costs is governed strictly by statute, a court
has no discretion to award costs not statutorily authorized. (Ibid.)
Discretion is abused only when, in its exercise, the court “exceeds the bounds
of reason, all of the circumstances being considered.” (Lincoln, supra,
39 Cal.App.4th at p. 105.)¿ 
B. Analysis
OneUnited moves to tax certain
costs items on the grounds that Bakewell seeks inflated deposition costs, and service
of process and court reporter fees, and seeks unauthorized parking charges and
expert witness fees. 
1.    
Item No. 4, Deposition Costs
OneUnited
challenges $31,804.83 of deposition costs as inflated. OneUnited argues
that the $5,241.62 for a one-day deposition for Cohee, $5,896.10 for a one-day
Zoom deposition for Cooper, and $3,390.10 for a partial day of deposition for
Maxine Waters are significantly higher than normal. (Mot. to Tax Costs, p.
4:12-13.)  One United also argues that
the $4,240.86 sought in non-appearance fees were not necessarily incurred because
Bakewell was given ample notice ahead of time that the deponents were not
appearing for the depositions. (Mot. to Tax Costs, p. 4:18-21; Fox Decl. ¶ 6.)  
In opposition, Bakewell asserts
that deposition costs are authorized under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1033.5 subdivisions (a)(3)(A) and (a)(3)(C). (Opp. p.
6:12-15.) However, he does not provide an explanation of the costs incurred, copies
of the invoices, or any other documentation. 

Here, OneUnited has failed to meet
its burden to challenge Bakewell’s deposition costs for Cohee, Cooper, and
Waters’s depositions because the depositions were necessarily incurred in order
to conduct discovery. Simply speculating that the costs are too high is insufficient.
However, OneUnited has met its burden to show that the non-appearance fees were
unnecessarily incurred because Bakewell had prior notice that the deponents
would not appear, giving him sufficient time to cancel the court reporting
services and avoid the fees.
The Court thus GRANTS OneUnited’s
motion as to taxing “deposition costs” in part, in the amount of $4,240.86. 
2.    
Item No. 5, Service of Process
OneUnited challenges service of
process costs of $2,886.95 as excessive because Bakewell lists six undated
attempts of service on both Sidney Williams and Maxine Waters that vary widely
in amount. (Mot. to Tax Costs, p. 5:6-14.) 

In opposition, Bakewell asserts
that he is entitled to the costs because several attempts were made to serve
the relevant parties. (Opp. p. 7:1-3.) 
Here, Civil Code Section 1033.5
subdivision (a)(4) clearly allows for the recovery of costs for service of
process. In the absence of contrary legal authority, OneUnited has failed to
meet its burden to challenge the costs. 
The Court thus DENIES OneUnited’s
motion as to taxing “service of process” costs. 

3.    
Item No. 6, Attachment Expenses
Next, OneUnited challenges $208 in
parking costs because parking is not a proper attachment expense. (Mot. to Tax Costs, p. 5:16-18.)  Bakewell argues in opposition that various
travel costs are allowable costs when reasonably necessary to attend a
deposition. (Opp., p. 6.)
Here, parking is not an “attachment
expense” within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5
subdivision (a)(5). Nor has Bakewell provided any specificity as to when and
where these parking costs were incurred, making it impossible to confirm that
they would qualify as travel expenses to attend a deposition.
The Court
thus GRANTS OneUnited’s motion as to taxing “attachment expenses” in the amount
of $208.00.  

4.    
Item No. 8, Witness Fees 
OneUnited challenges $41,800.60 in expert
witness fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 998. It argues that “[a]n
unapportioned settlement offer to several defendants jointly is not sufficient
to trigger section 998 penalties.” (Mot. to Tax Costs, p. 6:13-14.)  OneUnited relies on Taing v. Johnson
Scaffolding Co., (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 579, 586 to support this assertion.
In Taing, the Court of Appeals held that awarding expert witness fees was
improper where plaintiff served a joint 998 on three defendants because it was
not “sufficiently specific to permit that individual defendant to determine the
exact amount plaintiff is seeking from him or her.” (Ibid.) Bakewell
served OneUnited and Kevin Cohee a single 998 offer which stated that he was
willing to dismiss the action if the Defendants pay $500,000 and agree to have
judgment entered against them. (Mot. to Tax Costs, pp. 6-7.) The offer only had
one signature line for Defendants counsel to accept on behalf of both
Defendants. (Mot. to Tax Costs, p. 7.) OneUnited also argues that the expert
fees are excessive. (Mot. to Tax Costs, p. 7.) 
In opposition, Bakewell argues that
the 998 offer is not invalid because it was jointly made. (Opp. p. 4.) He specifies
that a jointly made offer does not preclude a determination that a plaintiff received
a more favorable judgment. (Opp. pp. 7-8) However, he does not make any counterargument
to OneUnited’s contention that a 998 offer made to several defendants jointly
is not sufficient to trigger the award of expert witness fees. The cases
Bakewell cites in opposition do not address this specific question and do not
support a different outcome. 
The Court thus GRANTS OneUnited’s
motion as to taxing “witness fees” in part, in the amount of $41,760.00.  The Court notes that $40.60 were for ordinary,
not expert, witness fees. (See Amended Memorandum of Costs, Worksheet, 8(a).) 
5.    
Item No. 11, Court Reporter Fees 
Lastly, OneUnited challenges
$11,352.96 in court reporter fees as excessive because the parties agreed to equally
split the cost of the court reporter, but OneUnited’s half was only $8,706.57.
(Mot. to Tax Costs, p. 7:17-19.) 
In opposition, Bakewell argues that
recovery for court reporter costs is authorized under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5 subdivision (a)(11). (Opp. p. 6:12-15.) While he states that he
is “prepared to provide copies of the invoices” he neither submit the invoices
nor addresses the discrepancy. 
Here, OneUnited has properly
challenged the reasonableness of the court reporter costs. The burden thus
shifts to Bakewell to show that the cost was reasonably incurred. Bakewell offers
no explanation for the additional $2,646.39 in his ‘half’ of the costs. 
The Court thus GRANTS OneUnited
motion as to taxing “court reporter fees” in part, in the amount of $2,646.39. 
 
Based on the foregoing, OneUnited’s
Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED in the reduced total amount of $48,855.25.
 
III. Conclusion
Defendant OneUnited Bank’s Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED, in part. 
Plaintiff Danny Bakewell Sr.’s Amended Memorandum of Costs is TAXED in
the amount of $48,855.25.Superior

I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Danny Bakewell, Sr.
(Bakewell) sued Defendants Kevin Cohee (Cohee), OneUnited
Bank (OneUnited) and Does 1 through 20 pursuant to an April 15, 2020, First
Amended Complaint alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract; (2)
Fraud and Deceit; (3) Declaratory Relief; (4) Unfair Competition; (5) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty; and (6) Fraudulent Sale of Securities. 
The claims arose from allegations
that in January 2000, Bakewell agreed to purchase preferred stock from
OneUnited in the amount of $250,000.00. (FAC ¶ 6.) Bakewell alleges that Cohee,
the CEO and Chairman of OneUnited, orally represented and personally guaranteed
that Bakewell could redeem the preferred stock shares at any time upon request
and receive $250,000.00 plus any accumulated dividends. (FAC ¶ 6.) Bakewell
states that he never received the preferred stock certificates. (FAC ¶ 7.) When
Bakewell tried to redeem his stock in 2019, Defendants denied the request and
contended that Bakewell had no right to redeem the preferred shares. (FAC ¶ 9.)
Bakewell subsequently filed this lawsuit. 
B. Relevant Procedural History
This action was tried in July 2024.
Only the causes of action for breach of contract, fraud (with jury instructions
as to false promise and intentional misrepresentation at trial), and breach of
fiduciary duty went to trial by jury. 
On July 19, 2024, the jury rendered
a verdict in favor of Bakewell on all causes of action. 
On August 8, 2024, the Court signed
and entered judgment and on August 13, 2024, the Clerk noticed entry of
judgment on the parties. 
C. Motion Before the Court
On August 22, 2024, Defendants
OneUnited Bank and Kevin Cohee filed and served a Memorandum of Costs seeking $34,179.20
in costs. 
On September 9, 2024, Bakewell
filed the instant motion to strike and/or tax costs. 
On October 15, 2024, the Defendants
opposed the motion.
On October 21, 2024, Bakewell
replied. 
 
II. Motion
A. Legal Standard
¿ In general, the “prevailing
party” is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs for suit in any action
or proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b); Santisas v. Goodin
(1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co. Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999)
20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.) Assuming the “prevailing party” requirements are met,
the trial court has no discretion to order each party to bear his or her own
costs of suit. (Michell v. Olick (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson
v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 129.) The term “prevailing party”
for costs purposes is defined by statute to include: ¿ 
(1) The party with a net monetary recovery; ¿ 
(2) A defendant who is dismissed from the action; ¿ 
(3) A defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant
recovers anything; and ¿ 
(4) A defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not
recover any relief against that defendant. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).) 
If the party does not fall within one of these four express
categories, the court may exercise its discretion to award or deny costs. (See Lincoln
v. Schurgin (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 100, 105.)  
If any party recovers other than monetary relief and in
situations other than as specified, the “prevailing party” shall be as
determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its
discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion costs between
the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under
Section 1034. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).) For example, even if a
plaintiff maintains a net monetary recovery, in determining the prevailing
party in the litigation, the trial court should also consider, if applicable,
the defendant’s success on its declaratory relief claims and exercise its discretion
to allow costs or not and, if allowed, to apportion them as appropriate. (Wolf
v. Walt Disney Pictures & Television (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1107, 1142;
see, e.g., Lincoln v. Schurgin, supra, 39 Cal.App.4th at pp.
104-105 [when plaintiff wins net monetary recovery but defendant prevails in
its cross-action for declaratory relief, case presents circumstance not
otherwise specified; in that case, determination of prevailing party is matter
within court’s discretion].) 
Allowable costs under Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5 must be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, rather
than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation, and must be reasonable
in amount. An item not specifically allowable under Section 1033.5(a) nor
prohibited under subdivision (b) may nevertheless be recoverable in the
discretion of the court if they meet the above requirements (i.e., reasonably
necessary and reasonable in amount). If the items appearing in a cost bill appear
to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show
that they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v. California State
Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774 (Ladas).) 
Moreover, a verified memorandum of costs is prima facie
evidence that the costs, expenses, and services therein listed were necessarily
incurred. (Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256,
266.) A party seeking to tax costs must provide evidence to rebut this prima
facie showing. (Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1266 (Jones),
superseded by statute on other grounds in Code Civ. Proc., § 998, subd. (c)(1)
[whether costs permissible from filing of complaint or from date of 998
offer].) Mere statements unsupported by facts are insufficient to rebut the
prima facie showing that costs were necessarily incurred. (Jones, supra,
at p. 1266.)¿On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are
put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs. (Ibid.) 
Whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to the
litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and its decision is
reviewed for abuse of discretion. (Ladas, supra, 19 Cal.App.4th
at p. 774.) Because the right to costs is governed strictly by statute, a court
has no discretion to award costs not statutorily authorized. (Ibid.)
Discretion is abused only when, in its exercise, the court “exceeds the bounds
of reason, all of the circumstances being considered.” (Lincoln, supra,
39 Cal.App.4th at p. 105.)¿ 
B. Analysis
Bakewell moves to strike Defendants’
entire memorandum of costs on the grounds that Defendant Cohee is not a
prevailing party, or in the alternative, tax certain costs items on the grounds
that Defendant Cohee is not a prevailing party and the memorandum of costs is
deficient because it does not attach any documentation supporting the costs.  
1.    
Prevailing Party 
Bakewell argues that the Defendants
are not entitled to recover their costs because Defendant Cohee is not a
“prevailing party.” Bakewell argues that the August 8, 2024 Judgment neither
finds in favor of nor awards any amount to Cohee. (Mot. p. 8.) In opposition, the
Defendants assert that Cohee is a prevailing party because Code of Civil
Procedure defines a “prevailing party” to include “a defendant as against those
plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032 subd. (a)(4).) The Defendants rely on the
Supreme Court’s decision in Goodman v. Lozano for their assertion that
where a plaintiff obtains no monetary recovery from a defendant, that defendant
is a prevailing party. (Goodman v. Lozano (2010) 47 Cal.4th 1327 at 1333.)
Bakewell argues in reply that the Defendants misapply Goodman, and that
in this case the jury awarded damages based on “the implicit finding that [Cohee]
was acting in the course and scope of his employment with [OneUnited] when the
wrongful acts were committed which is the predicate for the award against [OneUnited].”
(Reply. p. 3:6-8.) 
The Supreme Court’s decision in Goodman
is not instructive in this case. In Goodman, the Court only discussed when
a party can invoke the “net monetary recovery” prong of Code of Civil Procedure
section 1032 subdivision (a)(4). The Supreme Court did not reach the “defendant
as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that
defendant” prong. Thus, the Court is bound by the plain language of the
statute, which clearly defines a defendant against whom the plaintiff obtains
no relief as a prevailing party. (see Code Civ. Proc., § 1032 subd.
(a)(4).) Bakewell does not cite any legal authority that interprets that prong
of the section differently. Further, Bakewell’s assertion that the jury implicitly
found against Cohee because the damage award was necessarily predicated on an
understanding that Cohee, within the scope of his employment, committed
wrongful acts, does not change the outcome that Bakewell obtained relief solely
from OneUnited, and not from Cohee.
Thus, Cohee is a prevailing party under
the language of Code of Civil Procedure section 1032 subdivision (a)(4) and is
entitled to recover costs. 
2.    
Costs
Bakewell argues that each cost the Defendants
seek should be stricken on the grounds that the Defendants do not provide any
documentation for the cost, thus rendering it impossible to determine whether
the cost was necessarily or reasonably incurred. (Mot. pp. 12-17.) In reply, the
Defendants argue that such documentation is not required and that the
memorandum is both itemized and clear. (Opp. pp. 4-5.) Plaintiff cites no
specific requirement that the invoices or receipts be attached. (Cf. Bach v.
County of Butte (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 294, 307-308.) The burden is on the
party seeking to tax costs to show that the costs were not necessarily or
reasonably incurred. (see Ladas, supra at 773-774; see also Jones, supra at 1266.)
The burden only shifts if items are “properly objected to,” at which time they
are put at issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as
costs. (Jones, supra, at 1266.)
Bakewell argues
that the costs sought are unreasonable by citing again to Defendants’ failure
to attach any receipts or invoices to their memorandum. (Mot. pp. 11-12.)
The only specific items that Bakewell challenges as unreasonable are the
parking and hotel expenses that cost for $3,272.81, photocopies of exhibits for
$1,593.41, electronic filing at $891.85 and service of process at $2003.15 “without
a single receipt or invoice.” (Ibid.) However, there are detailed
breakdowns of these expenses in the Attachments to the memorandum, and the
Court does not see prima facie any evidence of their being unreasonable.
Accordingly, Bakewell has not met
his burden to show that the costs sought are improper. 
However, upon review of the
Memorandum, it is clear that it includes total costs for the defense of the
entire case. No effort is made to distinguish between Cohee’s costs and
OneUnited Bank’s costs. Considering that only one of the two Defendants is a
prevailing party, it would be unjust to grant Defendants Cohee and OneUnited
Bank their full costs. Thus, the motion to tax costs in the amount of
$34,179.20 is reduced by half. 
Based on the foregoing, Bakewell’s motion
to tax costs is GRANTED in the reduced total amount of $17,089.60. 
C. Request for Sanctions
Code of Civil Procedure section
128.5 permits a trial court to “order a party, a party’s attorney, or both, to
pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by another
party as a result of actions or tactics, made in bad faith, that are frivolous
or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5 subd.
(a).)  Actions or tactics include, but are not limited to, filing or
opposing motions, complaints, answers, or other responsive pleadings. 
(Code Civ. Proc. §¿128.5 subd. (b)(1).)  “‘Frivolous’ means totally and
completely without merit or for the sole purpose of harassing an opposing
party.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 128.5 subd. (b)(2).)  Bad faith is
determined using a subjective standard.  (In re Marriage of
Sahafzadeh-Taeb & Taeb (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 139, 134-35.) 
Here, the Defendants memorandum of
costs was not deficient, and the request for costs is not frivolous as Cohee
fits into one of the clear statutory definitions of a prevailing party in Code
of Civil Procedure section 1032 subdivision (a)(4). 
Thus, Bakewell’s request for
sanctions is DENIED. 
 
III. Conclusion
Plaintiff Danny Bakewell Sr.’s Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED, in part. 
Defendants Kevin Cohee and OneUnited Bank’s Memorandum of Costs is TAXED
in the amount of $17,089.60.
