Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a special motion to strike (Anti-SLAPP) all causes of action in the First Amended Complaint (FAC). The defendants, Wesley Mitchell and Anna Snih, have moved to strike the complaint, arguing that it arises from protected activity under Code of Civil Procedure ยง 425.16.

The judge has denied the motion, finding that the defendants have not met the first element of 'speech or petition' required by the statute. The judge notes that the HOA's decision to levy a special assessment on the HOA members for fees associated with exterior repairs of one unit may be a matter of public interest, but the defendants have not shown that the complaint arises from protected activity.

The judge has also ordered that an Order to Show Cause be set, requiring the plaintiff, Brett Stettner, to show cause why the claims of the Estate of Suzi G. Stettner should not be dismissed for failure to have legal representation.
