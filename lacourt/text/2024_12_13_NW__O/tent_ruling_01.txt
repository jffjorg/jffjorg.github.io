III.     LEGAL
STANDARD
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not
fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading
(complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (See Code Civ. Proc. §§
422.10, 589(a); see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)[2] It
is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the
complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in
the complaint are assumed to be true. (See Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th
at 994.) 
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law. We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and
also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.” (Mitchell v.
California Dept. of Pub. Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007, citation
omitted.) “[T]he facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be. (Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981)
123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604.) Allegations are to be liberally construed. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 452.) A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
430.10(e).)  
“A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded.” (Id.) In testing the sufficiency of the
complaint, the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (See Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence
or other extrinsic matters. (See SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered. (See
Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court
to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso
v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862
[disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos.
(1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court
record].) Accordingly, “[w]hether the plaintiff will be able to prove the
pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.” (Stevens v.
Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609-10.) 
A demurrer can only be sustained when
it disposes of an entire cause of action. (See Poizner v. Fremont
General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian
Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The
burden is on the complainant to show the Court a pleading can be amended successfully.
(Id.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility that the
plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer
without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70
Cal.2d 240, 245).  
IV.     MEET AND CONFER
Before
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet
and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a), emphasis
added.) A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the results of
the meet and confer process. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(3).)
          Tony filed
a declaration attesting to the parties’ telephonic meet and confer and
unsuccessful attempt to come to an informal resolution. (See Declaration
of Michael McCabe filed November 8, 2024, ¶
2.) The
Court therefore finds Tony has fulfilled his meet and confer requirements.
V.       ANALYSIS   
Tony
argues his Demurrer should be sustained for three separate reasons. (See Demurrer,
pp. 1-2.) The Court will address each below. 
Tony
argues Plaintiff previously filed an identical Complaint under case number
22VECV01039 that was dismissed for failure to prosecute. (See id. at 1.)
Tony argues Plaintiff therefore should have filed a motion to set aside the
dismissal in that case. This is incorrect. Plaintiff’s Complaint in case number
22VECV01039 was dismissed without prejudice. (See Minute Order in Case
No. 22VECV01039 dated July 25, 2024.) Plaintiff can thus file a new lawsuit on
the same causes of action. (See Buell v. CBS, Inc. (1982) 136 Cal.App.3d
823, 826-827.)
Tony
next argues “[t]his demurrer should be sustained under the provisions of
California Code of Civil Procedure Section 430.10 ©[sic].” (Demurrer, pp. 1-2.)
Tony does not elaborate on this argument but does note Plaintiff’s first cause
of action is for criminal theft and that only the District Attorney can pursue
criminal charges. (See id. at 2.) The Court finds Plaintiff cannot
maintain a cause of action for criminal theft because this Court does not have
jurisdiction over criminal matters. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10(a).) 
Finally,
Tony argues the following: “The remaining causes of action are uncertain. There
are a total of 30 causes of action, each arising from a contract for a countertop
and alleged failures to make repairs. This is a simple breach of contract claim.
That should be the singular cause of action.” (Demurrer, pg. 2.) Tony does not
provide any additional argument. (See id.) 
The
Court will not sustain Tony’s Demurrer on the above, which would require it to scrutinize
each line of Plaintiff’s remaining twenty-eight causes of action to ascertain
how each is uncertain or whether they state a cause of action. “Generally, the
failure to specify the uncertain aspects of a complaint will defeat a demurrer
based on the grounds of uncertainty.” (Fenton v. Groveland Community
Services Dist. (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 797, 809 (disapproved of on other
grounds by Katzberg v. Regents of University of California (2002) 29
Cal.4th 300).) Additionally, a demurring party must file a memorandum of points
and authorities containing argument in support of its demurrer. (See Rules
of Court, rule 3.1113(a)-(b).)  
Accordingly,
the Court SUSTAINS WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND Tony’s Demurrer as to Plaintiff’s first
cause of action for criminal theft but OVERRULES Tony’s Demurrer as to
Plaintiff’s remaining causes of action.
///
VI.    
CONCLUSION
Based on
the foregoing analysis, the Court
SUSTAINS WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND Tony’s Demurrer as to Plaintiff’s first cause
of action for criminal theft but OVERRULES Tony’s Demurrer as to Plaintiff’s
remaining causes of action.
Tony shall file an Answer only on or
before January 17, 2025.
          IT
IS SO ORDERED.
DATED: ­­­­­December 13, 2024
