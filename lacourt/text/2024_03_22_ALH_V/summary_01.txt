And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to quash a deposition subpoena and request a protective order. The motion was filed in response to a subpoena served on the defendant's employer, Los Angeles Community Hospital, seeking deposition testimony and production of documents. The judge has granted the motion, finding that the subpoena requests are protected by California Evidence Code § 1157, which prohibits the discovery of records of organized committees of medical staffs in hospitals. The judge has also denied the defendant's request for sanctions.
