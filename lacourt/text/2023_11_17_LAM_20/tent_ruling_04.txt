  Plaintiff American Express National Bank seeks to enforce its settlement with Defendants Kenichiro Kawaminami and Three Seventy Three, Inc.  Plaintiff contends that Defendants have failed to tender payments pursuant to their settlement.  Plaintiff seeks for the Court to enter judgment in the sum of $15,153 plus costs of $563 for a total judgment of $15,716.The Court is authorized to enter judgment pursuant to a stipulated settlement.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6.)  In reviewing a motion to enforce a settlement, the Court determines “whether the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement.”  (Hines v. Lukes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182.)  “A settlement is enforceable under section 664.6 only if the parties agreed to all material settlement terms.  [Citations.]  The court ruling on the motion may consider the parties’ declarations and other evidence in deciding what terms the parties agreed to, and the court’s factual findings in this regard are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.  [Citations.]  If the court determines that the parties entered into an enforceable settlement, it should grant the motion and enter a formal judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.”  (Id. at pp. 1182-1183; see also Osumi v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1357 [“Strong public policy in favor of the settlement of civil cases gives the trial court, which approves the settlement, the power to enforce it”].)Because a valid settlement exists between the parties and the Court has retained jurisdiction (see Dyle Decl., Exhibit A), the Motion to Enforce Settlement is granted.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6.)Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
