And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case involving the Voce Family Trust, Voce Residuary Trust, and Restated Voce Marital Trust against Morgan Stanley & Co., LLC and John R. Privitelli. The Plaintiffs alleged abuse by a financial advisor relating to a "trading strategy consist[ing] of high-volume, high-risk options transactions which were saddled with massive transactional commissions, costs, and fees." The Judge granted a nonsuit in favor of the Defendants and entered a judgment in favor of the Defendants.

The Defendants seek attorneys' fees, costs, and expert fees, which the Judge has partially granted. The Judge rejects the request for attorneys' fees under CCP § 128.7, but awards expert fees from after May 26, 2023 ($177,420.50). The Judge also reduces the request for costs by $41,161.35.

The Judge allows Scales to recover $40,000 in expert fees, but rejects the request for $108,000. The Judge also reduces the request for costs by $20,501.25 due to improper transcript costs, $5,570.13 for duplicative deposition costs, and $3,065.87 for other duplicative costs. The Judge also deducts $12,024.10 for electronic document hosting.

The Judge orders that a proposed order be provided within 5 days by the Defendants. The Court also continues the Motions for supplemental briefing, and the Judge has considered the supplemental brief submitted by the Defendants.
