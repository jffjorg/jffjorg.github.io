This is an action in which Plaintiffs Adam DeVone, Mario Frank Voce, and Julia Voce, as co-trustees of the Voce Family Trust dated 8/17/1970, the Voce Residuary Trust dated 8/17/1970 and the Restated Voce Marital Trust dated 8/17/1970, alleged abuse by a financial advisor relating to a "trading strategy consist[ing] of high-volume, high-risk options transactions which were saddled with massive transactional commissions, costs, and fees." At trial, the Court granted a nonsuit in favor of Defendants Morgan Stanley & Co., LLC and John R. Privitelli.On April 12, 2024, the Court entered a judgment in favor of Defendants. Defendants seek “attorneys’ fees in the amount of $2,169,258, costs in the amount of $182,489.82 and expert fees of $177,420.50 or $249,490.37, for a total of $2,529,168.32 or $2,601,238.19. Defendants are entitled to all their expert fees under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 128.7, or, in the alternative, their expert fees after May 26, 2023, pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 998, because Plaintiffs rejected Defendants’ offer of $24,999, and Plaintiffs failed to obtain a more favorable award at trial.” The request for attorneys’ fees is premised on CCP § 128.7, which was and is again rejected.   Next, “[i]f the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.  On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.  Whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.”  (Ladas v. Cal. State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.) The request for expert fees based on CCP § 128.7 is rejected.Previously, the Court rules as follows: Defendants also seek expert fees after May 26, 2023, per CCP § 998.  Plaintiffs argue that such fees should not be awarded because (a) there is no evidence of the 998 offer provided with the memorandum of costs and (b) the expert fees claimed for Scales and Nelson are unexplained and excessive.  The former argument is rejected because evidence of the 998 offer was provided with the Opposition to the Motion to Tax Costs.  There is nothing in Behr v. Redmond (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 517 that states this is insufficient.  With respect to the latter argument, the Court finds the request for $177,420.50 to be reasonable given the scope and duration of the services provided.  Plaintiffs also object to cost items 1, 5, 14 (filing, motion, and service costs), 4 (deposition costs), 11 (court reporter fees), 12 (models and copies of exhibits), 15 (fee for hosting electronic documents), and 16 (other—specifically, rental equipment and trial technician).   The Court reduces the request for costs by $20,501.25 due to improper transcript costs that were not ordered by the Court.  This is conceded.There will be a $5,570.13 reduction for duplicative deposition costs.  This is conceded.There will be a $3,065.87 reduction for other duplicative costs.  This too is conceded.The Court will also make a deduction of $12,024.10 for electronic document hosting, which the Court sees as an overhead cost.  In sum, the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs is granted in part.  The Motion to Tax Costs is granted in part.  Specifically, the Court will not award any attorneys’ fees.  Further, all costs will be awarded, except (a) there will only be expert fees from after May 26, 2023 ($177,420.50) and (b) there will be a deduction of $41,161.35.  A proposed order is to be provided within 5 days by Defendants. The Court, however, continued the Motions for supplemental briefing.  Defendants have submitted a supplemental brief in which they contend that they “withdraw their request for $25,009.14, which encompasses Mr. Scales’ travel expenses and certain billed fees from May 1, 2023, to May 26, 2023.”  The total amount sought for Scales is $108,000.  Defendants attach Scales’ invoices.  Defendants continue to support the full amount requested for demonstratives and travel expenses.  Meanwhile, Plaintiffs contend that “Defendants should recover none of Scales’ expert fees, given that he never testified, he was unqualified and had no intention of offering opinion testimony about Breach of Fiduciary Duty issues allowed by the Court, he was unqualified and had no intention of providing opinion testimony about Financial Elder Abuse, and the Court excluded any of his testimony about investment ‘suitability’ about which he was disclosed and intended to opine. Defendants should not recover most of their costs of trial exhibits or video presentations, to the extent those materials were unnecessary and never used, and thus were not reasonably necessary for trial. Defendants should not recover any travel costs associated with their abandonment of the deposition of Michelle Mangan in November 2022, nor should they recover any other deposition travel costs that were ‘merely convenient or beneficial.’ ”The Court again finds that the demonstratives and travel costs have been sufficiently supported.   As to Scales, the Court, upon further examination, will only allow him to recover $40,000.  The Court’s other findings are unchanged. Defendants to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
