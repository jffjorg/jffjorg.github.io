B CONTENT CHECKED HOLDINGS INC.,    Plaintiffs, Case No.:  BC721119 vs.  [Tentative] RULING  RBSM LLP, et al.,   Defendants.       Hearing Date:                         March 19, 2024 Moving Parties:                      Plaintiff Content Checked Holdings, Inc.Responding Party:                  Defendant RBSM, LLPMotion to Tax Costs             The court considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers. QUESTION:  If expert witness fees incurred AFTER a CCP § 998 offer are recoverable, but not expert witness fees incurred prior the § 998 offer, does proof of the existence of a § 998 offer and proof of the date of the offer constitute part of the necessary prima facie showing for a party to establish “entitlement” to post offer expert witness fees.  If so, should the party claiming entitlement to such post-offer fees be required in the first instance to bring forth that evidence?  Defendant says “no.”RULING            The motion is DENIED as to Item 16 and GRANTED as to Items 1, 5, 8.b., and 11.  The court STRIKES the following from defendant’s memorandum of costs:  Item 1 in the amount of $2179.57; Item 5 in the amount of $449.82; Item 8.b. in the amount of $117,487.07; and Item 11 in the amount of $13,118.75.LEGAL AUTHORITY            “Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.  This means that the prevailing party is entitled to all of his costs unless another statute provides otherwise.  Absent such statutory authority, the court has no discretion to deny costs to the prevailing party.”  Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal. App. 4th 111, 128-29 (citations and internal quotations omitted); CCP §1032(b) (“Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding”). CCP §1033.5(c) states, in relevant part:  “Any award for costs shall be subject to the following:              (1) Costs are allowable if incurred, whether or not paid.  (2) Allowable costs shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation. (3) Allowable costs shall be reasonable in amount.  (4) Items not mentioned in this section . . . may be allowed . . . in the Court’s discretion.” “If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.  On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.”  Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th 761, 774 (citation omitted).   Id.  “The court’s first determination, therefore, is whether the statute expressly allows the particular item, and whether it appears proper on its face.  If so, the burden is on the objecting party to show them to be unnecessary or unreasonable.”  Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal. App. 4th 111, 131 (citations omitted).  “[I]t is not enough for the losing party to attack submitted costs by arguing that he thinks the costs were not necessary or reasonable.  Rather the losing party has the burden to present evidence and prove that the claimed costs are not recoverable.”  Seever v. Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141 Cal. App. 4th 1550, 1557.DISCUSSION            Plaintiff requests that the court tax and/or strike the following items from defendant’s memorandum of costs:  Items 1, 5, 8, 11, and 16.            As background, on January 9, 2024, the court entered judgment in favor of defendant RBSM LLP and against plaintiff Content Checked Holdings, Inc. and “[c]osts to be determined per the filing of a Memorandum of Costs.”  Defendant filed a memorandum of costs on January 4, 2024.                        Item 1:  $2179.57 in filing and motion fees            Plaintiff contends that although defendant provided a list of amounts and dates, “it is impossible to tell what RBSM was paying for and whether those costs are reasonable and appropriate.”              In opposition, defendant asserts that it is entitled to such costs.            The court notes that the form memorandum of costs at Item 1 requires the name of the “Paper filed” and the “Filing fee.”  Instead, defendant stated, “See Attachment A,” which was only the invoice date and job total.  Although the statute expressly allows recovery of “filing and motion fees,” the memorandum of costs at Item 1 lacks required information to show that they are proper on their face.  Thus, the burden does not shift to plaintiff to show that they are not reasonable or necessary.              The motion is GRANTED as to Item 1.                         Item 5:  $449.82 in service of process            Plaintiff asserts that defendant only lists a total in the worksheet without specifying what was served or who served the documents.            In opposition, defendant argues that such costs are recoverable under CCP §1033.5(a)(1).            The court notes that the form memorandum of costs at Item 5 for service of process requires that the claimant state, “Name of person served” and the amount.  Defendant provides no information and leaves blank the lines and states only the total.  The court finds that it is unable to determine whether the cost bill appears to be proper charges as to Item 5 as defendant has not provided the required information to be prima facie evidence of their propriety.            The motion is GRANTED as to Item 5.             Item 8.b.:  $117,487.07 in expert witness fees            CCP §998(c) states:  “(1) If an offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award, the plaintiff shall not recover his or her post offer costs and shall pay the defendant’s costs from the time of the offer.  In addition, in any action or proceeding . . . , the court . . . , in its discretion, may require the plaintiff to pay a reasonable sum to cover postoffer costs of the services of expert witnesses, . . . actually incurred and reasonably necessary” in either or both preparation of trial or during trial of the case by the defendant.            Plaintiff argues that defendant is not entitled to expert witness fees because defendant did not submit a written 998 offer with its memorandum of costs.  Also, plaintiff asserts, to the extent that defendant seeks expert fees that pre-date any 998 offer, CCP §998(c)(1) only permits the recovery of costs incurred “from the time of the offer.”  Plaintiff further argues that defendant should not recoup any expert costs because Christine Davis’ testimony was partially deemed inadmissible and rejected by the jury and court.  Lastly, plaintiff contends, Davis’ post deposition fees ($71,632.07) are not recoverable because they are unreasonably high as she had testified at deposition that she had completed her investigation.            In opposition, defendant argues that it is entitled to expert witness fees because it is the prevailing party.  It asserts that on March 9, 2023, it served a 998 offer in the amount of $1,141,133, and that a jury ruled in favor of plaintiff in the amount of $1,136,000, which the court vacated on October 30, 2023 in defendant’s motion for nonsuit.  Defendant contends its costs were reasonable and necessary.             In reply, plaintiff points out that defendant does not address that the expert witness fees incurred pre-998 offer are not recoverable.  Plaintiff also asserts that defendant’s contention that Davis’ costs are reasonable and necessary because “the jury found Defendant’s expert testimony helpful and credible and largely adopted her opinions over Plaintiff’s expert’s opinions who insisted Plaintiff’s damages were over five million dollars” is a misrepresentation because Davis did not testify about damages at trial and expressed no opinion about damages at her deposition.  Plaintiff reiterates that Davis testified that RBSM was not negligent, which the jury and court disregarded.            The court finds that $51,175 in expert witness costs predates defendant’s 998 offer and thus is not recoverable.  As to expert witness Davis spending 200 hours, amounting to $71,632.07 in costs after her July 7, 2022 deposition, the court finds that the amount is unreasonable, considering that she had testified that she had completed her investigation and formed her opinions at the time of her deposition.            The motion is GRANTED as to Item 8.b.                         Item 11:  $13,118.75 in trial transcripts            Plaintiff argues that the cost of trial transcripts is not recoverable under CCP §1033.5(b)(5).            In the memorandum of costs, defendant states “See Attachment A” but does not include any information on Attachment A as to trial transcripts.            Defendant’s opposition does not address this item.            The court finds that such costs are not recoverable.  See CCP §1033.5(b)(5).            The motion is GRANTED as to Item 11.                         Item 16:  $5556 for mediation fees [$4950] and subpoena records [$606]            Plaintiff argues that without more information it is impossible to determine whether these costs are reasonable and appropriate.            In opposition, defendant argues that the voluntary mediation costs fall under the catch-all of costs “reasonably necessary” to the litigation.            Mediation costs are not listed among the costs that are expressly allowable or expressly not allowable under CCP §1033.5.  Mediation costs do fall within the category of costs that may be awarded in the trial court’s discretion.  See CCP §1033.5(c)(4).  “[M]ediation fees incurred for mediation that was not ordered by the court are not categorically nonrecoverable as ‘not reasonably necessary to the conduct of litigation.’  The question whether mediation fees should be awarded as costs in a particular matter must be determined based on the facts and circumstances of the particular action.” Berkeley Cement, Inc. v. Regents of University of California (2019) 30 Cal. App. 5th 1133, 1143.            The court finds that the mediation costs were reasonably necessary to the litigation.            The motion is DENIED as to Item 16.             Accordingly, the motion is DENIED as to Item 16 and GRANTED as to Items 1, 5, 8.b., and 11.  The court STRIKES the following from defendant’s memorandum of costs:  Item 1 in the amount of $2179.57; Item 5 in the amount of $449.82; Item 8.b. in the amount of $117,487.07; and Item 11 in the amount of $13,118.75. ORDER            The motion is DENIED as to Item 16 and GRANTED as to Items 1, 5, 8.b., and 11.  The court STRIKES the following from defendant’s memorandum of costs:  Item 1 in the amount of $2179.57; Item 5 in the amount of $449.82; Item 8.b. in the amount of $117,487.07; and Item 11 in the amount of $13,118.75.            Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of ruling.
