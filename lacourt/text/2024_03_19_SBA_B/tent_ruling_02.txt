Motion for Terminating
Sanctions Against Plaintiff
            The court considered the moving
papers.  No opposition was filed.  

RULING
            The motion for terminating sanctions
is GRANTED.  The complaint filed on
November 7, 2022 is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
BACKGROUND
On November 7, 2022, plaintiff
Austin Brennan filed a complaint against City of Culver City and Minerva
Rodriguez for motor vehicle negligence. 
Plaintiff alleges that on January 14, 2022, City of Culver bus driver
Rodriguez did not yield the right of way to pedestrian plaintiff who was
traveling on a bicycle.  As a result of a
failure to yield, plaintiff was struck with the bus and injured. 
On November 21, 2023, the court
granted plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration indicated that
counsel’s office had attempted to locate plaintiff through their last known
phone number and mailing contact letters to the last known address and hired an
investigation service but was unable to confirm plaintiff’s last known address
and phone number. Plaintiff has not participated in these proceedings since Plaintiff’s
counsel withdrew.
On November 29, 2023, the court
granted defendant City of Culver City’s motion to compel plaintiff to appear
for a deposition within 30 days. Plaintiff has not appeared for deposition.
The matter is set for the Final
Status Conference on March 20, 2024 with the jury trial set for March 27, 2024.
As of the date of this hearing Defendant has filed a witness and exhibit list.  However, Plaintiff has failed to file or
propose any trial documents.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
If a party fails to comply with a
court order compelling discovery responses or attendance at a deposition, the
court may impose monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions.  CCP § 2025.450(h) (depositions); §
2030.290(c) (interrogatories); § 2031.300(c) (demands for production of
documents).  CCP § 2023.030 provides
that, “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method . . . , the court, after notice to any affected party, person,
or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose . . .  [monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating]
sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery
process . . . .”  CCP § 2023.010 provides
that “[m]isuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the
following: . . . (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery. . . . (g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery. . . .”  
“The trial court may order a
terminating sanction for discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the
circumstances:  [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding
party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’”  Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390
(quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77
Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246).  “Generally,
‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.  But where a violation is willful, preceded by
a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.’”  Los Defensores, 223 Cal. App. 4th at 390
(citation omitted).
“Under this standard, trial courts
have properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties have willfully
disobeyed one or more discovery orders.” 
Los Defensores, 223 Cal. App.
4th at 390 (citing Lang, 77 Cal. App. 4th at 1244-1246 (discussing
cases)); see, e.g., Collisson &
Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 1611, 1617-1622 (terminating
sanctions imposed after defendants failed to comply with one court order to
produce discovery); Laguna Auto Body v.
Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 481, 491, disapproved on
other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen
(1997) 16 Cal. 4th 469, 478, n. 4 (terminating sanctions imposed against
plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating
various discovery statutes).
DISCUSSION
Defendant City of Culver City requests
an order imposing terminating sanctions against plaintiff Austin Brennan.
On November 29, 2023, the court
granted defendant City’s motion to compel plaintiff to appear for deposition
within 30 days on a mutually acceptable date and time.  The court also ordered plaintiff to pay
sanctions in the amount of $450 to defendant within 30 days.
Defense counsel indicates in his
declaration that counsel’s office served plaintiff on December 1, 2023 with the
notice of ruling and “invited plaintiff to contact my office in order to set
his deposition for a mutually agreeable date and time.”  Counsel states that to date, plaintiff has
not contacted counsel’s office to set up his deposition.  See Geroge Tourkow decl. filed January 2,
2024.
It is noteworthy that Plaintiff has
not participated in these proceedings since the Court granted his counsel’s
motion to be relieved as counsel.  These
failings include not just the failure to attend his court ordered deposition,
but also his failure to attend the Order to Show Cause re Failure to Prosecute
held January 29, 2024.  He has not
prepared any jury trial documents.  This
case is scheduled for the Final Status Conference on March 20, 2024 and Jury
Trial on March 27, 2024.
The court notes that a court may
not issue a terminating sanction for failure to pay a monetary discovery
sanction.  Newland v. Superior Court
(1995) 40 Cal. App. 4th 608, 610, 615.
The court rules as follows:  The court finds that plaintiff has engaged in
conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process by disobeying the court’s November
29, 2023 order to appear for a deposition as directed by the court.  CCP §§2023.010(g), 2023.030.  The court thus finds that it is appropriate,
and exercises its discretion, to impose terminating sanctions.  CCP §2023.030(d)(1).  It would be fundamentally unfair to Defendants
to have the matter proceed further, burdening them (at a minimum) with
preparing for the March 27, 2024 trial.
The motion is GRANTED.  
ORDER
The motion is GRANTED.
The complaint filed on November 7,
2022 is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
Moving defendant is ordered to give
notice of the ruling.
