Summary:

The Judge issues a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants, Manhattan Beach Unified School District and Redondo Beach Unified School District, to the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action in the complaint filed by the plaintiff, T.B. The plaintiff alleges that he was sexually assaulted in 1980-1981 by two individuals employed by Aviation High School and seeks damages and compensation. The defendants argue that the court lacks jurisdiction over the causes of action, that the plaintiff lacks standing, and that the claims are time-barred. The Judge rules that the allegations are sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that the plaintiff has standing. The Judge also finds that the defendants have not shown that the "gift clause" is applicable or triggered and that the legislative history shows a "public purpose". The demurrer is therefore overruled, and the defendants are ordered to file an answer within 20 days.
