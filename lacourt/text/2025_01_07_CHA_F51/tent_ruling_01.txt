BACKGROUND
 
On 12/23/23, Plaintiffs filed the instant action against
Defendants, alleging the following causes of action: (1) Breach of Written
Contract; (2) Negligent Misrepresentation; (3) Fraudulent Business Practices
Pursuant to Bus. & Prof. Code Section 17200, et sq.; and (4) Unjust
Enrichment. On 4/13/21, Plaintiffs filed proofs of service stating that the
complaint and summons were served on Defendants via substituted service on 3/30/21. On 8/26/22, Plaintiffs
filed a proof of service stating the complaint and summons were personally
served on defendant Delgadillo on 5/26/22.
 
On 8/26/22, the Court entered default against defendant
Urbino Construction, Inc. On 11/2/22, default was entered against Delgadillo.
On 5/25/23, the Court entered a default judgment against Defendants in the
amount of $58,732.20. On 6/11/24, Defendants filed the instant motion. On 10/3/24,
Plaintiffs filed their opposition. No reply has been filed to date.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“The court may, upon any terms
as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.
Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or
other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall
not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 473, subd. (b).)
 
“When service of a summons has
not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a
default or default judgment has been entered against him or her in the action,
he or she may serve and file a notice of motion to set aside the default or
default judgment and for leave to defend the action. The notice of motion shall
be served and filed within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the
earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a default judgment against him or her;
or (ii) 180 days after service on him or her of a written notice that the
default or default judgment has been entered.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 473.5, subd.
(a).)
 
Here, Defendants argue that the address where the complaint
and summons were originally served were incorrect, and therefore they lacked
actual notice of the instant action until they were correctly served with the
default judgment on 3/7/24. (Defs.’ Mot. 4:2–10.)
 
As a preliminary matter, to the extent that Defendants
move for relief on the bases of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect, the instant motion was not made within six months of the default
judgment, despite Defendants’ assertion that the instant motion is timely.
(Defs.’ Mot. 4:21–22 [“This motion is filed within a reasonable period of time,
not exceeding six months after entry of the default.”].) Here, the default
judgment was entered on 5/25/23, and Defendants now move for relief on 6/11/24,
over one year later. Accordingly, the instant motion is untimely pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).


Furthermore, to the extent that Defendants argue lack of
actual notice to Delgadillo because the complaint and summons were not served
to his correct address, located in San Fernando, this argument likewise lacks
merit. (Id. at 4:5–8 [“Defendant did not become aware of this litigation
until very recent, and that was only the default judgment was served on the
Defendant on March 7th, 2024. Only the very last service list served on March
7th, 2024 provided the correct San Fernando address.”].) The Court record shows
that Delgadillo was personally served with the complaint and summons at this
“correct San Fernando address” on 5/26/22 at 5:53pm. (8/26/22 POS.)
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds no basis to grant
Defendants relief from the default judgment entered against them on 5/25/23.
Accordingly, the motion is denied.
 
CONCLUSION

 
The
motion is denied.
