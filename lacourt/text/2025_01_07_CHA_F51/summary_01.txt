And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to vacate/default judgment filed by the defendants, Urbino Construction, Inc. and Rigo Delgadillo. The defendants argued that they lacked actual notice of the lawsuit because the complaint and summons were served at an incorrect address. However, the judge found that the defendants were personally served with the complaint and summons at the correct address on May 26, 2022. The judge also noted that the defendants did not file the motion to vacate/default judgment within the six-month time limit specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). Therefore, the judge denied the motion and allowed the default judgment entered against the defendants on May 25, 2023 to stand.
