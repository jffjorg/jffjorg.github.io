And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiffs' complaint. The defendants, Bohrer and Bohrer Construction, have demurred to the first four causes of action (COAs) in the complaint, arguing that they do not state facts sufficient to constitute a valid claim. The judge has sustained the demurrer as to the first and third COAs, and overruled the demurrer as to the second and fourth COAs.

The first COA alleges breach of contract, and the judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. The second COA alleges breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and the judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient to state a claim.

The third COA alleges violation of Business and Professions Code sections 7159, 7159.4, and 7159.6, and the judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. The fourth COA alleges fraud, and the judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient to establish a cause of action.

The judge has also noted that Bohrer Construction should be removed from the second COA, as it is not a proper party to that claim.
