And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Roth v. Arakelian Enterprises, Inc. The plaintiff, Roth, is suing the defendants, Arakelian Enterprises, Inc. and Caraballo, for property damage to his vehicle. The defendants have moved to compel Roth's deposition and request sanctions, alleging that Roth failed to respond to their requests for discovery. Roth opposes the motion and requests sanctions against defense counsel.

The judge has ruled that Roth failed to appear for a previously scheduled deposition and did not serve written objection. The judge has also found that Roth's deposition notice was in an incorrect font, but has determined that this does not invalidate the notice. The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel Roth's deposition and has awarded them attorney's fees in the amount of $1,600, payable within 30 days. The judge has also ordered that the deposition occur within 15 days of the date of this ruling.
