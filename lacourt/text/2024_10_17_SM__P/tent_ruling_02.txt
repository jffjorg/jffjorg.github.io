Scholer v. Bohrer, Case no. 23SMCV05070
Hearing date October 17, 2024
Defendants Bohrer and Bohrer Construction’s Demurrer to
Plaintiffs’ FAC
Plaintiffs Scholer sue defendants Stephen Bohrer, Bohrer
Construction, Mendez Master Concrete, Inc., Mendez Leon, American Contractors
Indemnity Company, and Leiva dba JJ Electric for breach of contract, fraud and
conversion. Defendants Bohrer and Bohrer Construction (“BC”) demur to the first
four COAs in the FAC, arguing they do not state facts sufficient to constitute
a valid claim per Code Civ. Proc. §430.10(e).
“The function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of
the complaint as a matter of law.” Holiday Matinee, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc. (2004)
118 Cal.App.4th 1413, 1420. A complaint “is sufficient if it alleges ultimate
rather than evidentiary facts” Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th
531, 550, but plaintiff must set forth the essential facts of the case “with
reasonable precision and with particularity sufficient to acquaint [the]
defendant with the nature, source and extent” of the plaintiff’s claim. Doheny
Park Terrace Homeowners Ass’n., Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exchange (2005) 132
Cal.App.4th 1076, 1099.
First COA: Breach of Contract
The court previously sustained moving parties’ demurrer to
the breach of contract claim without leave to amend. The first cause of action
should only be pled as against Stephen Bohrer. 
Second COA: Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing
The elements for a cause of action for breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing are: (1) the parties entered into a
contract; (2) plaintiff performed; (3) all conditions required for defendant’s
performance occurred or were excused; (4) defendant’s conduct prevented
plaintiff from receiving the benefits expected under the contract; (5)
defendant did not act fairly and in good faith; and (6) damage. CACI 325.
BC is not a proper party under this claim, as a claim for
breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing necessarily arises from a
breach of contract. Plaintiffs do not dispute this.
Defendants argue plaintiffs attempted to add duties to the
contract between defendant Bohrer and plaintiffs that are an expansion of the
original contract, in violation of Careau & Co. v. Sec. Pac. Bus. Credit,
Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1395. Defendants argue plaintiffs’ allegations
are duplicative of the breach of contract claim. Plaintiffs alleged that
defendant Bohrer:
•              failed
to provide defect-free installations that were code compliant and approved by
Los Angeles Building and Safety inspectors. FAC para. 38.
•              engaged
in work outside the scope of the agreed upon contracts without the prior
written approval of plaintiffs. Id.
•              failed
to timely secure and provide lien releases to plaintiffs. Id.
•              failed
to document the progress of construction and to complete the construction on
time and on budget. Id.
•              failed
to provide adequate supervision of the construction. Id.
Plaintiffs’ allegations are sufficient to state a claim for
breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Plaintiffs alleged a
contract under which they fulfilled their obligations by making payments. FAC
para. 14. Plaintiffs allege they did not receive the benefits of the contract
and suffered harmed. 
Defendants argue plaintiffs fail to allege unfair or bad
faith actions; plaintiffs allege defendants acted unfairly by willfully failing
to properly manage the work. FAC para. 38. This is sufficient to survive
demurrer. 
Third COA: Violation of Business & Professions Code
Sections 7159, 7159.4 and 7159.6.
Defendants argue there is no civil cause of action for
violations of Bus. & Prof. Code §§7159, 7159.4 and 7159.6. Violations of
§7159 and §7159.5 constitute misdemeanors. Section 7159.6 states extra work or
change orders in violation of a contract are not enforceable against a buyer.
Plaintiffs argue these statutes were intended to protect
homeowners, so violations thereof give rise to civil claims. Simply because a
statute is designed to protect a class does not inherently imbue that class
with the right to bring a civil cause of action, absent express statutory
authority. 
Case law holds a home improvement contract may be
enforceable despite violating sec. 7159. See Asdourian v. Araj (1985) 38 Cal.3d
276, 292. “The Legislature intended neither that the express misdemeanor
penalty provision of the statute would be exclusive nor that all contracts made
in violation of the statute would be void, thereby opening the door to
enforcement of nonconforming contracts in appropriate cases” Arya Group, Inc.
v. Cher (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 619, 615. Neither statute nor case law supports
plaintiffs’ contentions. Sustained without leave to amend.
Fourth COA: Fraud
The court overruled defendants’ previous demurrer to
plaintiffs’ fourth COA for fraud, finding the claim was not subject to the
economic loss rule. Plaintiffs argue the fourth COA was not substantially
changed via the FAC, so demurrer is not permitted under Code Civ. Proc.
§430.41.
Defendants argue they previously demurred on both economic
loss rule grounds and under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §430.10(e). The court did not
address the Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §430.10(e) argument, which defendants renew.
Min. Order 2/23/2024. 
The elements of a fraud claim are: (a) misrepresentation;
(b) knowledge of falsity; (c) intent to induce reliance; (d) justifiable
reliance; and (e) damage. See Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631,
638. Defendants argue plaintiffs fail to plead the fraud cause of action with
sufficient particularity. 
Plaintiffs allege: (1) defendants made misrepresentations
regarding additional payments required to complete the work. FAC para. 48; (2)
defendants knew those additional payments would not result in the completion of
the work. FAC para. 49; (3) they would not have made the additional payments if
not for defendants’ misrepresentations, which were intended to induce reliance.
FAC paras. 49-51; (4) defendants made misrepresentations to induce plaintiffs
to retain BC as general contractor. FAC para. 53; and (5) damages exceeding
$500,000. FAC para. 54. These allegations are sufficient to establish a COA for
fraud. 
Plaintiffs alleged intentional misrepresentations, which
induced them to make payments to defendants. Overruled. 
Defendants’ demurrer as to the first and third COAs is
SUSTAINED without leave to amend. Defendants’ demurrer as to the second and
fourth COAs is OVERRULED, noting that BC should be removed from the second COA.
