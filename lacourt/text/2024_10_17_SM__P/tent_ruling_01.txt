Roth v. Arakelian Enterprises, Inc., Case no. 22SMCV01418
Hearing date October 17, 2024
Defendants’ Motion to Compel Plaintiff Roth’s Deposition
Plaintiff Roth in pro per sues defendants Arakelian
Enterprises, Inc. dba Athens Services and its employee Caraballo for property
damage to plaintiff’s vehicle. Defendants alleges plaintiff failed to respond
to requests for discovery and move to compel plaintiff’s deposition and request
sanctions. Plaintiff opposes and requests sanctions against defense counsel. 
A party may move to compel deposition per Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. §2025.450(a). Defendants attempted to take plaintiff’s deposition twice,
on 7/22/2024 and 8/22/2024. The court ruled on 8/1/2024 that defendants could
file a motion to compel deposition and for sanctions. Decl. Herzog para. 14,
ex. M; Min. Order 8/1/2024. Plaintiff asked to reschedule a previously set
8/22/2024 deposition to 9/3/2024. Decl. Herzog para. 16.
Plaintiff failed to appear on for a properly noticed
deposition on 9/3/2024 and did not serve written objection. Decl. Herzog para.
16. Plaintiff argues the deposition notice was in the incorrect font, so
invalid and that he did object, but defendants did not receive the objections. 
Plaintiff accuses defense counsel Herzog of lying in her
declaration (Decl. Roth paras. 11-15) and seeks $3,712.50 for alleged discovery
abuse, plus costs. To request sanctions, plaintiff would have to file a motion
to that effect, not simply include such a request in an opposition to the
motion to compel. There is no basis to award costs, which request is denied.
Regarding defendant’s motion to compel, this issue has been
ongoing, and plaintiff has failed to appear and has not provided a reasonable
basis for his failure to appear. Plaintiff has been on notice since 8/1/2024.
Min. Order 8/1/2024. He subsequently failed to appear. Plaintiff brought this
suit; he is required to sit for deposition.
Defendants seek attorney’s fees at $400 an hour for six
hours spent preparing the motion and an additional hour at hearing totaling
$3,600, plus $60 in filing fees. Decl. Herzog para. 18. The court finds the
hourly rate reasonable but finds six hours to prepare this motion to be
unreasonable. In addition, the hearing is not likely to last a full hour. The
court awards a total of four hours at $400/hour = $1,600 payable within 30
days. Further, the deposition is to occur within 15 days of the date of this motion.
GRANTED.
