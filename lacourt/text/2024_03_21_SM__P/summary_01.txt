Significant Statements:
  - "Unlawful detainer is a highly specialized form of litigation. Highly summary in nature, the code requirements must be followed strictly, otherwise a landlord's remedy is an ordinary suit for breach of contract with all the delays that that remedy normally involves and without restitution of the demised property." (Cal-American Income Property Fund IV. v. Ho (1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 583, 585)
  - "The court agrees with defendant's argument that a five-month delay in providing notice to the Housing Department is not 'substantial compliance.' The statute imposes a time requirement of 'three business days[.]' If the court were to treat a filing made five months after the statutory period as effective, the statute's time limit would be rendered void."

The plaintiff admits that the JCEO applies to this action, but does not provide evidence of compliance. The court agrees with the defendant that a five-month delay is not substantial compliance and will hear from the plaintiff regarding alleged compliance.
