Estate Investment v. Ann Turkel, Case No. 23SMCV04805
Hearing Date March
21, 2024
Defendant Ann
Turkel’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons 
 
In this unlawful
detainer action defendant Turkel moves to quash service of summons. 
 
Turkel cites Delta
Imports, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1033, 1035 for the
principle that a motion to quash –rather than a demurrer - is the proper
vehicle to challenge a defective complaint for unlawful detainer. Turkel argues
if the complaint does not state a cause of action for unlawful detainer, then,
under Delta, the summons with an expedited five-day period to respond is
ineffective, and the court lacks jurisdiction. 
 
She argues the
unlawful detainer claim fails because “[m]ere expiration of lease is not
just-cause under the Tenant Protection Act,” so the summons did not confer
jurisdiction upon the court. 
 
The underlying
unlawful detainer action is properly pleaded. The first amended complaint is
not based on “mere expiration of lease,” but on failure to pay rent, which
constitutes just cause under the Tenant Protection Act. FAC ¶19. The court has
jurisdiction under Delta. DENIED. 
 
Defendant to
answer within 5 court days.
