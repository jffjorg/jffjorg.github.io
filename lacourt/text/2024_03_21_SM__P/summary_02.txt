The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to quash service of summons in the unlawful detainer action brought by Alathel Real Estate Investment against Ann Turkel. The defendant argues that the complaint does not state a cause of action for unlawful detainer, and therefore the court lacks jurisdiction. However, the Judge finds that the complaint is properly pleaded and states a cause of action based on failure to pay rent, which constitutes just cause under the Tenant Protection Act. The Judge rules that the court has jurisdiction under the principle established in Delta Imports, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1033, 1035. The defendant is ordered to answer within 5 court days.
