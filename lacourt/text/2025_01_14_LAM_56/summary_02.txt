Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the demurrer filed by State College Distributors, Inc. against the toxic tort action filed by Leobardo Segura-Meza and Mirian Sanchez. The demurrer argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action against State College. The judge agrees that the complaint is too generic and fails to specify which products supplied by State College contain toxic substances that caused the plaintiffs' injury. Therefore, the judge sustains the demurrer and gives the plaintiffs 20 days to amend their complaint.
