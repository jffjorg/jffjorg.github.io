BACKGROUND
             Plaintiffs Leobardo Segura-Meza and Mirian
Sanchez (“Plaintiffs”) filed this toxic tort action against defendants Agoura
Hills Marble and Granite, Inc., et al (collectively, “Defendants”) on
December 13, 2022. The operative third amended complaint (“TAC”) alleges causes
of action for: (1) negligence; (2) products liability – failure to warn; (3) products
liability – design defect; (4) fraudulent concealment; (5) breach of implied warranties;
and (6) loss of consortium.
            
            On October 17, 2024, State College
filed the instant demurrer (“Demurrer”). The Demurrer is unopposed.  
 
MEET AND CONFER 
            State
College has satisfied the meet and confer requirement.  
 
DISCUSSION
            A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) § 430.10, subd.
(e).) 
 
To sufficiently allege a cause of action,
a complaint must allege all the ultimate facts—that is, the facts needed to
establish each element of the cause of action pleaded. (Committee on
Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan
Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) “[E]ach evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) 
 
In testing the sufficiency of the cause of
action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry
v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) Courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other
grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th
1158, 1162.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.)  
 
State College demurs to the entire TAC on
the ground that it fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action
against State College. 
 
Causation

            “In the ordinary personal injury
lawsuit, in which the complaint's factual recitations show plainly the
connection between cause and effect, it suffices to plead causation succinctly
and generally.” (Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 71,
78.) “But when, by contrast, the pleaded facts of negligence and injury do not
naturally give rise to an inference of causation, the plaintiff must plead
specific facts affording an inference the one caused the others.” (Ibid.)
The facts must show that “the defective products supplied by the defendant were
a substantial factor in bringing about his or her injury.” (Id. at p.
79.) In order for a complaint to satisfy the substantial factor test in a toxic
exposure case, the plaintiff must plead the following: 
(1) he was exposed to each of the toxic
materials claimed to have caused a specific illness;
(2) he must identify each product that
allegedly caused the injury;
(3) he must allege that as a result of the
exposure, the toxins entered his body;
(4) he must allege that he suffers from a
specific illness, and that each toxin that entered his body was a substantial
factor in bringing about, prolonging, or aggravating that illness; and
(5) he must allege that each toxin he absorbed
was manufactured or supplied by a named defendant. 
(Id.
at p. 80.) These facts must be pled “in ordinary and concise language” and may
be pled “in a conclusory fashion if [the plaintiff’s] knowledge of the precise
cause of injury is limited.” (Id..)
            
            Defendant argues that Plaintiffs have
failed to satisfy the specificity element of Bockrath because the TAC does
not allege any specific product that was manufactured or supplied by State
College that caused Plaintiffs’ injury. (Demurrer pp. 10:15-11:7.) In the TAC,
Plaintiffs allege that stone products in general contain varying concentrations
of toxic substances which fabrication workers are exposed to. (TAC ¶¶ 103,
105-109) The TAC states that State College’s stone products include porcelain,
quartz and quartzite. (TAC p. 59:20-23.) The Court agrees that this is too
generic to satisfy Bockrath. Plaintiffs do not specify which of the porcelain,
quartz or quartzite products supplied by State College contain a toxic
substance that was a substantial factor in causing their injury. The TAC fails
to put State College on sufficient notice to appropriately respond to the
claims against it. Thus, Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to
state a cause of action against State College. 
 
            Accordingly, the Demurrer is
SUSTAINED, with 20 days leave to amend.  
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
