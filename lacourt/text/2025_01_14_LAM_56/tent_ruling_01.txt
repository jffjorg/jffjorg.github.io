  CASE NO.:  21STCV36334
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION TO SET ASIDE/VACATE DEFAULT

MOVING
PARTY:  Defendant 1970 Taylor Bi, Inc. (“1970”)

RESPONDING
PARTY: Plaintiff Patriot Environmental Services, Inc. (“Plaintiff”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from remediation
services allegedly provided by Plaintiff after a boat fire that occurred at the
marina located at 1970 Taylor Road, Bethel Island, CA 94511, known as Anchor
Marina. Plaintiff alleges that Anchor Marina Inc. (“AMI”) failed to pay the
outstanding invoice of over $400,000 for services rendered. Plaintiff filed
this action on October 1, 2021.  The
operative first amended complaint (“FAC”) alleges causes of action for: (1) breach
of contract; (2) common count: goods and services rendered; (3) intentional
misrepresentation (fraud); (4) promissory fraud; (5) negligent
misrepresentation; (6) fraudulent inducement; and (7) violation of Business
& Professions Code Section 17200.     
 
            On October 31, 2024, Defendant 1970
filed the instant motion to set aside defaults entered against 1970 Taylor BI, Inc.,
and BI Properties, Inc. (the “Motion”). Plaintiff filed an opposition on
December 17, 2024 (the “Opposition”).
 
            Initially, the Court notes that the
moving party as identified in the Notice of Motion is only Defendant 1970;
however, it seeks to set aside the defaults against both 1970 and BI
Properties, Inc.  Setting aside the issue
of 1970’s ability to seek an order setting aside default taken against 1970
when 1970 has no counsel in this case, 1970 has no standing whatsoever to seek
the setting aside of the entry of default against another party, namely BI
Properties, Inc.  As such, the Court will
not consider the Motion insofar as it purports to address the entry of default
against BI Properties, Inc.
 
DISCUSSION
            The Court notes that counsel for the
moving Defendants was relieved on December 18, 2024 (12/18/24 Minute Order). “A
corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria
persona or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa
Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99
Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.) Accordingly, the Court is precluded from hearing
this Motion at this time. 
 
            Unless Defendant 1970 files a notice
of retention of an attorney before the hearing on the Motion, the Motion will
be DENIED.  If Defendant 1970 retains an
attorney before the hearing, the Court will continue the hearing to allow it to
be heard substantively.
 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
