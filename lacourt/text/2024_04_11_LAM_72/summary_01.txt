And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment, ruling that there are triable issues of fact as to whether Artiaga's use of deadly force was reasonable. The court found that there is no clear evidence that Escobedo had a gun in his right hand, and that Artiaga's approach to Escobedo while he was lying on the ground and asleep was contrary to LAPD training. The court also found that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether Escobedo ever pointed a gun in Artiaga's direction. The court concluded that the defendants are not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the battery claim.
