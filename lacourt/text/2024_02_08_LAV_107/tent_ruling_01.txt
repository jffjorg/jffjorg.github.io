COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: Motion to be Relieved
  as Counsel
                  



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING:
 
Counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel is GRANTED.  
 
 
FACTUAL
BACKGROUND
 
On January 9, 2023, Plaintiff Rita Zetino filed this motor vehicle
negligence action against Defendant Davit Andreasyan. 
 
On January 8, 2024, Joshua Zokaeem, Esq, counsel for Plaintiff Rita Zetino,
filed the instant motion to be relieved as counsel. The motion is unopposed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
California Rule of Court rule 3.1362 (Motion to
Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed
to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and
without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship
why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration
on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)).
 
The motion satisfies the procedural
requirements. The notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order
are on the appropriate Judicial Council forms and addressed to the client. (CRC,
rule 3.1362(a), (c), (e).) The proof of service indicates service on the client
and all parties. Counsel represents he served the client at her last known
address. However, he was unable to confirm this address after making the
following efforts: mailing the motion papers to her last known address, return
receipt requested; calling her last known telephone number or numbers; and
commissioning the services of a private investigator. Based on these efforts,
the Court finds that counsel has satisfied the service requirements. (CRC, rule
3.1362(d).)
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to
withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no
prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of
justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) 
 
Here, counsel states that “[t]here has been a
significant breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, which has
significantly impeded counsel's ability to effectively prosecute this case and
represent Plaintiff's interest.” Further, trial in this matter is set for
September 24, 2024, thus there is no prejudice to the client from withdrawal.
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff’s counsel is ordered to serve a copy
of the order granting leave to withdraw on the client and all parties who have
appeared in the action or proceeding. Counsel will be relieved upon filing
proof of service on the client of the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel--Civil (Judicial Council form MC-053).
 
Plaintiff’s counsel is ordered to give notice of
the ruling on the motion to be relieved. Counsel for Plaintiff is ordered to file the
proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
