COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: Application
  for Writ of Possession (CCP 512.010)   
 



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The Applications for Writ of Possession are GRANTED.
 
Procedural
History
 
On November 28, 2023, Plaintiff Transport Funding, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed
this breach of contract action (the “Complaint”) against Defendants LHC
Trucking Inc. (“Buyer”) and Tigran Ghukasyan (“Ghukasyan” and, together with
Buyer, “Defendants”) relating to the sale of 3 Volvos. Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants failed to make installment payments and are in possession of the
vehicles.
 
On November 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed an application for a writ of
possession (the “Applications for Writs of Possession”) against each Defendant,
along with proposed orders for writs of possession (the “Proposed Orders”). Plaintiff
seeks a writ of possession against Defendants Buyer”) over the following
property: 
 
(1) 2021 Volvo VNL860, VIN 4V4NC9EH5MN271830 (“Truck #1”),
(2) 2021 Volvo VNL860, VIN 4V4NC9EH9EH9MN271832 (“Truck
#2)[NOTE: This VIN appears to be incorrect. All VINs in North America
are 17 digits long, but this one is 20. The correct VIN is written in Agreement
#1/Complaint Exh. “5”: 4V4NC9EH9MN271832. All of Plaintiff’s filings have this
typo, including both Applications for Writs of Possession and both Proposed
Orders], and
 
 (3) 2021 Volvo VNL860 VIN
4V4NC9EH0MN271833 (“Truck #3” and, together with Truck #1 and Truck #2, the “Collateral”
and, each, a “Truck”),
 
On January 2, 2024, Plaintiff served the Defendants by substituted service
and on January 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed proofs of such service.
 
The applications are unopposed.
 
FACTUAL
BACKGROUND
 
The following facts are drawn from the Complaint (as defined below).
 
On January 26, 2022, Buyer and Plaintiff’s assignor, Arrow Truck Sales,
Inc. (“Seller”) entered a Conditional Sale Contract (“Agreement #1”) for the
sale of two commercial trucks, Truck #1 and Truck #2, from Seller to Buyer in exchange
for 60 monthly installments of $5,594.73. Simultaneously, Ghukasyan executed a
Continuing Guaranty (“Guaranty #1”) of Buyer’s obligations under Agreement #1. The
same day, Seller assigned its rights and interest in Agreement #1, Truck #1,
and Truck #2 to Plaintiff. Plaintiff perfected its interest in Truck #1 and
Truck #2 by obtaining Certificates of Title therefor from the State of
California.
 
On March 7, 2022, Buyer and Plaintiff’s assignor, Arrow Truck Sales, Inc. (“Seller”)
entered another Conditional Sale Contract (“Agreement #2” and, together with
Agreement #1, the “Agreements”) for the sale of another commercial truck, Truck
#3, from Seller to Buyer for $185,351.22, to be paid in 54 monthly payments of
$3,432.43
commencing on April
22, 2022. (Newton Decl., ¶3, Exh. 1.) 3. Simultaneously, Ghukasyan executed a
Continuing Guaranty (“Guaranty #2” and, together with Guaranty #1, the
“Guaranties”) of Buyer’s obligations under Agreement #2. The same day, Seller
assigned its rights and interest in Agreement #2 and Truck #3 to Plaintiff.
Plaintiff perfected its interest in Truck #3 by obtaining a Certificate of
Title from the State of California. 
 
Buyer made payments to Plaintiff per the Agreements for about a year and a
half. (Id.
at ¶6.)
 
In September 2023, Buyer failed to make its monthly payment under Agreement
#2, and in October 2023, Buyer failed to make its monthly payment under
Agreement #1. Plaintiff accelerated the balances due under the Agreements as
permitted by each of the Agreements. (Id. at ¶7.)  Plaintiff has made demands to Defendants that
they deliver the Collateral to it, but Defendant has not done so. Plaintiff now
seeks to recover from Defendants possession of the Collateral, the full balances
due under the Agreements, late fees, interest at an annual rate of 18%, costs,
and attorney’s fees. There is now due, owing and unpaid from Defendant to
Plaintiff the sum of $115,675.32, including late charges of $686.48 and
interest on the principal amount at the rate of 18% per annum. (Id. at
¶8.)
 
 
Summary of
Applicable Law
 
“Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, the plaintiff
may apply pursuant to this chapter for a writ of possession by filing a written
application for the writ with the court in which the action is brought.”  (CCP § 512.010(a).)
            
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 512.010(b), the application
must be submitted under oath and include:
 
(1) A showing of the basis of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff
is entitled to possession of the property claimed. If the basis of the
plaintiff's claim is a written instrument, a copy of the instrument shall be
attached.
 
(2) A showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, of
the manner in which the defendant came into possession of the property, and,
according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of
the reason for the detention.
 
(3) A particular description of the property and a statement of its value.
 
(4) A statement, according to the best knowledge, information, and belief
of the plaintiff, of the location of the property and, if the property, or some
part of it, is within a private place which may have to be entered to take
possession, a showing that there is probable cause to believe that such
property is located there.
 
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute; or seized under an execution against the
property of the plaintiff; or, if so seized, that it is by statute exempt from
such seizure.
 
Before the hearing on the Writ of Possession, the Defendant must be served
with (1) a copy of the summons and complaint; (2) a Notice of Application and
Hearing; and (3) a copy of the application and any affidavit in support
thereof.  (CCP § 512.030.)
 
“The writ will be issued if the court finds that the plaintiff's claim is
probably valid and the other requirements for issuing the writ are
established.”  (CCP § 512.040(b).)  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  (CCP §
511.090.)  
 
Prior to the issuance of a writ of possession, the Plaintiff must file an
undertaking “in an amount not less than twice the value of the defendant's
interest in the property or in a greater amount.”  (CCP § 515.010(a).)  
 
Analysis


1.         Notice
 
Notice appears proper.  
 
2.         Basis of Plaintiff’s
Claim
 
Plaintiff seeks a writ of possession based on its claims for (1) breach of
written agreement, (2) claim & delivery, (3) conversion, (4) goods sold and
delivered, and (5) breach of guaranty. 
 
Plaintiff attaches copies of the Agreements and the Guaranties. Each
Agreement includes a provision that, in the event of a default, which includes
a failure by Byer to “pay when due any amount owed by it to [Plaintiff],” Plaintiff
may exercise its “right to require Buyer to assemble the Collateral and deliver
it  to [Plaintiff] at a place to be
designated by [Plaintiff] which is reasonably convenient to [Plaintiff], and to
lawfully enter any premises where the Collateral may be without judicial
process and take possession thereof.” (Newton Decl. Exh. “1” ¶¶ F(a),
G(v), Exh. “5” ¶¶ F(a), G(v).)
 
3.         Wrongful Detention
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 512.010(b)(2), the application
must include “a showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the
defendant, of the manner in which the defendant came into possession of the
property, and, according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the
plaintiff, of the reason for the detention.”
 
Buyer entered, and Ghukasyan guaranteed, the Agreements, giving Plaintiff
the right to immediate possession of the Collateral upon default. (Newton Decl.
¶¶ 3, 10, 13, 20, Exh. “1” ¶¶ G(v), Exh. “5” ¶¶ G(v).) Per the
Agreements, Defendants took immediate possession of the Collateral. (Newton
Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5, 13, 15.) Defendants subsequently defaulted. (Newton Decl.
¶¶ 6, 16.) Defendants refused to return the Collateral per the Agreements.
(Newton Decl. ¶ 25.)
 
4.         Description and Value of
Property
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 512.010(b)(3), the application
must include a particular description of the property and a statement of its
value.
 
The application particularly describes the Collateral by make, model, and
VIN, and states the value of each Truck per the JD Power Guide. (Newton Decl.
¶¶ 28–31.) We note, however, that the VIN for Truck #1 is incorrectly
written on Plaintiff’s filings, including on both Applications for Writs of
Possession and on both Proposed Orders.
 
5.         Statutory Statements
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 512.010(b)(4)-(5), the
application must include: 
 
(4) A statement, according to the best knowledge, information, and belief
of the plaintiff, of the location of the property and, if the property, or some
part of it, is within a private place which may have to be entered to take
possession, a showing that there is probable cause to believe that such
property is located there.
 
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute; or seized under an execution against the
property of the plaintiff; or, if so seized, that it is by statute exempt from
such seizure.
 
Plaintiff specifically states the addresses of two locations where it
believes the Collateral is located. (Newton Decl. ¶ 23.) Both locations
appear to be private real property, but Plaintiff does not make any showing of
its belief that the Collateral is located there.
 
The Collateral is not being seized pursuant to statute or under execution.
(Newton Decl. ¶ 26.) 
 
6. Undertaking
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 515.010 requires an undertaking to be filed
before the writ issues in the amount of “not less than twice the value of the
defendant’s interest in the property.” 
 
Since the balance owed under the Agreements ($298,839.64, being the sum of $183,164.32
owed under Agreement #1 and $115,675.32 owed under Agreement #2) is greater
than the value of the Collateral ($222,000.00, being the product of three
Trucks at $74,000.00 each), Defendants have no interest in the Collateral. (Newton
Decl. ¶¶ 8, 18, 29, 31.) Therefore, no undertaking is required to be
posted by Plaintiffs.
 
Conclusion
 
The Applications for Writ of Possession are GRANTED.
