v. Sooferi
22STCV09370
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Deposition
 
Tentative
 
The
motion is denied.
 
Background 
 
On March 16, 2022, Plaintiff Jacquith Embray
(“Plaintiff”) filed the complaint in this action, asserting one cause of action
for professional negligence against Pedram Sooferi, D.D.S. (as an individual
and dba LA Smiles Dentistry), Sean Sooferian, D.D.S., and Does 1 through 50,
based on events occurring during a visit to Defendants’ dental office on March
18, 2021. 
 
Defendant Sooferian filed an answer on September 7, 2023.

 
Defendant Sooferi and Sooferi and Sooferi, APC dba LA
Smiles Dentistry (erroneously sued as Pedram Sooferi, D.D.S. dba LA Smiles
Dentistry) filed their answer on September 19, 2024. 
 
On
December 6, 2024, Defendant Sooferi (“Defendant”) filed this motion to compel
Plaintiff to attend, produce documents, and testify at deposition. Defendant also
seeks monetary sanctions. 
 
On
December 10, 2024, Defendant Sooferian filed a notice indicating that he joins
in the motion (but not the request for sanctions). 
 
No
opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal
Standard 
“Any
party may obtain discovery . . . by taking in California the oral deposition of
any person, including any party to the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.)
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served. A deposition must be “scheduled for at least 10 days after
service of the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.270, subd. (a).) 
“The
service of a deposition notice under Section 2025.240 is effective to require
any deponent who is a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party to attend and to testify, as well as produce any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection
and copying.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).) 
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280. 
“If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action . . . without having served a valid
objection . . . fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to
produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b).) 
If a
motion under Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(a) is granted “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction . . . in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and
against the deponent or party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d),
defines “[m]issues of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond
to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010, subd. (d).) Where a party or attorney has engaged in the misuse of
the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount
of the “reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
Discussion               
 
In September 2023, Defendant noticed
Plaintiff’s deposition for February 28, 2024. 
(Hertzog Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh. A.) 
On February 13, 2024, Defendant advised Plaintiff that the deposition
would need to be rescheduled and requested available dates.  (Id., ¶ 5.) 
The deposition was subsequently noticed for June 13, 2024, but Plaintiff
requested a continuance.  (Id., ¶¶ 6-7
& Exhs. C-D.)  
 
On October 22 and November 12, 14, and 22, 2024,
Defendant inquired by email about dates for Plaintiff’s deposition.  (Id., ¶¶ 8-11 & Exhs. E-H.)  Plaintiff did not provide any dates.  (Id., ¶ 12.)
 
Defendant is certainly entitled to take the deposition of
Plaintiff.  To obtain a court order
compelling the deposition, however, Defendant must meet certain procedural
requirements, including showing that Defendant properly noticed the deposition
and that Plaintiff failed to object or appear. 
Defendant has not made that showing. 
Rather, Defendant noticed the deposition for February 28, 2024, and then
took the deposition off calendar at Defendant’s own request.  Defendant subsequently noticed the deposition
for June 13, 2024, but took the deposition off calendar at Plaintiff’s
request.  There is no evidence in the
record that Plaintiff failed to appear for a properly noticed deposition.
 
The Court understands that Defendant was attempting to
schedule the deposition, particularly in October and November 2024, and
Plaintiff was nonresponsive.  That is
inappropriate conduct by Plaintiff.  But frustration
with opposing counsel’s failure to respond does not excuse Defendant from
satisfying the requirements to obtain a court order – which, here, includes evidence
of a properly noticed motion and a failure to object or appear.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450.)  On this record, that evidence is missing.
 
Conclusion 
The Court DENIES Defendant's motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff. 

Moving party is ordered
to give notice.
