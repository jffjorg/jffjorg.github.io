Background
On September 26, 2022, Dehnys Valenzuela

being attacked by other attendees of an event at Sofi Stadium on August 20,

On April 28, 2023, StadCo LA, LLC and
Hollywood Park Management Company, LLC filed an answer.

Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration on December 4, 2024. However, no proposed order
on form MC-053 was filed in accordance with California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e). 
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE due to improper procedure. 
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
Moving counsel
is ordered to give notice.
