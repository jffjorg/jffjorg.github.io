Specified in Defendant’s Requests for Admission (Set One).
Tentative
The motion is GRANTED.
Background
On November 22, 2023, Tony Surphman
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Selma Vine Hollywood LLC (“Defendant”),
Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action for negligence,
statutory liability – dog bite statute, strict liability, and premises
liability arising out of an incident occurring on August 29, 2023. 
On December 29, 2023, Defendant filed an
answer and filed a cross-complaint against Ashley Leon and Roes 1 through10. 
On January 2, 2024, Plaintiff amended the
complaint to name Ashley Leon as Jane Doe 1.
On May 1, 2024, Plaintiff amended the
complaint to name Robert Altamirano as Doe 1. 
Defendant amended the cross-complaint to name Robert Altamirano as Roe 1
on May 13, 2024.
On July 23, 2024, Plaintiff amended the
complaint to name Camden Development, Inc as Doe 2. Camden Development, Inc.
filed an answer on August 8, 2024.
On September 26, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel
was relieved.
On December 6, 2024, Defendant filed this
motion for an order deeming Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters
specified in Defendant’s Requests for Admission (Set One).  Defendant also seeks sanctions.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On October 10, 2024, Defendant served
Plaintiff with Requests for Admission (Set One).  (Mintie Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. 1.) No
responses were served.  (Id., ¶ 6.)  
 
Defendant need show nothing more.
 
The motion is granted.
 
The request for sanctions is also
granted in part.  Based on the relatively
straightforward nature of this motion, the Court sets sanctions in the amount
of $810, calculated based on two hours of attorney time, multiplied by counsel’s
reasonable billing rate of $375 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee. (See Mintie
Decl., ¶ 10.)
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion
for a deemed-admitted order.
 
The Court ORDERS that Plaintiff Tony
Surphman IS DEEMED TO HAVE ADMITTED THE TRUTH of the matters specified in Requests
for Admission (Set One) propounded by 
Defendant Selma & Vine Hollywood,
LLC. 
 
The Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant’s
request for sanctions.
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to pay
monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act to Defendant (through counsel)
in the amount of $810 within 30 days of notice.
 
The Court ORDERS Moving Party to give
notice.
