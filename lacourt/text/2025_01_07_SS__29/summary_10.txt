And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial date by approximately 30 days. The judge finds that there has been a substantial change in the case due to the plaintiff's medical procedure in October 2024, which requires additional discovery. The judge is concerned about the diligence of the defendants, who appeared in the case in January 2024 but did not complete discovery until recently. Despite this, the judge finds good cause to grant the motion in part and continue the trial date. The judge resets the final status conference and all discovery deadlines based on the new trial date.
