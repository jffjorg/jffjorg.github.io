Plaza Apartments
21STCV40994
Plaintiff’s Motion for Order Deeming Defendants to Have Admitted the Truth of
the Matters Specified in Request for Admissions (Set One).
Tentative
The motion for deemed-admitted orders is
granted in part and denied in part.
The request for sanctions is granted in part
and denied in part.
Background
On November 8, 2021, Michele Edison
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Burton Plaza Apartments, LLC, Statewide
Enterprises, Inc., Arturo Serna, Serna Maintenance, and Does 1 through 50,
asserting causes of action for premises liability and general negligence arising
out of an alleged slip and fall on May 20, 2020.
On December 28, 2021, Burton Plaza
Apartments, LLC and Statewide Enterprises, Inc. filed an answer and
cross-complaint against Arturo Serna and Serna Maintenance. The cross-complaint
was dismissed on April 18, 2022.
On April 6, 2022, Arturo Serna and Serna
Maintenance filed an answer to Plaintiff’s complaint.
On December 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed
this motion for an order deeming Defendants Burton
Plaza Apartments, LLC, Statewide Enterprises, Inc., Arturo Serna, and Serna
Maintenance (collectively, “Defendants”) to have
admitted the truth of the matters specified in Plaintiff’s Request for
Admissions (Set One).  Defendants filed
an opposition on December 23, , and Plaintiff filed a reply on December 27.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On November 7, 2024, Plaintiff served
each of the Defendants with Request for Admissions (Set One). (Ahn Decl., ¶ 4
& Exh. 1.)
 
Prior to the filing of the motion on
December 12, 2024, none of the defendants responded.  (Ahn Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
On December 23, 2024, one of the
defendants – Burton Plaza Apartments, LLC – served verified responses.  (Ahn Supp. Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. 1.)  The Court has reviewed these responses and
finds (notwithstanding Plaintiff’s argument to the contrary in the reply) that
they are in substantial compliance with Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.220.
 
Accordingly, the motion for a
deemed admitted order against Defendant
Burton Plaza Apartments, LLC, is denied.
 
There is no indication in the record
that any of the other defendants have served responses to the requests for
admission.  According, the motion for a
deemed admitted order against Defendants Statewide Enterprises, Inc., Arturo
Serna, and Serna Maintenance is granted.
 
In their opposition, Defendants
complain that Plaintiff failed to meet and confer prior to filing this motion,
but (in contrast to many other provisions of the Civil Discovery Act) there is
no meet-and-confer requirement prior to filing a motion for a deemed-admitted
order under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280.
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
is also granted.  The Court finds that the
failure of Defendants to serve timely responses to the requests for admission
necessitated this motion.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  The
Court sets sanctions in the amount of $1,111.65, based on three hours of
attorney time, multiplied by a reasonable billing rate of $350 per hour for
work on this nature, plus a filing fee of $61.65.  (See Ahn Decl., ¶¶ 7-8.)
 
As the notice of motion does not
specifically identify that sanctions are sought against Defendants’ counsel,
the sanctions are awarded against Defendants (jointly and severally).
 
Finally, the Court notes that Plaintiff filed only one motion
for what should have been four separate motions.  Combining discovery motions allows the moving
party to avoid paying the requisite filing fees. Filing fees are jurisdictional
and it is mandatory for court clerks to demand and receive them. (See Duran
v. St. Luke’s Hospital (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 457, 460.) Thus, Plaintiff is
ordered to pay the additional three filing fees. This ruling will be final and
effective only upon filing of a proof of payment of the three additional filing
fees.

The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion

Plaza Apartments, LLC.
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for a deemed-admitted
order as against Defendants Statewide Enterprises, Inc., Arturo Serna, and Serna

Plaza Apartments, LLC, Statewide Enterprises, Inc., Arturo Serna, and Serna
Maintenance, jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions to Plaintiff
(through counsel) under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of $1,111.65 within 30 days of notice.
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to pay
three additional filing fees to the Clerk of the Court and to file and serve
proof of payment by no later than January 21, 2025.  The granting of the requests for deemed-admitted
orders and for an award of sanctions, as set forth herein, is expressly
conditioned on the payment of the filing fees and the filing and service of
proof of payment.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give
notice.
