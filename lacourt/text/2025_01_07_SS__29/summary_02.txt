And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the plaintiff, James Matters, to set aside a dismissal of the case. The plaintiff originally filed a complaint on August 2, 2021, but failed to appear at the Final Status Conference or Trial, and the case was dismissed without prejudice on January 30, 2023. The plaintiff then filed a motion to set aside the dismissal, which was granted and set for a trial setting conference and order to show cause (OSC). However, the plaintiff failed to appear at the OSC and the case was dismissed again without prejudice. The plaintiff has now filed a second motion to set aside the dismissal, which the judge is considering.

The judge notes that the plaintiff's counsel submitted a declaration stating that the failure to appear was due to severe medical issues, and that counsel has recovered and is able to resume representation of the plaintiff. The judge finds that the motion is granted and sets aside the dismissal dated September 13, 2024. The judge also sets an OSC to show cause why monetary sanctions of up to $500 should not be imposed on the plaintiff and/or his counsel for failure to comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.110(g). The hearing on the OSC is set for approximately 45 days, and any response must be in writing and filed at least 5 days prior to the hearing.
