And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff. The Defendant's motion was filed on December 6, 2024, seeking to compel the deposition of Plaintiff and requesting monetary sanctions. The Plaintiff did not oppose the motion. The Judge found that the Defendant did not meet the procedural requirements to obtain a court order compelling the deposition, including showing that the deposition was properly noticed and that the Plaintiff failed to object or appear. The Judge noted that the Plaintiff was nonresponsive to the Defendant's attempts to schedule the deposition, but this was not sufficient to excuse the Defendant's failure to satisfy the requirements for a court order. The Judge ordered the Defendant to give notice of the ruling.
