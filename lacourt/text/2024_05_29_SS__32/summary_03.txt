And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court grants in part the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set Two, numbers 16.2 to 16.6. The Court finds that Defendant's initial and supplemental responses are not supported by specific facts and do not identify a specific person with personal knowledge of the fact. The Court also denies the motion to compel further responses to numbers 16.9 and 16.10, finding that the information is equally available. The Court declines to award monetary sanctions to either party.
