And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the judge's thoughts on the case before the hearing. The judge notes that the default entered on August 19, 2021, is still valid and that the defendant, Fermin Antonio Mazariego Jr., has not moved to set aside the default. The defendant's motion for leave to file an answer is denied because the defendant is currently in default and has no right to file pleadings or motions, other than to set aside the default under Code of Civil Procedure section 473. The judge concludes that the defendant does not have the right to file an answer and therefore denies the defendant's motion.
