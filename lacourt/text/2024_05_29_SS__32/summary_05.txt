And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition filed by Petitioner Darien Koop on behalf of Claimant Rose Koop, a 3-year-old child. The court denies the petition without prejudice for several reasons. First, Petitioner failed to attach exhibits to the petition and label them according to the attachment numbers assigned in the petition. Second, Petitioner did not provide updated medical records or other evidence showing Claimant's current condition and prognosis. Third, Petitioner did not provide detailed information on the settlement terms. Fourth, Petitioner's expense claims are inconsistent, and some expenses may be medical payments in the form of co-payments. The court finds Petitioner's request for $15,000 in attorney fees to be reasonable. The court orders Petitioner to provide updated medical records and settlement terms and to complete missing information.
