Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' motions to compel responses to their requests for production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories. The plaintiff, Jose Estrada, failed to serve timely responses to these requests, despite being served on November 16, 2023, with an extension until January 30, 2024. As a result, the court has ordered the plaintiff to provide verified responses without objection within 10 days. The court did not award monetary sanctions, as requested by the defendants.
