And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to relieve counselor, Khashayar Eshraghi, from representing Plaintiff Ryan Caldwell. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. However, the court finds that relieving counsel would likely prejudice the Plaintiff's rights, particularly given the proximity to the trial date. Additionally, Counsel failed to take reasonable steps to avoid prejudice to the Plaintiff's rights and was unable to confirm the Plaintiff's address. The proposed order lacked Plaintiff's full zip code and judicial officer information. Therefore, the court denies the motion and requires Counsel to provide notice of the ruling and file proof of service.
