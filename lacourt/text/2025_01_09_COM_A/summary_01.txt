And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the plaintiff's motion to determine the fair market value of the property located at 11579 Virginia Avenue, Lynwood, California and send a buyout notice to all parties. The plaintiff, Steen Sprouffske, moved for the court to determine the property's value and send a buyout notice based on an appraisal conducted by Certified Residential Appraiser Chauncey Sylvester. The judge found that the parties were unable to agree on the property's value or a method of valuation and that there was no evidence demonstrating that the cost of a court-ordered appraisal would outweigh its evidentiary value. Additionally, the prior appraisal was almost one year old and the real estate market had fluctuated significantly since then. Therefore, the judge concluded that a court-ordered appraisal would be of substantial evidentiary value and denied the plaintiff's motion.
