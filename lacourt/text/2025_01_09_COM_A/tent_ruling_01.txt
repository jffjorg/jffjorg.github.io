RESPONDING PARTY:     None
1.    
Motion
to Determine Value and Send Buyout Notice
The court considered the moving papers and supporting
declarations filed in connection with this motion. No opposition was filed.
2.     Discussion
Plaintiff Steen Sprouffske (“Plaintiff”) moves
for the court to determine the fair market value of the property located at 11579
Virgina Avenue, Lynwood, California 90262 (the “Property”) and send a buyout
notice to all parties. Plaintiff’s motion is based on an appraisal of the
Property’s fair market value conducted by Certified Residential Appraiser
Chauncey Sylvester.
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 874.316,
the court shall determine the fair market value of a property by ordering an
appraisal by a court-appointed disinterested appraiser licensed by the State of
California, unless all cotenants have agreed to the value of the property or to
another method of valuation or the court determines that the evidentiary value
of an appraisal is outweighed by the cost of the appraisal.
Here, the parties have been unable to come to
an agreement as to the value of the property or a method of valuation. There is
no evidence demonstrating the second element required to permit the court to
determine fair market value, which is that “the evidentiary value of an
appraisal is outweighed by the cost of the appraisal.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§874.316 subd. (c).) There is no evidence of the cost of an appraisal.
Furthermore, although Plaintiff has submitted
the appraisal of a licensed appraiser, the appraisal occurred on April 22,
2024, almost one year ago. Because of the age of the prior appraisal, the
fluctuation in the real estate market over the past year, and the greatness of the
purported value of the property reflected in the April 22, 2024 appraisal, the
court finds a court-ordered appraisal is likely of substantial evidentiary
value.
Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to establish
why a court-ordered appraisal would be cost-prohibitive.
3.    
Conclusion

Based on the
foregoing, the court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion to determine value and send
buyout notice.
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice. 
DATED: January 9, 2025
