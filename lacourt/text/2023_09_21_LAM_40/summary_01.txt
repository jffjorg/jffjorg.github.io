And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The motion was brought by Vassal Benford, Ronald M. Lebow, and TBC Group, LLC, who are seeking to compel arbitration of the plaintiffs' claims and stay the proceedings in this court. The judge found that an arbitration agreement exists between the parties, and that the defendants have standing to invoke the arbitration clause. The judge also found that the arbitration clause is valid and enforceable, and that the parties have agreed to submit their disputes to arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association.

The judge ordered the parties to proceed with arbitration, with the arbitrator having the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. The judge also ordered that the stay of proceedings in this court will remain in effect until a final outcome is reached in the arbitration or until the court otherwise specifies.

The judge noted that the stay does not apply to claims against Defendant The Benford Company, which was not a party to this motion.
