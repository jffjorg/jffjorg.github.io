 Case Number:  21STCV33200    Hearing Date:   October 23, 2023    Dept:  52 Defendant Crown Building
Maintenance Co. dba Able Building Maintenance’s Motion for Summary Judgment or,
in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication
            Defendant
Crown Building Maintenance Co. dba Able Building Maintenance (Crown) moves for
summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication of each cause of
action alleged against it by plaintiff Ugo O. Asobie.
Legal Standard
Summary judgment
should be granted where no triable issues of fact exist and the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
(CCP § 437c(c); Villa v. McFerren
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 741.)  Courts
use a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings;
(2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent’s claims; and
(3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a
triable, material factual issue.”  (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005)
135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)  Courts consider
the evidence “in the light most favorable to the opposing party.”  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield
Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  
Summary of Allegations
Plaintiff Ugo O. Asobie leases an office at 3550
Wilshire Boulevard in an office complex known as Paramount Plaza.  He alleges that, between 2019 to 2022, many people
at the plaza discriminated against him based on his race in numerous ways.  For example, he alleges people broke into his
car, “[a]rrang[ed] for a robber to steal Plaintiff’s cell phone, from his
pocket,” “chang[e]d the combination to Plaintiff’s brief case to read 800911,”
and used “racially harassing black garbage liners on plaintiff’s trash can
while they used transparent liners for other tenants.”  (4AC, ¶ 49.)
            The
operative fourth amended complaint alleges Crown Building Maintenance Co. was
contracted by Paramount Plaza, LLC to perform janitorial services at 3550
Wilshire Boulevard.  (4AC, ¶ 3.)  Plaintiff alleges “Does No. 21 to 40 were
janitors that were employed by” Crown “to provide janitorial services at
Paramount Plaza.”  (Id., ¶ 38.)  He further alleges, “between 2019 and 2022,
DEFENDANTS, Does Nos 21 to 40, used their position as janitors in 3550/3580 Wilshire
Blvd., to direct the very serious and pervasive racial/national
origin/color/ancestry discrimination and harassment, that is specified in
paragraph 49, at PLAINTIFF.”  (Id.,
¶ 48.)  
Analysis
            Defendant
Crown Building Maintenance Co. meets its initial burden of showing plaintiff
cannot prove any of his causes of action against it.  Crown negates all causes of action against it
via evidence that it was not involved in any of the events plaintiff alleges
happened to him at Paramount Plaza. 
Crown submitted the declaration of April Chau, the company’s
Controller.  (Schwarz Decl., Ex. B, Chau
Decl., ¶ 1.)  Chau testifies she
“reviewed” Crown’s “billing history,” and Crown “did not provide any services
whatsoever at 3550/3580 Wilshire Boulevard … at any time after April of
2014.”  (Id., ¶ 4.)  “The last time [Crown] billed for any work at
the Property was April of 2014.”  (Id.,
¶ 5.)
            Plaintiff
does not meet his burden of providing admissible evidence to demonstrate any
triable issue of material fact.  He
attempts to do so in three ways.  
First, plaintiff splits hairs over Crown’s use of
the shortened name “ABLE” in its papers instead of using its full name, Crown
Building Maintenance Co. doing business as Able Building Maintenance.  (Opp. Separate Statement, Nos. 1-3, 7, 8.)  Crown’s use of the shortened name “ABLE” does
not undermine any of its evidence.  Crown’s
notice of this motion states, “Defendant CROWN BUILDING MAINTENANCE CO. dba
ABLE BUILDING MAINTENANCE (‘ABLE or Defendant’) will” move for summary judgment
or adjudication.  
Similarly, plaintiff presents evidence that Crown’s
counsel filed a demurrer and motion to strike portions of plaintiff’s first
amended complaint on behalf of “defendant Crown Energy Services, Inc. dble Able
Engineering Services.”  (Asobie Dec.,
Exs. A, B.)  That is not evidence that Crown
provided janitorial services or otherwise had anything to do with the events
plaintiff alleges occurred at Paramount Plaza from 2019 to 2022.   
Second, plaintiff relies on interrogatory responses
by defendant Paramount Plaza, LLC that state “Defendant Crown Building
Maintenance Co. handled janitorial tasks for the building at issue and would be
the party to provide this information.” 
(Asobie Decl., Ex. C, supplemental responses to Nos. 1-6, 10-12.)  Paramount Plaza, LLC,
however, amended those responses to omit any mention of Crown Building
Maintenance Co.  Plaintiff relies on
Paramount Plaza, LLC’s supplemental responses dated October 23, 2022, and
verified on October 28, 2022.  (Id.
at pp. 16-18.)  Asobie Decl., Ex. C, pp.
16-18.)  On December 28, 2022, Paramount
Plaza, LLC served amended supplemental responses stating, “ABM Facility
Services handled janitorial tasks for the building at issue and would be the
party to provide this information.” 
(Schwarz Decl., Ex. E.)  Paramount
Plaza, LLC verified those responses on January 16, 2023.  (Id., p. 23.)  
Moreover,
Paramount Plaza, LLC’s interrogatory responses are not admissible as evidence against
Crown.  Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.410 provides, “At the trial or any other hearing in the action, so far as
admissible under the rules of evidence, the propounding party or any party
other than the responding party may use any answer or part of an answer to an
interrogatory only against the responding party.”  (CCP § 2030.410; accord Great American
Ins. Cos. v. Gordon Trucking, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 445, 450 [a party
cannot use its own interrogatory responses as evidence on summary
judgment].)  Paramount Plaza, LLC was the
responding party.  These responses can
only be used against Paramount Plaza, LLC. 
They are not admissible against Crown. 

Third,
plaintiff relies on Crown’s amended response to his request for production No.
20.  (Asobie Decl., Ex. H.)  No. 20 demands, “An original or copy of any and
all DOCUMENTS that shows, or tends to show, YOUR employee that cleaned 3550
Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1905, Los Angeles, California 90010, on the following
dates: 06/24/20, 06/25/20, 07/01/20, 07/06/20 and 07/13/20.”  (Id., p. 24.)  
Crown
initially responded by objecting based on attorney work product and attorney-client
privilege, then gave the following substantive response: “Despite a diligent
search and reasonable inquiry, no documents responsive to this request are in
Responding Party’s custody, control, or possession.  [¶]  Discovery
is ongoing.  Responding Party reserves
the right to supplement or amend this response.”  (Asobie Decl., Ex. H, pp. 24-25.)
Crown’s
amended response states: “Despite a diligent search and reasonable inquiry, no
non-privileged documents responsive to this request are in Responding Party’s
custody, control, or possession, as they never existed.  Able was not the entity that cleaned at the
Property on the following dates: 06/24/20, 06/25/20, 07/01/20, 07/06/20 and 07
/13/20.  Responding Party is unable to
provide the name and address of any natural person or organization known or
believed to have possession, custody, or control of that item as it never
existed.”  (Asobie Decl., Ex. H, p.
25.)  
Plaintiff
characterizes this response as Crown “admit[ing] that there are ‘confidential
documents’ that show, or tend to show, that” it “provided janitorial services,
to the subject building, at the relevant times to this action.”  (Opp., p. 6.) 
Rather than admitting there are confidential responsive documents, the
amended response expressly affirms that “Able was not the entity that cleaned
at the Property” on those dates.  That the
initial response included objections based on attorney work product and
attorney-client privilege does not show there is a triable issue of material
fact.  Objections to discovery requests are
not evidence.  (See CCP 2031.250(a) &
(c) [a response that “contains only objections” need not be verified under oath
and must only be signed by the responding party’s attorney].)  
Plaintiff
thus presents no admissible evidence that defendant Crown Building Maintenance
Co. dba Able Building Maintenance was involved in any of the events giving rise
to this lawsuit.
Arguments
Regarding Discovery
Plaintiff
also argues the court should deny the motion because defendant “stifled the
Plaintiff’s efforts at discovery.” 
(Opp., pp. 6-7.)  Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (h) provides an exclusive method for a
party to oppose a motion for summary judgment on this basis: “If it appears
from the affidavits submitted in opposition to a motion for summary judgment or
summary adjudication, or both, that facts essential to justify opposition may
exist but cannot, for reasons stated, be presented, the court shall deny the
motion, order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or discovery to
be had, or make any other order as may be just.”  Plaintiff does not rely on subdivision (h)
and does not present any affidavit showing that facts essential to justify
opposition may exist.
Even
if section 437c(h) were not the exclusive method for opposing summary judgment
on this basis, plaintiff’s opposition mirrors arguments he made in his motion
to compel Crown to provide further responses to these requests for
production.  The court denied that motion
in its entirety on August 30, 2023.  
Disposition
            Defendant Crown Building Maintenance Co. dba Able Building Maintenance’s motion for
summary judgment is granted.
