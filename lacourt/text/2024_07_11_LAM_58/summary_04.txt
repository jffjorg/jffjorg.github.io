And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the counsel's motion to be relieved without prejudice. The counsel, Friedman & Chapman, LLP, has been representing the plaintiffs, Abigail Yaneth Lopez Tulul and others, in a habitability action against their landlord and associated entities since September 2023. The motion to be relieved is unopposed. The court notes that it has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, but this discretion should be exercised provided there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The court also notes that the counsel has not attested to verifying their client's last known address, as required by California Rules of Court 3.1362. Therefore, the motion is denied, but the counsel is given the opportunity to refile with additional information explaining their efforts to verify their client's address and why withdrawal is now warranted.
