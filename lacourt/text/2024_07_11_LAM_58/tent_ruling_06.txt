Plaintiffs Hyon
and Jinny Yi sued defendants The 400 Condominium Owners’ Association (“the
HOA”), Desiree Golembiewski (“Golembiewski”), HOA Management Professionals,
Inc., and Does 1-100 on January 10, 2024, asserting causes of action for (1)
breach of covenants, conditions, and restrictions, (2) intentional interference
with contractual relationship, (3) declaratory relief, (4) breach of fiduciary
duties, (5) violation of the Davis-Stirling Act, and (6) negligence.
 
As alleged in the
complaint and accepted as true for purposes of demurrer (with paragraph
citations to the complaint):
 
In 1995, Plaintiffs,
a husband and wife, bought the property located at 400 S. Lafayette Park Place,
Unit 109, Los Angeles 90057 (“the Unit”). (¶¶ 8-9.) The Unit is one of approximately
fifty condominiums located in the same development (“the Property”), which is
managed by the HOA. (¶ 10 and Exh. 1.) All units on the Property are bound by
the same Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictiosn (CC&Rs). (Id., ¶¶
12.) The HOA is administered according to written bylaws. (¶ 11 and Exh. 2.)
Defendant Golembiewski was, at relevant times, the HOA’s Board President. (¶
26.)
 
Around February
2021, Plaintiffs sought to rent out the Unit. (¶ 18.) Golembiewski recommended
they rent to friends of hers, a Michelle Alvarez and Salvadore Zelaya (“the Tenants”).
(¶ 19.) Plaintiffs took Golembiewski’s advice and rented to them. (¶ 21.) About
fourteen months after the Tenants executed their lease, Plaintiffs began
receiving complaints about them from the HOA. (¶ 22.) One of the Tenants
informed Plaintiffs they had personally fallen out with Golembiewski. (¶¶
26-27.) The HOA began imposing increasing fines on Plaintiffs for their
Tenants’ purported nuisance behavior. (¶¶ 28-40.) Eventually, the Board passed
a resolution to fine Plaintiffs daily until the Tenants were evicted. (Id.,
¶ 41.) Plaintiffs conferred with the Tenants, who agreed to vacate voluntarily
and did so in October 2022. (¶¶ 45-46.) Throughout this dispute, Plaintiffs
allege the HOA did not hold meetings or impose fines according to its bylaws.
(¶¶ 16, 42-43.)
 
Plaintiffs decided
to sell their Unit because they expected the HOA, led by Golembiewski, would
conduct themselves similarly toward other tenants. (¶¶ 50-51.) They hired a
real estate agent in September 2023. (¶ 51.) Golembiewski then approached the
real estate agent and falsely told the agent that Plaintiffs owe $20,000.00 in
fees that will be deducted from escrow during the Unit’s sale. (¶¶ 53-54.) The
HOA has since provided a breakdown of the fees, several of which are fabricated
(e.g., $8,500.00 for “evicting nuisance tenant” who left voluntarily; $4,500.00
in construction work never performed). (¶ 54.)
 
Plaintiffs
attempted to engage the HOA in informal dispute resolution procedures. The HOA
failed to cooperate, so Plaintiffs sued.
 
On June 4, 2024, Golembiewski
and the HOA jointly demurred to the complaint and moved to strike certain
portions from it. The HOA challenges only the second cause of action against
it; Golembiewski challenges all of them. On June 27, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
their opposition. Neither the HOA nor Golembiewski replied.
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendants’
requests for judicial notice are denied. “There
is ... a precondition to the taking of judicial notice in either its mandatory
or permissive form—any matter to be judicially noticed must be relevant to a
material issue.”  (People ex rel.
Lockyer v. Shamrock Foods Co. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 415, 422 fn. 2.) The
issuance or non-issuance of restraining orders against the Tenants has no
bearing on the sufficiency of Plaintiffs’ complaint.
 
Demurrer
 
            A demurrer is an objection to a
pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the face of the
complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also
Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the
sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of law.”  (Postley v. Harvey (1984) 153
Cal.App.3d 280, 286.)  “In the
construction of a pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its
allegations must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice
between the parties.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)  The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the
demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . ..” ’ ” (Berkley v. Dowds
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)
 
The
HOA’s Demurrer to the Second Cause of Action for Intentional Interference
 
            The HOA argues only that Plaintiffs
have not stated a claim against it for intentional interference with
contractual relations.
 
            The elements of intentional
interference are (1) a valid contract between the plaintiff and a third party,
(2) defendant’s knowledge, (3) intentional acts designed to induce breach or
disruption, (4) breach or disruption, and (5) damage. (Seaman’s Direct
Buying Service, Inc. v. Standard Oil Co. (1984) 36 Cal.3d 752, 765-766.)
 
            Here, Plaintiffs allege they had a
valid lease with their Tenants, the HOA knew about it, and the HOA fabricated
wrongdoing on the Tenants’ part to induce Plaintiffs to evict them, thereby
depriving Plaintiffs of rental income. Plaintiffs have pled all the requisite
elements of intentional interference. The HOA’s argument relies on facts
outside the four corners of the complaint, of which the Court declines to take
judicial notice.
 
            The HOA’s demurrer to the second
cause of action is overruled.
 
Golembiewski’s
Demurrer on the Basis of Uncertainty and Failure to State a Claim
 
            Golembiewski demurs, arguing that
the complaint is uncertain or fails to state a claim because on its face it
only alleges she acted in her capacity as HOA President. She relies on the rule
that a corporate director may not be held liable for the corporation’s torts
when the director did not personally participate in the torts. (See Frances
T. v. Village Green Owners’ Association (1986) 42 Cal.3d 409, 503-504.)
Plaintiff argues the inverse: that Golembiewski did personally
participate in the torts committed by the HOA, so she can be held liable even
though she is also an HOA director.
 
            The Court agrees with Defendants.
The complaint is at best unclear which actions were purportedly taken by Golembiewski
in her individual capacity and which as HOA President. The Court is not
persuaded that any of the actions in question permit individual liability to be
imposed on Golembiewski, but will permit Plaintiffs to amend their pleading to
provide more clarity.
 
            Golembiewski’s demurrer is sustained
in its entirety, with leave to amend.
 
Motion
to Strike
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 436 provides that the Court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 435, or at any time within its discretion
and upon terms it deems proper, “strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper
matter inserted in any pleading” and/or “strike out all or part of any pleading
not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or
an order of the court.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 436, subd. (a).) In passing on the
correctness of a ruling on a motion to strike, judges read allegations of a
pleading subject to a motion to strike, all parts in their context, and assume
their truth. (Clauson v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253,
1255.)
 
A
motion to strike is the procedure to attack a purportedly improper remedy such
as unjustified punitive damages. (Venice Town Council, Inc. v. City of Los
Angeles (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 1547, 1561-1562.) A complaint including a
request for punitive damages must also include allegations showing that the
plaintiff is entitled to such an award. (Clauson v. Superior Court, supra,
67 Cal.App.4th at p. 1255.) A claim for punitive damages cannot be pleaded
generally and allegations that a defendant acted “with oppression, fraud and
malice” toward plaintiff are insufficient legal conclusions to show that the
plaintiff is entitled to an award of punitive damages. (Brousseau v. Jarrett
(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 864, 872.) Specific factual allegations are required to
support a claim for punitive damages. (Ibid.)
 
            Here, there are no specific factual
allegations in the complaint that permit an inference of fraud, malice, or
oppression. The complaint depicts a straightforward dispute over CC&Rs,
perhaps improperly influenced by the personal biases of an HOA director. But
that is not sufficient to satisfy Civil Code section 3294, which requires
despicable conduct (Civ. Code, § 3294(c)(1)-(2)), intentional conduct
intended to cause injury (id., subd. (c)(1)), or intentional fraud (id.,
subd. (c)(3)).
 
            The motion to strike is granted with
leave to amend.
