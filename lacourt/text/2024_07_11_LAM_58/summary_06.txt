Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled on the demurrers filed by the defendants, The 400 Condominium Owners' Association and Desiree Golembiewski, to the complaint filed by Hyon Yi and Jinny Yi. The judge has overruled the HOA's demurrer to the second cause of action for intentional interference with contractual relations, finding that the complaint adequately states a claim. The judge has sustained Golembiewski's demurrer to the entire complaint, finding that the complaint is uncertain and fails to state a claim, and has given the plaintiffs 30 days to amend their pleading to provide more clarity. The judge has also granted the motion to strike the complaint's request for punitive damages, finding that the complaint does not contain sufficient factual allegations to support an award of punitive damages.
