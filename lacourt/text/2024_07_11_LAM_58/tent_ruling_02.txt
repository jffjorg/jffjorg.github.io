I.              
 Background
 
Plaintiff Gary R. Belz, as
representative for the benefit of himself and Gary Belz Family LP
(collectively, “Lender”) provided a single credit facility of $4,550,000
evidenced by a Promissory Note (the “Note”) executed by Defendant Cyber 1 LLC
(“Cyber 1”).  The Note was personally
guaranteed by Defendants Norman Kravetz and Douglas Jacobsen.  It is undisputed that Cyber 1 failed to make a
principal payment amount on February 1, 2023 in the amount of $450,000.  Cyber 1 has also failed to pay three months
of interest on the Note.  Under the Note,
Lender is entitled to the entirety of the remaining principal balance, plus
interest and attorney’s fees.  
 
On April 26, 2023, Lender filed a
complaint against Defendants Cyber 1, Kravetz and Jacobsen alleging (1) breach
of contract – Note; (2) breach of contract – Personal Guarantees; and (3)
declaratory relief.  
 
II.           
Evidentiary Objections
 
            Defendants’
Objection to paragraph 4 of the Gurvitz Declaration is overruled. (Evid. Code,
§§1221 and 1222.)  
 
III.         
Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice 
 
            Defendants’
RJN of the White House announcement passing HR Bill 2617 on December 29, 2022
and HR Bill 2882 on March 23, 2024 is granted pursuant to Evidence Code section
452, subdivision (c)(“official acts of the…executive…departments of the United
States…”).  
 
IV.         
Discussion
 
A.     Legal Standard
 
            “A
plaintiff or cross-complainant has met his or her burden of showing that there
is no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action. Once
the plaintiff or cross-complainant has met that burden, the burden shifts to
the defendant or cross-defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code
Civ. Proc., §437c, subd. (p)(1).)
 
            “A party
is entitled to summary judgment only if it meets its initial burden of showing
there are no triable issues of fact and the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. This is true even if the opposing party fails to
file any opposition.  The court's
assessment of whether the moving party has carried its burden—and therefore
caused a shift—occurs before the court's evaluation of the opposing party's
papers.  Therefore, the burden on the
motion does not initially shift as a result of what is, or is not, contained in
the opposing papers.”  (Mosley v.
Pacific Specialty Insurance Company (2020) 49 Cal.App.5th 417, 434–435
(landlord’s failure to address issue of whether they were aware of their
tenant’s marijuana growing operation was not grounds to grant summary judgment
where moving party failed to satisfy its initial burden as to the issue); Thatcher
v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1086-1087 (court cannot
grant summary judgment based merely on lack of opposition; court must first
determine if the moving party has satisfied its burden).   
 
            In
addition, the evidence and affidavits of the moving party are construed
strictly, while those of the opponent are liberally read.  (Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Sup. Ct.
(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 95, 100.)  “All
doubts as to the propriety of granting the motion (whether there is any issue
of material fact [Code of Civil Procedure] § 437c) are to be resolved in favor
of the party opposing the motion (i.e., a denial of summary judgment).”  (Hamburg v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 497, 502.)  
 
B.     No triable issues of fact remain as to the 1st
cause of action for breach of contract and 2nd cause of action for
breach of personal guarantees
 
            Lender
moves for summary judgment of its entire complaint.  Lender alleges three causes of action for
breach of contract based on three separate agreements:  (1) the Note with Cyber 1; (2) the personal
guaranty of the Note executed by Kravetz; and (3) the personal guaranty of the
Note executed by Belz.  
 
            To prevail
on Lender’s claims for breach of the Note against Cyber 1 Lender must
establish:  (1) existence of the
contract; (2) Lender's performance; (3) Cyber 1’s breach; and (4) damages.  (First Commercial Mortgage Co. v. Recce
(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 731, 745.)  
 
To prevail on Lender’s claims for
breach of Kravetz’s and Jacobsen’s personal guarantees, Lender need only
establish that (1) Kravetz and Jacobsen executed an agreement assuming
liability for Cyber 1’s debt under the Note; (2) Cyber 1, the principal debtor,
defaulted on its underlying obligations; and (3) Kravetz and Jacobsen breached their
obligation to pay upon default of the Cyber 1. 
(Civ. Code, §2807; R.P. Richards, Inc. v. Chartered Const. Corp.
(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 146, 154.)
 
Lender establishes that Cyber 1
executed a Promissory Note on February 15, 2022 whereby Cyber 1 borrowed
$4,550,000 from Lender subject to certain explicit repayment obligations.  (Plaintiff’s SSUMF No.1; Belz Dec., ¶2, Ex. 1.)  Lender provided the credit facility as
reflected in the Note.  (Belz Dec.,
¶2.)  Lender establishes that under the
Note, Cyber 1 was required to pay the principal balance of $4,550,000 in four
annual installments:  (1) $450,000 on
February 1, 2023; (2) $600,000 on February 1, 2024; (3) $1,000,000 on February
1, 2025; and (4) the remaining principal balance on February 1, 2026.  (Plaintiff’s SSUMF No. 2; Belz Dec., Ex. 1, ¶1.)  
 
On February 15, 2022, Kravetz and Jacobsen
also executed separate personal guarantees guaranteeing the Note.  (Plaintiff’s SSUMF Nos. 9 and 10; Belz Dec.,
Exs. 2 and 3.)  Under their guarantees,
Kravetz and Jacobsen promised to pay all principal and interest whenever it
became due, including any accelerated balance, upon Cyber 1’s failure to
pay.  (Plaintiff’s SSUMF No. 12; Bezl
Dec., Exs. 2-3, Section 1.)  In addition,
Kravetz and Jacobsen pledged 7.5% each of their outstanding membership
interests in Equity Orchestration LLC as collateral for the guarantees.  (Plaintiff’s SSUMF No. 14, Ex. 4, Section
1.)  
 
Cyber 1 failed to make the first
payment due under the Note in the amount of $450,000 on or before February 1,
2023.  (Plaintiff’s SSUMF No. 16; Belz
Dec., ¶4.)  Cyber 1 failed to tender any
interest payments from February 2023 to the present.  (Plaintiff’s SSUMF No. 18.; Belz Dec., ¶¶6,
9.)  On March 21, 2023, Lender sent
notice to Defendants of Cyber 1’s breach of its obligation to pay the first
installment by February 1, 2023 in the amount of $450,000.  (Plaintiff’s SSUMF No. 21, Gurvitz Dec., Ex.
5 (Lender’s March 21, 2023 Written Notice).) 
On April 3, 2023, Defendants informed Lender that they could not make
the required payments and cure their breach. 
(Plaintiff’s SSUMF No. 22; Gurvitz Dec., ¶4.)  Kravetz and Jacobsen have also refused to
tender the collateral as required by the Pledge Agreement in support of their
personal guarantees.  (Plaintiff’s SSUMF
No. 23; Belz Dec., ¶10.)  
 
Plaintiff submits evidence that the
full amount of the Note ($4,550,000) is due. 
Plaintiff also submits evidence that there is currently $333,666.77 due
in interest.  (Plaintiff’s SSUMF No. 19;
Belz Dec., ¶¶6-9.)  
 
Lender therefore establishes (1)
the existence of the Note with Cyber 1 and the personal guarantees with Kravetz
and Jacobsen; (2) Lender performance of its obligations by providing Cyber 1
with the $4,550,000 credit facility; (3) Defendants’ breach of the Note and the
personal guarantees based on their failure to make the first payment due on
February 1, 2023 and the failure to pay interest within 10 days of receiving
notice of their default; and (4) the damages suffered as a result of the breach
($4,550,000 + $333,666.77 = $4,883,66.77). 

 
The burden therefore shifts to
Defendants to raise a triable issue of material fact as to the first and second
causes of action for breach of contract. 
(CCP §437c(p)(1).)   Defendants
fail to do so.  Defendants fail to raise
a triable issue of fact or establish an affirmative defense to the causes of
action.  
 
i.  Defendants’ defenses based on “course of
conduct” and “commercial impracticability” fail to raise a triable issue of
fact as to the breach element of Plaintiff’s first and second causes of action
for breach of the Note and breach of the personal guarantees
 
Defendants concede that they failed
to make the first principal payment due under the Note and the personal
guarantees or interest payments from February 1, 2023 onward.  (Defendants’ Responses to SSUMF Nos. 16-23.)  However, they claim they are not in breach
due to the parties’ “course of dealing” and “commercial impracticability.”
            
“Course of dealing.”  According to Defendants, in prior dealings
involving short term obligations, Plaintiff adjusted these obligations to avoid
default.  (Defendants’ Additional
Material Fact (“AMF”) No. 28, Kravetz Dec., ¶11, Ex. C.)  Defendants contend they made monthly interest
payments until January 2023 on the Note and the personal guarantees, which was
consistent with the parties’ prior course of conduct.  (Defendants’ AMF No. 32; Kravetz Dec.,
¶¶38-43; Jacobsen Dec., ¶¶10-15.) 
Defendants testify that Lender’s current actions of putting them in
default and filing this lawsuit contradicts Lender’s prior course of
conduct.  (Defendants’ AMF No. 34; Belz
Depo., Ex. M, pp. 44, 49-50; Kravetz Dec., ¶¶2-43; Jacobsen Dec., ¶¶2-15.)  
 
Defendants fail to establish that
the Note or the personal guarantees were uncertain or indefinite, such that the
Court must resort to the parties’ course of dealing to interpret the contract
and determine the obligations thereunder. 
Defendants rely on California Lettuce Growers v. Union Sugar Co.
(1955) 45 Cal.2d 474 as authority for the proposition that they are not in
breach of the Note or personal guarantees based on the parties’ “course of
dealing” in connection with prior transactions that are entirely unrelated to
the Note.  
 
California Lettuce Growers is
inapposite.  In California Lettuce Growers,
the defendant argued it was not obligated under the parties’ agreement to
purchase beets delivered to it by plaintiff, because the parties’ agreement did
not specify a price, time and place of delivery and was therefore unenforceable
as illusory and void. (California Lettuce Growers, supra, 45
Cal.2d at 481.  Here, Defendants do not
argue that the Note or the personal guarantees are illusory and void.  The court in California Lettuce Growers
resorted to the parties’ and the industry’s “course of dealing” to fill in the
unstated terms of price, time and place of delivery.  (Id. at 483.)  Defendants provide no authority for their
attempt to use “course of dealing” to amend clear and definite obligations in
an agreement.  
 
“Commercial impracticability.”  “[W]here performance remains possible,
the doctrine of impossibility or impracticability excuses performance of a
contractual obligation when performance is impossible or extremely
impracticable.  A thing is impossible in
legal contemplation when it is not practicable; and a thing is impracticable
when it can only be done at an excessive and unreasonable cost.  Circumstances that may make performance more
difficult or costly than contemplated when the agreement was executed do not
constitute impossibility.  A party cannot
avoid performance simply because it is more costly than anticipated or results
in a loss.”  (KB Salt Lake III, LLC v.
Fitness Intern., LLC (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 1032, 1058-1059 (affirming
summary judgment of landlord’s unlawful detainer action for nonpayment of rent;
defendant failed to present any evidence that cost of paying rent as obligated
under the lease could only have been done at an “excessive and unreasonable
cost” due to COVID shutdown).)
 
Defendants submit evidence that
they suffered a number of financial setbacks due to the COVID shutdown.  (Kravetz Dec., ¶35.)  Such arguments have been rejected.  (KB Salt Lake III, LLC, supra, 95
Cal.App.5th at 1058-1059; SVAP III Poway Crossings, LLC v.
Fitness International, LLC (2023) 87 Cal.App.5th 882, 895-896 (impracticability
did not apply to excuse lessee from lease payments on health club even though
COVID shutdown prevented it from operating the health club, which it maintained
was the purpose of the lease).) 
Defendants fail to establish based on the evidence presented that
repaying the Note in accordance with the schedule could only have been done at
excessive and unreasonable cost. 
Defendants do not present evidence as to what they would have had to do
to satisfy the payments under the Note. 
They only state that they suffered severe financial setbacks due to
COVID policy.  Defendants fail to
establish that they were discharged from their obligations under the Note and
the personal guarantees due to impracticability.  
 
            ii.  Defendants fail to raise a triable issue as
to damages based on offset
 
Defendants argue there are triable
issues of fact as to damages, because they are entitled to an offset for the
collateral pledged as security for the Pledge Agreement.  However, Defendants present no evidence as to
the value of the collateral—a 15% membership interest in Equity Orchestration
LLC—nor may the Court assume that the value of such an interest is greater than
zero.  Defendants therefore fail to raise
a triable issue of fact as to the first and second causes of action for breach
of contract based on offset.   
 
C.     No triable issues of fact remain as to
Plaintiff’s declaratory relief claim and summary adjudication is properly
granted as to the third cause of action for declaratory relief
 
In Lender’s third cause of action
for declaratory relief, Lender seeks an order declaring that Defendants Kravetz
and Jacobsen “have no right to the Equity Orchestration membership interests
and that these interests are the sole and exclusive property of the
Lender.”  (Complaint, ¶40.)  Lender contends that, upon Defendants’
default, right to ownership of the Equity Orchestration LLC membership
interests transferred to Lender based on Section 5 of the Pledge Agreement.  (Complaint, ¶38.)  Lender does not seek a declaratory order
regarding the value of the 15% interest in Equity Ownership pledged as
collateral for the personal guarantees.
 
Lender establishes that Kravetz and
Jacobsen pledged their respective 7.5% membership interests in Equity
Orchestration LLC in the Pledge Agreement executed in connection with the
personal guarantees on February 15, 2022. 
(Plaintiff’s Separate Statement, Issue No. 3, SSUMF No. 14,. Belz Dec.,
Ex. 4, Section 1.)  As discussed above,
Defendants failed to make the first principal payment due under the Note, nor
did they pay any interest due from February 1, 2023 onward.  (Plaintiff’s SSUMF Nos. 17-18; Belz Dec.,
¶¶6-9, Ex. 2-3, Section 1.)  Lender
provided notice of the default to Defendants on March 21, 2023 and Defendants
confirmed on April 3, 2023 that they were unable to make the payments.  (Plaintiffs SSUMF Nos. 21-22, Gurvitz Dec., ¶4;
Ex. 5 (Lender’s March 21, 2023 Written Notice).)  Kravetz and Jacobsen have also refused to
tender their interests as required under the Pledge Agreements.  (Plaintiff’s SSUMF NO. 23.)  
 
However, section 5 of the Pledge
Agreement does not automatically grant Lender rights in the membership
interests upon Default, nor does it create any obligation on Defendants to
voluntarily transfer the membership interests to Lender.  (Belz Dec., Ex. 4, Section 5.)  Instead, section 5 states as follows:  “If a Pledgor shall default in payment of any
Obligations or be in violation of any provision hereunder or under any
promissory note or other document, instrument or agreement evidencing or
relating to the Obligations, in each case, after giving effect to any
applicable cure period (any such default, a “Default”), the Pledgee will
have all rights and remedies of a secured party after default under the UCC and
other applicable law.”  (Id.)  
 
Based on the Pledge Agreement,
Defendants were not obligated to voluntarily sign over their interests.  As Defendants point out in their response to
SSUMF No. 24, Lender was entitled to “all rights and remedies of a secured
party after default under the UCC and other applicable law.”  Lender filed this action and sought a
declaratory order declaring its ownership of the collateral, which it was
entitled to do under Section 5.  Defendants
acknowledge that Lender’s action for declaratory relief is a proper exercise of
its rights to file an action for judicial foreclosure.  (Defendants’ SSUMF No. 24.)  
 
As discussed above, there are no
triable issues of fact remaining as to the issue of breach.  The undisputed facts establish that (1) Defendants
are in default under the Note and the personal guarantees and (2) Lender has
exercised its rights under the law to ownership of the collateral based on
Defendants’ default per section 5 of the Pledge Agreement.  As such, based on the undisputed facts,
Lender is entitled to an order declaring it the owner of the collateral pledge
under the Pledge Agreement, a total 15% interest in Equity Ownership LLC.  
 
Conclusion
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion for Summary Judgment is granted.  Based
on the undisputed facts, (1) Defendants defaulted on their obligations under
the Note and the personal guarantees; and (2) there is currently an outstanding
balance of $4,883,666.77.  Based on the
undisputed facts, Plaintiff is also the owner of the collateral pledged as
security for the personal guarantees executed by Defendants Kravetz and Jacobsen—a
15% membership interest in Equity Orchestration LLC.  No triable issues of fact remain as to any of
the causes of action alleged in the complaint.
