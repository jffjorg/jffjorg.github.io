Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash deposition subpoenas issued by the Defendant to the Plaintiff's former employers. The Plaintiff is a former employee who has sued the Defendant for whistleblower retaliation and wrongful termination in violation of public policy. The Defendant issued subpoenas for 17 categories of documents from the Plaintiff's former employers, including personnel files, performance evaluations, and medical records. The Plaintiff argues that the subpoenas are overly broad and violate his privacy, citing case law that protects employees' privacy interests in their employment records. The Judge agrees with the Plaintiff, finding that the Defendant has not shown a compelling need for the discovery and that the subpoenas are drafted so broadly that they unnecessarily and impermissibly invade the Plaintiff's privacy. The motion to quash is granted, and no sanctions are awarded.
