And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for determination of good faith settlement. The plaintiff, Nor Windsor Homeowners Association, brought a lawsuit against Nor Windsor III, LLC and MSB Constructors, Inc. regarding defects at the condominium project at 518 East Windsor Road in Glendale, California. The parties reached a settlement agreement for $1.9 million. The judge reviewed the settlement agreement and declarations from Kenneth Ralidis and Brian Kahn and found that the settlement appears to possess the minimum indicia of good faith required by the law. The judge noted that the settlement was a policy-limits demand on a burning-limits policy prior to mediation, after investigation of the extent of the damage to the Property and the financial condition of the developer defendant. Therefore, the motion is granted, and the judge will sign the plaintiff's proposed order.
