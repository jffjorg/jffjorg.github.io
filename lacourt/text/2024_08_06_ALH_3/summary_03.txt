And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Pasaca Capital, Inc.'s motion for a stay of proceedings pending its appeal of the June 7 Order. The June 7 Order granted Petitioner, Sean E. Rogers, permission to inspect and copy certain corporate records. Pasaca Capital, Inc. argues that it will be irreparably harmed if Petitioner accesses the sensitive information in the records, which Pasaca Capital, Inc. claims it has a right to keep confidential. The judge has refused to consider Petitioner's supplemental declaration, which was filed 17 days after the opposition brief, as it was untimely and irrelevant. The judge has granted the stay, citing Pasaca Capital, Inc.'s agreement to an expedited briefing schedule on a priority basis with the Court of Appeal and the potential harm that Petitioner's access to the records could cause.
