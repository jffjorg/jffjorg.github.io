English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for summary adjudication filed by Defendants Ty Labbe and Liza Gonzalez. The motion seeks to dismiss Plaintiffs Gerald Wachel and Gina Wachel's Second Cause of Action for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, Fourth and Fifth Causes of Action for Defamation, and Sixth Cause of Action for Negligence Per Se.

The Court grants the motion for summary adjudication of the Second Cause of Action for IIED as to Ms. Wachel, finding that her emotional distress did not result from any outrageous conduct and that she was not present during the verbal altercation between Mr. Wachel and Mr. Labbe.

The Court denies the motion for summary adjudication of the Fourth and Fifth Causes of Action for Defamation, finding that Mr. Labbe's statements calling Mr. Wachel a pedophile were not mere opinion but rather a statement of fact intended to injure Mr. Wachel's reputation.

The Court also denies the motion for summary adjudication of the Fifth Cause of Action, finding that the police report filed by Mr. Labbe was not privileged as it was made in reckless disregard of the truth.

Finally, the Court grants the motion for summary adjudication of the Sixth Cause of Action for Negligence Per Se, as Plaintiffs withdrew this cause of action.

The parties who intend to submit on this tentative ruling must send an email to the Court indicating their intention to submit.
