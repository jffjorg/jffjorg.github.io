      CASE NO.: 23AHCV02140
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY RESPONSES FROM PLAINTIFF TO SPECIAL
   INTERROGATORIES (SET ONE)
 
Dept.
  3
8:30
  a.m.
August 6,
  2024



 
On September
 14, 2023, plaintiff Michael Adam Cadena (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action against defendants Sharon Ibara and Randy Ibara (collectively, “Defendants”)
arising from a motor vehicle vs. pedestrian accident that occurred on
 October 12, 2022. On November 8, 2023 Defendants
served Special Interrogatories (Set One) Plaintiff.
Despite granting several extensions, no responses were received and Defendants
filed this motion on April 16, 2024. 
Where a party fails to serve timely
responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling
responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives
any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the
protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a),
2031.300, subd. (a).) 
In opposition, Plaintiff
submits a declaration from counsel stating that the discovery responses have
been provided and that the delay was due to Plaintiff’s failure to communicate
with counsel.  As responses have already
been served, the motion is DENIED as moot. 
Sanctions may be awarded under in favor
of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though the requested
discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed. (C.R.C.
3.1348.)  Defendants’ request for
monetary sanctions is GRANTED and imposed against Plaintiff
in the reduced amount of $ 330 for 1 hour
at defense
counsel’s hourly rate of $270.00 and $60.00
in filing fees, to be paid within 20 days of the date of this Order.
Moving party to give notice.
Dated
this 6th
day of August 2024
