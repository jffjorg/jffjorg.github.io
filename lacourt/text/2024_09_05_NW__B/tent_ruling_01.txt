CASE NUMBER: 21STCV08691
____________________________________________________________
 
Petition to
Approve Compromise of Pending Action of Minor (Nathan Jackson, Age 12)
____________________________________________________________
 
TENTATIVE 
 
The Court excuses the personal appearance of the
claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video
conference call.  
 
The
Court has reviewed the Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim
of a Minor (Nathan Jackson, Age 12). The
Court finds the settlement and requested attorney fees are reasonable, however
the following deficiencies preclude granting of the petition at this time:
 
(1)  
Item
12b(2)(C) of the petition states that no reduction of the medical expenses has
been agreed to, but items 12a(3) and 12b(5)(b)(i)(E) states that there are
reductions. Item 12b(2)(C) must be corrected.
(2)  
Item
12a(5) states there are no liens, but items 12b(2)(C) and 12b(5)(b)(i) indicate
there is a lien. Item 12a(5) must be corrected.
(3)   Medical records and bills have not been
attached.
(4)   Reduction agreement for medical bills have not
been attached.
(5)  
As noted by the court in its July 16, 2024, the petition is also
missing Attachment
18(b)(2), which would provide information about the depository. 
 
The
petition is denied without prejudice.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
