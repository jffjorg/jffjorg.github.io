Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Frontier's motion for determination of good faith settlement. The motion seeks an order determining that the settlement between Defendant Frontier and Plaintiff is in good faith, and that the settlement bars all potential third-party complaints and/or cross-complaints and further claims against Defendant Frontier for equitable contribution or partial or comparative indemnity.

After reviewing the evidence, the Judge has denied Defendant Frontier's motion. The Judge found that the settlement agreement between Defendant Frontier and Plaintiff fails to satisfy the Tech-Bilt factors, which include a rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and a recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than they would if they were found liable after a trial.

The Judge also found that Defendant Frontier may be potentially liable for indemnity to Defendant Spectrum and/or other nonsettling defendants, which makes the settlement amount disproportionate. Therefore, the Judge has denied Defendant Frontier's motion and ordered it to give notice to the parties involved.
