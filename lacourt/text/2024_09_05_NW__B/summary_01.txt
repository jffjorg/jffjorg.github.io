And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition to approve a compromise of the disputed claim of a minor, Nathan Jackson (age 12). Although the settlement and requested attorney fees are deemed reasonable, the court finds several deficiencies in the petition that prevent it from being granted at this time. Specifically, the court notes that items 12a(5) and 12b(2)(C) must be corrected, and medical records and bills, as well as a reduction agreement for medical bills, must be attached. Additionally, Attachment 18(b)(2) is missing. The court denies the petition without prejudice and orders the moving party to give notice.
