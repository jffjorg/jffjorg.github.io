And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which is currently pending. The ruling addresses a motion filed by the Defendant, which applies to the Plaintiff's individual claims. The Plaintiff has deposed two experts, Dr. Elizabeth Chan and Dr. Elana Hadar-Schwartz, and claims that the Defendant cannot rely on the Plaintiff's objections-only discovery responses to shift the burden of proof. The Judge disagrees, finding that the Defendant's declarations from ACCESS personnel shift the burden independently of the Plaintiff's responses.

The Defendant contends that the Plaintiff did not suffer an economic injury, as she was not overcharged for the services provided. The Judge disagrees, finding that the Plaintiff paid for continued visits that she would have discontinued, which raises a triable issue as to whether those payments establish an economic injury. The Judge has not yet made a final ruling on the motion, and the parties are invited to submit further comments before the ruling is finalized.
