TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendants’ no-merits motion is
granted as to the Los Angeles hospital, the Torrance hospital, and Dr. Richard
Mills and denied as to the San Fernando Valley hospital.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Defendants own and operate
veterinary hospitals that provide emergency services and specialty care.  Spornik brought her cat Ozzie to one of
Defendants’ vet hospitals for treatment. 
She alleges that non-board-certified vets treated Ozzie despite
Defendants’ representation that they only employ board-certified vets.  (See, e.g., Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”),
¶¶ 2-4, 29-54.)  She seeks to represent a
class of similarly situated customers. 
(See id. at ¶¶ 55-63.)
 
Here, Defendants request a
determination that Spornik’s third cause of action (Consumer Legal Remedies Act
(“CLRA”)) lacks merit.[1]
 
On 9/20/23, the Court continued
the hearing pursuant to give Plaintiff a chance to depose the treating vets.[2]
 
On 12/4/23, Plaintiff filed her
supplemental opposition.
 
On 1/16/24, Defendants filed
their reply.
 
On 1/17/24, Plaintiff filed a
late supplemental separate statement.
 
On 1/29/24, the Court heard
Defendants’ no-merits motion and their motion for summary
judgment/adjudication.  The Court denied
summary judgment, granted summary adjudication as to the Los Angeles and
Torrance hospitals, and continued the hearing as to the other Defendants to
give Defendants an opportunity to respond to the late supplemental separate
statement.
 
On 2/28/24, Defendants filed
their response. 
 
Now, the Court must consider the
parties’ briefs.
 
LAW
 
The CLRA does not contain a “general proscription against ‘unfair’
or ‘deceptive’ acts or practices.” 
(Stern, Business & Professions Code Section 17200 Practice (The
Rutter Group March 2023 Update) ¶ 10:4.) 
“Instead,” the statute lists 28 activities “defined to be ‘unlawful.’”  (Ibid.; see also Civ. Code § 1770, subd.
(a).)  “Some of these practices are also
found in the laundry list of practices that are deemed to constitute false
advertising and, hence, are also actionable under” the UCL and the FAL.  (Ibid.)
 
The statute “broadly applies to any transaction involving the
sale or lease of goods or services to a ‘consumer.’”  (Id. at ¶ 10:16.)  A “consumer” is “an individual who seeks or
acquires, by purchase or lease, any goods or services for personal, family, or
household purposes.”  (Id. at ¶ 10:26.)  “The Act broadly defines ‘transaction’ as ‘an
agreement between a consumer and any other person, whether or not the agreement
is a contract enforceable by action, and includes the making of, and the
performance pursuant to, that agreement.’” 
(Id. at ¶ 10:18.)
 
“The CLRA is to be ‘liberally construed and applied to
promote its underlying purposes, which are to protect consumers against unfair
and deceptive business practices and to provide efficient and economical
procedures to secure such protection.’” 
(Id. at ¶ 10:17.)
 
Importantly, the statute “has a unique provision” pertaining
to dispositive motions.  (Id. at ¶
10:63.)  “It prohibits a court from
granting a motion for summary judgment under [Code of Civil Procedure section]
473c ‘in any action commenced as a class action pursuant to subdivision
(a).’”  (Ibid.)  “However, what that provision takes away it
seemingly gives back; while a trial court may not enter summary judgment, it
may determine that the action ‘is without merit or there is no defense to the
action.’”  (Ibid.; see also Smith v.
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1474 [“Although
a CLRA cause of action cannot be summarily disposed of by means of a motion for
summary adjudication or summary judgment [citation], it can be dismissed before
trial on a motion for a determination that it is without merit (i.e., a
no-merit determination).”].)
 
“In practice, a motion that ‘the action lacks merits’
operates [] much like a motion for summary judgment.”  (Id. at ¶ 10:65.)  In fact, there is “‘no meaningful distinction
in the choice’ between dismissal of a cause of action after a motion for
summary judgment and a motion for a no-merit determination.”  (Smith, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th
at 1475.)  “Thus, courts have applied the
standards applicable to motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication
in deciding motions for no-merit determinations.”  (Stern, supra, at ¶ 10:65.)
 
“Furthermore, there is not a ‘more exacting standard’ for
summary judgment in CLRA (or UCL) cases than in other civil cases.”  (Ibid.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
No-Merits Motion Re: Los
Angeles and Torrance Hospitals
 
At the last hearing, the Court
granted summary adjudication in favor of the Los Angeles and Torrance
hospitals.  The analysis applies with
equal force here, so the no-merits motion is granted as to the Los Angeles and
Torrance hospitals.
 
No-Merits Motion Re: San
Fernando Valley Hospital and Dr. Mills
 
The facts and analysis for the
no-merits motion are the same as the facts and analysis for the pending
summary-adjudication motion; consequently, the Court incorporates the
summary-adjudication tentative ruling. 
For the reasons stated there, the no-merits motion is denied as to the
San Fernando Valley hospital and granted as to Dr. Mills.
 
Business
and Professions Code Section 4883
 
The
Court stated last time that it is disinclined to grant Plaintiff leave to amend
to allege a cause of action under Business and Professions Code section
4883(s).  The statement stands.
