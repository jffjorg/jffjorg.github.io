To date, the putative class is uncertified. 
The motion applies to Plaintiff’s individual claims.
 


[2]
Plaintiff deposed Dr. Elizabeth Chan and Dr. Elana Hadar-Schwartz.  (See Supp. Opposition, p. 2.)


[3]
Plaintiff claims Defendants cannot rely on her objections-only discovery
responses to shift the burden.  (See
Opposition, pp. 4-5; see also Leifer Decl., Exs. 4, 5.)  If Defendants’ moving brief were entirely
based on her objections-only responses, the Court would agree.  That is not the situation.  Defendants’ declarations from ACCESS
personnel shift the burden independent of Plaintiff’s responses.


[4]
Defendants contend Plaintiff did not suffer an economic injury.  They claim she was not overcharged.  (See Reply, pp. 4-6.)  The Court disagrees.  She paid for continued visits that she would
have discontinued.  (See Plaintiff Decl.,
¶¶ 11-12.)  It is a triable issue whether
those payments establish an economic injury.
