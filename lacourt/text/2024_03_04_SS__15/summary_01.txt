**Significant Statements**

* The evidence would have little probative value because foreign bans did not apply to workplaces in the United States and would be confusing to the jury.
* The documents could be relevant to notice or knowledge of the dangers of asbestos.
* The court cannot determine at this point that no witness will be able to authenticate the documents.
* The motion is denied without prejudice to objections at trial.
* The court notes that the motion is too vague, and the parties should be able to work out a stipulation on this motion.
