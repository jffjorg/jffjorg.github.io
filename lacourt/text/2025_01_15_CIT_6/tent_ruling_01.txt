Relieved as Counsel for Defendant Thunder International Group Inc. 
TENTATIVE
RULING 
The Court DENIES the motion of Richard Liu and Edward Wells of
Innovative Legal Services, P.C. to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Thunder
International group Inc. without prejudice. 
            Counsel is ordered to give notice of
the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order. 
BACKGROUND 
This is a common counts case. On December 8, 2023, plaintiff Seasky
Logistics, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Thunder
International Group, Inc. (Defendant) and Does 1 to 10, alleging one cause of
action for common counts. 
On December 23, 2024, Richard Liu and Edward Wells of Innovative
Legal Services, P.C. moved to be relieved as counsel for Defendant.[1] The motion is unopposed. 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 The Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted, provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.)
A motion to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council
Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all
parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362,
subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION 
Richard Liu and Edward Wells of Innovative Legal Services, P.C. (collectively,
Counsel) seeks to be relieved as counsel for Defendant on the grounds that
there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. (Wells Decl., ¶
2.) The Court finds this proper grounds for withdrawal. A breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship is grounds for allowing the attorney to withdraw.
(Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) Grounds for
permitting an attorney to withdraw from representation also include the
client’s conduct that, “renders it unreasonably difficult for the lawyer to
carry out the representation effectively[.]” (Cal. Rules of Professional
Conduct, rule 1.16, subd. (b)(4).) 
Counsel has also submitted the application, declaration, and
proposed order on Judicial Council forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) 
But, the deadline for service with the five-day mail extension was
December 16, 2024, and the deadline for electronic service with the two court
day extension was December 18, 2024. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1005, subd. (b),
1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B), 1013, subd. (a).) Counsel filed and served this motion
on December 23, 2024, so it is therefore untimely. 
Moreover, there are issues with the forms submitted. First, the
notice of motion is addressed to Ye Feng and Mingming Wang, not to Defendant.
(Notice, p. 1.) Second, Counsel vaguely identifies the “California Secretary of
State” as the means by which Counsel confirmed Defendant’s address is current.
(Wells Decl., ¶ 3, subd. (b)(1).) It is not entirely clearly what this means.
The Court infers that Counsel meant they checked the address on file with the
California Secretary of State via its website, but that would be insufficient.
The methods for confirmation listed in Judicial Council Form MC-052 indicate
some sort of affirmative response from the client, such as mail return receipt
requested, telephone, or conversation. (See Wells Decl., ¶ 3, subd. (b)(1).)
Checking the California Secretary of State website or its files would not
require an affirmative response from Defendant. Third, Counsel did not provide
the information for the upcoming discovery motion hearing on February 26, 2025.
(Wells Decl., ¶¶ 4-5; Proposed Order, ¶¶ 7-8.) Fourth, Counsel did not complete
paragraphs 3 or 5 of the proposed order. (Proposed Order, ¶¶ 3, 5.) 
            Based on the foregoing, the Court
DENIES the motion without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES the motion of Richard Liu and Edward Wells of
Innovative Legal Services, P.C. to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Thunder
International group Inc. without prejudice. 
            Counsel is ordered to give notice of
the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
