Introduction
Defendant Glenda Maciel (Defendant) moved to compel Plaintiffs to appear and testify at their depositions and produce documents and requested $1,460.00 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs' Counsel, Law Office of Christopher Mesaros.
Discussion
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action … without having served a valid objection under [section] 2025.410, fails to appear for examination … the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony.”  (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 2025.450(a).)  “If a deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document … , the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that answer or production.”  (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 2025.480(a).)  The moving party must show a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents or things described in the deposition notice, provide a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.  (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 2025.450(b) and 2025.480(b).)  A separate statement is required when moving to compel production of documents at a deposition.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)  The moving party must show specific facts to support good cause justifying the production of any document, electronically stored information or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 2025.450.)
On October 1, 2024, Defendant’s counsel requested Plaintiff’s availability for deposition by the close of business on October 4, 2024.  This short period of time was unreasonable. Plaintiffs' counsel failed to respond to Defendant’s request. On October 4, 2024, Defendant served its deposition notice on Plaintiff and gave one business day to provide a new date. The Deposition Notice called for Plaintiffs to appear and testify at deposition at 10:00 a.m. on October 21, 2024, via remote videoconference. The deposition was timely noticed in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.270. On October 16, 2024, Plaintiffs served their objection to the deposition notice but did not provide alternative dates despite two weeks having passed from the time Plaintiffs were advised of the need to provide dates.  Indeed, Plaintiffs did not provide dates until after the motion to compel was filed on November 6, 2024.  This is over one month after the initial request for the depositions. This was unreasonable. 
In sum, had Plaintiffs responded to Defendant’s three requests prior to the motion, Defendant would not have been required to file the instant motions on November 6, 2024.  After filing the instant motions on November 6, 20204, Defendant served a First Amended Notice of Deposition on November 8, 2024 setting the deposition date for December 20, 2024.  (Abella’s Reply Decl. par. 3, Exh. A.)  Only thereafter did Plaintiffs confirmed the availability to appear at the December 20, 2024 deposition.  (Abella’s Reply Decl. par. 4, Exh. B.)  Because of Plaintiffs' failure to cooperate and respond to Defendant’s three prior requests for dates of availability, Defendant was required to file the instant motions. It should be noted that Defendant did not file the motions until more than one month after the initial request for a date and there was no excuse for plaintiffs not providing a date until after November 6th.  Waiting one month to get a deposition date is more than enough time. It was not until after the instant motion was filed that Plaintiffs agreed to appear. Defendant’s motions were merited and persuasive and further showed Plaintiffs' misuse of discovery. 
Despite Plaintiffs' amenability to appear at the December 20, 2024 deposition, the Court finds that the motions are still viable since the December 20, 2024 date will not have passed at the time of this hearing.  The motions to compel appearance at the depositions as noticed are GRANTED. 
As to the motions' request for production of documents at the deposition, the Court finds that good cause is submitted for the demand for production because the demands are all related to other discovery demands and the auto accident itself.  Plaintiffs served objections to the document demand on October 16, 2024 via email (Abella Decl. par. 5, Exh. C).  After October 16, 2024 and before November 6, 2024 (the filing date of the instant motion), Defendant was required to meet and confer to resolve the issues as to the Plaintiffs' objections.  (Code Civ. Proc. sec. 2025.480(b).)  Defendant’s evidence does not show any meet and confer efforts as to the document demands.  However, a failure to meet and confer is not seen as grounds to outright deny a motion to compel.
In reviewing Plaintiffs' objections, the burden to justify the objections is on the responding party.  (Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal. 2d 210, 220-221; Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 97-98.)  Plaintiffs' opposition failed to justify the objections.  The Court finds the objections to be boilerplate and not made in good faith. It is disingenuous to serve boilerplate objections and then require a meet and confer. Because Plaintiffs failed to justify the objections, Defendant is entitled to a further response.
The motions to compel production of documents at the deposition are GRANTED. 
The parties’ declarations attesting to their efforts to proceed with the Mandatory Settlement Conference with Resolve Law LA are outside the scope of the instant discovery issues and will be addressed by separate order. 
Sanctions are mandatory unless the court finds that the one subject to sanctions acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances exist making sanctions unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 2025.450(g)(1) and 2025.480(j).)  A failure to meet and confer in good faith is a misuse of discovery and grounds for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 2023.010, 2023.020, and 2023.030.)   The Court finds that Defendant is the prevailing party as to the motions.  Plaintiffs engaged in discovery abuse by making frivolous objections, by failing to provide dates for deposition for over 4 weeks after being asked (and only after the motion was filed) and for not producing clearly relevant documents.  Monetary sanctions are awarded.

OSC RE SANCTIONS
The court sets an OSC re sanctions on ______________ at _______ in the sum of $500 against defense counsel Ivie McNeill Wyatt Purcell & Diggs for failure of defendant to obey the court order of 3/12/2024 for a Mandatory Settlement Conference pursuant to CCP section 177.5. Written response to the OSC is due no later than 5 court dates before the OSC. The court did not order that the MSC could take place only after the plaintiffs’ depositions.  In fact, defendant asked for available dates for the depositions on October 1, 2024, after the MSC cutoff date.  Plaintiffs’ counsel sent defense counsel the following email on 3/15/2024:
"Mr. Abella, As you know we were ordered sign up and confirm a date through the resolve law MSG program within 10 days of our last hearing. The completion date is 9/15/2024. The following dates are the only available dates for an MSG between now and then. Please get back to me as soon as possible so that we can lock in a date: May 1,2024 at 1:30 P.M. April 19,2024 at 1:30 P.M. March 27,2024 at 1:30 P.M.”
Defendant did not provide alternative dates nor did defendant schedule the plaintiffs’ depositions until after the MSC cutoff date of 9/15/2024.  There was nothing stopping defendant from selecting dates before the cutoff and taking the plaintiffs' depositions before those dates.
