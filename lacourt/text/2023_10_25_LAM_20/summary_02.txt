And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Equaltox, LLC v. Health Access for All, Inc. The defendant has demurred to the complaint, arguing that it is uncertain and fails to state a cause of action. The judge has overruled the demurrer as to the first, second, third, and fifth causes of action, finding that the allegations are sufficient to state a claim. The first cause of action is for breach of oral contract, the second and third causes of action are for work, labor, and services/agreed price, and the fifth cause of action is for unjust enrichment. The judge has also overruled the demurrer as to the fourth cause of action for account stated, finding that the allegations are not inconsistent with the claims made in the complaint. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the ruling. The judge encourages counsel to submit on the tentative ruling or appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
