BACKGROUND
On March 17, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint
against Defendants Hwy 111 Hotel Group, LP, a California Limited Partnership; Shields
Housing Corporation; and Rosecrans Avenue Property, LLC (“Rosecrans”).  The Complaint asserts causes of action for
(1) breach of implied warranty of habitability, (2) breach of statutory
warranty of habitability, (3) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, (4)
negligence, (5) violation of Civil Code section 1942.4, and (6) private
nuisance.  
On September 1, 2023, Rosecrans filed
twelve Motions to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, from
Plaintiffs Lizbeth Brito, Roberto Maciel, Luis Humberto Lopez, Anthony
Gonzalez, Liliana Brito, Lesly Brito, Jared Maciel, Claudia Maravel, Jorge
Pulido, Alivahnie Osuna, Adrian Pulido, and Isaura Alvarez (collectively
“Plaintiffs”).  For each motion,
Defendant also requests sanctions against Plaintiffs in the amount of $764 for
a total amount of $9,168. 
No opposition or reply was filed. 
 
DISCUSSION
Applicable
Law
            If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling responses and for a monetary sanction.¿(CCP § 2030.290(b).)¿The
statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses or no
verified responses have been served.¿¿All that need be shown in the moving
papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing
party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind
has been served.  (See¿Leach v.
Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)  
Sanctions are mandatory in connection with motions to compel
responses to interrogatories and requests for production of documents against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel.¿ (CCP §§ 2030.290, subd. (c),¿2030.300, subd. (d),¿2031.300, subd.
(c),¿and 2031.310, subd. (h).) However, sanctions are not mandatory if the
court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿¿(Ibid.) 
Application
to Facts
            Rosecrans served its Form
Interrogatories, Set One, to Plaintiffs by electronic service on Jul 21,
2022.  (Walls Decl., ¶ 3.)  Plaintiffs’ responses were due on August 25,
2022.  (Id.)  However, as of the date of this Motion,
Plaintiffs have failed to serve verified responses.  (Id., ¶ 4.) 

            There is no evidence before the
Court indicating that Plaintiffs served verified responses to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One.  Additionally,
there is no opposition filed before the Court.      
            Accordingly, Rosecrans’s Motions to Compel Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, are GRANTED. Plaintiff shall serve verified
responses, without objection, within 30 days.   
 
Sanctions
            Rosecrans requests sanctions in the total
amount of $9,168 against Plaintiffs. This amount includes 1.2 hours in
preparing each Motion, 2 hours of time spent preparing for and attending the
hearing of each Motion at a rate of $220 per hour, and $60 in filing fees for a
total of $764 per motion. (Walls Decl., ¶ 6.)
            As indicated above, Plaintiffs
failed to serve verified responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One.
            Accordingly, the Court awards sanctions in favor of Rosecrans
and against Plaintiffs, but in the reduced amount of $720.00 (2
hours for the Motions @ $220/hour + 1 hour in preparing for and attending the
hearing of the Motions @ $220/hour + $60 filing fee).
 


 
CONCLUSION
The Motions to Compel Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, are GRANTED. Plaintiffs shall serve verified
responses, without objection, within 30 days.
The Court awards sanctions in the reduced
amount of $720.00, payable within 30 days.
            If counsel do not submit on the
tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than
in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
