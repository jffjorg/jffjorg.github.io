            The complaint alleges that Plaintiff
Equaltox, LLC dba Equaltox Laboratory (“Plaintiff”) entered into an oral
agreement with Defendant Health Access for All, Inc. (“Defendant”) to perform
and provide clinical laboratory testing and reporting on specimens furnished to
it by Defendant, and Defendant would pay for the tests. Plaintiff sues for
$60,900.00 for services provided between August 2021 and January 2022. 
            The complaint asserts causes of

price; (3) open book account; (4) account stated; and (5) unjust enrichment.
            On May 22, 2023, Defendant demurred.
On October 10, 2023, Plaintiff opposed. On October 18, 2023, Defendant replied.

 
DISCUSSION
APPLICABLE
LAW
When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context,
and “treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but
not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Serrano v.
Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and
not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. The only
issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected
with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  “If the complaint
states a cause of action under any theory, regardless of the title under which
the factual basis for relief is stated, that aspect of the complaint is good
against a demurrer.” (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title
Guar. Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.) Demurrers for uncertainty are strictly construed,
because discovery can be used for clarification, and apply where defendants
cannot reasonably determine what issues or claims are stated.  (Khoury
v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Weil & Brown,
Civ. Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2021) ¶¶7:85-7:86.)  It is error “to
sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a
reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by
amendment.”  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th
962, 967.)
 
APPLICATION
TO FACTS
Defendant demurs to the 1st
cause of action for breach of oral contract, the 2nd cause of action
for work, labor, and services/agreed price, 3rd cause of action for
open book account, 4th cause of action for account stated, and 5th
cause of action for unjust enrichment.
Preliminarily, it is unclear whether Defendant
met the meet-and-confer requirements. It is unknown whether Defendant’s counsel
communicated with Plaintiff’s counsel in person, by telephone, or by another
means, and the parties must communicate in person or by telephone. (Code Civ.
Pro. § 430.41, subd. (a).) 
 
1st
cause of action for breach of oral contract
Defendant first contends that this cause
of action fails because the terms of the purported agreement are not
sufficiently certain. 
“Whether
a contract is sufficiently definite to be enforceable is a question of law for
the court.” (Ladas v. California State Automobile Assn. (1993) 19
Cal.App.4th 761, 770, fn. 2.) An oral contract may be pleaded generally as to its effect because
it is rarely possible to allege the exact words. (Khoury v. Maly's of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) A demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff has sufficiently
alleged facts for its breach of oral contract cause of action. It alleges that on
or about August 22, 2021, it entered into an oral agreement with Defendant where
it agreed to perform and provide clinical laboratory testing and reporting on
specimens furnished to it by Defendant, and Defendant would pay for the tests.
(Complaint, ¶ 7). Plaintiff provided the services between August 2021 and
January 2022, and now, there is a balance due of $60,900.00 (Ibid.)
            The demurrer is
overruled as to this cause of action. 
2nd
cause of action for work, labor, and services/agreed price, 3rd
cause of action for open book account, and 4th cause of action for
account stated
Defendant demurs to the second, third, and
fourth causes of action on the same ground as it demurred to the first cause of
action. Defendant additionally demurs to the fourth cause of action because its
allegations of an account stating in writing is inconsistent with its
allegations of an oral agreement.
For the same reasons that apply to the
breach of contract cause of action, the demurrer is overruled as to the second
and third causes of action. 
For the account stated cause of action, Plaintiff
alleges that “within the last two years an account was stated in writing by and
between Plaintiff and Defendant wherein it was agreed that Defendant was
indebted to Plaintiff in the sum of $60,900.00.” (Complaint, ¶ 17.) Plaintiff
argues that there is no inconsistency because the action for account stated is
not founded upon the original items, but upon the balance agreed to by the
parties, citing Gleason v. Klamer (1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 782, 786-787. The
court agrees. The demurrer is overruled as to the fourth cause of action. 
5th
cause of action for unjust enrichment
            Defendant demurs to the fifth cause
of action for unjust enrichment on the ground that it is conclusory because
Plaintiff only alleges that “Defendants knowingly received and retained the
benefit of the testing services provided by Plaintiff and used those services
in ACHCs’ business without paying Plaintiff for any portion of the services.” 
“The elements for a claim of unjust enrichment are receipt of a
benefit and unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of another. The
theory of unjust enrichment requires one who acquires a benefit which
may not justly be retained, to return either the thing or its equivalent to the
aggrieved party so as not to be unjustly enriched.” (Lyles v. Sangadeo-Patel (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th
759, 769.) Based on this, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s allegations are
not conclusory. 
Thus, the Court overrules the fifth cause of action. 
 
CONCLUSION
Defendant’s
demurrer is overruled. 
 
Defendant to give
notice.
 
            If counsel do not submit on the
tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than
in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
