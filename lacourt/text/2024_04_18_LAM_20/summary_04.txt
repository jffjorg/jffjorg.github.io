Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion for summary judgment filed by First Mercury Insurance Company is denied. The court finds that there are triable issues as to whether the bar, "Gamez Bar", was also insured under the insurance policy issued to D&M Restaurant Group, Inc. The court concludes that the evidence presented by D&M Restaurant Group, Inc. raises a triable issue as to whether the bar was a covered entity under the policy. Therefore, the court denies the motion for summary judgment and sets the case for further proceedings.
