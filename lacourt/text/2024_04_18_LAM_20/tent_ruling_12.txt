 Plaintiff Delia Alvino seeks leave to file a first amended complaint.  Plaintiff states that “[t]he proposed FAC differs from the Complaint in three primary aspects. First, the FAC adds Plaintiff’s husband, Alfred Alvino, as a plaintiff. Defendants Sunrun Inc. and Sunrun Installation Services Inc. (collectively, ‘Sunrun’) prompted the addition of Mr. Alvino to this case by way of Sunrun’s motion to join necessary parties. Because Sunrun has already consented to—and in fact prompted—the joinder of Mr. Alvino, that amendment cannot possibly prejudice Sunrun. No other defendants have objected to adding Mr. Alvino as a plaintiff. Second, the proposed FAC adds a cause of action for nuisance. This cause of action is directly tied to Mr. Alvino’s joinder and is similarly unobjectionable. Third, the FAC adds allegations regarding Sunrun’s agency relationships with Defendants Sunergy Construction Inc. (‘Sunergy’), Voltaic, LLC, Voltaic Energy, LLC, and Voltaic Construction, LLC (collectively, ‘Voltaic’).”The Court may, in the furtherance of justice, and upon any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 473, 576.)  In general, California courts liberally exercise discretion to permit amendment of pleadings in light of a strong policy favoring resolution of all disputes between parties in the same action.  (Nestle v. Santa Monica (1972) 6 Cal.3d 920, 939; Morgan v. Superior Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.)  “[T]here is a strong policy in favor of liberal allowance of amendments.”  (Mesler v. Bragg Management Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 296.)  Pursuant to this policy, requests for leave to amend generally will be granted unless the party seeking to amend has been dilatory in bringing the proposed amendment before the Court, and the delay in seeking leave to amend will cause prejudice to the opposing party if leave to amend is granted.  (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490; Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 558, 564-565.)  The decision on a motion for leave is directed to the sound discretion of the trial court.  (See generally Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2014) ¶¶ 6:637 et seq.) Because there is no opposition, it is not apparent what prejudice would arise from the subject amendment.  Therefore, the Motion is granted.  The FAC is to be filed within 10 days.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
