And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The proposed amended complaint adds the plaintiff's husband, Alfred Alvino, as a plaintiff, as well as a cause of action for nuisance and allegations regarding Sunrun's agency relationships with other defendants. The court has discretion to permit amendment of pleadings in the furtherance of justice, and since there is no opposition to the amendment, it is granted. The proposed amended complaint must be filed within 10 days.
