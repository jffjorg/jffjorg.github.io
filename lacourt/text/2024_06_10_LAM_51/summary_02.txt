And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Rocket Mortgage LLC, has moved to quash service of summons, arguing that the court lacks jurisdiction over it. The plaintiff, Anne Heiting, has failed to present sufficient evidence to establish the court's jurisdiction over the defendant. As a result, the court grants the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and denies the plaintiff's request for a stay. The court also orders the complaint filed by Anne Heiting dismissed without prejudice.
