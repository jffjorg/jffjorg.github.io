 Case Number:  24STCV02222    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  51 Tentative Ruling   Judge Upinder S.  Kalra, Department 51   HEARING DATE:   June  10, 2024                             CASE NAME:           Anne  Heiting v. Rocket Mortgage LLC   CASE NO.:                24STCV02222  MOTION  TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS   MOVING PARTY: Defendant Rocket Mortgage LLC   RESPONDING PARTY(S): Plaintiff Anne Heiting   REQUESTED RELIEF: dismissal of the lawsuit with  prejudice   TENTATIVE RULING: Defendant’s motion to quash service  of summons is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s request for stay is DENIED.   STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:             On January  29, 2024, Plaintiff Anne Heiting (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Rocket  Mortgage, LLC (“Defendant”) and Does 1-25 alleging a cause of action for  Violations of the California Invasion of Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 631.)                The  complaint alleges as follows. Defendant is a Michigan corporation with its  principal place of business in Michigan. (Compl. ¶ 6.) Defendant entered into  agreements with salesforce.com (“SalesForce”) to embed code into Defendant’s  website’s chat function. Once the chat occurs, SalesForce uses digital  surveilance tools to collect personal data and monitor user behavior.  SalesForce will also disclose sensitive and personal information to third  parties. Defendant knowingly allowed this and failed to obtain user consent for  this invasive behavior.               On February  23, 2024, the parties filed a joint stipulation to enlarge the time for  Defendant to file a response to the Complaint to April 2, 2024. Defendant did  not file a responsive pleading.               On April 2,  2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to quash service of summons based on  lack of personal jurisdiction. Plaintiff filed an opposition, and Defendant  replied.    LEGAL STANDARD:  Pursuant to CCP  section 418.10(a)(1), a defendant may move to quash service of summons on or  before the last day to plead in response to the complaint or within such  further time as the Court may allow for good cause. When a defendant challenges jurisdiction  by a motion to quash, “the burden of proof is placed upon the plaintiff to  establish the facts of jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.” Aquila, Inc. v. Super. Ct., 148 Cal.  App. 4th 556, 568 (2007). “The plaintiff must do more than merely allege  jurisdictional facts. It must present evidence sufficient to justify a finding  that California may properly exercise jurisdiction over the defendant.” In re Auto. Antitrust Cases I & II,  135 Cal. App. 4th 100, 110 (2005) (citations omitted). Mere vague assertions of  facts are not enough, but instead the plaintiff must offer “specific  evidentiary facts permitting a court to form an independent conclusion on the  issue of jurisdiction.” Id.  (citations omitted). Plaintiff cannot rely on “allegations in an unverified  complaint or vague and conclusory assertions of ultimate facts.” Strasner v. Touchstone Wireless Repair &  Logistics, LP, 5 Cal. App. 5th 215, 222 (2016) ANALYSIS: Plaintiff has failed in their  burden to present evidence to support a finding that California courts have  jurisdiction over Defendants. Plaintiff has presented no evidence to meet their  burden.   CONCLUSION:             For  the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: Defendant’s  motion to quash service of summons is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s request for stay is  DENIED.               The Court  orders the Complaint filed by Anne Heiting dismissed without prejudice.   Moving party is to give notice.    IT IS SO ORDERED.    Dated:              June 10, 2024                          __________________________________                                                                                                                Upinder  S.
