And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is on a demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) and a motion to strike punitive damages. The plaintiff, Chol Enterprises, Inc., alleges breach of contract, trespass to chattels, conversion, and two counts of unfair competition under Business and Professions Code section 17200. The defendant, 740 South Broadway Associates, LLC, demurs to the entire FAC and moves to strike punitive damages. The court rejects the defendant's arguments that the litigation privilege applies and that the claims are unintelligible. The court also finds that the plaintiff has met its burden at the pleading stage. The court overrules the demurrer and grants the motion to strike punitive damages, but allows the plaintiff to amend the complaint to add allegations supporting punitive damages.
