The judge finds that the plaintiffs have failed to timely respond to the discovery requests and grants the defendant's motions to compel responses to the Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production, and deems admitted the Requests for Admission. The judge also orders the plaintiffs to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,123.30 to the defendant, which represents 2 hours of attorney time at an hourly rate of $250 plus a filing fee of $61.65. The judge orders the plaintiffs to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 30 days of notice of the court's orders.
