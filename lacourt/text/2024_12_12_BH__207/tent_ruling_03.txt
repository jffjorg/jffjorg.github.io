LEGAL
STANDARDS
 
1.     Interrogatories
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.290, “[i]f a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a
timely response . . . [t]he party to whom the interrogatories are directed
waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section
2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based
on privilege or the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010.  . . .   [and] The party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds. (a)-(b).) 
 
2.     Requests
for Admission
 
             Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (a), “[i]f a party to whom requests
or admission are directed fails to serve a timely response . . .  [t]he party to whom the requests for
admission are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product[.]”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)  Where a party fails to respond to
requests for admissions, the propounding party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
 
3.    
Requests for Production
 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure, section 2031.300, subd. (a), “[i]f a party to whom
a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to
serve a timely response to it, the following rules shall apply: (a) The party
to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed
waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010).”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(a).)  Where a party fails to respond to
demands for production, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
response to the demand.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) “Within 30 days after service of a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the party to whom the demand is
directed shall serve the original response to it on the party making the demand
. . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a).)
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.    
Discovery Requests
 
Defendant electronically served each
Plaintiff with the FROG, SROG, RPD and RFA on December 13, 2023 (Tsaturyan
Decl. ¶ 4 and Ex. A.)  No extensions have
been requested or granted, and as of October 31, 2024 when Defendant’s counsel
executed the declaration that accompanied the motions, no responses had been
received.  (Tsaturyan Decl. ¶¶ 4-6;
10.)    
 
Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs
have failed to timely serve responses to FROG, SROG, RPD, and RFA, and grants
Defendant’s motions to compel FROG, SROG, and RPD, and deems admitted the
RFA.  
 
2.    
Monetary Sanctions
Defendant
seeks monetary sanctions for each of the eight motions (FROG, SROG, RPD, and
RFA as to each Plaintiff) in the amount of $561.65, representing 2 hours of
attorney time at the hourly rate of $250 plus the $61.65 filing fee.  (Tsaturyan Decl. ¶ 12.)   
 
The Court
finds Plaintiffs’ failure to timely respond to the discovery requests to constitute
abuses of the discovery process, warranting monetary sanctions.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subd. (d);
2030.290, subd. (c); 2031.300, subd. (c); 2033.280, subd. (c).)  
 
Therefore,
the Court grants Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against Caldwell in
the amount of $1,123.30 and against Smith in the amount of $1,123.30.
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants Defendant’s
motions to compel responses to the FROG, SROG, and RPD per Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300. 
As such, the Court orders Plaintiffs to serve verified responses to the
FROG, SROG, and RPD, without objections, within 30 days of notice of the
Court’s orders.
 
Further, the Court grants Defendant’s motion to deem admitted matters
specified in the RFA per Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, and deems
admitted the matters specified in the RFA propounded to Plaintiffs.
 
The Court further orders each Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions in
the amount of $1,123.30 to Defendant, by and through counsel for Defendant,
within 30 days of notice of this order.
 
            Defendant
shall provide notice of the Court’s orders and file the notice with a proof of
service forthwith.
