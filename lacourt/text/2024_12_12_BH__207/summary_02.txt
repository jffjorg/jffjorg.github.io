And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case where the plaintiff, Rowland, is suing the defendant, Christian, and his company, Quakestrong, for injuries caused by the defendant's want of ordinary care. The judge is applying the multifactor test set forth in Rowland v. Christian (1968) to determine whether the defendant has a duty to exercise care to avoid injuring others. The judge notes that Quakestrong failed to present evidence on various factors, including the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved. As a result, the judge is inclined to find that there is no basis to make an exception to the duty of care under California Civil Code Section 1714. The judge will consider the Rowland factors, including the foreseeability of harm, the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury, and the moral blame attached to the defendant's conduct, before making a final ruling.
