[1] Although
Plaintiffs argue that Defendants have not shown shared control as to Plaintiff
Nedco, LLC (Opposition at p. 15), Nedco was only added as a Plaintiff in the
First Amended Complaint, and served no prior demand letter upon Defendants. There
is good reason to believe that Nedco’s role in the shaping the litigation is
secondary to BR CO’s. 


[2] For the
same reason, Plaintiffs’ proffered authority of Farmland Irr. Co. v.
Dopplmaier (1957) 48 Cal.2d 208 is likewise distinguishable. (Opposition at
pp. 13–14.) The plaintiff in that case sought relief personal to itself with no
inference that it was responsible for the concurrent litigation: “laintiff
brought the present action, not to harass defendant with multiple litigation,
but to assert interests it claimed would not be adequately represented in the
Oregon action.” (Farmland Irr. Co. v. Dopplmaier (1957) 48 Cal.2d 208,
215.) The facts here are dissimilar.
