And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to stay the proceedings in this case. The defendants, Gilbert Milam, Parker Berling, and Cookies Creative Consulting and Promotions, Inc., argued that the issues in the arbitration proceeding and the derivative action are substantially identical and that the stay is necessary to promote judicial efficiency and avoid unnecessary duplication of effort. The judge agreed, citing the Code of Civil Procedure and several case citations. The judge noted that the defendants had presented new facts and circumstances supporting the motion, including the procedural history of the case and a new filing by the arbitration claimants. The judge also noted that the plaintiffs and the arbitration claimants are represented by the same counsel and that the claims in both proceedings are similar. The judge concluded that the defendants had demonstrated sufficient identity of parties and issues to warrant the requested stay and that the plaintiffs had shown no countervailing prejudice that could result.
