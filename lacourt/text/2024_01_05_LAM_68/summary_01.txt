Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment in its entirety. The plaintiff, Victoria Williams, has alleged discrimination and retaliation by the Pasadena Area Community College District, but the judge has found that she has not demonstrated any triable issues of material fact regarding her claims.

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's claims of race and gender discrimination are time-barred, as they were filed after the one-year statute of limitations had expired. The judge has also found that the plaintiff has not established a prima facie case of discrimination, as she has not presented sufficient evidence of direct or indirect discrimination.

The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff's claims of retaliation are barred, as she has not demonstrated that she experienced an adverse employment action as a result of her complaints. The judge has further found that the plaintiff has not established a triable issue of fact concerning any retaliatory conduct.

Finally, the judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the plaintiff's claim for failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation, as the plaintiff has not demonstrated that there was any underlying discrimination or retaliation.
