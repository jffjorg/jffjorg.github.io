Kenneth E.
Follmar, III, et al.’s Application for a Preliminary Injunction 
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Kenneth E. Follmar, III, et al.’s Application for a
Preliminary Injunction is denied pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 526.
 
Background
 
Plaintiffs’ Complaint was filed on March 18, 2024.
Plaintiffs allege the following facts. Plaintiffs obtained a first lien
mortgage loan secured by the property located at 44 Buckskin Lane, Rolling
Hills Estates, CA 90274, through a Deed of Trust, recorded on May 5, 2016.
Plaintiffs suffered from financial hardship. On or around July 12, 2022, Plaintiffs
entered into a loan modification agreement with Bank of America. Thereafter,
Bank of America transferred the servicer rights to Selene Finance (“Selene”). Plaintiffs
requested a repayment plan with Selene, but Selene did not offer a plan that
Plaintiffs could manage. MTC Financial Inc. recorded a notice of default. Prior
to recording the NOD, Defendants did not contact Plaintiff to assess the
borrower’s financial situation and explore options for the borrower to avoid
foreclosure, as required by Civ. Code § 2923.5(b). Defendants did not provide a
single point of contact as required by Civ. Code § 2923.7.
 
Plaintiffs allege the following causes of action: 1. Violation
of Civ. Code § 2923.5; 2. Violation of Civ. Code § 2923.7; 3. Declaratory
Relief; 4. Violations of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq. 
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Defendant’s request for judicial notice is granted. The
Court may take judicial notice of recorded documents.  Evid. Code, § 452, subds. (c), (h); Yvanova v. New Century Mortg. Corp.
(2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 924, fn. 1. 
 
Application for Preliminary Injunction
 
            The legislature designed the
California Homeowner Bill of Rights Act (“HBOR”) to provide plaintiffs the
ability to obtain an injunction to enjoin foreclosure when there is a material
violation of HBOR.  With the first
through second causes of action, Plaintiffs have alleged HBOR claims.  
 
            Civ. Code, § 2924.19 states, in
material part:
            “(a)(1) If a trustee's deed upon
sale has not been recorded, a borrower may bring an action for injunctive
relief to enjoin a material violation of Section 2923.5, 2924.17, or 2924.18.
            (2) An injunction shall remain in
place and any trustee's sale shall be enjoined until the court determines that
the mortgage servicer, mortgagee, beneficiary, or authorized agent has
corrected and remedied the violation or violations giving rise to the action
for injunctive relief. An enjoined entity may move to dissolve an injunction
based on a showing that the material violation has been corrected and remedied.
            (b) After a trustee's deed upon sale
has been recorded, a mortgage servicer, mortgagee, beneficiary, or authorized
agent shall be liable to a borrower for actual economic damages pursuant to
Section 3281, resulting from a material violation of Section 2923.5, 2924.17,
or 2924.18 by that mortgage servicer, mortgagee, beneficiary, or authorized
agent where the violation was not corrected and remedied prior to the
recordation of the trustee's deed upon sale. If the court finds that the
material violation was intentional or reckless, or resulted from willful
misconduct by a mortgage servicer, mortgagee, beneficiary, or authorized agent,
the court may award the borrower the greater of treble actual damages or
statutory damages of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000).”
 
            In addition, pursuant to CC §
2924.12(a)(1): “If a trustee's deed upon sale has not been recorded, a borrower
may bring an action for injunctive relief to enjoin a material violation of
Section 2923.55, 2923.6, 2923.7, 2924.9, 2924.10, 2924.11, or 2924.17.”  In addition, injunctive relief is a remedy
available under the third cause of action for Violation of Business &
Professions Code § 17200.  Bus. &
Prof. Code § 17203.
            
            “In determining whether to issue a
preliminary injunction, the trial court considers two related factors: (1) the
likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits of its case at trial,
and (2) the interim harm that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the
injunction is denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to suffer
if the court grants a preliminary injunction. 
The latter factor involves consideration of such things as the
inadequacy of other remedies, the degree of irreparable harm, and the necessity
of preserving the status quo.”  14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT
Corp. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396, 1402.
 
            The court finds that Plaintiffs failed
to meet their burden to demonstrate a likelihood that Plaintiffs will prevail
on the merits of their case at trial. 
Plaintiffs failed to establish that Defendants committed a material
violation of HBOR.  Thus, Plaintiffs have
not met their burden to establish entitlement to injunctive relief to enjoin a
material violation of Civ. Code Sections 2923.5 and 2923.7.  CC § 2924.19(a)(3); CC § 2924.12(a)(1).  
 
            Plaintiffs allege material
violations of Sections 2923.5 and 2923.7 based on the self-serving conclusory
declaration of Plaintiff Kenneth Follmar.  However, the conclusions of violations of these
Sections are materially controverted with competent evidence by Defendant.
 
            Defendant has provided evidence to
show that Defendant complied with Section 2923.5. Section 2923.5(b) states that
a notice of default may not be recorded until a loan servicer has contacted or,
with due diligence, attempted to contact the borrower to discuss foreclosure
avoidance options. Here, Defendant did send Plaintiffs letters regarding
foreclosure avoidance options that contained the HUD toll-free telephone number
and made numerous attempts to speak to Plaintiffs by telephone. (Decl., Nik
Fox, ¶¶ 12-30; Exs. 4-16.)  In addition,
in numerous correspondences, Defendant identified a single point of contact in
compliance with CC § 2923.7. (Id.) Defendant’s submitted significant evidence
supported with accompanying documents showing material compliance with Sections
2923.5 and 2923.7. Again, Defendant’s evidence refutes Plaintiff’s own
self-serving declaration of alleged violations.
 
            As to the non-HBOR causes of action,
pursuant to Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a
likelihood of success on the merits. 
Plaintiffs failed to establish standing due to the underlying default in
their loan obligations. To establish standing for purposes of the UCL claim,
Plaintiffs must provide evidence to show a causal link between their economic
injury and Defendant’s alleged wrongful acts. 
Jenkins v. JP Morgan Chase Bank,
N.A. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 497 (disapproved on other grounds in
Yvanova v. New Century Mortg. Corp.
(2016) 62 Cal.4th 919).  Here,
Plaintiffs submitted no competent evidence to establish such a causal link. The
declaratory relief cause of action is based on an alleged existing controversy
pursuant to the alleged HBOR violations, and thus fails to establish a
likelihood of success on the merits for purposes of injunctive relief.   
 
            Thus, Plaintiffs failed to
demonstrate that they are likely to succeed on the merits.  Therefore, the interim harm that Defendant may
suffer if the injunction is granted is greater than Plaintiffs’ relative
harm.  
 
Thus, the application for a preliminary injunction is
denied. 
 
The temporary restraining order is hereby dissolved.
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
