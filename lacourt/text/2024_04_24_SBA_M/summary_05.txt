And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the application for a preliminary injunction filed by the plaintiffs (Kenneth E. Follmar, III, et al.) against the defendants (Selene Finance, LP, et al.). The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants committed material violations of the California Homeowner Bill of Rights (HBOR) and sought injunctive relief to enjoin a material violation of HBOR. However, the court found that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their case at trial. The court also found that the defendants complied with HBOR and that the plaintiffs failed to establish a causal link between their economic injury and the defendants' alleged wrongful acts. The court denied the application for a preliminary injunction and dissolved the temporary restraining order.
