And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted in part and denied in part Lashawna Nadreau's motions to compel Briana Flowers' and Brianna Hollens' responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demand for inspection and production of documents, Set One, and for monetary sanctions. The ruling is conditioned upon all parties waiving the defect in notice. The court notes that no notice was provided of the hearing date of April 24, 2024. The motions are granted due to Plaintiffs' failure to serve timely responses and failure to file written oppositions. The court orders Plaintiffs to serve responses without objection within 10 days of this date. The defendant's request for monetary sanctions is denied due to the failure to identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanctions are sought and failed to specify the type of sanctions sought.
