PROCEEDINGS
 
Calsafe
Research Center, Inc. v. Acadian Kitchen, LLC, et al.
23TRCV01517
1.      Calsafe Research Center, Inc.’s Motion to Approve
Settlement    
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Calsafe
Research Center, Inc.’s Motion to Approve Settlement is granted.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on May 12, 2023.
Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Defendant manufactures, packages,
distributes, markets, and/or sells consumer products that contain lead. Plaintiff
seeks to cause Defendant to warn consumers in California that they are being
exposed to lead pursuant to Proposition 65 - Health and Safety Code § 25249.5.
Plaintiff requests an injunction and civil penalties.
 
Motion to Approve Settlement
 
CCP § 664.6 states: “If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”
 
Health & Saf. Code, § 25249.7(f)(4) states, in
relevant part:
“If there is a settlement of an action brought by a
person in the public interest under subdivision (d), the plaintiff shall submit
the settlement, other than a voluntary dismissal in which no consideration is
received from the defendant, to the court for approval upon noticed motion, and
the court may approve the settlement only if the court makes all of the
following findings:
(A) The warning that is required by the settlement
complies with this chapter.
(B) The award of attorney's fees is reasonable under
California law.
(C) The penalty amount is reasonable based on the
criteria set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b).
 
Plaintiff contends that on
or about September 26, 2023, the parties finalized the terms of a settlement
and executed a proposed consent judgment which was forwarded to the attorney
general for reporting as required by the applicable statute. (Decl., Joseph R.
Manning, ¶¶ 9-10, Ex. B). The Court finds that the injunctive relief that is
required by the settlement complies with Proposition 65, codified in Health and
Safety Code Section 25249.5 et seq. The Court finds that the award of
attorneys’ fees of $29,250 is reasonable and that the penalty amount of $3,250.00
is reasonable under the criteria set forth in Section 25249.7(b)(2). 
 
Thus, the Court grants the
Motion to Approve Settlement and enters judgment in accordance with terms of
the consent judgment.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.
