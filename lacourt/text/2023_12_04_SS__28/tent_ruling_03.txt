PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to grant relief from waiver of jury trial. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
          “The court may, in its discretion upon just terms, allow a
trial by jury although there may have been a waiver of a trial by jury.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 631, subd. (g).) 
“Generally,
the failure to deposit jury fees at least 25 calendar days before the date
initially set for trial constitutes a waiver of the right to a jury trial.” (Tesoro
del Valle Master Homeowners Assn. v. Griffin (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 619,
638 (Tesoro), citing Code Civ. Proc., § 631, subds. (b) & (d)(5); Grafton
Partners v. Superior Court (2005) 36 Cal.4th 944, 956 (Grafton Partners).)
“Nonetheless, in the event of a waiver, the trial court retains discretion to
allow a trial by jury.”  (Ibid.,
citing Code Civ. Proc., § 631, subd. (e); Johnson–Stovall v. Superior Court
(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 808, 810 (Johnson-Stovall); Gann v. Williams
Brothers Realty, Inc. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1698, 1703–1704 (Gann).)
“In exercising such discretion, courts are mindful of the requirement ‘to
resolve doubts in interpreting the waiver provisions of section 631 in favor of
a litigant's right to jury trial. [Citations.]’” (Ibid., quoting Grafton
Partners, supra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 956.)  “Accordingly, ‘[w]here the right to jury is
threatened, the crucial focus is whether any prejudice will be suffered by any
party or the court if a motion for relief from waiver is granted. [Citation.] A
trial court abuses its discretion as a matter of law when “... relief has been
denied where there has been no prejudice to the other party or to the court
from an inadvertent waiver. [Citations.]” [Citations.]’” (Ibid., quoting
Wharton v. Superior Court (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 100, 104.) 
The
Court of Appeal in Tesoro held the trial court properly exercised its
discretion to permit a jury trial because “Tesoro demonstrated that it made an
inadvertent mistake by relying on the local rule timeline.” (Tesoro, supra,
200 Cal.App.4th at p. 638, citing Winston v. Superior Court (1987) 196
Cal.App.3d 600, 602–603 [inadvertent waiver shown where failure to post fees
occurred from inconsistency in the time requirement among statutes].) In
addition, the party opposing relief from the waiver had not demonstrated any
prejudice from a jury trial.  (Id.
at pp. 638-639, citing Johnson–Stovall, supra, 17 Cal.App.4th at
p. 811 [“The mere fact that trial will be by jury is not prejudice per se”]; Gann,
supra, 231 Cal.App.3d at p. 1704 [“The prejudice which must be shown
from granting relief from the waiver is prejudice from the granting of relief
and not prejudice from the jury trial”].) “‘The court abuses its discretion in
denying relief where there has been no prejudice to the other party or to the
court from an inadvertent waiver.’” (Id. at p. 639, quoting Gann,
supra, 231 Cal.App.3d at p. 1704.) 
DISCUSSION 
On
April 20, 2021 and May 26, 2021, Plaintiff filed demands for jury trial.  However, Plaintiff did not post jury fees by
the deadline.  Plaintiff has subsequently
posted jury fees. 
The
Court finds that no party will suffer prejudice as the result of granting
Plaintiff’s motion for relief from her inadvertent waiver of a jury trial. The
Court grants the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Angela Walker’s motion for relief from jury waiver. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
