PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Edison
Power requests that the Court reclassify the case as a limited civil case. 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 403.040 provides in part: 
“(a) The plaintiff, cross-complainant, or petitioner
may file a motion for reclassification within the time allowed for that party
to amend the initial pleading. The defendant or cross-defendant may file a
motion for reclassification within the time allowed for that party to respond
to the initial pleading. The court, on its own motion, may reclassify a case at
any time. A motion for reclassification does not extend the moving party’s time
to amend or answer or otherwise respond. The court shall grant the motion and
enter an order for reclassification, regardless of any fault or lack of fault,
if the case has been classified in an incorrect jurisdictional classification. 
“(b) If a party files a motion for reclassification
after the time for that party to amend that party’s initial pleading or to
respond to a complaint, cross-complaint, or other initial pleading, the court
shall grant the motion and enter an order for reclassification only if both of
the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The case is incorrectly classified. 
“(2) The moving party shows good cause for not seeking
reclassification earlier.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040,
subds. (a), (b).) 
          Limited civil cases include cases “in which the demand,
exclusive of interest, or the value of the property in controversy amounts to
twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) or less.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 86, subd. (a)(1).)   
“[A]
matter may be reclassified as a limited civil action ‘when (i) the absence of
jurisdiction is apparent before trial from the complaint, petition, or related
documents, or (ii) during the course of pretrial litigation, it becomes clear
that the matter will “necessarily” result in a verdict below the superior
court's jurisdictional amount . . . .’ ”  (Ytuarte v. Superior Court (2005) 129
Cal.App.4th 266, 276-277 (Ytuarte), quoting Walker v. Superior Court
(1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 262.)  “Even more
appropriately, ‘... the test [is] ... whether “lack of jurisdiction is clear”...'
[or] virtually unattainable....” ' ” (Id. at p. 277, quoting Walker,
supra, 53 Cal.3d at p. 269.)  “This
standard involves an evaluation of the amount fairly in controversy, not an
adjudication of the merits of the claim, and according to Walker,
requires a ‘high level of certainty that [the] damage award will not exceed
$25,000.’” (Ibid., quoting Walker, supra, 53 Cal.3d at p. 269.) “The Supreme
Court explained: ‘ “The [trial] court may believe it highly unlikely that
plaintiff will recover the amount demanded, but this is not enough to defeat
jurisdiction, unless it appears to a legal certainty that plaintiff cannot
recover the amount [of the] demand[ ]”.’ “  (Ibid., quoting Walker, supra,
53 Cal.3d at p. 270; see Maldonado v. Superior Court (1996) 45
Cal.App.4th 397, 402 [“The unlikeliness of a judgment in excess of $25,000 is
not the test. The trial court reviews the record to determine whether the
result is obtainable. Simply stated, the trial court looks to the possibility
of a jurisdictionally appropriate verdict, not to its probability”].) 
“Accordingly
under Walker the superior court must deny the motion to reclassify the
case as limited (and thus keep the matter in the unlimited civil court) unless
it appears to a legal certainty that the plaintiff's damages will necessarily
be less than $25,000. This standard of ‘legal certainty’ is not met when it
appears a verdict within the unlimited court's jurisdiction is ‘possible.’ ”  (Ytuarte, supra, 129 Cal.App.4th
at p. 277; see Singer v. Superior Court (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1320
[superior court abused its discretion in ordering case transferred to municipal
court where plaintiff sought damages for pain and suffering, creating possibility
that total damages could exceed municipal court’s jurisdictional limit].) 
JUDICIAL NOTICE 
          The Court grants Edison Power’s request for judicial notice
only of Exhibit A.  (Evid. Code, §§ 452,
subd. (d), 453.)  The Court denies the
request for judicial notice of Exhibits B-L. 
EDISON POWER’S EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS 
          Sustained: 1-3, 6
          Overruled: 4, 5, 7 
DISCUSSION 
A.   The complaint 
The
complaint alleges the following: 
On February
4, 2020, at or near Eighth Street and Grand View Street in Los Angeles, Cambell
was operating a motorized scooter eastbound on Eighth Street near Grand View Street.
 Defendant negligently merged into
Plaintiff’s lane of travel, colliding into Plaintiff’s motorized scooter.  Campbell, Southern California Edison, and Does
1-50 negligently entrusted, managed, maintained, operated, controlled and drove
the vehicle. 
As a
direct and proximate result of Defendants’ acts and omissions, Plaintiff was
hurt and physically injured, sustaining medical bills, loss of earnings, loss
of earning capacity, pain, suffering, loss of enjoyment of life and other
damages, as well as substantial property damage, loss of use, towing, storage
and other associated charges and damages, and will continue to sustain such
damages in the future. 
    B.   Parties’ arguments 
In its motion, Edison
Power asserts that Plaintiff “has submitted medicals of $2,715.00 with unknown
loss of wages.”  As a result, Edison
Power argues, “a recovery in excess of $25,000.00 is virtually unattainable and
therefore the matter should be reclassified.”  Edison Power cites Plaintiff’s discovery responses
showing medical expenses of $2,715 and a last day of treatment of April 8, 2020. Edison Power argues that “Plaintiff’s general damages, based on a last date of
treatment of April 8, 2020, do not support the classification of an unlimited
civil action matter as it pertains to Plaintiff’s Complaint.”  (Motion p. 3.)  Aside from a declaration repeating this
statement (Woods Dec. ¶ 16), Edison Power does not provide any evidence that Plaintiff's general damages -- together with other damages -- could not exceed $25,000. 
In
opposition, Plaintiff asserts that he has incurred more than $135,000 in medical
expenses as the result of the accident, making a verdict over $25,000 likely. 
In
its reply, Edison Power adjusts its figure for Plaintiff’s economic damages
upward, to $7,668.  However, Edison Power
argues that the remaining medical expenses that Plaintiff claims stem from a
subsequent accident and are not recoverable in this case.  Therefore, Edison Power argues,
reclassification is appropriate. 
C.   Analysis 
Edison
Power has not shown that “it appears to a legal certainty” that Plaintiff’s
damages – including general damages – will necessarily be less than $25,000.  The
Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Edison Power Constructors, Inc.’s motion to reclassify
the case as a limited civil case. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
