 Case Number:  22STCV20759    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2023    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows.  
BACKGROUND 
On
June 24, 2022, Un Chu Ko (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants
Zion Market and Does 1-20 for premises liability, 
On
July 27, 2022, Defendant 864 S. Vermont Ave. Inc. dba Zion Market (erroneously
named as Zion Market) (“Defendant”) filed an answer. 
On
April 19, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved
as counsel. 
On
November 8, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to continue trial to be heard on
December 4, 2023.  On November 27, 2023,
Plaintiff also filed a request to continue the trial. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for December 22, 2023. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Defendant
requests that the Court continue the trial to October 1, 2024.   Plaintiff requests that the Court continue the trial to November 18, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(b), provides that “a party seeking a continuance of
the date set for trial, whether contested or uncontested or stipulated to by
the parties, must make the request for a continuance by a noticed motion or an
ex parte application under the rules in chapter 4 of this division, with
supporting declarations. The party must make the motion or application as soon
as reasonably practical once the necessity for the continuance is discovered.” 
          Under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c), the Court may grant a continuance
only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.
Circumstances that may indicate good cause include “a party's excused inability
to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite
diligent efforts,” or the unavailability of a party, counsel, or expert due to
death, illness or other excusable circumstance. The Court should consider all
facts and circumstances relevant to the determination, such as proximity of the
trial date, prior continuances, prejudice suffered, whether all parties have
stipulated to a continuance, and whether the interests of justice are served.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) 

DISCUSSION 
Defendant
requests that the Court continue the trial date because Defendant has not received
discovery responses from Plaintiff.  In
addition, on October 16, 2023, the Court continued the hearings on Defendant’s motions
to compel Plaintiff’s discovery responses and to deem admitted matters
specified in requests for admission served on Plaintiff to January 5, 2024. 
Defendant
also asks that the Court reopen discovery, which closed on November 23, 2023.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).)  “Except as provided in [Code of Civil
Procedure] [s]ection 2024.050, a continuance or postponement of the trial date
does not operate to reopen discovery proceedings.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (b).)   
Although
Defendant has not filed a motion to reopen discovery under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2024.050, Plaintiff appears to agree with the request to
reopen discovery (as well as continue the trial).  (See Plaintiff’s November 27, 2023 filing,
page 5.)  When the parties agree to
reopen discovery, the Court may grant the request.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.060.) 
The Court finds good cause to continue the trial.  Based
on the Court’s finding of good cause and the parties’ agreement, the Court
grants the request to continue the trial and reopen discovery to correspond to
the new trial date. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS the motion to continue the trial and request to reopen discovery filed by Defendant
864 S. Vermont Ave. Inc. dba Zion Market (erroneously named as Zion Market).
 Trial is
continued to October 1, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 28 in the Spring
Street Courthouse. The Final Status Conference is continued to September 17,
2024, at 10:00 a.m.in Department 28 in the Spring Street Courthouse.  All related dates and deadlines will be based
on the new trial date. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
