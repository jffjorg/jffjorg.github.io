LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default
judgment 
“[With
exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party seeking a default judgment on
declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry of Default (Application to
Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following must be included in the
documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in unlawful detainer cases, a brief
summary of the case identifying the parties and the nature of plaintiff's
claim; 
“(2)  Declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A declaration of nonmilitary status for each
defendant against whom judgment is sought; 
“(6)  A proposed form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against
specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a
showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request for attorney fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
  On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
The
relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's default cannot exceed
the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal injury cases where
damages may not be stated in the complaint, the amount listed in the statement
of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a), 585, subd. (b).) “The notice
requirement of section 580 was designed to insure fundamental fairness.” (Becker
v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The
statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a default judgment have
adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken against them. [Citation.]
‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is taken against him, [the
defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a right to a hearing on the
matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A trial court exceeds its
jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the amount specified in the
complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p. 494; see Cal. Practice
Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258, p. 5-70.)  
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
has submitted a declaration from its insured stating that, as a result of the
accident, Plaintiff paid the insured $7,185.39 for the repair of property and
$100,000.00 for personal injuries, for a total sum of $107,185.39. 
Plaintiff
has also submitted a declaration from its custodian of records stating that Plaintiff made payments under the insured's
policy for uninsured medical bene¿ts in the amount of $100,000.00 and for the
repair of the property in the sum of $7,185.39, for a total sum of $107,185.39. 
Consistent
with these statements, the complaint demanded $107,185.39. 
Plaintiff's application for a default judgment, however, states that the demand of the
complaint is $7,185.39.  Plaintiff is
requesting judgment for that amount plus costs, for a total amount of $7,716.89. 
The
Court will assume that Plaintiff intends to seek a judgment that is $100,000
less than the amount demanded in the complaint. 
The application is complete and contains all required attachments.  The Court grants the application. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Allstate Northbrook Indemnity Company’s request for
default judgment filed on October 4, 2023.  The Court enters judgment of $7,716.89 against
Defendants Manuel C Carrillo and Myira
Alejandra Figueroa. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
