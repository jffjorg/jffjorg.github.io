 Case Number:  21STCV19834    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2023    Dept:  28 


Having considered the moving papers, the Court rules
  as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On May 26, 2021, Plaintiff Brianne Zamora
  (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Eric Russel Van Dyk and
  Does 1-50 for negligence. 
On January 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of Defendant
  Eric Russell Van Dyk’s death on June 29, 2021. 
On February 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amendment
  to the complaint stating that, having designated a defendant in the
  complaint by the incorrect name of Erick Russell Van Dyk and having
  discovered the true name of the defendant to be Estate of Erick Russell Van
  Dyk, deceased, Plaintiff was amending the complaint by substituting the true
  name for the incorrect name wherever it appears in the complaint. 
On May 3, 2023, Defendant Estate of Erick Russell
  Van Dyk, deceased (“Defendant”), filed an answer. 
On October 4, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel, James R.
  Doddy, filed a motion to be relieved as counsel to be heard on December 4,
  2023. 
No trial date is currently scheduled. 
COUNSEL’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff’s counsel, James R. Doddy, asks to be
  relieved as counsel. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
  Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed
  to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
  form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without compromising
  the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under
  Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent
  under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in
  Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
  service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order
  on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
  proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion
  to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw.  The motion should be granted if there is no
  prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.
  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) 
DISCUSSION 
Counsel has submitted MC-051, MC-052 and MC-053
  forms.  Counsel has provided a
  declaration stating that Plaintiff “is in breach of the attorney client
  agreement.” 
 Counsel stated
  that he served Plaintiff at her last known address but counsel did not
  provide a proof of service.  Counsel
  must submit proof of service on all parties that have appeared in this case,
  including Plaintiff.  (Cal. Rules of
  Court, rule 3.1362(d).) 
The Court denies the motion without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES the motion of Plaintiff’s counsel James
  R. Doddy to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. 
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Counsel is ordered to file the proof of service of
  this ruling with the Court within five days.
