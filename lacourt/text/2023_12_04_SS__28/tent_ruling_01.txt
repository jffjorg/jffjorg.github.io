  Case Number:  19STCV22033    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2023    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On

against Defendants College Hospital Cerritos, College Hospital Group, Inc.,
College Hospital, Inc., George Karamigios, M.D., Kiyo Teshima, RN, John Doe 1,
John Doe, 2, John Doe 3, John Doe 4, John Doe 5, and Does 6-25 for negligence,
battery, sexual battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
On
July 9, 2019, College Hospital Cerritos filed an answer. 
On
August 27, 2019, the Court appointed Jose Castillo to act as Plaintiff’s
guardian ad litem. 
On
June 30, 2021, the Court granted Plaintiff leave to file a first amended
complaint. 
On
July 1, 2021, College Hospital Cerritos filed an answer to the first amended
complaint. 
On
February 10, 2022, Plaintiff amended the first amended complaint to add
Defendant Kenneth Alan Converse as John Doe 1. 
On

On
June 7, 2023, Petitioner Jose Castillo (“Petitioner”) filed a petition to
approve the compromise of Plaintiff’s pending action, including a proposed
special needs trust.  The Court continued
the hearing from July 10, 2023 to October 19, 2023.   
On
October 19, 2023, the Court issued an order stating that the Court’s Probate
Legal Unit had reviewed the special needs trust instrument and identified several
issues.  The Court continued the hearing
to December 4, 2023 for Petitioner to submit an amended special needs trust
instrument. 
On
November 3, 2023, Petitioner submitted an amended proposed special needs trust. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Jose Castillo asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of
Plaintiff Jesus A. Castillo. 
DISCUSSION  
On
October 19, 2023, the Court ordered Petitioner to submit an amended special needs
trust instrument and continued the hearing.  Petitioner has filed an amended proposed special
needs trust.  The Court’s Probate Legal
Unit must review the amended proposed special needs trust before the Court can rule
on the petition.  The Court therefore
continues the hearing to give the Probate Legal Unit time to review the amended
proposed special needs trust.

CONCLUSION 
The
Court CONTINUES the hearing to approve the
petition to approve the compromise of the pending claims of Plaintiff Jesus A.
Castillo to January 5, 2024 at 1:30 p.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street
Courthouse. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
