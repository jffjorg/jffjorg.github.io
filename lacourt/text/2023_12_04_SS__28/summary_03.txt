And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has reviewed the moving papers and has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for relief from jury waiver filed by Plaintiff Angela Walker. Plaintiff had initially filed demands for a jury trial, but failed to post jury fees by the deadline, resulting in a waiver of the right to a jury trial. However, Plaintiff has since posted the required fees and argues that no party will suffer prejudice from granting relief from the waiver.

The Judge cites several California laws and court cases to support the decision, including California Code of Civil Procedure, section 631, and cases such as Tesoro del Valle Master Homeowners Assn. v. Griffin and Grafton Partners v. Superior Court.

The Judge finds that no party will suffer prejudice as a result of granting Plaintiff's motion, and therefore grants the motion for relief from jury waiver. The Court orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service with the Court within five days.
