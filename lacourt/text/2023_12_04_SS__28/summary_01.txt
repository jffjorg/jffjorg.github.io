And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge continues the hearing to approve the petition to approve the compromise of the pending claims of Plaintiff Jesus A. Castillo. The Court ordered Petitioner Jose Castillo to submit an amended special needs trust instrument and continued the hearing. Since Petitioner has filed an amended proposed special needs trust, the Court needs more time to review it. The Court therefore continues the hearing to January 5, 2024, to allow the Probate Legal Unit to review the amended proposed special needs trust.
