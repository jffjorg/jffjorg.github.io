Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

In this ruling, the court has sustained Defendant Ford Motor Company's demurrer to Plaintiff William Holmquist's third and fifth causes of action. The third cause of action alleges that Defendant failed to provide sufficient service literature and replacement parts, in violation of Civil Code Section 1793.2(a)(3). The court finds that Plaintiff's complaint does not adequately plead facts supporting this claim, and therefore sustains the demurrer with leave to amend.

The fifth cause of action alleges fraud and concealment by Defendant. The court finds that Plaintiff's complaint does not plead sufficient facts to support this claim, specifically lacking details regarding the alleged misrepresentations and/or nondisclosures, and the intent to defraud. The court sustains the demurrer to this cause of action with leave to amend.

Additionally, the court grants Defendant's motion to strike Plaintiff's request for punitive damages, finding that punitive damages are not available under the Song-Beverly Act. The court also grants Defendant's motion to strike Plaintiff's request for punitive damages, as punitive damages are not available for Plaintiff's other causes of action.
