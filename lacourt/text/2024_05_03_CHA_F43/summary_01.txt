English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to a motion to consolidate two cases related to a single motor vehicle collision. The Judge grants the motion, finding that the cases are related and consolidation would promote judicial economy. The motion was filed by the Gallegos Plaintiffs, who are seeking an order to consolidate their case with that of Angel Sanchez, another plaintiff. The Judge considered the factors outlined in CCP ยง 1048(a) and found that the motion was timely, the cases were not complex, and no party would be prejudiced by the consolidation. The Judge also addressed the concerns of Defendant Los Angeles Truck Centers, LLC, which argued that consolidation would deprive it of its right to a fair jury trial. The Judge found that consolidation would not deprive the defendant of its right to a fair trial and granted the motion to consolidate the cases.
