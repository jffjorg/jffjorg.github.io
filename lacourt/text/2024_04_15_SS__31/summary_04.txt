Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Defendant Mini Mart's motion for judgment on the pleadings. Mini Mart had argued that the complaint did not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action against it. The judge found that the complaint adequately alleged a cause of action against Mini Mart based on the allegations of negligence and vicarious liability. The judge also denied Mini Mart's request for judicial notice of certain documents. The judge noted that the issues of fact and law raised by Mini Mart's motion are more appropriate for resolution at a trial or summary judgment hearing, rather than on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.
