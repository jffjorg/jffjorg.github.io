```

And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for sanctions, citing defects in the proof of service. The proof of service fails to specify what documents were served on the parties, and does not indicate that the other parties who have appeared in the action have been properly served. The defendant is ordered to give notice, and the parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement. The parties are also encouraged to submit to the tentative ruling by email, and failure to do so may result in the Court taking the motion off calendar.
