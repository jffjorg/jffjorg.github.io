The complaint alleges that on April 30, 2018, Plaintiff sustained injury while walking on a driveway near Serrano and 6th Street in Los Angeles because of an unsafe condition.   Plaintiff reserved a “Hearing on Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Default and Default Judgment (CCP 473.5)” for April 15, 2024. However, upon review of the motion, Plaintiff appears to be seeking a trial continuance due to medical reasons. However, the Court notes that it has provided Plaintiff multiple continuances within the past year due to medical reasons. Considering the age of this action, and the number of previously granted continuances, and the fact that the current trial date was specifically requested by the Plaintiff, the Court finds no good cause to continue delaying trial.   Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request to continue the trial date is DENIED. This action is now over 5 years old, with trial to commence on this hearing’s date on April 15, 2024. Plaintiff must prepare for trial accordingly.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 12th day of April 2024      Hon.
