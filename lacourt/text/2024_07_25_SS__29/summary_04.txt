```

Summary:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to withdraw admissions made as a result of the January 17 and May 16 court orders. The plaintiff had served unverified responses to Requests for Admission and the court had deemed them admitted. The plaintiff's argument that the admissions were made in error is rejected, but the court finds that the admissions were the result of the plaintiff's mistake and therefore grants the motion. The withdrawal is conditioned upon the plaintiff serving verified and code-compliant responses to the requests for admission by a certain date.
