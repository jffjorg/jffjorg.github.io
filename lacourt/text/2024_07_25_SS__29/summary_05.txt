And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court will hear from counsel. The case involves a slip and fall incident that occurred on November 3, 2020, at a Food 4 Less store in Bell Gardens. The plaintiff, Ana Maria Vasquez, filed a complaint on October 3, 2022, against Food 4 Less of California, Inc dba Food 4 Less and others. The defendant filed an answer on November 9, 2022. The court previously dismissed all claims against The Kroger Co. on May 12, 2023.

The plaintiff served a Fourth Notice of Taking PMK Depositions on March 19, 2024, which noticed the deposition for April 9, 2024. The notice sets forth eight topics for examination, including policies and procedures, video cameras, employee witnesses, and substantially similar prior slip and falls at the subject location and other locations. The defendant objected to the notice and did not produce a PMQ witness or witnesses for deposition on the noticed date.

The plaintiff filed a motion to compel the defendant's deposition on the topics in the notice and also requests monetary sanctions. The defendant produced witnesses for deposition as to certain topics on May 7 and 22, 2024, but there appeared to be continuing disputes as to Topics 7 and 8 in the Fourth Deposition Notice.

The court will hear from counsel as to whether these disputes have been resolved through the meet and confer process following the informal discovery conference. The court notes that the defendant's production of witnesses for deposition as to certain topics does not make the entire motion moot.
