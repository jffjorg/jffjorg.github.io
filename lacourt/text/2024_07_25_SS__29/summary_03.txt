```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff without prejudice due to the defendant's failure to comply with all statutory requirements. The defendant had repeatedly served the plaintiff with notices of deposition, but the plaintiff failed to appear for the deposition. However, the defendant failed to provide evidence that it had contacted the plaintiff to inquire about her nonappearance, as required by the California Code of Civil Procedure. The judge ruled that the defendant is entitled to take the deposition of the plaintiff, but must satisfy all statutory requirements to obtain a court order compelling the plaintiff's attendance. The motion is denied without prejudice, and the defendant is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
