 Case Number:  21STCV34819    Hearing Date:   July 25, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Compel the Deposition of Plaintiff filed by
Defendant Ralphs Grocery Company dba Ralphs.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice for
failure to comply with all statutory requirements.
Background
On September
21, 2021, Irma Yolanda Veliz Morales (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Ralphs Grocery Company, Alpha Beta Company, The Kroger C., Matthew Higa and
Does 1 through 50 for negligence and premises liability causes of action
arising out of a slip and fall occurring on September 30, 2019.
 
On
January 5, 2023, Ralphs Grocery Company dba Ralphs (“Defendant”) filed an
answer.
 
On May 31, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel
was relieved as counsel.
 
Defendant has repeatedly noticed the deposition of
Plaintiff, but Plaintiff has not appeared yet for her deposition.
 
On June 20, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to compel
the deposition of Plaintiff. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280, subd.
(a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
Section
2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  
Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).)  
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
Discussion
Defendant
served Plaintiff with several notices of deposition, with the most recent
notice setting the deposition for April 15, 2024. (Odabachian Decl., ¶¶ 4-7.)
Plaintiff failed to appear for the April 15, 2024 deposition. (Id., ¶ 7.)
 
Defendant
presents no evidence, however, that it “contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance,” as is required under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450,
subdivision (b). 
Defendant
is unquestionably entitled to take the deposition of Plaintiff.  But to obtain a court order compelling
Plaintiff to attend her deposition, Defendant must satisfy all statutory
requirements.  Defendant has not done so.
Accordingly.
The motion is denied without prejudice
Conclusion
 
The Court
DENIES without prejudice Defendant’s motion to compel the deposition of
Plaintiff.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
