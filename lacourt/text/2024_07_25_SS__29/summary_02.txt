And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion by defendants Venco Power Sweeping, Inc. and Menahem Roberto Solares to admit attorney Stephen C. Haynes to appear pro hac vice in this case. Haynes is an attorney from Texas, admitted to practice in the federal courts of Texas, and has been retained by the defendants. The judge found that all procedural and substantive requirements were met, including the filing of a written application, notice to all interested parties, and a $50.00 application fee to the State Bar Association in San Francisco. The plaintiff had argued that Haynes's declaration was insufficient, but the judge did not find this to be a sufficient reason to deny the motion. As a result, the motion is granted, and Haynes is allowed to appear pro hac vice in this case.
