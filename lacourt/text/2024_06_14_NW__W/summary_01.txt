And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants Plaintiff Karen Soronow's motion to compel production and for sanctions against Defendant Sunshine's Place II. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant failed to produce all responsive documents and failed to conduct a diligent search and reasonable inquiry. The court finds that supplemental responses are required to explain the nature of the renewed search and the fact that no documents were discovered. The court also grants Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,000.00 payable within 30 days.
