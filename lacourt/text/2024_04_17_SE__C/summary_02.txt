And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing to May 15, 2024, at 10:30 a.m. in Department SE-C. The defendants, H.P. Palomino, Inc. and Rafiq Shah, had filed a demurrer to the nine causes of action in the second amended complaint, alleging that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action and is uncertain. The defendants' counsel claimed to have made meet-and-confer efforts, but failed to demonstrate that these efforts were made after the second amended complaint was filed. As a result, the court has continued the hearing to allow the parties to meet and confer before the new hearing date.
