TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff Del Rio 7444, LLC’s Motion for Summary Judgment
is GRANTED. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
This motion is unopposed as of April 15, 2024. 
 
 
 
Background
 
This is an unlawful detainer action over a commercial tenancy.
On January
9, 2024, plaintiff Del Rio 7444, LLC filed a complaint alleging one cause of
action for unlawful detainer. Plaintiff
alleges that defendants Tacos N Miches, LLC and Juan Gonzales owe plaintiff
$17,021.20 in unpaid rent for the lease of a
property owned by Plaintiff. 
 
Plaintiff
moves for summary judgment as to the cause of action for unlawful detainer. 
 
Legal Standard
 
“[A] motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the
papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact
and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” (Code
of Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)  The
moving party bears the initial burden of production to make a prima facie
showing no triable material fact issues. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850.)  If the
moving party meets this burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party to make
a converse prima facie showing that a triable issue of material fact
exists. (Ibid.)  
 
Plaintiffs may shift the burden of proof by submitting
evidence as to every element of the cause of action. (Code Civ. Pro., §437c,
subd. (p)(1); WRI Opportunity Loans II, LLC v. Cooper (2007) 154
Cal.App.4th 525, 532.) Unlike former law, it is not plaintiff’s burden to
disprove affirmative defenses asserted by the defendant. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) 
 
Unlawful Detainer
 
Plaintiff
has moved for summary judgment on the basis that all the elements for unlawful
detainer have been met and the undisputed facts show that there is no triable
issue of material fact as to this cause of action. 
 
The
elements of unlawful detainer for nonpayment of rent are the following: “(1)
the tenant is in possession of the premises; (2) that possession is without
permission; (3) the tenant is in default for nonpayment of rent; (4) the tenant
has been properly served with a written three-day notice; and (5) the default
continues after the three-day notice period has elapsed.” (Kruger v. Reyes
(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th Supp. 10, 16.) 
 
Here,
the first two elements are met because Defendant is in possession of the
premises, and Defendant has refused to relinquish possession of the premises,
despite Plaintiff’s termination of the lease after the Three-Day Notice Period
had run. (Decl. Matoba, ¶ 12.) The third element is met because Defendant is in
default for failure to pay the rent from August 2023 and on. (Decl. Matoba, ¶¶
10, 11.) The fourth element is met because Plaintiff has provided proof that it
served Defendant with the required written three-day notice on November 20,
2023, and that the notice complied with the requirements under California law. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1161(2); Decl. Matoba, ¶¶ 8,9, Ex. D.) The fifth element is met
because Defendant’s nonpayment continued after the three-day notice period, as
the $17,021.20 has not been paid. (Decl. Matoba, ¶ 11.)
 
Plaintiff
has shown that there is no triable issue of material fact as to the unlawful
detainer cause of action. The burden shifts to defendants to prove a triable
issue of material fact exists, but the motion is unopposed. 
 
Thus, the motion is GRANTED.
