And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in the unlawful detainer action. The plaintiff, Del Rio 7444, LLC, alleges that the defendant, Juan Gonzales, ET AL, owes the plaintiff $17,021.20 in unpaid rent for the lease of a property owned by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has moved for summary judgment on the basis that all the elements for unlawful detainer have been met and there is no triable issue of material fact as to this cause of action. The defendant has not opposed the motion. The court finds that the plaintiff has shown that there is no triable issue of material fact as to the unlawful detainer cause of action, and therefore the motion is granted.
