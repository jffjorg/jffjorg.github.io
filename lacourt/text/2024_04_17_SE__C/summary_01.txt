The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of ROMO v. SOTO, ET AL. The Defendant, Juan Soto, has moved to dismiss the trademark infringement action. The Judge has denied the motion. The Judge notes that the Defendant has not made clear on what grounds he is moving to dismiss the action. The Judge also notes that an action can be dismissed for delay in prosecution if service is not made within two years after the action is commenced against the defendant, or if the action is not brought to trial within five years. The Judge also cites several court cases, including Barragan v. Banco BCH (1986) and Mesecher v. County of San Diego (1992), to support the denial of the motion to dismiss.
