Background
This is a public nuisance action over real
property located at 10325 California Avenue, South Gate, California 90280. The
subject property contains five structures: a commercial property of 782 square
feet; a garage structure of 560 square feet; and three accessory structures of
approximately 130, 120, and 58 square feet. (Petition, ¶ 12.) The subject
property has impermissibly been used as a residential property with the
commercial and garage structure converted into several dwelling units and
accessory structures rented to unsuspecting tenants. (Petition, ¶ 13.) 
 
On May 17, 2023, the City of South Gate
inspected the subject property and found that its conditions threatened the
life and safety of its occupants, neighbors, and the public. (Petition, ¶ 17.) The
conditions included the following: substandard buildings, general dilapidation,
improper maintenance, unpermitted construction, improper occupancy, dilapidated
construction materials, inadequate sanitation, no proper kitchen, inadequate
bathroom, temporary wiring, exposed electrical wiring, exposed electrical switches
and outlets, lack of carbon monoxide detectors, lack of smoke alarms, junk and
debris, overgrown or dead weeds and vegetation, inadequate emergency egress,
improper water heater, and inoperable vehicles. (Petition, ¶ 19.) 
 
On August 14, 2023, the City of South Gate
petitioned for appointment of a receiver. On October 20, 2023, the Court
entered default as to Respondent De La Cruz. 
On December 15, 2023, the Court granted Petitioner City of South Gate’s
ex parte application for appointment of a receiver pursuant to Health and
Safety Code section 17980.7. It granted the order appointing a receiver the
same day. 
 
Motion to Set Aside
Default
 
Respondent
De La Cruz moves to set aside default entered against him on October 20, 2023
pursuant to CCP § 473(d).
 
At
any time, “[t]he court…may, on motion of either party after notice to the other
party, set aside any void judgment or order.” (CCP §473(d).) 
 
On
October 10, 2023, City of South Gate filed proof of substituted service upon
Respondent De La Cruz.  The evidence
reflects that on September 11, 2023., a copy of the Complaint and Summons were
left with a co-occupant at Respondent De La Cruz’s residence.  The documents were served by mail on September
12, 2023.  Under CCP §415.20(b), service
is deemed complete 10 days after mailing, or on September 22, 2023.  Before Plaintiff may apply for entry of
default, the time allowed for responding to the complaint must have
expired.  Here, that period expired 30
days after September 22, 2023, or on October 22, 2023.  Because October 22, 2023 was a Sunday, the
time to respond was extended to Monday October 23, 2023. The default entered on
October 20, 2023 was premature and is void per statute. 
 

Motion for Entry of
Order
 
The receiver moves for
an order to do the following: (1) proceed with the remediation plan for the
subject property; (2) borrow funds; and (3) retain a real estate broker to sell
the property. 
 
Because the Court has granted Respondent’s
Motion to Set Aside Default, Receiver’s motion is DENIED.  The December 15, 2023 order appointing a
receiver is VACATED.
