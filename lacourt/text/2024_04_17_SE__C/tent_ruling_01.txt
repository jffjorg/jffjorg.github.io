TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Defendant in Pro Per
Juan Soto’s motion to dismiss is DENIED. 
 
Moving Party to give
NOTICE.
 
 
This is a trademark infringement
action. Defendant in Pro Per Juan Soto moves to dismiss the
action. However, it is not clear on what grounds Soto moves to dismiss the
action.   
 
The court may dismiss
an action for delay in prosecution where service is not made within two years
after the action is commenced against the defendant. (Code Civ. Proc., §
583.420, subd. (a)(1).) In addition, an action shall be dismissed by the
court on its own motion or on the motion of the defendant if the action is not
brought to trial within five years. (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.360.)
 
Separately,
a motion to dismiss may be substituted for a demurrer as the first pleading. (Barragan
v. Banco BCH (1986) 188 Cal.App.3d 283, 299.) If denied, it is treated as
an overruled demurrer. (Ibid.)
 
Soto asserts that he has discovered facts
to support this motion and Plaintiff’s allegations are unmeritorious and solely
to harass him. But that is not the law. Further, a judge in a civil case is not
"'obligated to seek out theories [a party] might have advanced, or to
articulate … that which … [a party] has left unspoken.'"  (Mesecher v. County of San Diego (1992)
9 Cal.App.4th 1677, 1686.)
 
Thus, the motion is DENIED.
