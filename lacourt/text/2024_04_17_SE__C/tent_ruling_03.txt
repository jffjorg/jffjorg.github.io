Sunny Kim’s motion to quash service of summons of Nellis Building Services,
Inc. is GRANTED. The motion to quash service of summons of Base Hills, Inc. dba
Jan Point and Sunny Kim is STRICKEN.  
 
Moving Party to give
NOTICE.
 
The motion is unopposed
as of April 15, 2024. 
 
 
This is an employment law action. Specially Appearing Defendants Base Hills, Inc. dba Jan Point; Nellis
Building Service, Inc.; and Sunny Kim move to quash service of summons served on them. 
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Specially Appearing Defendants request the
court to take judicial notice of the “right to sue notice” issued by Nevada
Equal Rights Commission on January 25, 2023 under California Evidence Code
section 452, subdivision (h). 
 
The Court grants judicial notice based on
California Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (c).
 
Quash Service of Summons
 
Specially Appearing
Defendants move to quash service of summons on the grounds that the court lacks
personal jurisdiction over named defendant Nellis Building Service, Inc.
Specially Appearing Defendants also move on the grounds that the court lacks
subject matter jurisdiction over all three named defendants. 
 
          Personal Jurisdiction
 
Due process allows
state courts to assert personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants who
were served with process elsewhere only if those defendants have such minimum
contacts with the state to ensure that an assertion of jurisdiction will not
violate “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.” (Aquila, Inc. v. Super. Ct. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 556,
568.) When jurisdiction is
challenged by a nonresident defendant, the burden of proof is upon the
plaintiff to demonstrate that “minimum contacts” exist between defendant and
the forum state to justify imposition of personal jurisdiction. (Mihlon v.
Super. Ct. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 703, 710.) This may be done through
presentation of declarations, with opposing declarations received in
response. (Aquila, Inc. v. Super. Ct. (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 556, 568.)
 
Here, Plaintiff
alleges that defendant Nellis Building Services, Inc. is a Nevada Corporation
with its principal place of business in Clark County, Nevada. (Compl., ¶ 7.) Specially
Appearing Defendants argue that minimum contacts do not exist between named
defendant Nellis Building Services, Inc. and the state of California. 
 
This motion is
unopposed. Thus, Plaintiff has not met his burden to demonstrate that minimum
contacts exist between named defendant Nellis Building Service, Inc. 
 
          Subject Matter Jurisdiction
 
Lack of subject matter jurisdiction cannot be raised in a special
appearance by a motion to quash service of summons. (Greener v. Workers’
Comp. Appeals. Bd. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1028, 1036-1037.) The motion to quash
service of summons lies on the ground that the court lacks personal, not
subject matter, jurisdiction. (Id. at 1036.) 
 
Thus, Specially Appearing Defendants’ arguments about lack of subject
matter jurisdiction over all three defendants is STRICKEN. 
 
The motion is GRANTED in part and STRICKEN in part.
