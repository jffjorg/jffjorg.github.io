 Case Number:  22NWCV01502    Hearing Date:   April 17, 2024    Dept:  C VICTOR FUENTES v. H.P. PALOMINO, INC., ET AL.
CASE NO.:  22NWCV01502
HEARING:   4/17/24 @ 9:30 A.M.
#1
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendants H.P. Palomino, Inc. and Rafiq
Shah’s demurrer is CONTINUED.  
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
This
is a wage-and-hour employment law action. Defendants H.P. Palomino, Inc., and
Rafiq Shah demur to the nine causes of action in the second amended complaint
on the grounds that they do not state facts sufficient to constitute causes of
action and the pleading is uncertain. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Defendants did not satisfy
the meet-and-confer requirements. (Code. Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) Defendants’
counsel stated that he submitted declarations on February 8, 2023 and May 17,
2023 attesting to the meet and confer efforts he made. (Decl. Orloff, ¶ 2.) But
Defendants’ counsel has not stated he met and conferred after the second
amended complaint was filed on September 13, 2023.   
 
Based on this, the
Court CONTINUES the hearing to Wednesday, May 15, 2024, at 10:30 A.M. in Dept.
SE-C. The parties are to meet and confer before then and Defendants are to
submit a declaration attesting that the parties met and conferred.
