The background of the case involves a public nuisance action over a property located at 10325 California Avenue in South Gate, California. The property has been used as a residential property with commercial and garage structures converted into dwelling units, and is in a state of disrepair, posing a threat to the life and safety of occupants, neighbors, and the public. The Court's decision is based on the statute cited in California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 473(d), which allows the court to set aside any void judgment or order.
