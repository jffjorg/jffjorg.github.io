WILLIAM R. HESS,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
MOOSA MOADEL, 
                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  24STCV04475
  Hearing Date:  January 8, 2025
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motions to compel responses 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On February 22, 2024, Plaintiff
William R. Hess filed this negligence action against Defendant Moosa Moadel
stemming from an auto accident. 
            On November 12, 2024, Defendant
filed the instant three motions to compel responses to interrogatories and
requests for production. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Discovery responses are due 30 days after
service of the requests, unless the parties stipulate or the court orders
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a).) If a
responding party fails to respond in time, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling the responses or deeming matters admitted. (Id., §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b), 2033.280(b).) The responding party also waives its
objections. (Id., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a).)  
 
 
DISCUSSION 
            Defendant served the subject
discovery on April 16, 2024. (Mahlstedt Decl. ¶ 6.) Plaintiff has not served
responses to date. (Id., ¶ 12.) Thus, an order compelling the responses
is warranted. 
Defendant is also entitled to sanctions as
Plaintiff provides no substantial justification. Defense counsel claims a
reasonable hourly rate of $250. (See Mahlstedt Decl. ¶ 9.) Given the simplicity
and identical nature of the motions, the Court finds 2 hours to be reasonable
for all three motions. Defendant additionally incurred $180 in filing fees. (Id.,
¶ 10.) Thus, the Court awards $680 in total. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motion to compel
responses is GRANTED. Plaintiff shall provide responses to the subject
discovery within 15 days of this order. The Court sanctions Plaintiff and his
counsel in the total amount of $680, to be paid within 30 days of this order.
