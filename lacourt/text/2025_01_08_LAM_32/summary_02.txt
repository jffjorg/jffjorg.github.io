And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Heritage Auctioneers & Galleries, Inc.'s motion to uphold the confidential designation of 10 documents produced in discovery. The documents consist of settlement communications between Heritage and a third party, which Heritage argues justify the confidential designation under the protective order. The judge has granted the motion, finding that the documents deserve confidential protection as settlement communications. The judge rejected Plaintiffs' argument that Heritage failed to satisfy the requirements for sealing court records under Rules of Court, Rule 2.550, noting that this is not a motion to seal court records but rather a motion to uphold the confidential designation of records produced in discovery.
