And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the evidence presented by the parties and has made a tentative ruling on the motion to compel arbitration. The defendant, The Lobster LLC, has moved to compel arbitration of the action brought by the plaintiff, Donna Pociecha. The judge has found that the defendant has met its burden of proving that the plaintiff signed an arbitration agreement on May 1, 2015.

The judge has also found that the arbitration agreement includes a clear and unmistakable delegation clause, which delegates issues of arbitrability to the arbitrator. The judge has determined that the delegation clause is not unconscionable or otherwise revocable.

Accordingly, the judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and has ordered the plaintiff to arbitrate the action against the defendant. The judge has also stayed the entire action pending the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator will determine whether the action or any part of it is not arbitrable.
