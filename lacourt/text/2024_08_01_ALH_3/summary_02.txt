And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant's motion for sanctions against Plaintiff. The plaintiff brought an unlawful detainer action against the defendant, alleging that the property is exempt from the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 and that the defendant has failed to comply with the notice provisions. The defendant argues that the action is baseless and that the plaintiff is attempting to harass him.

The judge agrees with the defendant that the action is frivolous and that the plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence to support his claims. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's counsel has failed to sign the complaint, which is a violation of California Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7.

As a result, the judge grants the defendant's motion for sanctions and imposes a penalty of $30,450 on the plaintiff. The penalty is calculated based on the amount of time spent by the defendant's counsel on the case, which is 87 hours at an hourly rate of $350. The judge also orders the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs and attorney's fees.

The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 128.5 and 128.7, which provide for sanctions against parties who bring frivolous or harassing actions. The judge finds that the plaintiff's action is frivolous and that the plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence to support his claims. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's counsel has failed to sign the complaint, which is a violation of California Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is a significant victory for the defendant and a setback for the plaintiff. The ruling demonstrates the importance of providing evidence to support claims and the need to comply with procedural rules, such as the requirement that a complaint must be signed by counsel.
