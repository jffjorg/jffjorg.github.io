[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: PLAINTIFF’S MOTIONS TO COMPEL DISCOVERY RESPONSES; REQUEST
   FOR SANCTIONS

  2024



 
On February 20 and March 8, 2024,
plaintiff Mary Swanston, by and through her successor-in-interest, Jack I.
Martin, III (“Plaintiff”), filed these motions for orders compelling defendant
Argiri Bratakos (“Defendant”) to serve responses to Special Interrogatories,
Set One, and Request for Identification and Production of Documents, Set One. 
Where a party fails to serve timely
responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling
responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives
any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the
protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a),
2031.300, subd. (a).) The Code of Civil Procedure provides that the court shall
impose a monetary sanction against the party who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with substantial
justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
Plaintiff served these discovery
requests on December 5, 2023. In late-filed opposition briefs filed on July 25,
2024, Defendant argues that these motions will be moot because responses will
be served before the hearing. However, Plaintiff makes clear in their reply
briefs that responses have not yet been served and, therefore, Defendant must
be ordered to serve responses. Based on the papers, it is undisputed that
responses have not yet been served and even if they were, Plaintiff’s request
for sanctions would still be considered. (CRC 3.1348(a) [sanctions may be
awarded under in favor of party moving to compel discovery even if requested
discovery was provided after the motion was filed].) 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motions are
GRANTED and Defendant is ordered to serve verified responses, without
objection, to Special Interrogatories, Set One and Request for Identification
and Production of Documents, Set One, within 10 days of the date of this
hearing. Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,460 for
each motion is excessive. Therefore, the request for sanctions is GRANTED in
part and imposed against Defendant in the reduced amount of $820 for 2 hours
at a
 reasonable hourly rate of $350
and $120
in filing fees, to be paid within 10 days of the date of this Order.
Moving party to give notice.
Dated
this 1st
day of August 2024
