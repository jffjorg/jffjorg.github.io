And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a employment discrimination action filed by Terri Johnson against Paramount Global, Inc. et al. The plaintiff moves to compel further responses to special interrogatories propounded to the defendant, CBS Broadcasting, Inc. The defendant objects to the requests, claiming they are vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence.

The court finds that the plaintiff's request to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 3 and 7 is GRANTED to the extent described herein and otherwise DENIED. The court also finds that the plaintiff's request to compel further responses to Special Interrogatory No. 8 is GRANTED to the same limited extent as Special Interrogatory No. 7.

The court orders the defendant to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections within 30 days of this order. The court's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, which provides that a court may order a party to serve a further response to an interrogatory when the court finds that the answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. The court also cites several California and federal court cases in its ruling.
