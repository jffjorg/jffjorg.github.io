And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to set aside the dismissal of the cross-complaint filed by Susannah C. Bernard. The motion was filed on August 19, 2024, more than six months after the dismissal was entered on February 6, 2024. The judge found that the six-month period under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) commences on the date of the dismissal, and therefore the motion is not timely. The judge also ruled that the cross-complainant's failure to attend the August 14, 2024 hearing was not a basis for seeking relief from the six-month deadline. As a result, the Court denies the motion to set aside the dismissal.
