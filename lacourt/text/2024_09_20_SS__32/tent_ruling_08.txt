BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff
Ernesto Figueroa filed this action arising out of a dog bite on May 19, 2018
against Defendants Robert Harang, Robin Harang, Susana Bernard, and Does
1-20.  
 
On
June 14, 2021, Cross Complainant Susannah Bernard aka Susana Bernard (“Cross
Complainant”) filed a First Amended Verified Cross Complaint (FACC) against
Cross Defendants Ronald Harang, Robin Harang, Shawdae Harang, Assad Ali, Yvette
Geater, and Roes 1-20.
 
On
February 6, 2024, at an OSC re: dismissal for failure to enter default
judgments on the complaint and cross-complaint, the Court ordered the amended
cross complaint dismissed without prejudice. (Min. Order, 2/6/24.) 
 
On
June 5, 2024, Cross-Complainant filed a motion under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473(b) setting aside and vacating the dismissal on February 6, 2024. The
hearing for that motion was originally scheduled for July 29, 2024. Cross-Complainant
was present at that hearing, and the Court continued the motion to August 14,
2024. (Min. Order, 7/29/24.) 
 
At
the August 14, 2024 hearing, there were no appearances and the motion was
placed off calendar. (Min. Order, 8/14/24.) 
 
On
August 19, 2024, Cross-Complainant filed the instant motion to set aside the
February 6, 2024 dismissal under Civil Procedure section 473(b). No opposition
has been filed. 
 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473(b), the Court may relieve a party from a
dismissal taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.  This application must
be filed no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is
sought, and must contain an affidavit of fault demonstrating the moving party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
 
A mistake
is a basis for relief under section 473 when by reason of the mistake a party
failed to make a timely response.  Surprise occurs when a party is
unexpectedly placed in a position to his injury without any negligence of his
own. Excusable neglect is a basis for relief when the party has shown some
reasonable excuse for the default.  (Credit Managers Association of
California v. National Independent Business Alliance (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d
1166, 1173; Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892, 905.)  Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, the moving party bears the burden of
demonstrating an excusable ground, such as fraud or mistake, justifying a
court’s vacating a judgment.  (Basinger v. Roger & Wells (1990)
220 Cal.App.3d 16, 23–24.)   
 
Relief under
this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault;
otherwise, it is discretionary. (Id.) However mandatory relief is only
available when a party fails to oppose a dismissal motion (“which are
procedurally equivalent to a default”). (Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89
Cal.App.4th 603, 620.) The mandatory relief provision
does not apply to dismissals for “failure to prosecute [citations omitted], dismissals
for failure to serve a complaint within three years [citations omitted],
dismissals based on running of the statute of limitations [citations omitted],
and voluntary dismissals entered pursuant to settlement [citations omitted]”,
as well as “discretionary dismissals based on the failure to file an amended
complaint after a demurrer has been sustained with leave to amend, at least
where, as here, the dismissal was entered after a hearing on noticed motions
which required the court to evaluate the reasons for delay in determining how
to exercise its discretion.” (Id.)   
 
DISCUSSION
 
            This
motion is not timely because it was not filed within six months after the cross
complaint was dismissed. Cross-Complainant cites to Save Our Forest &
Ranchlands v. County of San Diego (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1757, 1770, for the
assertion the six-month period under section 473(b) “does not commence until
the opposing party takes some action based on the missed time limit (e.g.,
motion to dismiss) or a court order is made as a result thereof.” (Motion, 6.)
However, that rule applies to relief from failure to meet procedural time
limits. (See Save Our Forest & Ranchlands, supra, 50
Cal.App.4th at 1769-70.) Here, Cross-Complainant is seeking relief from a
dismissal, which occurred on a specific date. 
 
            To the
extent Cross-Complainant’s counsel argues that failure to attend the August 14,
2024 hearing was based on mistake, surprise, or neglect, that cannot be a basis
for seeking relief from the six-month deadline. (See Arambula v. Union
Carbide Corp. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 333, 345 [“There is no indication in
the language of section 473, subdivision (b), that the Legislature intended to
authorize a court to relieve a party from the failure to timely apply for
relief. . . . [The language of the discretionary and mandatory provisions of
section 473(b)] does not suggest that an exception should exist based on
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect or an attorney's
affidavit of fault. Moreover, it appears unlikely that the Legislature would
have intended to allow the use of section 473, subdivision (b), to excuse a
party's noncompliance with that very statute without expressly stating so.”].) 
             
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Accordingly, the Court DENIES Cross-Complainant’s motion to set aside the
dismissal.
 
Cross-Complainant to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
