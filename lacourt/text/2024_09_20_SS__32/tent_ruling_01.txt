TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


September
  20, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


21STCV35489




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Amend, Nunc Pro Tunc, the Court’s June 25, 2024 Order




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiffs Karen Flores and Michael Perry 




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On June 25, 2024, the Court granted a petition to approve a minors’
compromise filed by Karen Flores on behalf of Claimant M.P. 
 
Plaintiffs Karen Flores and Michael Perry (“Plaintiffs”) now move to
amend, nunc pro tunc, the Court’s June 25, 2024 order granting the Petition to
Approve Minor M.P.’s compromise. No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(d), “[t]he court may, upon
motion of the injured party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in
its judgment or orders as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order
directed, and may, on motion of either party after notice to the other party,
set aside any void judgment or order.” 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Here, Plaintiffs seek to correct item 8b2 on the Order Approving
Compromise (MC-351), granted on June 25, 2024, which states the balance of the
settlement will be “paid to Pacific Life Insurance Company and assigned to
Pacific Life and Annuity Services, Inc. to fund annuity contracts and disbursed
as follows: $2,500.00  Lump Sum Payment
on 9/22/2035; $5,000.00  Lump Sum Payment
on 9/22/2038;  and $13,281.08 Lump Sum
Payment on 9/22/2042, for a total disbursement of $20,281.08.” 
 
Instead, Plaintiffs contend that $13,281.08 should be $13,190.28,
which means the total disbursement should be $20,690.28. This information was
provided in the supporting petition, in the terms of the settlement agreement.
(Petition, Hayden Decl., Exh. A.) 
 
Therefore, the motion to correct the amounts within 8b2 is granted.
Item 8b2 is amended to state: “paid to Pacific Life Insurance Company and
assigned to Pacific Life and Annuity Services, Inc. to fund annuity contracts
and disbursed as follows: $2,500.00 Lump Sum Payment on 9/22/2035; $5,000.00
Lump Sum Payment on 9/22/2038; and $13,190.28 Lump Sum Payment on 9/22/2042,
for a total disbursement of $20,690.28.
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Motion to Amend, Nunc Pro Tunc, the Court’s June 25,
2024 Order is GRANTED. The Court signs the proposed order attached as Exhibit
1.
 
Plaintiffs shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
