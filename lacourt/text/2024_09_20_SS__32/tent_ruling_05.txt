Court notes that section 2034.720 also requires a similar showing. (See Code
Civ. Proc., ยง 2034.720, subd. (c).) Therefore, even if section 2034.720
applied, the motion would also be denied. 


[2] The
Court does not rule on any motion in limine regarding the evidence to be
presented at trial, as those issues will be decided by the trial court.
