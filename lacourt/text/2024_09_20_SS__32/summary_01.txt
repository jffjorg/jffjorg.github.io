The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the motion to amend, nunc pro tunc, the Court's June 25, 2024 order. The order granted a petition to approve a minors' compromise, and the compromise states that the balance of the settlement will be paid to Pacific Life Insurance Company and assigned to Pacific Life and Annuity Services, Inc. The total disbursement was originally stated to be $20,281.08, but the plaintiffs contend that it should be corrected to $20,690.28. The judge has agreed to correct the mistake and the total disbursement will now be $20,690.28. The motion is granted and the proposed order is attached as Exhibit 1. The plaintiffs must provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
