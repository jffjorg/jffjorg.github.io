TENTATIVE RULING:

dismiss for Plaintiff’s failure to furnish security pursuant to the Court’s May
24, 2023 order declaring Plaintiff a vexatious litigant. 
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendant
requests that the Court take judicial notice of (1) the Notice of Ruling on the
Motion to Designate Plaintiff as a Vexatious Litigant filed on May 25, 2023 in
this action; (2) the May 24, 2023 Prefiling Order for Vexatious Litigant in
this action; and (3) the Notice of Appeal filed in this action on June 23,
2023. Defendant’s requests are GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(d)
(court records). 
 
Analysis
 
            On May 24,
2023, this Court granted Defendant U.S. Bank’s Motion to Designate Plaintiff a
Vexatious Litigant, finding that Plaintiff had filed six actions in propria
persona in the past seven years which had been finally determined against
him, and, therefore, that he is a vexatious litigant as a matter of law. (RJN
Exh. 1.A.) The Court also ordered Plaintiff to furnish security in the amount
of $50,000 to maintain his claims against Defendant U.S. Bank only pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 391.1. (Id.) 
 
            Defendant
contends that it has received no indication that Plaintiff has furnished any
security. (Declaration of E. Christine Hehir ISO Mot. ¶ 3.) The Court’s own
records confirm Defendant’s contention. Therefore, pursuant to the express
terms of Code of Civil Procedure section 391.4, Plaintiff’s claims against this
Defendant must be dismissed. 
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant U.S. Bank’s Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED.
 
            Dismissal
is entered without prejudice on all causes of action as to Defendant
U.S. Bank National Association, As Trustee for GSAA Home Equity Trust 2006-12,
Asset Backed Certificates Series 2006-12. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
