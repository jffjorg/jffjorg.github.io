SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a landlord-tenant dispute. On
7/6/23, Plaintiffs Irwin Jacobowitz; Pearl Jacobowitz; Dakota Dusty
Zeigerman-Jacobowitz; Arizona Jacobowitz and Montana Jacobowitz (collectively,
Plaintiffs), representing themselves, filed this action against Defendants Rick
Hawthorne, Larry Thornton and Valley View Vaulters, Inc. (collectively,
Defendants) alleging various causes of action. 
On 7/21/23, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint against
Defendants alleging the following causes of action: (1) Wrongful Eviction, (2)
Breach of Contract, (3) Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment, (4) Trespass,
(5) Private Nuisance, 
(6) Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty of a
Third Party, (7) Constructive Eviction, 
(8) Intentional Concealment, (9) Fraudulent
Misrepresentation, (10) Negligence,  (11)
Breach of Habitability, (12) Negligent Misrepresentation, (13) Intentional

(17) Failure to Return Security Deposit, (18) Punitive Damages, (19) Treble
Damages and (20) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress.
 
On 8/25/23, Defendants filed and served a special motion
to strike seeking an order, pursuant to CCP 425.16, striking the 1st
– 4th, 6th – 10th, 13th – 16th
and 18th – 20th causes of action in Plaintiffs’
First Amended Complaint.  On 9/29/23, Plaintiffs
filed a combined opposition to the 
motion and to Defendants’ demurrer which was scheduled for a later
date.  On 1/31/24, Defendants filed a
reply to the opposition.  On 2/7/24, this
Court granted Defendants special motion to strike noting:
 
“Defendants are entitled to an
award of attorneys’ fees as the prevailing party on this motion. Code of Civil
Procedure Section 425.16(c)(1). However, Defendants have not provided any
information from which the Court can determine a proper fee award (number of
hours spent on the motion, hourly rate – i.e., lodestar). As such, Defendants’
request for an award of attorneys’ fees is denied without prejudice to
Defendants making a subsequent noticed motion for such fees or including the
request [in] the memorandum of costs after entry of judgment.”
 
(See 2/7/24 Minute Order).
 
On 2/9/24, each of the Defendants filed and served a
separate motion for attorney fees regarding the special motion to strike.  Each of the motions seeks an order, pursuant
to CCP 425.16(c), for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs against Plaintiffs
Irwin Jacobowitz; Pearl Jacobowitz; Dakota Dusty Zeigerman-Jacobowitz; Arizona
Jacobowitz and Montana Jacobowitz jointly and severally in the amount of
$7,042.81.
 
Plaintiffs have not opposed the motions.  While Plaintiffs have filed notices of
appeal, the filing of an appeal does not stay a motion for attorney fees.  See Domestic Linen Supply Co., Inc.
(2020) 58 CA5th 180, 187 citing Hennessy (1924) 194 Cal 368, 372.   
 
ANALYSIS
 
As noted in the Court’s 2/7/24 Minute Order a prevailing
Defendant on a special motion to strike is entitled to an award of attorney’s
fees under CCP 425.16(c)(1).  
 
The legislative history behind CCP 425.16(c) indicates
that it was intended to only allow for the recovery of fees and costs incurred
on the special motion to strike, not the entire litigation.  Layfayette Morehouse, Inc. (1995) 39
CA4th 1379, 1383.  Additionally, although
CCP 425.16(c) does not expressly state such, it is interpreted to allow for an
award of only fees and costs the court finds reasonable.  Robertson (1995) 36 CA4th 347, 362; Dove
Audio, Inc. (1996) 47 CA4th 777, 785. 
Further, when awarding attorney’s fees under CCP 425.16, courts apply
the lodestar approach (number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate prevailing in the community for similar work).  Frym (2022) 82 CA5th 613, 620-622; Ketchum
(2001) 24 C4th 1122, 1136.
 
The motions note that an attorney fee award properly
includes fees for necessary support staff (i.e., paralegals).  See Salton Bay Marina, Inc.
(1985) 172 CA3d 914, 951; Guinn (1994) 23 CA4th 262, 269.  Defendants also note that fees for electronic
filing or service of documents through an electronic service provider are
recoverable, if required or ordered by the court.  See CCP 1033.5(a)(14).
 
The Court finds the hourly rates charged by Defendants’
counsel for their time and the time of their support staff to be
reasonable.  (See Bussman Decls.
¶4).
 
However, Defendants have included $1,542.50 in fees
related to review and analysis of the entire complaint.  Since the special motion to strike did not
address all of the causes of action in the complaint, the Court finds that such
fees were not incurred on the special motion to strike and are not recoverable
by way of the instant motion. 
Additionally, on 8/24/23 and 8/25/23, Defendants have included billing
entries for tasks related to the special motion to strike and the demurrer.  Therefore, the Court finds that only half of
those amounts should be attributed to the special motion to strike.  As such, the Court finds that Defendants are
entitled to an award of $4,761.25 in attorney fees related to the underlying
special motion to strike and the instant motion.  (See Bussman Decl. and Ex.A and B
thereto).
 
The Court finds that Defendants are entitled to recover
$120.00 in filing fees/costs for the underlying special motion to strike and
for one of the motions for attorney fees. 
Since Defendants filed one combined special motion to strike, they only
incurred one $60.00 filing fee.  It is
not clear why Defendants filed three separate motions for attorney fees which
all seek the same fees and costs.  As
such, the Court finds that Defendants reasonably incurred only one $60.00
filing fee related to the motions for attorney fees.  Defendants have failed to adequately explain
the claimed “filing fees” listed for 8/25/23, 1/31/24 and 2/2/24.  It is not clear that the 8/25/23 and 2/2/24
fees relate to the special motion to strike. 
It is also not clear why Defendants are claiming a $25.00 “filing fee”
on 1/31/24 for their reply re: the special motion to strike as there is no
court filing fee for a reply.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motions are granted. 
However, the Court finds that the three separately filed motions should
have been filed as one motion. 
Therefore, all three Defendants are awarded a combined total of $4,881.25
($4,761.25 in attorneys’ fees + $120.00 in filing fees/costs) in attorneys’
fees and costs as the prevailing party on the special motion to strike.
