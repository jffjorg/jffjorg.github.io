Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled on three motions for attorney fees filed by Defendants Rick Hawthorne, Larry Thornton, and Valley View Vaulters, Inc. The Court has awarded attorney fees of $4,761.25 to the Defendants, which includes $4,761.25 in attorneys' fees and $120.00 in filing fees/costs. The Court has denied the motion for attorney fees in the amount of $7,042.81, as the Court finds that certain fees related to review and analysis of the entire complaint are not recoverable. The Court has also denied certain filing fees claimed by the Defendants, as the Court is unsure whether they relate to the special motion to strike. The Court has granted the motions for attorney fees, but only to the extent that they are related to the special motion to strike.
