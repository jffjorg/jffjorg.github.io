SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Maria Margarita
Carranza’s (Plaintiff) care and treatment at Defendant Rinaldi Convalescent
Hospital (Defendant) from 4/10/21 to 4/12/21. 
Plaintiff alleges that she suffered “[s]evere infliction of injuries
sustained by employees from Rinaldi Convalescent Hospital” by refusing to give
her prescription drugs, including medication for pain and anxiety.  Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant’s
employees and staff were ordered to “not speak or assist Plaintiff with any
requests,” that staff refused to take her blood pressure, and that her
“complaint issued focus[es] around the infliction of injuries.”  Further, Plaintiff alleges that she was “[d]efrauded
by the Brochures shown to plaintiff,” that she was not allowed hygiene after she
“soiled [her] legs unable to reach [the] toilet (in use by another Patient),”
that Defendant’s employees stole her prescribed opioids, and that she was
kidnapped and held against her will “during [a] 48-hour mandatory stay” at
Defendant.  
 
On 2/25/22, representing herself, Plaintiff filed a
complaint against Defendant.  On 3/18/22,
 Plaintiff filed the operative (First) Amended
Complaint (FAC) which does not assert any distinct causes of action.  After Plaintiff failed to respond to
Defendant’s meet and confer efforts regarding the (First) Amended Complaint, on
7/6/23, Defendant filed and served a demurrer as to the entire (First) Amended
Complaint and motion to strike which sought to strike various portions of the
(First) Amended Complaint.  Although Plaintiff
had opposed the demurrer and Defendant had filed a reply, the hearing on the
demurrer and motion to strike did not proceed on the merits because default had
been entered against Defendant on 12/14/22. 
(See 10/18/23 Minute Order).
 
Thereafter, Defendant filed a motion to have the default
set aside which was granted on 2/15/24. 
(See 2/15/24 Minute Order). 
On 2/23/24, after Plaintiff did not respond to Defendant’s meet and
confer efforts, Defendant filed and served the instant demurrer to the entire
(First) Amended Complaint  and motion to
strike portions of the (First) Amended Complaint.  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition or
other response to the demurrer or motion to strike.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
A complaint must include a statement of facts
constituting the cause or causes of action in ordinary and concise
language.  CCP 452.10(a).  A defendant may challenge a complaint by
demurrer which admits all properly pleaded facts, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law. 
Gruenberg (1973) 9 C3d 566, 572; Carter (2011) 198 CA4th
396, 403.  Among other things, a demurrer
may be based on grounds that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action and/or is uncertain, ambiguous and
unintelligible.  CCP 430.10(e), (f).  
 
A demurrer may be sustained without leave to amend where
it is probable that Plaintiff cannot state a cause of action.  Banerian (1974) 42 CA3d 604, 616; Moore
(1977) 65 CA3d 896, 903; Berkley Police Association  (1977) 76 CA3d 931, 942.  Plaintiff has the burden of establishing that
there is a reasonable possibility that the defects in the complaint can be
cured by amendment.  Blank (1985)
39 C3d 311, 318.  If the Plaintiff does
not meet this burden, the demurrer is properly sustained without leave to amend.  Hendy (1991) 54 C3d 723, 742. 
 
Where the complaint is so poorly pled that the defendant
cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what
counts or claims are directed against it, a demurer for uncertainty lies.  Khoury (1993) 14 CA4th 612, 616.  Here, the (First) Amended Complaint is so
poorly pled that Defendant cannot reasonably determine what issues must be
admitted or denied and Defendant is left to speculate as to what causes of
action Plaintiff is alleging against it.
 
Similarly, the (First) Amended Complaint is uncertain
because it fails to separately state each cause of action, its nature, the
party asserting it and/or the parties against whom it is directed.  See CRC 2.112.
 
To the extent Plaintiff is attempting to plead a cause of
action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, she has failed to
adequately do so.  The elements of such a
claim are: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the
intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing,
emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme emotional
distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by
the defendant’s outrageous conduct.  Potter
(1993) 6 C4th 965, 1001; Christensen (1991) 54 C3d 868, 903.  For purposes of an intentional infliction of
emotional distress claim, conduct is “outrageous” when it is so “extreme as to
exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.”  Potter, supra at 1001.  Additionally, the defendant’s conduct must be
“intended to inflict injury or engaged in with the realization that injury will
result.”  Id.  
 
Here, Plaintiff has failed to plead facts to support each
of the elements of a claim for intentional infliction of emotional
distress.  Rather, Plaintiff merely makes
conclusory, ambiguous, and unintelligible allegations regarding Defendant’s
employees.  (See FAC p.1:20,
p.2:8-9, p.3:3-4, p.3:14-15, p.8:4-17).
 
To the extent Plaintiff is attempting to plead a cause of
action for fraud, she has failed to adequately do so.  The elements of a fraud cause of action are: (1)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (2)
knowledge of falsity; (3) intent to defraud; (4) justifiable reliance; and (5)
resulting damage.  Lazar (1996) 12
C4th 631, 638.  Additionally, a fraud
cause of action must be pled with factual particularity.  Id. at 645.  Here, Plaintiff has failed to plead
sufficient specific facts to support any of the elements of a fraud claim.  
 
To the extent Plaintiff is attempting to state a cause of
action for elder or dependent adult abuse/neglect, she has failed to do
so.  Such a statutory claim must be pled
with particularity.  See Welfare
& Institutions Code 15600, et seq.; Carter, supra at 410.
 
The elements of such a claim are: (1) plaintiff is an
elder or dependent adult as defined by the Elder and Dependent Adult Civil
Protection Act (the Act); (2) defendant is liable for physical abuse, neglect,
or fiduciary abuse; (3) defendant has been guilty of recklessness, oppression,
fraud or malice in the commission of the abuse or neglect; (4) defendant’s
conduct was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff harm; (5) the
employer had advanced knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and employed him
or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others, or
authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are awarded,
or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. With respect to a
corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard,
authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on
the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation; and (6)
damage or harm suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the abuse or neglect.  Welfare & Institutions Code 15657(c); CCP
3294(b); Delaney (1999) 20 C4th 23, 31; Covenant Care, Inc.
(2004) 32 C4th 771.  
 
Here, Plaintiff has failed to plead that she is a
dependent adult or elder as defined by the Act. 
See Welfare & Institutions Code 15610.23(a).  Plaintiff has also failed to allege facts
showing Defendant had responsibility for her basic needs as an elder or
dependent adult as required.  See Carter,
supra 406-407, 410.  Additionally,
Plaintiff has not pled the necessary specific facts regarding any alleged
neglect or abuse.  Id.  
 
Plaintiff has also failed to plead sufficient facts to
show that Defendant acted with malice, oppression, fraud and/or recklessness
which are necessary to obtain the enhanced remedies under the Act or punitive
damages.  Welfare & Institutions Code
15657.  Delaney, supra at
31-32; Civil Code 3294.
 
To the extent Plaintiff is attempting to state a cause of
action for general or medical negligence, she has failed to do so.  The elements of a negligence cause of action
are: (1) a legal duty to use due care; (2) a breach of such legal duty; and (3)
the breach as the proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.  Ladd (1996) 12 C4th 913, 917.   The
elements of a cause of action for medical malpractice are: (1) a duty to use
such skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of the profession commonly
possess and exercise; (2) a breach of the duty; (3) a proximate causal
connection between the negligent conduct and the injury; and (4) resulting loss
or damage. Chakalis (2012) 205 CA4th 1557, 1571.  Plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient
facts to support  the elements of either
claim.       
 
Even considering the opposition filed by Plaintiff on
7/31/23 in response to Defendant’s previously filed demurrer to the (First)
Amended Complaint (which was taken off calendar due to the default which has
now been set aside) which made the same arguments as the instant demurrer, Plaintiff
failed to address the arguments and authorities presented by Defendant in the
demurrer or motion to strike.  Rather,
Plaintiff made incomprehensible arguments regarding Defendant’s counsel not
being authorized to act and conspiring with unidentified “previous Attorneys
for Plaintiff.”  Plaintiff has
represented herself throughout this entire action.  Plaintiff also referred to a purported “Court
Ordered Judgment of 5/14/23.”  However,
no court judgment has been entered in this case and there is no entry in eCourt
on 5/14/23.  Plaintiff did not file a
separate opposition to the motion to strike.
 
CONCLUSION
 
For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiff’s (First)
Amended Complaint is so uncertain that Defendant cannot determine the causes of
action being asserted against it so that it can formulate a response.  Similarly, to the extent that Defendant
and/or the Court can surmise what claims Plaintiff is attempting to assert
against Defendant, she has failed to allege sufficient facts to state such
claims.  Plaintiff has not filed
oppositions to the instant demurer and motion to strike.  However, even considering Plaintiff’s
opposition to Defendant’s previously filed demurrer which made the same
arguments as the instant demurrer, Plaintiff failed to meet her burden of
establishing how she can cure the defects in her pleading, which she has
already amended once.
 
Therefore, the demurrer is sustained and the motion to
strike is granted, both without leave to amend.
