 
            This is a breach
of contract action. The Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs Corbel Architects,
Inc. and David Seong Bae Kim (Plaintiffs) entered into an agreement with Defendants
Hot Hand Corporation and Hyo Suk Kim (Defendants) to provide professional
architectural services as part of a project to build a 5 story, 210 room hotel.
In exchange for the performance of these services, Defendants were to pay
Plaintiffs $1,678,000. While Plaintiffs performed all their professional service
obligations, Defendants have refused to pay their outstanding balance of
$721,916.43.
 
Plaintiffs filed this Complaint on August
31, 2023. The Request for Entry of Default against Defendants Hot Hand
Corporation and Hyo Suk Kim was entered on September 16, 2024. Plaintiffs
dismissed DOES 1-30. 
 
The request for entry of default
judgment is granted. 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            Plaintiffs
request entry of default judgment in the amount of $809,833.63, which includes
$80,104.95 in prejudgment interest, $1,076.75 in costs, and $6,735.50 in
attorney fees. 
 
            In support
of the request for damages, Plaintiffs submit evidence that they performed the
obligations of their contract with Defendants, but Defendants failed to pay the
remaining balance to Plaintiff Corbel Architects, Inc. in the amount of
$721,916.43. (Kim Decl., ¶¶ 2-5, Ex. A.) The evidence submitted to prove-up the
amount of damages requested in the Complaint are sufficient. (Kim v.
Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 288 [“ ‘[p]laintiffs
in a default judgment proceeding must prove they are entitled to the damages
claimed’ ”].) 
 
            Plaintiffs also
submitted adequate evidence supporting their request for prejudgment interest
accruing at 10%, from August 31, 2023 (the filing of the Complaint) to October
10, 2024. (Yeo Interest Decl.) Plaintiffs also submit adequate evidence to
substantiate the request for costs in the amount of $1,076.75. (Yeo Cost Decl.,
¶¶ 2-3.) 
 
            Plaintiffs request
attorney’s fees of $6,735.  This amount
is within the amount permitted by Los Angeles County Court rule 3.214 and is granted.

 
            The proposed Judgment lodged with the Court on October 10, 2024 has
been corrected to delete the individuals and specify only Plaintiff Corbel
Architects, Inc. and only Defendant Hot Hand corporation, a South Korean
corporation.
 
            The request for entry of default Judgment in favor of Corbel Architects,
Inc., and against Defendant Hot Hand Corporation in the amount of $809,833.63
is granted.
