And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the special motion to strike filed by Cross-Defendant Vivoli Saccuzo, LLC. The motion was filed under California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, which allows for the dismissal of lawsuits that arise from protected activity. However, the judge found that the claims brought by Cross-Complainant Caster Modelo, LLC do not arise from protected activity. Specifically, the judge found that the conversion cause of action and the cause of action for receiving stolen property do not arise from protected activity because they are based on the receipt of stolen property and not on protected speech or petitioning activity. The judge also found that the claims do not meet the first prong of the anti-SLAPP statute, which requires a showing that the claims arise from protected activity.
