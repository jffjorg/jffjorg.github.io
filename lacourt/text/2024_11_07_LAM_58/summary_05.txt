And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering an anti-SLAPP motion, which challenges the third and fourth causes of action. The cross-complaint claims that the defendant intended to move to strike the third and fifth causes of action, but mistakenly cited the fourth cause of action. The reply only addresses the third and fifth causes of action. The court will treat the anti-SLAPP motion as a motion to specially strike the third and fifth causes of action. The judge's decision is based on case law, specifically Salma v. Capon (2008) and Bel Air Internet, LLC v. Morales (2018), which explain that courts can examine declarations when making a first-step assessment.
