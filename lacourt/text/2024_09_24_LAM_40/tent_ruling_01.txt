Motion for
  Attorneys’ Fees [RES ID # 6849]



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
On March 4, 2019, Plaintiff Western
Union Financial Services Inc. (Western Union) sued individual defendants Kelly
Ranghee Kang [wife] and Jeong Hoon Kang [husband], and entity defendants RJN
Group, Inc. and RK Deli Corporation, all of whom operate/do business as a
grocery market named Aloha Deli Market (collectively Defendants.) 
The operative November 18, 2021
Second Amended Complaint (SAC) alleges ten claims: (1) Breach of Written
Contract; (2) Account Stated; (3) Open Book Account; (4) Breach of Fiduciary
Duty; (5) Conversion; (6) Unjust Enrichment; (7) Common Counts; (8) Violation
of Voidable Transfers Act [Civil Code § 3439.04]; (9) Violation of Voidable
Transfers Act [Civil Code § 3439.05]; and (10) Civil Conspiracy. 
In November/December 2016, Defendants
signed an Agency Agreement with Western Union so they could sell Western Union
money orders and money transfer services to their customers. The claims arise
from allegations that Defendants failed to remit $98,760.17 to Western Union, as
part of Western Union transactions effected at the Aloha Deli Market. 
B. Relevant Procedural History
A bench trial of this matter
occurred on February 9, 2024. The Court issued a judgment awarding Western
Union (1) $98,760.17 in general damages, (2) $49,353.02 in prejudgment interest,
and (3) $98,760.17 in punitive damages. (February 22, 2024, JUD-100) 
C. Motion Before the Court
On April 4, 2024, Western Union
filed this motion to determine prevailing party and entitlement to recover
attorneys’ fees. 
The motion is unopposed. 
 
II. Motion
A. Legal Standard
A prevailing party is entitled to recover costs as a matter
of right. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subds. (a)(4), (b).) Attorney’s fees are
also recoverable as costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) 
Attorney’s fees and costs may be awarded where a contract
between the parties at issue specifically provides for such fees and costs and
one party prevails over the other on the contract. (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd.
(a); see Kaufman v. Diskeeper Corp. (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1, 8-9 [Civ.
Code, § 1717 fees and costs motion not subject to Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700’s requirements] (Kaufman).) 
“In any action on a contract,
where the contract specifically provides that attorney's fees and costs, which
are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the
parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the
party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in
the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in
addition to other costs.” (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a); see Kaufman
v. Diskeeper Corp. (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1, 8-9 [Civ. Code, § 1717 fees
and costs motion not subject to Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700’s
requirements].)
The party seeking fees and costs
bears the burden to show "the fees incurred were allowable, were
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in
amount." (Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31
Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) To satisfy this burden, evidence and descriptions of
billable tasks must be presented in sufficient detail, enabling the court to
evaluate whether the case was overstaffed, the time attorneys spent on specific
claims, and the reasonableness of the hours expended. (Lunada Biomedical v.
Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)   
“A trial court assessing attorney
fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the ‘careful
compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each
attorney… involved in the presentation of the case.” (Christian Research
Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness
of attorney fees is within the discretion of the trial court, to be determined
from a consideration of such factors as the nature of the litigation, the
complexity of the issues, the experience and expertise of counsel and the
amount of time involved. [Citation.] The court may also consider whether the
amount requested is based upon unnecessary or duplicative work. [Citation.]” (Wilkerson
v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) 
B. Analysis
Western Union moves for an order
awarding attorney’s fees in the total amount of $50,800.00
for 250.4 hours of work at an agreed upon rate of $200 per hour. (Spector Decl.
¶¶ 25-27.)
Here, Western Union is the
prevailing party in a contract with Defendants, the Agency Agreements, which
contains the following “Remedial Action” provision: “As used in this Agreement
a ‘Remedial Action’ is defined as: (d) exercise any legal and/or equitable
remedies available to WUNA, for which WUNA shall be entitled to reimbursement
of reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses;” (Spector Decl. ¶ 24, Ex A ¶ 8.3.)
Western Union is the undisputed
prevailing party in this action. The Court granted Western Union judgment in
the full amount of general damages alleged in the SAC plus prejudgment interest
and punitive damages. Thus, Western Union is entitled to an award of its
reasonable attorneys’ fees. 
Western Union demonstrates that,
based on counsel’s relative experience and qualifications, the agreed rate of
$200 per hour is more than fair. (Spector Decl. ¶ 26.) 
“‘Reasonably spent’ means that time spent ‘in the form of
inefficient or duplicative efforts is not subject to compensation.’” (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 394.)
Because the court’s focus in evaluating the
facts should be to provide a fee award reasonably designed to completely
compensate attorneys for the services provided, the starting point for this
determination is the attorney’s time records. (Horsford, supra,
132 Cal.App.4th at pp. 395-397 [verified time records entitled to credence
absent clear indication they are erroneous].) However, California case law
permits fee awards in the absence of detailed time sheets. (See e.g., Sommers
v. Erb (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1644, 1651 [fees awarded based on attorney’s
representation as to hours actually spent on contingency fee representation
where no time records were available]; Dunk v. Ford Motor Co. (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 1794, 1810 [time records not entirely necessary where “estimates
based on the functions performed [may] allow the court to properly calculate
the lodestar amount”].) 
As outlined in the declaration by
Western Union’s counsel, Ross Spector, Western Union seeks to recover fees for
250.4 hours billed for the following work: “1) analyze all documents in the
client’s file as to Kang’s accounts and transactions with Plaintiff; 2)
research the law to support Plaintiff’s claims against Kang; 3) respond to
Kang’s extensive efforts to thwart Plaintiff’s collection efforts [which included
transferring assets to her husband Jon Kang, filing a meritless bankruptcy case
(in which Plaintiff had to litigate an adversary proceeding), and creating and
then dissolving several alter ego corporations]; 4) propound written discovery
requests and then litigate motions to compel when no discovery responses were
forthcoming; 5) subpoena Kang's bank account records for numerous accounts and
then analyze those records; 6) prepare the initial complaint, and then several
amended complaints, as Plaintiff discovered the extent of Kang' s ongoing efforts
to avoid liability; 7) prepare several pre-trial motions, including summary
adjudication motions, a motion for leave to file an amended complaint, and a
motion to continue the trial date; 8) prepare for trial, including all written
trial submissions, witness preparation, and trial presentation; 9) attend trial
to obtain judgment; and 10) prepare this motion for attorney's fees.” (Spector
Decl. ¶ 26.)
The hours expended on this action are facially reasonable considering
they encompass five years of litigation and are unopposed.  
Thus, because Western Union is the prevailing party in this
action, and the rate sought and hours expended are reasonable, Western Union’s
motion for attorney’s fees is GRANTED.
III.ConclusionWestern Union Financial Services
motion for attorney’s fees is GRANTED in the amount of $50,800.00. An Amended Judgment including this sum may be lodged and served forthwith.
