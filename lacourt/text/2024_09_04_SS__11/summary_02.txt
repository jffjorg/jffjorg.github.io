And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided that the exhibits presented in discovery are not sufficient to establish the truth of the contents. The exhibits are copies of documents produced in discovery, but they do not prove the actual events or facts described. The judge also notes that the Diocese of Boise, which granted a priest permission to leave Idaho, is not subject to jurisdiction in New Mexico where the priest was accused of molesting a boy. The judge grants the plaintiff leave to address the Diocese's case law in a supplemental brief following discovery.
