Saying the exhibits are true and correct copies of documents produced in
discovery is different than saying they are true and correct copies of the
actual letters and newspaper articles and does not establish the truth of the
contents.

“The priest” in Diocese of Boise “went to New Mexico, where he was
accused of molesting a boy.” (Archdiocese of Milwaukee, supra, 112
Cal.App.4th at 440.) “The New Mexico Court of Appeals held the Roman Catholic Diocese of Boise was
not subject to jurisdiction in New Mexico because the diocese played no
part in the priest's decision to settle in New Mexico, but only granted the
priest permission to leave Idaho.” (Id. at 440-441.) “The fact that after
the Boise Diocese gave Father Garcia permission to leave Idaho, Father Garcia
subsequently selected New Mexico from among several other possible diocesan
destinations in which to seek employment as a priest” did not amount to “a
purposeful act by the Boise Diocese to avail itself of the benefits and
protections of New Mexico law.” (Id. at 441.)
 
Since a discovery continuance is warranted here, the Court
grants Plaintiff leave to address Diocese of Boise and Defendant’s other
case law in his supplemental brief following discovery.
