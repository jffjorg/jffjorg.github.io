The judge found that the defendant's failure was willful and prejudicial to the plaintiff, as the discovery requests were central to the plaintiff's claims against the defendant. The judge imposed terminating sanctions against the defendant, stricking the defendant's answer and ordering the defendant to pay monetary sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $3,400.
