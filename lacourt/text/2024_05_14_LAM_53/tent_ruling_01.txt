MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Virginia Zamora
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant General Motors LLC
Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs
The court considered
the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with this motion. 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
The court rules on plaintiff
Virginia Zamora’s evidentiary objections, filed on May 7, 2024, as follows:
            Objections
Nos. 1-22 are overruled. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Virginia Zamora (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
awarding attorney’s fees and costs in her favor and against defendant General
Motors LLC (“Defendant”) in the total amount of $57,995.36, consisting of
$54,957 in attorney’s fees and $3,038.36 in costs.  
First, the court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to recover
attorney’s fees pursuant to the Song-Beverly Act and the Code of Civil
Procedure section 998 Offer of Compromise served by Defendant and accepted by
Plaintiff.  (Barry Decl., Ex. 5, 998
Offer.) 
Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (d), provides:¿ “If the buyer
prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the
court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of
costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.”¿¿ 
Plaintiff has presented evidence showing, and Defendant does not
dispute, that the parties settled this action when Plaintiff accepted and
executed Defendant’s Code of Civil Procedure section 998 Offer of Compromise on
June 27, 2023.  (Barry Decl., Ex. 5, 998
Offer, p. 3 [Pl. Acceptance Statement]; Quezada Decl., ¶ 17.)  Pursuant to the compromise, Defendant agreed
to pay Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees, expenses, and costs that have been
reasonably incurred pursuant to Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (d), as
determined by the court on noticed motion. 
(Barry Decl., Ex. 5, 998 Offer, ¶ 3.) 
Second,
the court finds that Plaintiff has established, as to the attorney’s fees
incurred to commence and prosecute this action and to prepare the pending fee
motion, a lodestar amount of $50,602.
“[T]he
fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate. . . . .¿ The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community
for similar work.¿ The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.”¿ (PLCM Group v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 (internal citations omitted).)¿ “[T]he verified
time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to
credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.”¿ (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State Univ. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359,
396.)¿¿ 
Plaintiff has submitted the declarations of David N. Barry, Elizabeth
Quinn, Anna Galaviz, and Logan Pascal, all of whom have attested to his or her qualifications,
experience, and skill.  (Barry Decl.,
¶¶ 42-45; Quinn Decl., ¶¶ 1, 4-11; Galaviz Decl., ¶¶ 1, 3-6;
Pascal Decl., ¶¶ 1, 3-5.)  Plaintiff
has also included a chart setting forth the hourly rates for all her attorneys
as follows: (1) David N. Barry ($525 hourly rate for work performed prior to
January 2022; $600 hourly rate for work performed January 2022 to April 2023;
and $625 hourly rate for work performed from April 2023 to the present); (2)
Elizabeth Quinn ($500 hourly rate for work performed from January 2022 to April
2023; $550 hourly rate for work performed from April 2023 to the present); (3)
Anna H. Galaviz ($515 hourly rate); (4) Logan G. Pascal ($300 hourly rate for
work performed from January 2022 to April 2023; $350 hourly rate for work
performed from April 2023 to the present); and (5) Allison Norder ($250 hourly
rate).  (Mot., p. 14:1-14.)  The court finds that the hourly rates charged
and requested by Plaintiff’s attorneys are reasonable.  Moreover, the court notes that Defendant does
not appear to argue that these rates are unreasonable in its opposition.
The court has reviewed Defendant’s opposition papers, including the
chart summarizing the requested reductions, and its challenges to specific
billing entries.  (Opp., pp. 7:24-10:21,
11:16-12:15.)  Based on its review of the
billing entries and Defendant’s challenges, the court finds that the following 2.9
hours (amounting to $1,480 in attorney’s fees) expended in connection with
entering and setting aside the default of defendant TPUSA, Inc. were not
reasonably incurred in commencing and prosecuting this action against Defendant:
·      
0.40 hours billed to draft the request for entry
of default against defendant TPUSA, Inc. on April 11, 2022 ($100).
·      
1.3 hours, total, billed in connection with the
request to set aside defendant TPUSA, Inc.’s default on May 12, 2022 ($780).
·      
0.10 hours billed to draft correspondence to
counsel for defendant TPUSA, Inc. on May 13, 2022 ($50).
·      
0.10 hours billed to review and respond to defendant
TPUSA, Inc.’s correspondence on May 16, 2022 ($50).
·      
0.30 hours billed for a conference with defendant
TPUSA, Inc.’s counsel regarding the stipulation to set aside its default on May
16, 2022 ($150). 
·      
0.10 hours billed to confer about defendant TPUSA,
Inc.’s default on May 19, 2022 ($50).
·      
0.40 hours billed to draft stipulation to set
aside defendant TPUSA, Inc.’s default on May 20, 2022 ($200).
·      
0.10 hours billed to draft and send
correspondence to defendant TPUSA, Inc. on May 20, 2022 ($50).
·      
0.10 hours billed to review signed stipulation
to set aside the default of defendant TPUSA, Inc. on May 24, 2022 ($50). 
(Barry
Decl., Ex. 6, Invoice, pp. 7, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19; Civ. Code, § 1794, subd.
(d).) 
The court further finds that (1) of the total 2.2 hours billed to
review the discovery propounded by Defendant on April 20, 2022, 0.7 of those
hours ($175) were not reasonably expended, and (2) of the 4 hours to prepare
for, travel to, and attend the hearing on this motion dated May 13, 2024 and
May 14, 2024, 3 of those hours ($1,875) were not reasonably incurred in connection
with commencing and prosecuting this action. 
(Barry Decl., Ex. 6, p. 11, 55; Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).)  Thus, the court reduces the lodestar by 3.7
hours ($2,050). 
Finally, Defendant has also requested that the court reduce the hours
expended in connection with Plaintiff’s fraud claim.  The parties agree that “‘[w]hen a cause of
action for which attorney fees are provided by statute is joined with other
causes of action for which attorney fees are not permitted, the prevailing
party may recover only on the statutory cause of action.’  [Citation.] 
However, ‘[s]uch fees need not be apportioned when incurred for
representation on an issue common to both causes of action in which fees are
proper and those in which they are not.’ 
[Citation.]  Moreover,
‘[a]pportionment is not required when the claims for relief are so intertwined
that it would be impracticable, if not impossible, to separate the attorney’s
time into compensable and noncompensable units.’”  (Santana v. FCA US, LLC (2020) 56
Cal.App.5th 334, 349 [internal citations omitted].)  
The court agrees that, to the extent that Plaintiff incurred fees in
litigating both her Song-Beverly Act claims and fraud cause of action
jointly—for example, the fees incurred in drafting Plaintiff’s Complaint and
First Amended Complaint, which asserts statutory causes of action and the fraud
cause of action—apportionment would be impracticable and inappropriate.  (Santana, supra, 56 Cal.App.5th
at p. 349.)  However, Plaintiff has not
shown that the fraud and Song-Beverly Act causes of action were “so intertwined”
that apportionment is impracticable as to the fees incurred only in litigating
the fraud claim (i.e., the fees associated with opposing the demurrers and
motions to strike, which were directed to the fraud cause of action and related
request for punitive damages).  (Ibid;
Def. Dem. filed Apr. 20, 2022, p. 2:1-2 [demurring to fraudulent
inducement-concealment cause of action]; Def. Mot. to Strike Punitive Damages
filed Apr. 20, 2022; Def. Dem. filed Dec. 12, 2022, p. 2:8-16 [demurring to
fraudulent inducement-concealment cause of action]; Def. Mot. to Strike
Punitive Damages filed Dec. 12, 2022.)
Thus, the court finds that Defendant has shown that Plaintiff is not
entitled to attorney’s fees in the total amount of $825 consisting of the
following: (1) 0.10 hours billed by Norder to meet and confer regarding the
demurrer on February 25, 2022 ($25); (2) 0.20 hours billed by Norder to respond
to the demurrer meet and confer on February 28, 2022 ($50); (3) 0.20 hours
billed by Barry in reviewing the declaration in response to the complaint on
March 14, 2022 ($120); (4) 0.20 hours billed by Norder for the conference
regarding the meet and confer process on the demurrer on April 3, 2022 ($50);
(5) 0.20 hours billed by Norder to attend the telephonic meet and confer
regarding the demurrer on April 12, 2022 ($50); (6) 0.20 hours billed by Barry
to review the declaration in support of the demurrer and motion to strike on
April 21, 2022 ($120); (7) 0.10 hours billed by Barry to review the proposed
order on Defendant’s demurrer on April 21, 2022 ($60); (8) 0.10 hours billed by
Barry to review the proposed order on Defendant’s motion to strike on April 21,
2022 ($60); (9) 0.4 hours billed by Barry to review the motion to strike on
April 21, 2022 ($240); and (10) 0.10 hours billed by Quinn to review the notice
of taking the demurrer and motion to strike off calendar on November 16, 2022
($50).[1]
(Barry Decl., Ex. 6, Invoice, pp. 3, 4, 6, 7, 8-9, 12, 37; Civ. Code, § 1794,
subd. (d).)  Thus, the court reduces the
lodestar figure by 1.8 hours ($825).  
Third, the court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to an award of costs
in the amount of $2,913.36. 
Plaintiff requested costs in this amount by filing her Memorandum of
Costs on September 19, 2023.  (Pl. Memo.
of Costs, MC-010.)  The court notes that,
in reply, Plaintiff contends that, because Defendant did not file a motion to
strike or tax costs, the court should award all the costs set forth in her cost
memorandum.  The court agrees that “[a]ny
notice of motion to strike or tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after
service of the cost memorandum.”  (Cal.
Rules of Ct., rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(1).) 
However, Plaintiff did not file a proof of service of the cost
memorandum.  (Pl. Memo. of Costs, MC-010,
p. 2 [incomplete proof of service].) 
Thus, the court has not been provided with the date of service on
Defendant of the cost memorandum, such that the court can conclude that
Defendant is not entitled to challenge Plaintiff’s requested costs pursuant to
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700.
The court finds that $125 in costs for service of process on TPUSA,
Inc. were not reasonably necessary to the commencement and prosecution of this
action against Defendant.  (Pl. Memo. of
Costs, MC-011, Worksheet, ¶ 5, subd. (b); Civ. Code, § 1794, subd.
(d); Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2).)  The court therefore grants Defendant’s
request to tax the cost memorandum in that amount. 
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to an award of costs
in the amount of $2,913.36.
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff Virginia
Zamora’s motion for attorney’s fees and costs as follows.
            The court orders that plaintiff
Virginia Zamora shall recover a total of $53,515.36 from defendant General
Motors LLC, consisting of (1) $50,602 in attorney’s fees
and (2) $2,913.36 in costs. 
The court orders plaintiff Virginia Zamora to give notice of this
ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
