  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion for terminating and
  monetary sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Juan Cruz Rodriguez
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion for Terminating and Monetary Sanctions
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Juan Cruz Rodriguez (“Plaintiff”) moves the court or an
order (1) imposing terminating, issue, or evidence sanctions against defendant
John Stich (“Defendant”), (2) awarding monetary sanctions in the amount of
$1,500, payable by Defendant to the court, and  (3) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of
Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $4,800.
If
a party engages in a misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose
monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030.)¿ Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 provides, in relevant
part, that “[m]isuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited to,
the following: . . . . (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized
method of discovery. . . . . (g) Disobeying a court order to provide
discovery.”¿¿¿¿ 
“The
trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse ‘after
considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to
determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party;
and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’”¿ (Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390, quoting Lang
v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246.)¿ “Generally, ‘[a] decision
to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.¿ But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’”¿ (Los
Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation
omitted].)¿¿¿¿ 
Plaintiff
contends that terminating sanctions are warranted because Defendant has not
complied with four court orders directing Defendant to serve discovery
responses on Plaintiff.  The court
agrees. 
First, on
December 4, 2023, the court issued an order (1) granting Plaintiff’s motion to
compel Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s document demands, and (2) ordering
Defendant      (i) to serve verified written responses to
Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and (ii) to produce
to Plaintiff responsive documents within 20 days of the date of service of that
order.  (Dec. 4, 2023 Order, p.
2:12-20.)  Plaintiff filed a Notice of
Ruling with the court on December 7, 2023, establishing that Plaintiff served a
copy of the court’s December 4, 2023 ruling on Defendant on December 7, 2023.  (Pl. Dec. 7, 2023 Notice of Ruling, p. 6
[proof of service on Defendant’s counsel of record].)  As of the date that Plaintiff filed this
motion (April 2, 2024) Defendant had not served responses on Plaintiff.  (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 35.) 
Second, on
December 19, 2023, the court issued an order (1) granting Plaintiff’s motion to
compel Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories—Employment,
and (2) ordering Defendant to serve responses to that discovery within 20 days
of the date of service of that order. 
(Dec. 19, 2023 Order, p. 2:13-20.) 
Plaintiff filed a Notice of Ruling with the court on December 20, 2023,
establishing that Plaintiff served a copy of the court’s December 19, 2023
ruling on Defendant on December 20, 2023. 
(Pl. Dec. 20, 2023 Notice of Ruling, p. 6 [proof of service].)  As of the date that Plaintiff filed this
motion, Defendant had not served responses on Plaintiff.  (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 35.)
Third, on
December 20, 2023, the court issued an order (1) granting Plaintiff’s motion to
compel Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories—General, numbers
1.1, 2.1-2.13, 3.6, 3.7, 12.1-12.3, 12.6, 12.7, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1, 14.2,
16.-16.6, 16.9, and 16.10, and (2) ordering Defendant to serve responses to
that discovery within 20 days of the date of service of that order.  (Dec. 20, 2023 Order, p. 2:13-23.)  Plaintiff filed a Notice of Ruling with the
court on December 20, 2023, establishing that Plaintiff served a copy of the
court’s December 20, 2023 minute order on Defendant on December 20, 2023.  (Pl. Dec. 20, 2023 Notice of Ruling, p. 6
[proof of service].)  As of the date that
Plaintiff filed this motion, Defendant had not served responses on
Plaintiff.  (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 35.)
Fourth, on
January 8, 2024, the court issued an order (1) granting Plaintiff’s motion to
compel Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set One,
and (2) ordering Defendant to serve responses to that discovery within 20 days
of the date of service of that order. 
(Jan. 8, 2024 Order, p. 2:15-20.) 
Plaintiff filed a Notice of Ruling with the court on January 11, 2024,
establishing that Plaintiff served a copy of the court’s January 8, 2024 order
on Defendant on January 11, 2024.  (Pl.
Jan. 11, 2024 Notice of Ruling, p. 6 [proof of service].)  As of the date that Plaintiff filed this
motion, Defendant had not served responses on Plaintiff.  (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 35.)
Thus, the
court finds that Plaintiff has shown that Defendant violated four court orders
compelling him to serve responses to Plaintiff’s discovery requests within 20
days of the date of service of the court’s orders.  (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 35.)  Defendant has not filed an opposition or
other evidence with the court establishing that he has since complied with the
court’s orders. 
The court
further finds that Defendant’s failure to serve full and complete written
responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories—General, Form
Interrogatories—Employment, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for
Production of Documents, and to produce responsive documents to Plaintiff's
Requests for Production of Documents, is prejudicial to Plaintiff, because the
discovery requests information and the production of documents that are central
to Plaintiff’s Fair Employment and Housing Act (Gov. Code, § 12900 et
seq.) and wrongful termination claims against Defendant.  
For
example, special interrogatory number 21 is a contention interrogatory
requesting, if Defendant contends that Plaintiff was not discriminated against
during his employment, that Defendant state all facts that he believes supports
that contention, and therefore requests information relevant to Plaintiff’s
first cause of action for disability discrimination.  (Mot. to Compel Responses to SROGs filed Mar.
7, 2023, Rodriguez Decl., Ex. 1, p. 7:26-28.; FAC ¶ 31 [alleging disability
discrimination].)  Special interrogatory
number 24 requests information regarding attempts made by Defendant to engage
in a timely and good faith interactive process with Plaintiff to determine
reasonable accommodations, and therefore requests information relevant to
proving Plaintiff’s third cause of action. 
(Mot. to Compel Responses to SROGs filed Mar. 7, 2023, Rodriguez Decl.,
Ex. 1, p. 9:3-6; FAC ¶ 53 [alleging failure to engage in timely and good faith
interactive process].)  Similarly, form
interrogatory (employment) number 201.1 requests that Defendant “state all
reasons for” Plaintiff’s termination, which is relevant to Plaintiff’s claims
that Defendant terminated him for discriminatory and/or retaliatory reasons.  (Mot. to Compel Responses to Employment FROGs
filed Mar. 8, 2023, Rodriguez Decl., Ex. 1, Form Interrogatories—Employment, p.
3; FAC ¶¶ 31, 67, 78, 85, 93.)
Moreover,
the general form interrogatories request, inter alia, information
relating to any interviewees or witnesses to the claims described in the First
Amended Complaint (Nos. 12.1, 12.2, 12.3) and the existence of photographs,
films, or videotapes depicting anything concerning those claims (No. 12.4).  (Mot. to Compel Responses to General FROGs
filed Mar. 8, 2023, Rodriguez Decl., Ex. 1, Form Interrogatories—General, pp.
5-6.)  The document demands request the
production of, inter alia, documents that refute or contradict the
factual allegations in the complaint (No. 4), documents relating to adverse
employment actions taken against Plaintiff or his termination (Nos. 29-30), and
documents evidencing any attempt to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive
process with Plaintiff (No. 47).  (Mot.
to Compel Responses to Req. for Production filed Mar. 8, 2023, Rodriguez Decl.,
Ex. 1, Req. for Production, pp. 11:15-17, 15:26-16:27, 19:25-28.)  Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff’s
discovery requests information that is central to Plaintiff’s claims against
Defendant. 
            Based on the evidence presented, and in light of the fact
that Defendant did not file an opposition to this motion, the court finds that
Defendant has engaged in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process (1)
by willfully disobeying the court’s December 4, 2023, December 19, 2023,
December 20, 2023, and January 8, 2024 orders compelling him to serve responses
and produce responsive documents to Plaintiff’s discovery, and (2) by failing
to respond to authorized methods of discovery (Requests for Production of
Documents, Form Interrogatories (General and Employment), and Special
Interrogatories).  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (g), (d).) 

The court
has also concluded that Defendant’s failure to serve responses and produce
responsive documents to the subject discovery is prejudicial to Plaintiff,
since the discovery requests at issue go to the heart of Plaintiff’s wrongful
termination and employment claims, as set forth above.  Further, the evidence shows that the less
severe sanctions of monetary sanctions issued by the court in its December 4,
2023, December 19, 2023, December 20, 2023, and January 8, 2024 orders have not
produced compliance with the discovery rules or the court’s orders.  (Dec. 4, 2023 Order, p. 2:21-22; Dec. 19,
2023 Order, p. 2:21-22; Dec. 20, 2023 Order, p. 2:21-22; Jan. 8, 2024 Order, p.
2:21-22.)  Finally, as set forth above,
Defendant has not filed an opposition disputing his failure to comply with the
court’s orders.
The
court therefore finds that it is appropriate, and exercises its discretion, to
impose terminating sanctions against Defendant pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (d). 
The court
denies Plaintiff’s
alternative requests for the imposition of issue and/or evidence sanctions as
moot. 
The court denies Plaintiff’s
request that the court order Defendant to pay monetary sanctions to the court
in the amount of $1,500 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5.
The court grants Plaintiff’s
request for monetary sanctions against Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)  The court finds that $3,400 (8.5
hours x $400 hourly rate) is a reasonable amount of sanctions to impose against
Defendant in connection with this motion. 
(Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 37.) 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff Juan Cruz
Rodriguez’s motion for terminating and monetary sanctions as follows.
            The court grants plaintiff Juan Cruz
Rodriguez’s motion for terminating sanctions against defendant John Stich. 
            The court orders that the answer
filed by defendant John Stich on September 6, 2022 is stricken.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(d).) 
            The court orders defendant John
Stich to pay monetary sanctions to plaintiff Juan Cruz Rodriguez in the amount
of $3,400 no later than 30 days of the date of service of this order. 
            The court sets an Order to Show
Cause re entry
of default and default judgment for hearing on August 6, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., in
Department 53.
            The court orders plaintiff Juan Cruz
Rodriguez (1) to file a Request for Entry of Default (Judicial Council form
CIV-100) as to defendant John Stich no later than 10 days from the date of this
order, and (2) to file default judgment documents required by California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1800 (including a proposed judgment on form JUD-100) no later
than July 12, 2024.
            The court orders that the Final
Status Conference, set for October 11, 2024, is vacated. 
The court orders that trial, set for October 23, 2024, is vacated. 
            The court orders plaintiff Juan Cruz
Rodriguez to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
