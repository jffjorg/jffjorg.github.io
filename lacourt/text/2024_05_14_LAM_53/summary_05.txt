And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the request for judicial notice of the certified docket in the matter The People of the State of California v. Justin Charles Cato (Case No. BA432098) and has taken judicial notice of the docket attached as Exhibit E to the declaration of Jin S. Choi. However, the court does not take judicial notice of other documents referred to in the declaration. The court has also considered the two causes of action and has determined that they do not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action on the additional ground that the plaintiff did not allege actual innocence.
