And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion filed by the defendants to strike portions of the Second Amended Complaint seeking attorney's fees. The defendants had argued that the court has authority to strike portions of the complaint and that the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover attorney's fees. The judge found that the plaintiffs are not entitled to attorney's fees as there is no contract, statute, or other law that authorizes a fee award. The motion is unopposed, and the judge has inferred that it has merit. The judge has ordered the defendants to give notice of the ruling.
