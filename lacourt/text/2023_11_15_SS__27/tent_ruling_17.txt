[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: DEFENDANT RALPH RAULLI and FULLERTON ISLAND VILLAGE
  APARTMENTS, LLC’s MOTION FOR LEAVE TO TAKE A NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION
  OF PLAINTIFF
 
Dept.

1:30
  p.m.

November
   15, 2023



 
TENTATIVE 
 
Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiff to attend an
independent mental examination to be conducted by Dr. Charles Hinkin on
February12, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. is GRANTED based on the fact that the issue of
taking said examination is not really at issue. 
 
Defendants’ request that a cancellation less than 3
business days in advance of the scheduled examination be subject to a discovery
sanction of $3500 is DENIED.  If a
cancellation occurs, Defendants can request sanctions at thereafter based upon
facts they deem support a sanction.  
With regard to the more significant issues of whether the
court will impose requested limitations regarding disclosure of raw data and limit
audio recording to certain portions of the examination, the Court will hear
further argument and does not now make a tentative ruling.
    Dated this 15th day of November,
