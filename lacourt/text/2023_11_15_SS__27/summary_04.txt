Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to strike portions of the Second Amended Complaint filed by the defendants in a lawsuit arising from a shooting that occurred on November 14, 2017. The defendants seek to strike all references to attorney's fees from the complaint, arguing that the court has authority to strike improper portions of the complaint and that plaintiffs are not entitled to recover attorney's fees. The plaintiffs have filed a statement of non-opposition to the motion, indicating that they will not oppose the motion to strike their request for attorney's fees. The judge grants the motion, ruling that the Second Amended Complaint does not allege an entitlement to attorney's fees by contract, statute, or other law, and that the motion is unopposed.
