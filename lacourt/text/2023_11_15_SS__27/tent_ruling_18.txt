 INTRODUCTION 
 
On August 2, 2022, Plaintiff
Steven Pagliaro (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Tenten
Wilshire, LLC, Amidi Partners, LLC, Amidi Real Estate, LLC, Admidi, LLC
(“Defendants”) alleging two causes of action for premises liability and general
negligence. The complaint alleges that Plaintiff, a tenant of the Subject
Property, was using the back staircase that was slippery, uneven, and/or
otherwise dangerous. Plaintiff fell and was injured. 
 
On January 20, 2023, Defendants
Tenten Wilshire, LLC, and Amir, LLC filed an Answer. 
On September 19, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One.
As of November 13, 2023, no opposition has been filed.  Also on
September 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests
for Production of Documents, Set One. As of November 13, 2023, no opposition
has been filed. Motion to Compel Special Interrogatories                 ILEGAL STANDARD 
 
The propounding party may bring a motion to
compel further responses to interrogatories if the propounding party deems that
production is deficient, incomplete, or contains meritless objections. 
CCP § 2030.300(a).  The legal burden to justify refusing or
failing to provide discovery lies with the objecting party.  (Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58
Cal.2d 210, 220). 
 
The motion must be accompanied by a good-faith
meet-and-confer declaration. CCP § 2031.310(b). “A determination of
whether an attempt at informal resolution is adequate . . . involves the
exercise of discretion.” (Stewart v.
Colonial W. Agency (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016).  “The
history of the litigation, the nature of the interaction between counsel, the
nature of the issues, the type and scope of discovery requested, the prospects
for success and other similar factors can be relevant.  Judges have broad
powers and responsibility to determine what measure and procedures are
appropriate in varying circumstances.”  Id. 
 
CCP § 2030.300 provides the court shall
apposes monetary sanctions against a person, party, or attorney that
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response, unless
that subject to sanction acted “with substantial justification or other
circumstances make the imposition of sanctions unjust.”  CCP §
2023.010(h).  The court “may impose a monetary sanction” against any
attorney or party, or both, to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney
fees, if there has been a “misuse of the discovery process.  CCP §
2023.030(a).  “A trial court has broad discretion when imposing a
discovery sanction.”  (Lee v.
Lee (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1553, 1559). 
              DISCUSSION 
 
Plaintiff seeks to compel
Defendant Tenten Wilshire, LLC, to provide further responses, without
objections, to the Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 12-16, 19-21, 25-28,
30, 35-43, 46, 47, 48-54, 56, 59-66, 67, 68-69, 75, and 81-84.
 
Background: 
 
            Plaintiff
propounded the initial Special Interrogatories back on August 29, 2022, with a
deadline of September 28, 2022. Defendant served unverified responses on
January 4, 2023. Over the next months, Plaintiff sent multiple meet and confer
letters to defense counsel, granting multiple extensions and set up an Informal
Discovery Conference. By August 29, 2023, Plaintiff granted Defendant one final
extension, with responses due on September 12, 2023. However, as of the date of
this motion, Plaintiff has not received verified substantive responses. 
 
            Plaintiff
argues that Defendant’s responses are deficient. The responses provided are
incomplete, evasive, deficient, and non-responsive. Some of Defendant’s
responses indicated that discovery was still ongoing, some were left blank,
others failed to provide specific dates (such as dates of inspections, despite
claiming the area was walked daily), others indicated that discovery was still
ongoing, some stated it was a part of Tenten Wilshire LLC’s maintenance team. 
 
After reviewing the responses to
these questions, the
Court finds that further responses must be provided. Here, Plaintiff is seeking
relevant information. “Section 2017.010 and other statues governing discovery
‘must be construed liberally in favor or disclosure unless the request is
clearly improper by virtue of well-established causes of denial’” (Yelp Inc. v. Superior Court (2017) 17
Cal.App.5th 1, 15). Many of the questions ask about specific dates, persons, or
policies. However, Defendant’s responses are insufficient and merely state that
Tenten Wilshire’s maintenance team was responsible. If there is no specific
person who painted the stairs or water plants, for instance, then Defendant
should have indicated as such. Additionally, Defendant failed to provide a response to some of the
requests.
Thus, this information is relevant as it concerns the maintenance of the area
where Plaintiff fell. Defendant has failed to provide a sufficient reason for
not sufficiently responding to these Special Interrogatories, and discovery
disclosure is construed liberally. 
  Therefore, Motion to Compel Further
Response to Special Interrogatories is GRANTED.
Sanctions: 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that
the court may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of
the discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s
fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery
process includes failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Further, sanctions are
mandatory in the event that a party “unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion
to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification…” (CCP § 2030.300).
 
            Plaintiff requests $2,936.65 in
sanctions. This is based on an hourly rate of $250 and a total of 11.5 hours,
as follows: 
 
Review of Initial Discovery Responses 1.0 
January 23, 2023, Meet and Confer Letter 1.0 
May 4, 2023, Meet and Confer Letter 1.0 
August 22, 2023, Meet and Confer Letter 1.0 
Preparation of IDC Form 0.5 
Preparation of Motion 1.5 
Preparation of Separate Statement 3.0 
Anticipated Review of Opposition 0.5 
Anticipated Preparation of Reply 1.0 
Court Appearance 1.0 
 
Total Time 11.5
 Additionally,
Plaintiff requests $61.65 for the costs of filing this motion. The Court finds that the hourly rate of $250 is
reasonable. However, there are instances that have not been reasonably
incurred. For example, as there has been no opposition filed, reviewing the
opposition and preparing the reply is unnecessary. Therefore, a reduction of
sanctions is warranted. The Court will reduce the award by  about $500.00. Therefore,
the Court awards sanctions against Defendant totaling $2,450 in relation to the Motion Re Special Interrogatories. Motion to Compel Documents
              DISCUSSION 
 
Plaintiff
seeks to compel Defendant Tenten Wilshire, LLC, to provide further responses,
without objections, to the Request for Production, Set One, nos. 19-20, 25-32,
33-40, 47-52, 54, 61-73, 77- 84, and 88-93. 
 
Background: 
 
            Plaintiff propounded the initial Special Interrogatories
back on August 29, 2022, with a deadline of September 28, 2022. Defendant
served unverified responses on January 4, 2023. Over the next months, Plaintiff
sent multiple meet and confer letters to defense counsel, granting multiple
extensions and set up an Informal Discovery Conference. By August 29, 2023,
Plaintiff granted Defendant one final extension, with responses due on
September 12, 2023. However, as of the date of this motion, Plaintiff has not
received verified substantive responses. 
 
            Plaintiff argues
that the responses to the RPDs are insufficient. The objections are too
general, without merits, and do not comply with the statutory requirements of
CCP § 2031.240(b). The objections included that the requests were vague,
ambiguous, overly broad, burdensome, sought privileged information, or seeks
premature expert testimony. 
 
            As for
attorney impressions, Plaintiff does agree to exclude attorneys from the term
“person.” However as to claims that the requests seek work produce, Plaintiff
argues that this response does not comply with CCP § 2031.240(b-c), as it
requires a party to provide enough factual information about the documents. 
 
Plaintiff also argues that for
responses 25-32, Defendant’s responses are deficient. Defendant stated that it
will comply with these requests and identifies the “management agreement and
amended agreement.” However, Plaintiff states that the Management Agreement and
Amended agreement do not refer to a policy, procedure, or guideline “for
inspections of the subject promises and back staircase or determining whether
the subject premises or back staircase were in a safe condition…” (Sep. Stmt.
7: 3-9.) 
 
As to requests Nos. 33-40, 54,
61-71, and 88-93, Defendant merely stated that “responding party is continuing
to search for responsive documents to this request.” Plaintiff argues that this
response fails to comply with CCP § 2031.230.[1] A
party who is unable to comply with the response must indicate that a search has
been made, why that party cannot comply, and who may have these documents. 
 
Lastly, some of Defendant’s
responses indicate that they would comply with the request. However, the
documents produced did not contain all the requested documents. For example, as
to Nos. 83-84, Defendant stated it would produce any Insurance Bureau Index
Reports and any ISO claims searched conducted of Plaintiff. However,
Defendant’s production did not include the Insurance Bureau Index or the ISO
Claims search reports. 
 
After
reviewing the responses to these questions, the Court finds that further
responses must be provided. Here, Plaintiff is seeking relevant information. “Section
2017.010 and other statues governing discovery ‘must be construed liberally in
favor or disclosure unless the request is clearly improper by virtue of
well-established causes of denial’” (Yelp
Inc. v. Superior Court (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 1, 15). Many of the responses
do not comply with CCP § 2031.210-2031.240. Defendant failed to provide code-complaint
responses. Moreover, despite indicating that it would comply with the response,
Defendant failed to produce documents that correspond to the requests. Thus,
this information is relevant as it concerns the documents and electronically
store information about the incident, such as reports and videos. Defendant has
failed to provide a sufficient reason for not sufficiently responding to these
Requests for Production of Documents, and discovery disclosure is construed
liberally. 
 
Therefore, Motion to Compel
Further Response to Request for Production of Documents is GRANTED.  
 
 Sanctions:
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030,
subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a
monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to
pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010, subd. (d).) Further, sanctions are mandatory in the event that a party
“unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further responses to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification…” (CCP § 2031.310). 
 
            Plaintiff
requests $2,936.65 in sanctions. This is based on an hourly rate of $250 for a
total of 11.5 hours. This is based on the following: 
 
Review of Initial Discovery
Responses 1.0 
January 23, 2023, Meet and Confer
Letter 1.0 
May 4, 2023, Meet and Confer Letter
1.0 
August 22, 2023, Meet and Confer
Letter 1.0 
Preparation of IDC Form 0.5 
Preparation of Motion 1.5 
Preparation of Separate Statement
3.0 
Anticipated Review of Opposition
0.5 
Anticipated Preparation of Reply
1.0 
Court Appearance 1.0 
 
Total Time 11.5
 
. Additionally, Plaintiff requests $61.65 for the costs of
filing this motion. The Court finds that the hourly
rate of $250 is reasonable. However, there are instances that have not been
reasonably incurred. For example, as there has been no opposition filed,
reviewing the opposition and preparing the reply is unnecessary. Further, various items, such as the meet and confer letters and court appearance are addressed in the sanctions award for special interrogatories.  Therefore, the Court will reduce the award by about $1,250.00.  The Court awards sanctions against Defendant totaling $1,200.Further, the Court continued the issue of sanctions
relating to two discovery motions granted on November 15, 2023.  The Court awards reasonable sanctions of $3000
in relation to those discovery motions. 
IV.CONCLUSION   The Motion to Compel Further
Response to Request for Production of Documents is GRANTED. The Motion to Compel Further Response to Special Interrogatories is GRANTED.  The Sanctions Requests are GRANTED.  Further Responses and Sanctions totaling $6650.00 are to be made and paid within 20 days of this Order.
