I.           
Introduction 
On October 7, 2021, Plaintiffs Sheldon Phillips, and
Martin Phillips (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Defendant
Anie Kevork Mikaelian (“Defendant”) and Does 1-5, alleging causes of action for
motor vehicle and general negligence. 
On August 14, 2023, Defendant filed a motion for
leave to conduct mental examination of Plaintiff Sheldon Phillips. On November
2, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an opposition. On November 8, 2023, Defendant filed a
reply.

Legal
Standard
 
“As
a general matter, a defendant may obtain a physical or mental examination of
the plaintiff, in accordance with those provisions, if the plaintiff has placed
his or her physical or mental condition in controversy.”¿¿(Carpenter
v. Superior Court¿(2006) 141 Cal. App.
4th 249, 258.)¿¿ 
California
Code of Civil procedure section 2032.310 states: “(a) If any party desires to
obtain discovery by a physical examination other than that described in Article
2 (commencing with Section 2032.210), or by a mental examination, the party
shall obtain leave of court. (b) A motion for an examination under subdivision
(a) shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the
examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any, of the person
or persons who will perform the examination. The motion shall be accompanied by
a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. (c) Notice of the motion
shall be served on the person to be examined and on all parties who have
appeared in the action.” 
California
Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.320 states: “(a) The court shall grant a
motion for a physical or mental examination under Section 2032.310 only for
good cause shown. . . . (d) An order granting a physical or mental examination
shall specify the person or persons who may perform the examination, as well as
the time, place, manner, diagnostic tests and procedures, conditions, scope,
and nature of the examination.” 
Discovery Cut-Off
“[A]ny
party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings
on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or
before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).)  
“On
motion of any party, the court may grant leave to complete discovery
proceedings, or to have a motion concerning discovery heard, closer to the
initial trial date, or to reopen discovery after a new trial date has been set.
This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050, subd. (a).)  
III.       
Discussion
          As a
preliminary matter, the Court must determine whether Defendant’s motion is
timely made. On August 25, 2023, the Court issued an Order continuing the trial
originally scheduled for October 5, 2023, to March 15, 2023, and stated “Discovery
remains tied to the current trial date, not the new trial date, with the
exception of previously designated experts for whom the discovery cut-off date
will be the new trial date. The court cannot reopen discovery by ex parte
application absent an agreement.” (08/25/23 Minute Order.) As of this date, the
parties did not stipulate to an agreement to reopen discovery with the Court. In
addition, Defendant failed to conduct an informal discovery conference prior to
filing this motion. 
          Given that
discovery tracks to the initial trial date of October 5, 2023, Defendant’s
motions concerning discovery had to be heard before the 15th day of
trial, which is September 20, 2023. However, the Court finds that a mental
examination is a discovery proceeding since it is a method for a party to “obtain
discovery”, which must occur on or before the 30th day before trial. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 2019.010 [“Any party may obtain discovery by one or more of the
following methods: … (d) Physical and mental examinations”].)  The cut-off date for discovery proceedings in
this matter is September 5, 2023. The hearing for this instant motion is
scheduled for November 15, 2023. The Court finds that the order to compel the
discovery proceeding is to be heard past the discovery cut-off date provided in
Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020, subdivision (a). 
          There is no
dispute between the parties that Plaintiff has put his mental state in issue by
pleading that he suffers from “fatigue, mental fogginess, irritability, anxiety
and depression” (Fajardo Decl., Ex A, pg. 7.) While Defendant argues there is
good cause for the Court to order the mental examination, Defendant does not
move for leave to complete discovery proceedings closer to the initial trial
date pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050, subdivision (a). See
Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc.
(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1571 [trial court prejudicially abused discretion
by granting motion to compel after discovery motion cutoff date when moving
party had not moved to reopen discovery under Code of Civil Procedure section
2024.050].) Accordingly, the motion is denied. 
 
IV.        
Conclusion

Defendant’s motion for leave to conduct
mental examination is DENIED.
Moving party to give notice.

tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
