I.           
INTRODUCTION
The complaint in this action arises
from an alleged motor vehicle accident that occurred on October 4, 2018. On
October 1, 2020, Plaintiff Isaac Cortez (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint for
personal injuries—car accident against Defendants Desiree Hindman, Sevak Dersarkissian,
Selina Dersarkissian, Lyft, Inc., and Does 1 through 20. The complaint does not
identify any specific causes of action; however, the complaint alleges
negligence. 
Plaintiff alleges that he was a
passenger in a Black 2013 Scion on October 4, 2018, and he was injured while
riding in the motor vehicle. (Complaint, ¶¶ 12-13.) Plaintiff alleges that the
negligent conduct of Defendants was the cause of his injuries. (Id., ¶¶
14-16.) 
On June 29, 2022, Defendant Sevak
Dersarkissian (“Defendant”) filed an answer to the complaint. 
On April 27, 2023, the Court granted
Defendant’s motion to deem Defendant’s Requests for Admission, Set One, as
admitted against Plaintiff, as well as Defendant’s motions to compel responses
to discovery.[1]

On August 1, 2023, Defendant filed and
served the instant motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary
adjudication (the “Motion”). The Motion is made on the grounds that Defendant
is entitled to summary judgment because there is no triable issue as to any
material fact regarding Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant as stated in the
complaint. 
In support of the Motion, Defendant
contends that: (1) Defendant is not the legal cause of Plaintiff’s harm; and
(2) Plaintiff admits that he has no claims for negligence, loss of earnings, or
earning capacity. Defendant contends that his Requests for Admission, Set One,
were deemed admitted and, therefore, Plaintiff cannot prove his negligence
claim. 
The Motion is unopposed. Any opposition
to the Motion was required to have been filed and served at least nine court
days prior to the hearing pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure,
Section 1005(b).  
 
II.         
 JUDICIAL NOTICE
          The Court
GRANTS Defendant’s request for judicial notice as to Exhibits 1 through 8
pursuant to California Evidence Code, Section 452. 
 
III.       
LEGAL
STANDARD
The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code
Civ. Proc. § 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all
the evidence submitted, and all inferences reasonably deducible from the
evidence and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is
no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled
to judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  “The function
of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of
the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose
whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.”  (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67.)
“As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense.” (Scalf v. D. B. Log
Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe
the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve
doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.”  (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) Once the
defendant has met its burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action
or a defense thereto. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra,
25 Cal.4th 826, 849.)  A defendant moving
for summary judgment “may . . . present evidence that the plaintiff does not
possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence—as through admissions by
the plaintiff following extensive discovery to the effect that he has discovered
nothing.” (Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884, 889-90.)
 
IV.        
DISCUSSION
          To succeed in
a negligence action, a plaintiff must show the following: (1) the defendant
owed the plaintiff a legal duty; (2) the defendant breached the duty; and (3)
the breach proximately or legally caused the plaintiff’s damages or injuries. (Thomas
v. Stenberg (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 654, 662.) 
The causation element of negligence is
met when a plaintiff establishes that: (1) the defendant’s breach of duty was a
substantial factor in bringing about the plaintiff’s harm; and (2) there is no
rule of law relieving the defendant of liability. (Leslie G. v. Perry &
Associates (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 472, 481.) A plaintiff must establish that
the defendant’s act or omission was a substantial factor in bringing about the
injury. (Saelzler v. Advanced Group 400 (2001) 25 Cal.4th 763, 774.) Evidence
of causation must be substantial and cannot be mere speculation or conjecture.
(Showalter v. Western Pac. R. Co. (1940) 16 Cal.2d 460, 471.) The
substantial factor standard generally produces the same results as does the but
for rule of causation which states that a defendant’s conduct is a cause of the
injury if the injury would not have occurred but for that conduct. (Rutherford
v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 969.) 
Defendant’s Evidence
Defendant presents the following
undisputed facts in support of the Motion: (1) the subject incident occurred on
October 4, 2018 in Covina, California (Defendant’s Separate Statement at No.1);
(2) Plaintiff was a passenger in Defendant’s vehicle (Id. at No.2); (3)
Desiree Hindman collided with Defendant’s vehicle (Id. at No.3); (4) on
July 8, 2022, Defendant served Plaintiff with Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, Requests for Admission, and Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One (Id. at No. 4); (5) Plaintiff failed provide any
responses to Defendant’s discovery and Defendant filed a motion to compel
Plaintiff’s responses and to deem the Requests for Admissions, Set One, as admitted
(Id. at No. 5); and (6) the Court granted the motion to compel and
deemed the Requests for Admission as admitted on April 2, 2023 (Id. at
No. 6). 
Defendant presents the further
following undisputed facts: (1) Plaintiff admitted that Defendant was not
negligent with respect to the subject incident and that his negligence was not
a substantial factor in causing the subject incident (Defendant’s Separate
Statement at Nos. 7-8); (2) Plaintiff admitted that Desiree Hindman’s
negligence was a substantial factor in causing the subject incident (Id.
at Nos. 9-10); and (3) Plaintiff admitted that Defendant had the right of way
at the time of the subject incident (Id. at No. 11). 
Defendant has presented evidence that
there is no triable issue of material fact as to causation. The burden now
shifts to Plaintiff to show a triable issue of material fact. 
Plaintiff’s Lack of Evidence and
Analysis 
Plaintiff has failed to oppose the
Motion and therefore has not presented any evidence showing that there is a
triable issue of material fact as to causation. The Court therefore finds that
Defendant has met his burden by showing that Plaintiff’s negligence claim
cannot be established. Plaintiff’s failure to file an opposition creates an
inference that the Motion is meritorious. (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) 
Accordingly, the Motion is GRANTED. 
VI.     CONCLUSION
The Court GRANTS the Motion.

tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
