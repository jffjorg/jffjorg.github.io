And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling discusses the requirements for a responding party to demonstrate an inability to comply with a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling. The party must affirm that a diligent search and reasonable inquiry have been made to comply with the demand. The statement must specify the reason for the inability to comply, such as the item never existing or being lost or stolen. The party must also provide the name and address of any person or organization known to have possession, custody, or control of the item. The judge orders the moving party to give notice and advises parties who intend to submit on the tentative to send an email to the court. If a party submits on the tentative but does not appear at the hearing, the opposing party may still appear to argue the matter.
