And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motions to deem requests for admissions admitted as to both defendants are granted. As a result, the defendants are ordered to pay $600.00 in sanctions to the plaintiff. The plaintiff had propounded requests for admissions on the defendants on October 17, 2022, but the defendants failed to respond. The plaintiff's counsel spent 2 hours on each motion and the filing fee for each motion was $60.00. The court applied the Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.250 and § 2033.280 to determine that the defendants failed to comply with the law and therefore the plaintiff's motions are granted.
