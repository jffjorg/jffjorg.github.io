The judge has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to continue the trial date from December 11, 2023, to April 8, 2024, or the next available date on the court's calendar. The parties have stipulated to the continuance and requested that all discovery and motion cut-off dates be based on the new trial date. The judge has found that there is good cause for the continuance based on the parties' need to complete discovery and prepare for trial. The judge has also noted that the defendant's counsel is aware of two prior continuances and that the parties believe mediation could resolve the matter. The trial is now continued to April 8, 2024, and all parties are expected to track the new trial date for discovery and motion cut-off dates.
