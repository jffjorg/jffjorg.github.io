The motion was filed on October 23, 2023, and the hearing is set for November 15, 2023. The motion is unopposed, but the Court finds that the Estate has not complied with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 377.32.

The Court also finds that a certified copy of Plaintiff's death certificate was not attached to the motion. Therefore, the Court denies the motion without prejudice.
