And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's unopposed motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to the defendant's request for production of documents, set one. The plaintiff's counsel failed to respond to the request, despite being served on May 22, 2023. The defendant's counsel, Alan J. Carnegie, spent a total of 6.7 hours on the motion and requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,015.00. The court grants the motion and orders the plaintiff to provide verified, complete, and code-compliant responses to the request within 30 days of notice of the order.

The court also grants the defendant's request for monetary sanctions against the plaintiff and the plaintiff's counsel, The Barnes Firm, in the amount of $1350.00. This amount represents three hours of work at the rate of $450.00 per hour. The court reduces the amount of time spent on the motion due to its simplicity and the fact that the motion is unopposed.

The judge's ruling is tentative and parties who intend to submit on the ruling must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit. The ruling may be adopted as the final order or placed off calendar if no submissions are received.
