Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Sevak Dersarkissian. The motion was unopposed, and the judge has granted the motion. The judge found that Defendant has met his burden by showing that Plaintiff Isaac Cortez's negligence claim cannot be established. The judge's ruling is based on Plaintiff's failure to provide any evidence showing that there is a triable issue of material fact as to causation. The judge also noted that Plaintiff failed to file an opposition to the motion, which created an inference that the motion is meritorious. As a result, the judge granted the motion for summary judgment and ordered the moving party to give notice of this ruling.
