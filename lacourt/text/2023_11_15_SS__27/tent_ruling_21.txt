[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: Motion to
  Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents 
 
Dept. 27 
1:30 p.m. 
November 16, 2023.



 
                   
I.INTRODUCTION 
 
On September 8, 2022, Plaintiff William Garcia
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Aldarberto[1] Barba
and Olga Mata (“Defendants”) alleging two causes of action for motor vehicle
and general negligence arising from motor vehicle accident that occurred
between the parties. 
 
On November 28, 2022, Defendant Aldarberto Barba
filed an Answer. 
 
On May 3, 2023, Defendant Barba filed 3 separate
Motions to Compel Discovery responses. As of November 13, 2023, no opposition
has been filed. 
 
                
II.LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and
for a monetary sanction.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)¿ The
statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have
been served.¿ Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including
privilege and work product.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(a).)¿  
 
Under California Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030, subd. (a), “[t]he court may impose a monetary
sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or
any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. . .
. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the
court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery is a misuse of the discovery process.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿ 
 
Sanctions are mandatory in connection with motions to compel
responses to the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel unless the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
             
III.DISCUSSION 
 
Defendant seeks to compel Plaintiff to provide
responses, without objection, to Request for Production of Documents. 
 
On November 28, 2022, Defendant propounded the
Request for Production on Plaintiff, with responses due on December 30, 2022.
An extension was given until January 16, 2023. Defendant’s counsel also
contacted Plaintiff three separate times in an effort to resolve the matter
informally but did not receive any responses. (Dec. Miller, ¶ 4-6.) As of the
date of the filing of the current motion, no responses have been provided. 
 
Here, Defendant is entitled to responses. Plaintiff has
failed to provide responses to the Request for Production of Documents that was
served in November 2022, almost a year ago. As stated above, under CCP §§
2030.290, when a party fails to provide responses to timely propounded
discovery, a party may move for an order compelling responses. 
 
Defendant also requests sanctions in the amount of $860. The
Court awards reasonable sanctions in the amount of $500 for an unopposed motion.

 
             
IV.CONCLUSION 
 
Motion to Compel Responses is GRANTED.  Sanctions in the amount of $500 to Defendant
is granted.  Responses and sanctions due
20 days after this Order.
 
Moving party to give
notice. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on
this tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions
provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  Please be advised that
if you submit on the tentative and elect not to appear at the hearing, the
opposing party may nevertheless appear at the hearing and argue the
matter.  Unless you receive a submission from all other parties in the
matter, you should assume that others might appear at the hearing to
argue.  If the Court does not receive emails from the parties indicating
submission on this tentative ruling and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the tentative as the final
order or place the motion off calendar.
