 Case Number:  23STCV20205    Hearing Date:   March 15, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of Default Money Judgment
            Plaintiff Foothill Capital Group, LLC brings an
unlawful detainer action against defendant Alvaro M Luna aka Alvaro Ramiro
Montesinos Luna.  Defendant
defaulted.  Plaintiff obtained clerk’s
judgment for possession of the property on September 28, 2023.  In addition to possession, plaintiff’s
complaint also prayed for damages. 
(Comp., ¶ 19.)  Plaintiff has not
requested a money judgment for its damages. 

On
January 5, 2024, the court held a hearing on this order to show cause re: entry
of default money judgment.  The court
found plaintiff had not timely applied for a default judgment for the money
demanded in its complaint.  On February
9, 2024, the court held another hearing on the order to show cause re: entry of
default money judgment.  Plaintiff has
filed nothing since then.  It has neither
applied for a money judgment nor requested an extension of time to do so.  
Since
filing the complaint, plaintiff has done nothing to indicate it seeks the money
it prayed for.  The court therefore will
discharge this order to show cause and hold no further hearings.  The case is disposed of via clerk’s judgment
for possession.  If plaintiff seeks the
money its complaint prayed for, it must reserve a hearing date and file a
noticed motion to obtain a money judgment. 
Otherwise, this action is fully adjudicated. 
The order to show cause re: entry of default money
judgment is hereby discharged.
