The tentative ruling is issued by a judge in a case where Foothill Capital Group, LLC (plaintiff) is seeking to evict Alvaro M Luna aka Alvaro Ramiro Montesinos Luna (defendant) from a property due to unlawful detainer. The defendant has defaulted, and the plaintiff has obtained a clerk's judgment for possession. However, the plaintiff has not requested a money judgment for damages, despite praying for it in the complaint. The judge has held two hearings on the order to show cause re: entry of default money judgment, but the plaintiff has not taken any further action to seek a money judgment. Therefore, the judge will discharge the order to show cause and hold no further hearings. The case is disposed of via clerk's judgment for possession, and if the plaintiff wishes to seek a money judgment, it must reserve a hearing date and file a noticed motion.
