Summary in English:

The judge's tentative ruling grants defendant Triller Hold Co LLC's motion to compel arbitration of the case. The arbitration agreement between the parties includes a provision for attorney fees and costs, which the plaintiff argues is unconscionable. The court finds that the agreement is partially unconscionable, but only as applied to the plaintiff's claims under the Labor Code. The court severs the unconscionable provisions and orders the parties to arbitrate the dispute, staying the entire action pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding.
