And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses several issues related to the petition filed by the petitioner. The judge notes that the petitioner filed her reply brief late, but considers it nonetheless. The judge also notes that the petitioner did not individually paginate her RJN, so the court will refer to the actual pages within the document.

The judge limits the petitioner's claims under Section 54963 to those statements made on December 4, 2019, as identified in her Opening Brief. The judge does not include statements made by Councilmember Massey in the analysis, as the petitioner did not include Massey as a respondent for the TAP's fourth cause of action.

The judge concludes that the discussions on December 4, 2019, are exactly the type of discussions for which the open meeting law was created, and that they relate directly to the democratic process and the function of government.

The judge also notes that the respondent's perception of the petitioner's position is that some of the facts disclosed by respondents at the December 4, 2019, meeting were acquired in closed sessions relating to the City Manager's performance evaluation and are therefore confidential information under the Brown Act.

Finally, the judge indicates that monetary sanctions will be ordered, but does not specify the amount at this time.
