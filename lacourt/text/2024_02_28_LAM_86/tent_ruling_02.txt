[1] The TAP is the operative pleading in this proceeding.


[2] While Petitioner filed her reply brief late, the court
nonetheless considers it. (See Notice of Ruling filed October 4, 2023.)


[3] Petitioner did not individually paginate her RJN.
Accordingly, the court refers to the actual page within the 1,187 page RJN
starting with the face page as the first page.


[4] According to Petitioner and the City’s Adjourned
Meeting Agenda for each meeting, Suja Lowenthal was then serving as City
Manager. (RJN, Ex. A, pp. 6, 17, 29.)


[5] Petitioner did not request leave to file an oversized
brief. The court did not learn of Petitioner’s apparent inability to provide
all of the alleged confidential information disclosed to the public because of
page limits until she filed her Opening Brief. The court notes Petitioner also
did not set out the allegedly improperly disclosed confidential information in
the TAP for which there is no page limitation under the California Rules of
Court. Respondents note Petitioner’s lack of specificity beyond the statements
identified in her Opening Brief leave them “to guess as to what statements made
during the December 4, 2019 meeting Petitioner contends constituted unlawful
disclosures of confidential information.” (Opposition Brief 13:17-19.)
Accordingly, the court limits Petitioner’s claims under Section 54963 to those
statements made on December 4, 2019 as identified in her Opening Brief.


[6] While Petitioner also provides statements made by Councilmember
Massey, the court does not include those statements as Petitioner did not
include Councilmember Massey as a Respondent for the TAP’s fourth cause of
action.


[7] The court suggests the discussions on December 4, 2019
are exactly the type for which the open meeting law was created. The
discussions relate directly to the democratic process and the function of
government.


[8] Respondents perceive Petitioner’s position in the same
way: “Petitioner claims that some of the facts that were disclosed by
[Respondent Campbell and Respondent Armato] at that December 4, 2019 City
Council meeting were acquired in closed sessions relating to the City Manager’s
performance evaluation and, as a result, are ipso facto ‘confidential
information’ within the meeting of the Brown Act, Government Code § 54963 . . . .” (Opposition 1:9-12.)


[9] Councilmember Fangary is
Petitioner’s husband and counsel in this matter. (Natalizio Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A 9:12-14.)


[10] Petitioner separates “city manager performance or
evaluation issues” from “interactions between the city manager and any
councilmember” apparently to suggest any closed session discussion
involving the city manager falls within the personnel exception and is
confidential information without regard to context. (Opening Brief 7:1-2.)


[11] The City Attorney provided this opinion to the City
Council when discussing the cure and correct demand.


[12] Multiple statements made by councilmembers support
such a finding: For example, “I know he is very aware of my concern, of his
inability to work with [the city manager] as Mayor pro tem or Mayor.” (RJN,
Ex. E p. 662 [Councilmember Armato]); “. . . well, I’ve certainly been clear,
that all I desire from [Councilmember Fangary] is a basic respectful line of
communication between him and our City Manager.” (RJN, Ex. E p. 663
[Councilmember Armato]); “No one is asking for him to adore her, he can be
critical, but he must communicate professionally with her.” (RJN, Ex. E p. 663
[Councilmember Armato]); “I expressed immediately it was unthinkable for a
Council Member to determine that they would no longer be interacting with our
City Manager.” (RJN, Ex. E p. 673 [Councilmember Campbell]); and “. . .
Councilmember Fangary has been gratuitously combative, demeaning, and
counter-productive in communications with the City Manager and the staff.”
(RJN, Ex. E pp. 649-650 [Councilmember Massey].)


[13] The court stated: “I’m going to order monetary
sanctions. . . . [Respondents’ counsel], you can brief the amount of monetary
sanctions to which you believe you’re entitled at the time of trial.”
(Natalizio Decl., filed September 13, 2023, Ex. H at 14:5-9.) The court did not
specify the amount of the award at that time as Respondents’ requested—as the
court recalls—$10,000, an amount that appeared unreasonable.
