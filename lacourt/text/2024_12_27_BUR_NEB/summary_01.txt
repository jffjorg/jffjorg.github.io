And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying plaintiff John Doe's motion for a new trial. The motion was filed on November 25, 2024, nearly five months after the court's March 8, 2024 order sustaining the demurrer of defendants City of Los Angeles and Mr. Weideman without leave to amend. The judge finds that the motion is untimely, as plaintiff had 15 days from March 15, 2024 to file his notice of intention to move for a new trial, but filed on April 2, 2024 instead. The judge notes that time limits in Code of Civil Procedure section 659 are jurisdictional and cannot be extended or waived by the parties. As a result, the court is stripped of authority to hear the motion and it is denied.
