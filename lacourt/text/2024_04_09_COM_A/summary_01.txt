And here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has ruled on the demurrer to the complaint, specifically addressing the claims for fraudulent inducement-concealment and negligent repair. The court has overruled Ford's demurrer to the seventh cause of action for fraudulent inducement-concealment, finding that the allegations are sufficient to support the claim. However, the court has sustained Santa Monica's demurrer to the fifth cause of action for negligent repair, finding that the complaint does not allege facts to establish a component-to-component exception to the economic-loss rule. The court has given the plaintiff 10 days to amend the complaint to cure the defects.
