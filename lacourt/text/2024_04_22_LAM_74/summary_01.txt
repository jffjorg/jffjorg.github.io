And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, 74 Fredy Roldan, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The case, 23STCV15038, involves an employment dispute between Plaintiff Fredy Roldan and Defendants Cordova Construction Services, Inc. and DecisionHR I, Inc. The Plaintiff seeks to file a first amended complaint, which was opposed by the Defendants. The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion, finding that the Plaintiff substantially complied with the applicable California Rules of Court. The Judge noted that the Defendants' opposition was based on the argument that Labor Code section 218 does not give rise to a cause of action, which is a matter that should be raised through a demurrer or motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Judge also rejected the Defendants' argument that the Plaintiff waited too long to seek the amendment, finding that absent prejudice, delay alone is not ground for denial of a motion to amend.
