  Case Number:  23STCV15038    Hearing Date:   April 22, 2024    Dept:  74 Fredy Roldan
v. Cordova Construction Services, Inc., et al.
Motion for Leave to File First
Amended Complaint
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from an
employment dispute.
            On
June 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Cordova
Construction Services, Inc. and DecisionHR I, Inc. (Defendants). 
            On
March 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for leave to file a first amended
complaint. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1), “[t]he court may, in
furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to
amend any pleading.”  Amendment may be
allowed at any time before or after commencement of trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §
576.) “[T]he court’s discretion will usually be exercised liberally to permit
amendment of the pleadings. The policy favoring amendment is so strong that it
is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be justified.” (Howard
v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428 (internal
citations omitted).) “If the motion to amend is timely made and the granting of
the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse
permission to amend . . .”  (Morgan v.
Sup. Ct. (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) Prejudice includes “delay in
trial, loss of critical evidence, or added costs of preparation.” (Solit v.
Tokai Bank, Ltd. New York Branch (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448.) 
A
motion to amend a pleading before trial must include a copy of the proposed
amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate
it from previous pleadings or amendments. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1324(a).) The motion must also state what allegations
are proposed to be deleted or added, by page, paragraph, and line number.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324(a).) Finally, a separate supporting declaration
specifying the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and
proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered,
and the reason the request for amendment was not made earlier must also
accompany the motion. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.134(b).) 
DISCUSSION 
            As
a preliminary matter, the court notes Plaintiff has substantially complied with
the applicable California Rules of Court. In opposition, Defendants argue the
court should deny Plaintiff’s motion because Labor Code section 218 does not
give rise to a cause of action. But the appropriate vehicle for this argument
is a demurrer or motion for judgment on the pleadings. Defendants also contend
Plaintiff knew about the facts that support the proposed amendments when he
filed the original complaint. Defendants add that Plaintiff waited eight months
to pursue the proposed amendments. But absent prejudice, delay alone is not
ground for denial of a motion to amend. (Higgins v. Del Faro (1981)
Cal.App.3d 558, 564-565.) Defendants have not persuaded the court they have
suffered prejudice. Indeed, trial is nearly eight months away. 
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend a first amended complaint.
Plaintiff
shall give notice.
