  Case Number:  22STCV12174    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  57 Pending before the Court on June 10, 2024 is Defendant's motion to compel the deposition of the Plaintiff.  The Court had intended to raise the issues presented in this motion when the parties appeared on June 6, 2024 on a discovery motion that Plaintiff filed, but failed to do so.  Defendant's motion is denied.   That said, the Court will use the opportunity on June 10 to work with counsel to schedule a date for Plaintiff's deposition, if it has not yet been scheduled. The Court also will use the opportunity to set the deposition of Defendant's person most qualified if that has not yet been scheduled.  To facilitate this effort, the Court directs counsel for both sides to have their respective calendars/schedules with them at the June 10 hearing.
