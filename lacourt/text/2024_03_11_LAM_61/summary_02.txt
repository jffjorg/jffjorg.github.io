The motion was filed by Steven Bryant and Bertha Bryant (Plaintiffs) in connection with their lemon law action. The Plaintiffs sought information concerning internal analysis of a defined electrical defect and communications, notices, and recalls regarding the same. The Defendant responded only with objections to certain requests and a statement of partial compliance to another request. The judge found that the Plaintiffs had demonstrated good cause for the discovery and that the Defendant's objections were unpersuasive. The judge ordered the Defendant to provide further code-compliant, objection-free responses within 30 days.
