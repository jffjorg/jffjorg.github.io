And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for approval of the PAGA settlement. The settlement terms are as follows: the defendant will pay a gross settlement amount of $195,000.00, which will be split into various categories, including attorney fees, expenses, and individual "enhancement" payments. The settlement administrator will also receive fees. The judge finds that the settlement is reasonable in light of the strength and complexity of the plaintiff's claims and the risks posed by litigation. Additionally, the judge finds that the plaintiff's request for fees, representing one third of the gross settlement amount, is reasonable in light of the lodestar analysis presented by the plaintiff's counsel. The judge notes that the settlement furthers the purposes of PAGA, which is to remediate present labor law violations, deter future ones, and maximize enforcement of state labor laws.
