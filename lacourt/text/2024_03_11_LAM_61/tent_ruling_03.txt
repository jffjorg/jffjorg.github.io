 Case Number:  23STCV17006    Hearing Date:   March 11, 2024    Dept:  61  
Plaintiff Alexis Tristan’s
Motion for Approval of PAGA Settlement is GRANTED.
Plaintiff to give notice.
MOTION TO APPROVE PAGA SETTLEMENT
Under PAGA, “t[t]he superior
court shall review and approve any settlement of any civil
action filed pursuant to this part. The proposed settlement shall be
submitted to the agency at the same time that it is submitted to the court.” (Lab.
Code, § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)
“[A] trial court should
evaluate a PAGA settlement to determine whether it is fair, reasonable, and
adequate in view of PAGA's purposes to remediate present labor law violations,
deter future ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws.” (Moniz
v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 77.) 
Federal courts have compared
and contrasted PAGA settlements to class action settlements:
In the class
action context, where PAGA claims often also appear, a district court must
independently determine that a proposed settlement agreement is “fundamentally
fair, adequate and reasonable” before granting approval. [Citations.] However,
as the parties rightly point out and as noted above, this is not a class action
lawsuit, and PAGA claims are intended to serve a decidedly different
purpose-namely to protect the public rather than for the benefit of private
parties. [Citation.] In one recent district court case, the LWDA provided some
guidance regarding court approval of PAGA settlements. [Citations.] In that
case, where both class action and PAGA claims were covered by a proposed
settlement, the LWDA stressed that “when a PAGA claim is settled, the relief
provided for under the PAGA be genuine and meaningful, consistent with the
underlying purpose of the statute to benefit the public and, in the context of
a class action, the court evaluate whether the settlement meets the standards
of being “fundamentally fair, reasonable, and adequate” with reference to the
public policies underlying the PAGA.”
(Salazar, supra, 2017 WL
1135801 at pp. 3–4.) A number of these factors, “including the strength of the
plaintiff's case, the risk, the stage of the proceeding, the complexity and
likely duration of further litigation, and the settlement amount,” have been
recognized as useful in the analysis of PAGA settlements. (Moniz, supra,
72 Cal.App.5th at p. 77.) 
Plaintiff Alexis Tristan
(Plaintiff) present the terms of a proposed PAGA settlement here as follows.
Defendant American Homes 4 Rent, L.P. (Defendant) agrees to pay a gross
settlement amount of $195,000.00, (Agnew Decl. Exh. 3, ¶ 17.) Plaintiff’s
counsel is to be paid from this amount one third, amounting to $65,000.00, plus
expenses of up to $15,000.00, though Plaintiff requests actual expenses in the
amount of $12,328.45. (Id. ¶ 18.) Plaintiff is to receive an individual
“enhancement” payment of $10,000.00. (Id. at ¶ 19.) Fees are to be paid
to the settlement administrator in the anticipated amount of $2,850.00. (Id.
at ¶ 20.) 
These payments leave a net
amount of $104,821.55 to be paid as penalties. (Agnew Decl. Exh. 3, ¶ 21.) From
this, 75% is to go to the Labor Workforce Development Agency, while 25% is to
go to the aggrieved employees on a per-pay-period basis. (Id. at ¶¶
21–22.) There are approximately 98 aggrieved employees, who each stand to
receive on average $267.40 from the $26,205.39 that is apportioned to them. (Id.
at ¶¶ 16, 21–23.) 
As to the amount of fees
sought, Plaintiff presents a lodestar of 97.8 hours of attorney work (Agnew
Decl. ¶ 49; Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 6), which at the proposed hourly rates of $800
per hour, would yield a lodestar of $78,240.00. Dividing those hours into the
proposed $65,000 fee award would yield an average hourly rate of approximately
$664.60 per hour.
Plaintiff presents a maximum
potential exposure for Defendant of $538,600. (Agnew Decl. ¶ 26.) This estimate
is based on 2,693 potential pay periods, with each period apportioned
violations for overtime and wage statements. 
(Agnew Decl. ¶ 26.) Plaintiff discusses Defendant’s challenges to both
claims, including arguments as to the fundamental accuracy of the wage
statements provided and overtime pay correctly calculated. (Motion at pp.
16–17.) Plaintiff also notes that this court would possess discretion to reduce
an overall penalty amount, even if violations were found. (Motion at pp.
17–18.)
In light of the above, the
overall settlement amount furthers the purposes of PAGA. The settlement is
reasonable in light of the strength and complexity of Plaintiff’s claims, and
the risks posed by litigation. Plaintiff’s request for fees, representing one
third of the gross settlement amount, is reasonable in light of the lodestar analysis
presented by Plaintiff’s counsel. The calculation of attorney fees from a
percentage of a common fund created by a settlement agreement is a permissible
mode of fee calculation. (See Laffitte v. Robert Half Internat. Inc.
(2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 503.) Courts may evaluate the reasonableness of any
percentage-based attorney fee award through a “cross-check” with a lodestar
calculation, as Plaintiff presents here. (See
Laffitte v. Robert Half Internat. Inc. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 505.)
The
motion is therefore GRANTED.
