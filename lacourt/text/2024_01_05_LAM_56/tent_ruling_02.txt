BACKGROUND
            This action was initiated on July
31, 2023 and arises out of an employment relationship.  The currently operative first amended
complaint (the “FAC”), filed on August 21, 2023, alleges: (1) whistleblower
retaliation in violation of Labor Code section 1102.5; (2) age, sex, and gender
discrimination in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”);
(3) sexual harassment in violation of FEHA; and (4) retaliation in violation of
FEHA.
In
relevant part, the FAC alleges: In 2011, Plaintiff was hired as a set
photographer for the television program Real Time With Bill Maher (“RT”).  (FAC ¶ 16.) 
Moving Defendants’ work environment became hostile toward Plaintiff in
2013.  (FAC ¶ 20.)  In November 2013, Alex Brooks (“Brooks”) was
improperly admitted to a private wrap party for RT staff, where he made improper
advances toward Plaintiff and made Plaintiff feel uncomfortable.  (See FAC ¶ 21.)[1]  One night in February 2014, Brooks sexually
assaulted Plaintiff while she was finishing her work.  (See FAC ¶¶ 23-25.)  Plaintiff informed her employers of this
conduct and was assigned security.  (See
FAC ¶¶ 27-28.)  On February 21, 2014,
Brooks evaded security precautions and again approached Plaintiff on set before
being escorted off the premises.  (See
FAC ¶ 29.) 
 
After
this incident, two of Brooks’s fellow union members began mistreating
Plaintiff.  (See FAC
¶ 32.)  Kyle Beebe (“Beebe”) would
disparage Plaintiff for complaining about Brooks and invade her personal space
in order to intimidate her.  (Id.)  A boom operator swung a camera towards
Plaintiff’s head in an attempt to hit her. 
(Id.)  
 
In
March 2019, Brooks again bypassed on-set security to approach and intimidate
Plaintiff.  (See Complaint
¶¶ 33-36.)  After the March 2019
incident and the increased security measures that were implemented, Plaintiff’s
supervisors seemed displeased with her and appeared to place the blame on
Plaintiff.  (See FAC
¶ 37.)  Brooks did not appear on set
again, but his friend Beebe would sometimes confront Plaintiff in order to make
her feel unsafe.  (FAC ¶ 41.)  
When
lockdowns were instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Moving
Defendants paid all RT employees except for Plaintiff.  (FAC ¶ 47.) 
Plaintiff was terminated on July 15, 2020.  (FAC ¶ 48.) 
Plaintiff filed an administrative complaint with the Department of Fair
Employment and Housing on August 3, 2022. 
(FAC ¶ 3, Exhibit 1.)  
 
Moving
Defendants filed a demurrer (the “Demurrer”) to the third cause of action on
the grounds that the FAC fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause
of action.
 
DISCUSSION
Meet and
Confer
The meet and confer
requirement has been met.
 
Legal
Standard
A demurrer tests the
sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law. 
(Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)  The court
accepts as true all material factual allegations and affords them a liberal
construction, but it does not consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions,
speculation, or allegations contrary to law or judicially noticed facts.  (Shea
Homes Limited Partnership v. County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246,
1254.)  With respect to a demurrer, the
complaint must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the
facts pleaded.  (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 517.)  A demurrer will be sustained without leave to
amend if there exists no reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  
 
Third Cause of
Action: Harassment 
Employers may not harass an employee
because of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry,
physical¿disability, mental¿disability, medical condition, genetic information,
marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual
orientation, or military and veteran status. 
(Gov. Code § 12940,¿subd. (j)(1).) 
The elements of a cause of action for harassment under FEHA are: (1) the
plaintiff belongs to a protected group; (2) the plaintiff was subjected to
harassment; (3) the harassment complained of was based on the plaintiff’s
membership in the protected group; (4) the harassment complained of was
sufficiently pervasive so as to alter the conditions of employment and create
an abusive working environment; and (5)¿respondeat¿superior.  (Jones v. Department of Corrections &
Rehabilitation¿(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1367, 1377.)  The court looks to the totality of the
circumstances to determine that a hostile work environment existed.  (Etter
v. Veriflo Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 457, 466.) A court looks at: (1) the
frequency of harassment; (2) the severity of harassment; (3) whether the
conduct was threatening, humiliating, or merely an offensive utterance; and (4)
did the harassment interfere with a plaintiff’s work performance.  (Id.)  
 
Whether the conduct complained of is
sufficiently pervasive must be determined “from the totality of the
circumstances.” ¿(Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital¿(1989) 214
Cal.App.3d 590, 609.)  The plaintiff must
prove that the defendant’s conduct would have interfered with a reasonable
employee's work performance and would have seriously affected the psychological
well-being of a reasonable employee and that she was actually offended.  (Id.¿at 609-10.)¿ Harassment
typically does not include conduct necessary for management of the employer’s
business or performance of the supervisory employee’s job.  (Reno v. Baird¿(1998) 18 Cal.4th 640,
647.)  Rather, harassment consists of
conduct outside the scope of necessary job performance, conduct presumably
engaged in for personal gratification for meanness or bigotry, or for other
personal motives.  (Id.)¿  Some¿official employment actions done in
furtherance of a supervisor’s managerial role, however, can also have a
secondary effect of communicating a hostile message.  (Roby v. McKesson (2009) 47 Cal.4th
686, 709.)  This occurs when the actions
establish a widespread pattern of bias. 
(Id.)  Accordingly,
commonly necessary personnel management actions can support a¿harassment action
if the evidence of biased personnel management actions is relevant to prove the
communication of a hostile message.  (See
id.)  
 
A plaintiff asserting a cause of
action arising under the FEHA must first file a timely complaint with the DFEH
and obtain the agency’s permission to file a civil action in court.  (Brown v. City of Sacramento (2019) 37
Cal.App.5th 587, 598.)  As of January 1,
2020, the period to file an administrative charge is three years.  (A.B. 9, 2019 Cal Stats. Ch. 709, Sec. 3; Pollock
v. Tri-Modal Distribution Servs., Inc. (2021) 11 Cal. 5th 918, 931.)  The three-year limitations period does not
apply to claims that lapsed under the previous one-year limitations
period.  (See A.B. 9, 2019 Cal
Stats. Ch. 709, Sec. 3.)  
 
It is the plaintiff's burden to plead
and prove the timely filing of the DFEH complaint.  (Kim v. Konad USA Distribution,
Inc. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1336, 1345-46.)  Therefore, when the defendant has asserted
the statute of limitation defense, the plaintiff has the burden of proof to
show his or her claims are timely under the continuing violation doctrine.  (Jumaane v. City of Los Angeles
(2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 1390, 1402.) 
The continuing violation doctrine requires proof that the conduct
occurring outside the limitations period was (1) similar or related to the
conduct that occurred within the limitations period; (2) the conduct was
reasonably frequent; and (3) the conduct had not yet become permanent.  (Id.)
 
The harassment claim alleged in the
FAC is rooted in Brooks’s alleged misconduct that occurred in 2014 and
allegedly retaliatory hostilities that Plaintiff experienced thereafter.  As alleged, the FAC does not clearly allege facts
that show that the conduct that occurred in 2014 and the conduct that later
occurred in 2019 constitute a continuing violation.  Furthermore, the Court notes that facts
describing mistreatment Plaintiff experienced after the 2014 assault by Brooks
do not include details that link this treatment to her membership in a
protected group.  Rather, the FAC alleges
that Plaintiff was mistreated as a consequence of her complaining about the
attack and the additional security measures that were implemented on set.  (See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 32, 37.)
 
The Court finds that the FAC fails to
state a viable harassment claim and therefore SUSTAINS the Demurrer to the
third cause of action with 20 days leave to amend.  Should Plaintiff file an amended pleading
that is successfully challenged by demurrer, the Court will consider denying
Plaintiff further leave to amend.
