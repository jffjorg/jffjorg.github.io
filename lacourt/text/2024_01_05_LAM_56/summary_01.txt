And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has considered the opposition papers filed by the parties in six cases involving abuse claims against the Los Angeles Unified School District. After reviewing the cases, the Court has deemed them unrelated, despite involving the same defendant, as the individual claims raised by each plaintiff involve distinct facts and would not benefit from being related. The Court relies on California Rules of Court, rule 3.300, which defines related cases, and determines that relating these cases would not be in the interest of judicial efficiency or economy. The parties are ordered to appear at a hearing on January 5, 2024, to show cause why the cases should not be related.
