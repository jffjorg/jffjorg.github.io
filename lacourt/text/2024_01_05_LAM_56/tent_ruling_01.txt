  CASE NO.:  22STCV10943
 
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE RE: UNRELATING
  RELATED CASES 
 
Date: 
  January 5, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
Judge: Holly J. Fujie
 



 
The
Court has considered the opposition papers filed by the parties in: (1) E.J.
v. Los Angeles Unified School District, Case No. 22STCV10943; (2) M.M.
v. Los Angeles Unified School District, Case No. 23STCV11578; (3) O.B.
v. Los Angeles Unified School District, Case No. 22STCV11052; (4) A.H.
v. Los Angeles Unified School District, Case No. 23STCV11711; (5) G.B.
v. Los Angeles Unified School District, Case No. 23STCV09475; and (6) R.J.
v. Los Angeles Unified School District, Case No. 22STCV11004.
 
Under California Rules of
Court (“CRC”), rule 3.300, a pending civil case is related to another pending
civil case, or to a civil case that was dismissed with or without prejudice, or
to a civil case that was disposed of by judgment, if they: (1) involve the same parties
and are based on the same or similar claims; (2) arise from the same or
substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the
determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact;
(3) involve claims against, title to, possession of, or damages to the same
property; or (4) are likely for other reasons to require substantial
duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges.  (CRC, r. 3.300(a)(1)-(4).)  
 
            Although
these cases involve abuse claims alleged against the same Defendant, the
individual claims raised by each Plaintiff involve distinct facts such that the
Court finds that relating the cases would not be in the interest of judicial
efficiency or economy.  The Court
therefore deems these cases unrelated.
