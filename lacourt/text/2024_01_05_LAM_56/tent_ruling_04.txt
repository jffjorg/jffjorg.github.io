AND RELATED
CROSS-ACTION
 
MOVING
PARTY: Cross-Complainants Michael Schwab and Big Sky Venture Capital III, LLC
(collectively, “Moving Cross-Complainants”) 
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition papers were filed. 
Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at
least five court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
This
action arises out of a business relationship. 
On May 4, 2023, a judgment (the “Judgment”) was entered in Moving
Cross-Complainants’ favor against Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Nicholas Behunin
(“Behunin”).  
 
 
 
On
November 17, 2023, Moving Cross-Complainants filed a motion to compel responses
to the post-judgment Requests for Production and Interrogatories that they
served on Behunin (the “Motion”).  
 
DISCUSSION

            A judgment creditor may propound written interrogatories
and requests for documents to the judgment debtor, which are enforceable in the
same manner as interrogatories in a civil action.  (See CCP § 708.020, subds. (a), (c);
CCP § 708.030, subds. (a), (c).)
 
            Under
CCP section 2030.290, subdivision (b), when a party directs interrogatories
towards a party and that party fails to serve a timely response, the party
propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to
the interrogatories.  (CCP § 2030.290, subd. (b).)  The moving party
need only show that the interrogatories were served on the opposing party, the
time has expired to respond to the interrogatories and no responses have been
served in order for the court to compel the opposing party to
respond.  (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902,
906.)  
 
Where there has been no timely response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing or sampling, the demanding party may seek an order
compelling a response.  (CCP § 2031.300, subd.
(b).)  Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including
privilege and work product.  (CCP § 2031.300, subd. (a).)  
 
 
            The discovery requests at issue were
served on July 10, 2023.  (Declaration of
Nancy Chung (“Chung Decl.”) ¶¶ 2-3, Exhibits A-D.)  As of the filing of the Motion, Behunin had
not provided any responses.  (Chung Decl.
¶ 4.)
 
As it is unopposed, the Court GRANTS the
Motion.  (Sexton v.
Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  Behunin is ordered to provide
responses to the discovery requests detailed in the Motion within 20 days of
the date of this order. 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice.         
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
 
          Dated this 5th day of January 2024
