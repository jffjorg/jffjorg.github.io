```

Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. The plaintiff's complaint alleges that the defendant is not the sole owner of the property and that the plaintiff has an interest in the property based on the community property presumption. However, the judge has determined that the plaintiff cannot maintain a quiet title action against the defendant, who is the owner of the legal title. Additionally, the judge has ruled that the plaintiff's declaratory relief claim is not justiciable and that the controversy is not present and live. The judge has also determined that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the full faith and credit principles and that the court lacks jurisdiction to modify an out-of-state judgment.
