And here is the English text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to compel responses to defendant Aiden Bohlouli's requests for production of documents, set two, is denied. The Judge also denies the request for monetary sanctions. The Judge notes that the motion does not sufficiently address the pertinent discovery issues and that the memorandum presented by the moving party does not adhere to the standards outlined in the California Rules of Court. The Judge finds that the motion is not meritorious and therefore denies it.
