**Hearing Date:** May 23, 2024

**Department:** O

**Case Name:** Estate of Jaklin Rasekhnia, et al. v. Philips North America, LLC, et al.

**Tentative Ruling:**

I. LEGAL STANDARD

* A defendant or cross-defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication "has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action... cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action." (Code Civ. Proc., ยง 437c, subd. (p)(2).)

II. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE

* The request for judicial notice of the website advertisement is DENIED because the court "may not take judicial notice of the truth of the contents of a website." (LG Chem, Ltd. v. Superior Court of San Diego County (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 348, 362, fn. 7.)

III. EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS

* The objection to the declaration of John Heaston III is OVERRULED. The court finds that the expert has laid sufficient foundation.
* The objection to the declaration of Michael Sheahan is SUSTAINED as to paragraphs 4, 5, and 7 for lack of foundation. The court also sustains the objection as to paragraph 6 because it is irrelevant.

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Whether Defendants are Immune from the First Cause of Action for Strict Products Liability

* The court finds that defendants have met their burden of showing that their predominant role in their interactions with the decedent was to provide a professional service, specifically, respiratory therapy through the Ventilator.

B. Whether Plaintiffs' Negligence Claims are Barred by the Applicable Statute of Limitations

* The court grants summary adjudication of the first cause of action for strict products liability.
* The court grants summary adjudication of the second cause of action for negligence (failure to warn) and the third cause
