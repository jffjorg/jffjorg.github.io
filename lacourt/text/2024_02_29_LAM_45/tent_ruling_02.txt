Legal
Standard
The court may
order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after
judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney and
after notice from one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(2).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)  
An application
to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice
of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052
(Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed
Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e)). The proposed order must specify
all hearing dates scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the date of
trial, if known. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).)  
Further, the
requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties who have
appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may
delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service
of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) A motion to withdraw will not be granted
where withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) 
 
Discussion
            Attorney
Polina L. Ross of Ross Legal Corporation declares an irreparable breakdown in
the attorney-client relationship has occurred due to Defendant Australis
Capital, Inc. breaching a material term of agreement with attorney regarding
representation. Furthermore, Ross declares Defendant Australis Capital, Inc.’s
conduct has made it unreasonably difficult to carry out representation.
Moreover, Ross avers continued representation would likely result in violation
of California Rules of Professional Conduct or the State Bar Act. As such, Ross
avers she can no longer represent Defendant Australis Capital, Inc. 
            Ross
has stated a valid basis to be relieved as counsel. Furthermore, the MC-053
Form indicates the following hearing dates are scheduled in this action: (1) Defendant
Australis Capital, Inc.’s Demurrer to Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint and
Trial setting Conference set for March 13, 2024; (2) Plaintiffs’ Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Request for Admissions, Set One set for March 15,
2024; (3)  Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One set for March 22, 2024;
and (4) Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Further Responses to Demand for Production
of Documents, Set One set for March 22, 2024. Additionally, the MC-051 Form
indicates this present motion was served on all parties that have appeared in
this case. Lastly, Ross avers that Defendant Australis Capital, Inc. was served
with this instant motion via mail at its last known address, confirmed within
the past 30 days as current by conversation with Defendant Australis Capital,
Inc. and reviewing the State of Nevada, Secretary of State website. 
            Therefore,
the motion to be relieved as counsel is GRANTED. 
 
            It
is so ordered.
