The Court has considered the motion filed by Defense Counsel Polina L. Ross to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Australis Capital, Inc. The motion is granted. The Court finds that Ross has stated a valid basis for relief, including an irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship due to Defendant's breach of a material term of agreement. The Court also finds that continued representation would likely result in a violation of California Rules of Professional Conduct or the State Bar Act. The Court has reviewed the required forms and finds that they have been properly served on all parties. The motion is granted, and Ross is relieved as counsel for Defendant Australis Capital, Inc.
