And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motions to compel depositions of Sharishi Kobayashi and TDI Properties, Inc.'s Person Most Knowledgeable, and has granted both motions. The court finds that the defendant failed to respond to the notice of deposition and did not provide alternative dates, despite multiple attempts by the plaintiffs to resolve the issue informally. The court orders the defendant to pay sanctions of $1,660 for the Kobayashi motion and $1,640 for the TDI Properties, Inc.'s PMK motion. The court also orders the defendant to pay court reporter fees and attorney's fees in connection with the motions. The court notes that the defendant's failure to cooperate in discovery has caused delay and expense, and that the plaintiffs are entitled to reasonable compensation for their efforts.
