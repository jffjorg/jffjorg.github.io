And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies Plaintiff Maureen Martinez's motion to quash a deposition subpoena for production of business records from Sotheby's International Realty, or in the alternative, to limit the subpoenas with a protective order. The judge finds that the Plaintiff does not meet the burden of showing legally protected privacy interests, an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy, and a threatened intrusion that is serious. The judge also finds that the real estate listings and commissions earned by the Plaintiff are publicly disseminated and do not represent meaningful information about Sotheby's financial condition. The judge exercises its discretion not to award sanctions against the Plaintiff, finding that the motion was not made in bad faith or without substantial justification.
