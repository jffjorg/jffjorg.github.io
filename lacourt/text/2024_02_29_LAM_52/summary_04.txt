And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to strike portions of the first amended complaint filed by the defendants, Baldwin Apartment LLC and Fachoy LLC dba Management Rental Group. The defendants had moved to strike allegations related to punitive damages, arguing that the facts alleged did not rise to the level of malice, oppression, or fraud necessary to recover punitive damages. However, the judge found that the plaintiffs had alleged sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages, including allegations of hazardous conditions on the premises, failure to correct conditions despite complaints, and despicable conduct with a willful and conscious disregard of the plaintiffs' rights or safety. The judge also found that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged which defendant did what, and that the allegations could reasonably be characterized as despicable conduct carried on with a willful and conscious disregard of the plaintiffs' rights or safety. The defendants are ordered to answer the first amended complaint within 20 days.
