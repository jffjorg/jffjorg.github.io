And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in the case 22STCV00603, which was filed by Alen Vartanian against the City of Glendale. The City of Glendale had filed a motion to dismiss the case, which the judge has denied. The judge ruled that the City of Glendale's motion to dismiss was not justified because the plaintiff, Alen Vartanian, had a valid claim for premises liability based on a dangerous condition of public property, which was not affected by the previous rulings on the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike. The judge also noted that the plaintiff had not filed an amended complaint despite being granted leave to do so, but the judge declined to exercise its discretion to dismiss the complaint because the plaintiff's claim for relief remained unadjudicated.
