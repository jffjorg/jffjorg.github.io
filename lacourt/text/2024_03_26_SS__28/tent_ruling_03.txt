 Case Number:  22STCV16894    Hearing Date:   March 26, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows.  
BACKGROUND 
On
May 23, 2022, Plaintiff Maria Sukie Marquez (“Marquez”) filed this action
against Defendants Milagro Gutierrez, Stephanie Gutierrez, and Roes 1-25 for
motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
October 9, 2023, Plaintiffs Marquez, April Magdaleno, and Noemi Magdaleno filed a first amended complaint
against Defendants Milagro Gutierrez, Stephanie Gutierrez, and Roes 1-25 for
motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
November 30, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. 
On
January 12, 2024, Marquez filed expedited petitions to approve the compromises
of the claims of minors April Magdelano [sic] and Noemi Magdelano [sic].  On February 13, 2024, the Court issued a
ruling identifying problems with the petitions and continued the hearing to
March 26, 2024. 
On
March 22, 2024, Maria Parquez [sic] filed a petition for expedited
approval of Noemi Magdaleno’s claims. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUESTS 
Petitioner
Maria Marquez asks the Court to approve the compromise of Noemi Magdaleno’s claims. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“‘[W]ithout
trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the
settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on
the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior
Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
To
obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner
must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and
must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
DISCUSSION      
          The petition contains the following information about the
proposed settlement: 
Gross
settlement amount: $6,800.00 Medical
expenses: $3,225.00 Negotiated,
contractual, and statutory reductions: $1,515.00 (should be $1,710.00 – see below) Amount
to be paid or reimbursed from proceeds: $1,515.00 Attorney’s
fees: $1,700.00 Balance
of proceeds: $3,585.00 
Section
13a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $3,225.00.  Section 13a(3) of the petition states that
this amount was reduced by $1,515.00 as the result of negotiated, contractual,
and statutory reductions.  The remaining
amount of medical expenses, $1,710.00, is the amount that should be paid or reimbursed
from the settlement proceeds.  However, Section
13a(4) states that only $1,515.00 will be paid or reimbursed from the
settlement proceeds.  This leaves $195.00
in medical expenses unaccounted for. 
Based
on the attached medical bills and letters from medical providers agreeing to accept
reduced payment amounts, it appears that the total reduction amount in Section
13a(3) should be $1,710.00, not $1,515.00. 
Dr. Khalili billed $350.00 but agreed to accept $125.00, for a $225.00
reduction.  Dr. Razipour billed what
appears to be $2,875.00 but agreed to accept $1,390.00, for a $1,485 reduction.  $225.00 plus $1,485.00 is $1,710.00. 
Using
these figures, the petition shows that all medical expenses ($3,225.00) that
have not been reduced or waived (by $1,710.00) will be reimbursed from the
settlement proceeds ($1,515.00). 
Therefore, the Court grants the petition. 
At
Petitioner’s request, the Court orders that the net settlement proceeds of
$3,585.00 are to be deposited in insured accounts
in Logix Credit Union, 18700 Ventura Boulevard, Suite 110, Tarzana, CA 91356,
subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the Court. 
CONCLUSION 
Subject to the Court's discussion above, the
Court GRANTS the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor Noemi
Magdaleno’s action filed by Petitioner Maria Marquez on March 22, 2024. 
The
Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Distribution of Net Settlement on May 28,
2024, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
The
Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal of Case (Settlement) on May 28,
2024, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
