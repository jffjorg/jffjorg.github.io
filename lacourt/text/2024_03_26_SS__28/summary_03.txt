And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor Noemi Magdaleno's claims and has ruled as follows. The court grants the petition and orders that the net settlement proceeds of $3,585.00 be deposited in insured accounts in Logix Credit Union, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court. The court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Distribution of Net Settlement on May 28, 2024, and an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal of Case (Settlement) on May 28, 2024. The court notes that the petition contains inaccuracies regarding the negotiated, contractual, and statutory reductions, but ultimately approves the compromise.
