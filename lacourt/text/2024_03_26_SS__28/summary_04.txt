And here is the English text to summarize the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the moving, opposing, and reply papers in this case and rules as follows. The Plaintiff, Agustina Bizarro Garcia, filed a complaint against the City of Los Angeles, S.B. Community Homes, Inc. dba Kilgore Manor, and Does 1-25 for statutory liability/dangerous condition of public property and premises liability. The City and Kilgore filed answers, and Kilgore filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Kilgore and Roes 1-10 for indemnification, apportionment of fault, and declaratory relief. Kilgore filed a motion for summary judgment, which is to be heard on May 1, 2024. The Court has determined that due to its impacted calendar, the first available date for a hearing was May 1, 2024, which is less than 30 days before the scheduled trial. Kilgore has requested that the Court advance the hearing on the summary judgment motion to April 29, 2024, or continue the trial. The Court has denied the request to advance the hearing and granted Kilgore's motion to continue the trial to June 5, 2024, to ensure that the Court can hear Kilgore's timely filed summary judgment motion. The Court has continued the trial to June 5, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
