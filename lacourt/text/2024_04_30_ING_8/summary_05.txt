And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

In this tentative ruling, the court has considered the demurrer filed by the defendants, Eric Floyd and Wanda Dee, to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Youngkyu Lee, seeking to evict them from the property. The defendants argue that the plaintiff failed to follow the proper legal procedure to open an unlawful detainer case against them, specifically by failing to attach a valid proof of service on the notices served to them. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action and that the defendant's demurrer is without merit. The court thus rules to OVERRULE the demurrer and orders the plaintiff to give notice.
