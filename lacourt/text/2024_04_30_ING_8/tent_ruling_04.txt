Tentative Rulings:                  (1) Plaintiff’s Motion
to Deem Complaint filed on November 14, 2023 is GRANTED.  But the Court will need to hear oral argument
from Plaintiff’s counsel as to why a pleading rejected in November of 2023 did not
become the subject of a re-submitted Summons and Complaint until January 31,
2024, over two months later.  The Chesney
Declaration does not explain that substantial lapse of time, which troubles a Court
being asked to excuse a mistake by counsel, not a mistake by the clerk’s office.

I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
On January 31, 2024,
Plaintiff, Leidaly Diaz filed a Complaint against Defendants, Herman Wissker
Power, Inc., and DOES 1 through 50. The Complaint alleges causes of action for:
(1) Motor Vehicle Negligence; and (2) General Negligence.  The current Complaint was field more than two
years after the date of the subject motor vehicle collision, but a prior
version of the Complaint had been submitted for filign but was rejcted byt eh
Clerk’s office for non-compliance with the requirement in the statewide rules
of court for naming each defendant in the caption.  
 
After meet and confer between
counsel and the assertion by defendant of a likely statute of limitations
motion, Plaintiff now files a Motion to Deem the Complaint filed on November
14, 2023, which would be within the two-year statute.   
 
B. Procedural¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed this
Motion to Deem Complaint filed November 14, 2023. On April 16, 2024, Defendant
filed an opposition brief. On April 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply brief. 
 
¿II. ANALYSIS¿¿ 
 
A.    Legal Standard 
 
 The Court has the power to correct clerical mistakes
in its judgment or orders as entered to conform the judgment or order. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (d).)  Similarly, the Court has broad inherent
power to correct its records at any time so that they may truthfully reflect
what proceedings actually transpired. (Chester v. Chester (1946) 76
Cal.App.2d 265, 268-69.) In addition, amendments that merely correct clerical
errors are not barred by the statute of limitations. (See Ball v. Lowe
(1905) 1 Cal.App.228.) The Supreme Court in United Farm Workers of America
v. Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. (1985) 37 Cal.3d 912 stated that “it is
the filer's actions that are scrutinized in determining whether a petition was
timely filed. Rejection of the petition by the clerk…for a technical defect
cannot undo a ‘filing’ that has already occurred.” (Id. at p. 918.)
 
California Rule of Court 2.111 requires the complaint to
separately state the name of each defendant in the caption of the Complaint.  It states: “Below the title of the court, in
the space to the left of the center of the page, the title of the case. In the
title of the case on each initial complaint or cross-complaint, the name of
each party must commence on a separate line beginning at the left margin of the
page.”  (Id. subdiv. (3).)  “Compliance with these provisions is
important; the Law Revision Commission has stated that ‘the clerk is to rely on
the caption in determining how to classify a civil case that is brought in a
unified superior court.’”  (Stratton
v. Beck (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 483, 493.) 

 
Rule 2.119(a) requires the Clerk’s office to reject for
filing any papers that do not comply with the rules of court, including Rule
2.111.  Code of Civil Procedure section
422.40 requires the title of the action to include the names of all parties, as
contained in the caption of the Complaint. 
But Rule of Court 2.118(c) gives the Court discretion, for good cause
shown, to permit the filing of papers that do not comply with the Rules of
Court.  
 
B.    Discussion 
 
            The
moving papers assert that on November 13, 2023, Stephen L. Chesney, counsel for
Plaintiff, prepared the summons, complaint, civil cover sheet, and civil case cover
sheet addendum for filing. Plaintiff further notes that counsel also prepared
an additional parties form for the summons, and attachment 1 for the Complaint.
Plaintiff contends that the documents were scanned into the firm’s computer
system as a pdf by Mr. Chesney so that the documents could be filed with the
court through USA Express. Plaintiff’s counsel further notes that he instructed
his secretary to use the USA portal to submit the documents to the court, which
she did. Plaintiff asserts that the pdf was uploaded on November 14, 2023 at
3:01 pm. 
 
            However,
Plaintiff’s counsel asserts that unbeknownst to him or his secretary,
Attachment 1 to the Complaint (which listed Juan Jose Saldana, Jr. as an
additional defendant) was not part of the pdf. Further, Plaintiff also notes
that apparently there was a malfunction with the feeder for the scanner, so
that Attachment 1, though fed through the scanner, was not actually scanned.
Plaintiff notes that because of this, on November 20, 2023, at 3:40 pm, the
court rejected the documents, stating that the basis was that Attachment 1,
though referenced, was not part of the submitted documents.  Counsel for Plaintiff notes that he failed to
become aware of the rejection until “several weeks later.”  Because of this, Plaintiff’s counsel acknowledges
that this resulted in Plaintiff’s later-field lawsuit being subject to a
statute of limitations defense. As such, Plaintiff moves for an order deeming
the January 31, 2024-filed Complaint to be filed on November 14, 2023. 
            Defendant’s
opposition argues that this Court has no discretion to deem the complaint filed
on a date within the statute of limitations. This is incorrect.  Rule of Court 2.118(c), which is not mentioned
in the Opposition, states that “For good cause shown, the court may permit the
filing of papers that do not comply with the rules in this chapter.”  Further, Code of Civil Procedure section 128
gives the courts inherent authority to “amend and control its process and
orders so as to make them conform to law and justice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128,
subd. (a)(8).) A nunc pro tunc order is one such exercise of this inherent
authority: “A nunc pro tunc order is a retroactive entry by the court. It is
effective at the date which the court states it is to be effective, not at the
date it was made. It is an exercise of inherent power of the court for the
purpose of doing justice between the parties.” (Wexler v. Goldstein (1956)
146 Cal.App.2d 410, 412.) It is “generally limited to correcting clerical
errors[.]” (People v. Borja (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 481, 485.) 
            Here,
Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to file the complaint on November 14, 2023. The
Notice of Rejection of Electronic Filing confirms that the Superior Court
received the complaint on November 14, 2023 at 3:01 pm, but did not reject the
complaint until November 20, 2023 at 3:46 pm. (Declaration of Stephen L.
Chesney (“Chesney Decl.”), ¶ 5, Exhibit D.) Thus, the Complaint had been
attempted to be filed prior to the November 19, 2023 statute of limitations
deadline.  Plaintiff’s motion cites to Rojas
v. Cutsforth (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 774, 777 and Carlson v.
State Department of Fish & Game (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1268,
1279, where the appellate courts reversed dismissals of lawsuits that had been
timely filed but the papers were rejected by clerical staff for the failure to
comply with local rules of court.  The
Opposition distinguished these cases from the case at bar because, as defendant
argues, the Complaint here was rejected because of the application of a
statewide Rule of Court, not a local rule. 

But the Opposition
fails to address the good cause exception of Rule of Court 2.118(c).  Rule 2.118 was adopted effective January 1,
2007, after either of the Rojas or Carlson cases were decided.  But the substance of Rule 2.118(c)’s good
cause standard is foreshadowed in the earlier precedents.  For example, the Carlson court held
that “Where, as here, the defect, if any, is insubstantial, the clerk should
file the complaint and notify the attorney or party that the perceived defect
should be corrected at the earliest opportunity.”  (Carlson, supra, 68 Cal.App.4th at p. 1276.)  The Carlson court reversed the trial court’s
dismissal under the statute of limitations so that the later-filed suit could be
deemed to have been timely filed.  In Rojas,
the Second District reversed the dismissal of plaintiff’s untimely filed lawsuit
– which had been rejected for the insubstantial pleading defect of failing to
sign the declaration of courthouse assignment -- with instructions to deem the
complaint filed when it was first presented to the Clerk for filing. 
            In
the Court’s view here, the insubstantial defect of failing to include the name
of each party, because of a clerical mishap in scanning an attachment to an otherwise
timely submitted Complaint, fits the circumstances of Rojas and Carlson.  The circumstances presente here are, in the
Court’s discretion, the type of good cause contemplated by Rule 2.118(c) to consider
an untimely later-submitted complaint to be deemed to have been filed at the time
the original and timely-submitted complaint was presented to the Clerk for
filing.  However, for the Court to
exercise its discretion in plaintiff’s favor here, it needs more facts from
plaintiff’s counsel as to the unexplained two months of delay between the Clerk’s
notice of rejection and counsel’s belated filing of the later-submitted
complaint.  As with the exercise of the Court’s
discretion under Section 473, discretion under Rule 2.118(c) requires a showing
of reasonable diligence in seeking relief.
