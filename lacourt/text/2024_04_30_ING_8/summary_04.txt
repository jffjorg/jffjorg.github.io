And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to deem the complaint filed on November 14, 2023. However, the court needs more information from the plaintiff's counsel regarding the two-month delay between the rejection of the original complaint and the belated filing of the new complaint. The court is troubled by the substantial lapse of time and the lack of diligence in seeking relief. The court will need to hear oral argument from the plaintiff's counsel to determine whether the delay was reasonable.
