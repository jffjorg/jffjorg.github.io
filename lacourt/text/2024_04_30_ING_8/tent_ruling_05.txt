I. BACKGROUND¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿ 
¿¿ 
On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff, Youngkyu Lee
(“Plaintiff”) filed an Unlawful Detainer Complaint against Defendants, Eric
Floyd, Wanda Dee, and DOES 1 through 5. 
 
Defendants, Eric Floyd and Wanda Dee (collectively
“Defendants”) now file a Demurrer to the Complaint. 
 
B. Procedural¿¿  
 
            On
March 18, 2024, Defendants filed a Demurrer. To date, no opposition has been
filed.  But on April 18, 2024, demurring
defendant also filed an Answer, leading the Court to wonder if the demurrer may
have withdrawn or been taken off calendar. 

 
II. GROUNDS FOR MOTIONS
 
            Defendants demur to Plaintiff’s Complaint
on the grounds that they argue, Defendant’s Complaint is deficient to
constitute a cause of action, and failed to follow the proper legal procedure
to open an Unlawful Detainer case since Plaintiff allegedly failed to attach a
valid proof of service on the notices to quit allegedly served to the
Defendants. 
 
 
 
III. ANALYSIS 
 
A.   
Legal
Standard 
 
A demurrer can be used only to challenge
defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters
outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only
allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that
might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be
alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53
Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of
action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry
v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does
not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v.
Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A pleading is uncertain if it is
ambiguous or unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer
for uncertainty may lie if the failure to label the parties and claims renders
the complaint so confusing defendant cannot tell what he or she is supposed to
respond to.¿ (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d
135, 139, fn. 2.) However, “[a] demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed,
even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can
be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)

 
B.   
Discussion
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 1170, a defendant in an
unlawful detainer proceeding may answer or demur to a complaint. Section 1177,
provides that all provisions of law contained in Part 2 of the Code of Civil
Procedure are otherwise generally applicable to unlawful detainer actions,
unless other procedures are specified in the unlawful detainer statutes. (Id.) However, the
rule of liberal construction of pleadings provided by Code of Civil Procedure,
section 452, is inapplicable in unlawful detainer actions because an unlawful
detainer is an action seeking forfeiture and is a summary proceeding in which
the defendant’s normal procedural rights are limited. Thus, courts strictly
construe the statutory procedures that regulate unlawful detainers and require
strict compliance with all statutory requirements. (Civ. Code, § 1442; see
also Kwok, supra, 130 Cal.App.3d at 599; Briggs v. Electronic
Memories & Magnetic (1975) 53 Cal. App.3d 900, 905; Liebovich v.
Shahrokhkany (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 511, 513.) 
 
Here, Defendants argue that Plaintiff failed to follow the proper legal
procedure to open an Unlawful Detainer case against Defendant when he failed to
attach a valid proof of service on the notices served to the Defendants.  Defendants argue that Plaintiff attached invalid
proofs of service because they ae allegedly not dated, not named by the process
server, and not signed by the process server. However, in the copy of the Complaint
in the Court’s digital files, the declarations of service of the Notices to Quit
and Notice to Pay Rent or Quit are all dated and are all signed by purported process
server Joshua Chang. 
 
            While Plaintiff has failed to oppose
this motion, the court file in this case belies the asserted defect on the face
of the pleading.  Without more, this
Court is inclined to OVERRULE demurrer. 
 
IV. CONCLUSION¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
For the
foregoing reasons, Defendants’ Demurrer is OVERRULED.  The Court notes demurring defendant filed an
Answer on April 18, 2024.
 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice.
