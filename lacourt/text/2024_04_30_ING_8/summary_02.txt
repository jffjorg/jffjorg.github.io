And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on General Motors' demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint for fraudulent concealment. The court has sustained the demurrer, meaning that the plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to state a claim for fraudulent concealment. The court found that the plaintiff failed to allege a transactional relationship giving rise to a duty to disclose and that the plaintiff's allegations of fraud were conclusory and lacked specific facts. The court also found that the plaintiff's allegations of fraudulent concealment were insufficient to state a claim. The court has invited oral argument from the plaintiff's counsel on what specific allegations can be added to the complaint to address the deficiencies in the allegations of a fraudulent concealment cause of action in the Lemon law context.
