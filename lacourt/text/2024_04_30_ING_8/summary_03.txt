And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint is continued to enable the plaintiff to submit a supplemental declaration containing the missing information. The plaintiff seeks to add causes of action for general negligence, including common carrier liability and products liability, against the defendants. The court notes that the plaintiff has not entirely complied with the California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, and therefore requires the plaintiff to submit a supplemental declaration that includes the missing information. The court suggests that the hearing on the motion be continued to June 13, 2024.
