Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to set aside the default judgment entered against them. The default was caused by the attorney's mistake in calculating the deadline for filing a responsive pleading. The judge finds that the attorney's mistake was not excusable and did not result from any fault or negligence on the part of the defendants. As a result, the defendants are relieved from the default and are required to file their proposed answer or responsive pleading within 10 days. The plaintiff, who is representing herself pro per, is not entitled to recover any attorney's fees.
