ANALYSIS
Demurrer To Cross-Complaint
Meet and Confer
            Per the
Declaration of Nadia A. Zivkov, Cross-Defendants’ counsel satisfied the meet
and confer requirement set forth in Civ. Proc. Code, § 430.41.
Discussion
Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants
Northland THEA LLC, Northland THEA Portfolio LLC, Northland THEA Portfoilio II
LLC, Northland THEA Portfolio III LLC, and Northland THEA IV LLC demur to the
Cross-Complaint as follows:  
1.         Entire
Cross-Complaint.
            Cross-Defendants
argue that Cross-Complainant Moore has a default entered against him, and thus
his filing of a cross-complaint is improper and impermissible.
After the default was entered, defendant was
no longer an active party in the litigation and thus was not entitled to any
further notices. “The clerk's entry of default cuts off the defendant's
right to take further affirmative steps such as filing a pleading or
motion, and the defendant is not entitled to notices or service of pleadings or
papers.” (6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Proceedings Without Trial, §
152, p. 569, italics omitted; see also Code of Civil Proc., § 1010 [no “notice
or paper, other than amendments to the pleadings, or amended pleading, need be
served”].)
(Sporn v. Home Depot USA, Inc.
(2005)126 Cal.App.4th 1294, 1301 [bold emphasis added].)
            As such,
the hearing on the demurrer to the Cross-Complaint is CONTINUED to February 10,
2025 to be heard after the Court rules on Defendant Moore’s motion to set aside
entry of default. If that motion to set aside is granted, then the Court will
permit the Cross-Complaint to stand as filed and the Court will address the
demurrer on the merits.
