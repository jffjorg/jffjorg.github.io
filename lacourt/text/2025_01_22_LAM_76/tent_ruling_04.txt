ANALYSIS
Motion To Set Aside Default
Discussion
Defendants First Pointe Management
Group, LLC and Ezralow Company, LLC move to set aside the entry of default
against them. The basis for this motion is that attorney Shamtob miscalendared
the date in which a responsive pleading was due for Defendant First Pointe and Defendant Ezralow, and for
this reason, completely missed the deadline for filing a responsive pleading in
this matter. Defense Counsel represents Defendant First Pointe; Defendant
Ezralow; and Defendant Gordon Emerson 41, LLC., and with that, Defense Counsel
was under the belief all Defendants responsive pleadings were due on the same
date, December 2, 2024. (Declaration of Edrin Shamtob, ¶¶ 7 – 12.) This is
corroborated by the fact that Defendant 1440 Gordon Emerson and Gordon Emerson
41 filed demurrers on December 2, 2024.
 
Civ. Proc. Code, § 473(b) provides:
 
(b) The court may, upon any terms
as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application
for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading
proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted,
and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months,
after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. . . .
Notwithstanding any other requirements of this section, the court shall,
whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry
of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn
affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect,
vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her
client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting
default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the
court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the
attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The court shall,
whenever relief is granted based on an attorney’s affidavit of fault, direct
the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing
counsel or parties. However, this section shall not lengthen the time within
which an action shall be brought to trial pursuant to Section 583.310.
 
    
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b).)
 
On November 26, 2024, default
was entered against Defendants
First Pointe Management Group, LLC and The Ezralow Company, LLC.. This motion to set aside default was served
and filed on December 18, 2024, within the time limit set forth in § 473(b).
 
            “Section
473(b) also contains a ‘mandatory’ or ‘attorney affidavit’ provision,” which
relieves a party “if a default judgment or dismissal is the result of its
attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, without regard to whether the neglect is excusable. [Citation.]”
(Henderson, supra, at p. 225.)”  (Jackson v. Doe (2011) 192 Cal. App. 4th 742, 755 [bold
emphasis added].)
 
Subsequent amendments to section 473 were
apparently in response to Billings. The 1991 version, effective January 1,
1992, extended the attorney  [*292]  affidavit of fault procedure to
entry of the clerk's default. It also eliminated
the timeliness/diligence requirement with reference to an attorney affidavit,
and required only that the motion be filed within six months after entry of
judgment. (Citation omitted.) 
 
(Douglas
v. Willis (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 287, 291-92 (bold emphasis added).)
 
The clause in section 473, subdivision (b)
which mandates the court to grant relief unless it finds that the default was
not in fact caused by lawyer error is not only a credibility testing device. It
is also "a causation testing device." ( Cisneros v. Vueve (1995) 37
Cal. App. 4th 906, 912 [44 Cal. Rptr. 2d 682].) The Cisneros court affirmed a
trial court order denying section 473 relief because the lawyer was not
representing the clients when their defaults were entered and therefore was not
the proximate cause of their entry. (37 Cal. App. 4th 912.) A trial court's
finding on the causation issue will be affirmed so long as it is supported
by substantial evidence. ( Johnson v. Pratt & Whitney Canada, Inc., supra,
28 Cal. App. 4th at pp. 622-623.) If the evidence gives rise to conflicting
inferences, one of which supports the trial court's findings, we must affirm.
(Ibid.) 
 
(Milton
v. Perceptual Dev. Corp. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 861, 867)
 
Here, the Court finds that the
entry of default against Defendants First Pointe Management Group, LLC and Ezralow Company,
LLC was caused by their attorney’s mistake and inadvertence. As such, relief
from default is mandatory. Plaintiff’s arguments that the mistake is
inexcusable and the attorney’s conduct is unethical is irrelevant per the
authorities cited above. 
The motion to set
aside default is GRANTED. Defendants are to file their proposed answer or
responsive pleading within 10 days, since Defendants have had ample opportunity
to prepare such response and should have presented such with this motion. Because
Plaintiff is representing herself, she is not entitled to recover any
attorney’s fees.
