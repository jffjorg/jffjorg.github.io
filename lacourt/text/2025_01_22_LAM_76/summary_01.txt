As for the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is issued by the Court to address the demurrer to the Cross-Complaint filed by Defendant Moore. The Court has reviewed the meet and confer requirement and finds that it has been satisfied by Cross-Defendants' counsel. The demurrer argues that Cross-Complainant Moore's filing of a cross-complaint is improper and impermissible since he has a default entered against him. The Court agrees and continues the hearing on the demurrer to February 10, 2025, pending the Court's ruling on Defendant Moore's motion to set aside the entry of default. If the motion is granted, the Court will permit the Cross-Complaint to stand as filed and address the demurrer on the merits.
