And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Plaintiff, Barrington Plaza Tenant Association, has filed an unopposed motion to transfer the action to the Santa Monica Courthouse. The Court has considered the parties' stipulation and finds that the transfer is warranted under LASC Local Rule 2.3(b)(2) due to the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice. The Plaintiff's complaint alleges that the Defendant, Douglas Emmett, Inc., served eviction notices to all tenants at Barrington Plaza Apartments without sufficient cause and made contradictory representations to local and federal authorities. The Court has previously denied the Plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction. The tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to transfer the action to the Santa Monica Courthouse, where the unlawful detainer actions involving the property will be filed.
