## English Text Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to transfer the venue of this car accident case from the Inglewood Courthouse to the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. 

While Plaintiff and Defendant agree the case should be moved, the Judge ruled that they have not provided enough evidence to show the collision occurred in the correct area to justify transferring it to the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. 

The Judge pointed out that the parties used an incorrect zip code and their description of the location as "near" Manchester Avenue is not specific enough. Since the location relative to Manchester Avenue is crucial for determining the proper venue, the Judge has continued the hearing until the parties provide a supplemental declaration clarifying the exact location of the collision.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is continuing the joint motion to transfer the action to the Stanley Mosk Courthouse to October 26, 2023. The parties have agreed that the motor vehicle collision occurred on the 110 Highway near Manchester Avenue, but they have not adequately demonstrated that the collision occurred north of Manchester Avenue. The judge has taken judicial notice of various geographical facts, including that the city of Inglewood and the community of Morningside Park are within zip code 90305, and that Manchester Avenue intersects the 110 Freeway within zip code 90003. The judge finds that the parties' use of an incorrect zip code and their description of the accident as occurring on the northbound 110 Freeway "near" Manchester Avenue is insufficient to demonstrate that the Stanley Mosk Courthouse is the proper courthouse. The judge is requiring the parties to submit a supplemental declaration which more specifically identifies the location of the collision and whether it occurred north or south of Manchester Avenue.

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Cherrida Abram vs Hector Moreno, in which the parties have jointly moved to transfer the case to the Stanley Mosk Courthouse in the Central District.

The judge has also taken judicial notice that Manchester Avenue intersects the 110 Freeway within zip code 90003. As a result, the judge is requiring the parties to submit a supplemental declaration that more specifically identifies the location of the collision and whether it occurred north or south of Manchester Avenue. The motion to transfer the case is continued to October 26, 2023, and the parties must submit their supplemental declarations by October 16, 2023.

English text:
This tentative ruling is about case number 23TRCV00031 between Cherida Abram and Hector Moreno. The ruling is for a Joint Motion to Transfer Venue that is continued to October 26, 2023. The parties may submit a supplemental declaration that identifies the location of the collision and whether it occurred north or south of Manchester Avenue. The collision is said to have occurred on the 110 Freeway near Manchester Avenue. However, the parties used an incorrect zip code for the stated location of the collision, which is 90305. This zip code belongs to Inglewood and Morningside Park, not Los Angeles, and the 110 Freeway does not pass through this area. The correct zip code appears to be 90003. If the collision occurred on the 110 Freeway near Manchester Avenue, then the Stanley Mosk Courthouse is the appropriate filing location for incidents occurring North of Manchester, and the Compton Courthouse in the South Central District is the appropriate filing location for incidents occurring South of Manchester. The parties did not adequately demonstrate the location of the collision, and the court took judicial notice of various geographical facts on its own motion. The court will provide the parties with an opportunity to submit a supplemental declaration that more specifically identifies the location of the collision and whether it occurred north or south of Manchester Avenue.
