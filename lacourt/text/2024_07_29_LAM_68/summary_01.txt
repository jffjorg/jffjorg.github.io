And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling sets an Order to Show Cause (OSC) for August 16, 2024, to consider appointing a discovery referee to hear and determine discovery motions and disputes in the case. The court has been dealing with multiple motions to compel further responses and ongoing disputes, which have impacted the trial date of November 12, 2024. The court favors robust discovery, but also wants to avoid further delays and has decided to set a referee to handle the discovery disputes. The parties are invited to stipulate in advance of the hearing, and if they refuse, they must submit opposition to the appointment no later than August 5, 2024. The four motions to compel further responses are placed off-calendar pending the OSC and will be either presented before the referee or reset on the court calendar.
