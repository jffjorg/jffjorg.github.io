And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion to Enter Judgment Pursuant to Written Settlement Agreement and for Monetary Sanctions. The Motion is granted, and monetary sanctions are awarded in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant in the amount of $991.65. The Court finds that the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement agreement, and the Plaintiff is entitled to judgment in accordance with the agreement. The Plaintiff had also requested $2,116.65 in monetary sanctions, but the Court awards only $991.65, as the Plaintiff's counsel spent an excessive amount of time on irrelevant matters. The Court suggests that the Plaintiff's counsel shorten their briefs and avoid including irrelevant information. The Plaintiff is to prepare judgment, and the Defendant has not opposed the Motion.
