DROGON ALASKA,
 
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
HIGH TIMES PRODUCTIONS, INC., et al.
 
                        Defendants.


 
  Case No.: 23STCV05758
 
  Hearing Date:  April 26, 2024
 
 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion to be relieved as counsel
 



 
On March 15, 2024, Kapin PLLC filed the
instant motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant High Times Production. 
Counsel filed forms MC051 and MC-052 and
lodged with the Court a copy of the proposed order on form MC-053 pursuant to
CRC Rule 3.1362.  
The MC-052 form states that Counsel served
Defendant via mail at client’s last known mailing address, which Counsel states
they have confirmed as current within 30 days of the motion by mail with return
receipt requested.  
Counsel moves to be relieved based on irreconcilable
differences.
The proposed order on form MC-053 indicates
that trial is not yet set in this action, and the next hearing is on June 5,
2024, which is a trial setting conference.
The Court is inclined to grant the request
to be relieved as counsel. However, the Court notes that while a corporation
has the capacity to bring a lawsuit because it has all the powers of a natural
person in carrying out its business, under a long-standing common law rule of
procedure, a corporation, unlike a natural person, cannot represent itself before
courts of record in propria persona, nor can it represent itself through a
corporate officer, director or other employee who is not an attorney. (CLD Const., Inc. v. City of San Ramon
(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145.) “[A Corporation] must be represented by
licensed counsel in proceedings before courts of record. (Id.; Gutierrez v. G & M
Oil Co., Inc. (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 551, 564; Thomas G. Ferruzzo, Inc. v. Superior Court (1980) 104 Cal.App.3d
501, 503.) However, “[a]n attorney may be allowed to withdraw without offending
the rule against corporate self-representation.” (Thomas G. Ferruzzo, Inc., supra, 104 Cal.App.3d at 504.)
The Court will grant the motion and will
require that High Times Productions, Inc. timely retain new counsel and file a
substitution of counsel within 20 days of service of the signed order (MC-053).
The Court hereby sets an OSC regarding status of High Times Productions, Inc.’s
legal representation on May 20, 2024, at 8:30 am in Department 26.  
Counsel is ordered to serve copies of the
instant order and the signed form MC-053 order on all parties, including Defendant
High Times Productions, Inc., and file proof of service of such within 5 days.
Counsel is not relieved as counsel until proof of service is received by the
court.
