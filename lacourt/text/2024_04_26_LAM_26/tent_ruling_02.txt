 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION 
 



 
Background
On July 13, 2023, Fuel Break, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed its Complaint
against Ozopac Inc. dba V-Red West Covina (“Ozopac”), Elena Nikolayevna
Koroteeva (“Koroteeva”), and Does 1 through 20, inclusive (collectively
“Defendants”), asserting five causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract; (2)
Breach of Guaranty; (3) Conversion; (4) Restitution Based on Unjust Enrichment;
and (5) Money Had and Received. 
 
On
September 13, 2023, the Court entered default against Koroteeva. 
 
On February 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication. 
 
On February 23, 2024, the Court granted the motions to be relieved as
counsel filed by Thomas P Bleau as to Ozopac and Koroteeva. 
 
On
April 3, 2024, Ozopac failed to appear at the OSC and also failed to substitute
new counsel to represent it. The Court struck Ozopac’s Answer and entered
default against Ozopac.
 
No opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication has been filed as of April 23, 2024. 
 
Allegations
On
about January 5, 2023, Plaintiff and Ozopac entered into a written Retail
Product Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) pursuant to which Plaintiff
agreed to sell unbranded gasoline to Ozopac for Ozopac to dispense at its motor
fuel dispensing station or automotive service station located at 709 North
Sunset Avenues, West Covina, California 91790. (Complaint ¶ 6.) 
 
Pursuant
to the Sales Agreement, among other things, Plaintiff delivered gasoline to Defendants,
for which gasoline Defendants were required to pay Plaintiff. Beginning on
about March 30, 2023, and continuing through about April 11, 2023, Plaintiff
delivered gasoline to Defendants, for which gasoline Defendants paid Plaintiff
only a portion of the amounts due and payable to Plaintiff. (Id. at ¶ 7.) As
of April 15, 2023, the amount due, owing, and payable to Plaintiff from
Defendants for gasoline Plaintiff delivered to Defendants is $82,907.52, which
amount Defendants failed and refused to pay Plaintiff. Despite Plaintiff’s
repeated demands to Defendants for payment of this amount, Defendants have
continued to fail and refuse to pay Plaintiff the whole or any part of this
$82,902.57. (Id. at ¶ 8.)
 
Pursuant
to the Sales Agreement, all overdue sums owed to Plaintiff bear interest at the
rate of fifteen percent (15%) per annum, or at the maximum legal rate, from the
date payment is due until paid. As stated, the amount due to Plaintiff and
unpaid as of April 15, 2023 was $82,902.57, on which amount interest accrues in
the daily amount of $34.07 ($82,902.57 multiplied by 15% = $12,435.39 divided
by 365 days = $34.07). As of the date of this Complaint (July 13, 2023),
prejudgment interest in the amount of $3,066.30 ($34.07 multiplied by 90 days =
$3,066.30) has accrued on the overdue principal sum owed to Plaintiff and
continues to accrue each day the overdue principal sum is unpaid in the daily
amount of $34.07. (Id. at ¶ 9.) 
 
Despite
repeated demands, Defendants have failed and refused, and continue to fail and
refuse to pay all or any portion of the $85,968.87 to Plaintiff. (Id. at ¶ 10.)
 
The
Sales Agreement also provides, in pertinent part, that the prevailing party is
entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party all reasonable attorney fees
and other legal costs incurred to secure, defend or protect the rights inuring
to the prevailing party under the Agreement, or to enforce its terms. (Id. at ¶ 11.)
Plaintiff has incurred and will continue to incur attorney fees and other legal
costs to enforce the terms of the Sales Agreement, including without limitation
the attorney fees and costs incurred to commence and prosecute this action. (Id. at ¶ 12.) 
Legal Standard 
 
“The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts
with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine
whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their
dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal. 4th 826,
843.) “A party may move for summary judgment in an action or proceeding if it
is contended that the action has no merit or that there is no defense to the
action or proceeding.” (Code of Civil Procedure section 473c subd. (a)(1).)
“The motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted
show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving
party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” (Code of Civil Procedures
section 473c subd. (c).)
¿           Where
the plaintiff has also moved for summary judgment that party has the burden of
showing there is no defense to a cause of action.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (a).) That burden can be met if the plaintiff “has proved each element of
the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on that cause of action.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) If the plaintiff meets this burden, it
is up to the defendant “to show that a triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.” (S.B.C.C.,
Inc. v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 383,
388.)
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff moves for summary judgment on the grounds that there is no
triable issue of any material fact that each Defendant has breached their
respective agreements with Plaintiff, that they owe approximately $98,102.77 to
Plaintiff, and that Plaintiff is entitled to judgment in that amount as a
matter of law. 
 
Alternatively, Plaintiff moves for summary adjudication on the grounds
that there is no triable issue of any material fact, and that Plaintiff is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law on each of the five causes of action
alleged in the Complaint. 
 
I.               
First Cause of Action (Breach of Contract) against Ozopac and Second Cause
of Action (Breach of Guaranty) against Koroteeva.
 
“[T]he elements of a cause of action for breach of contract are
(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the
plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811,
821.)
 
As to the first element—the existence of a
contract—Plaintiff sets forth in the separate statement that “[o]n about January 5,
2023, Fuel Break and [Ozopac]
entered into the Sales Agreement, pursuant to which Fuel Break agreed to sell
unbranded motor vehicle gasoline to [Ozopac] that [Ozopac] could sell and
dispense at its [Ozopac]
gas station in West Covina.” (Separate Statement, p. 2, UMF No 4.)
In UMF No. 4, Plaintiff incorporates by reference Exhibit B of the Declaration
of Fahed in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, which is purported to be a
true and correct copy of the Sales Agreement. The Sales Agreement is signed by Plaintiff
and Ozopac and states in relevant part:
 
THIS AGREEMENT is
between FUEL BREAK, INC. ("Seller"), whose address is 2501 E. Chapman
Ave Suite 130 Fullerton CA 92831, and OZOPAC, INC. (collectively,
"Retailer"), whose address is 709 N. SUNSET AVE WEST COVINA CA 91790
("Retailer's Station" or "Premises"), and is effective 01
/05 I 2023 ("Effective Date"). As used herein, the terms Party or
Parties, shall refer to either Seller or Retailer individually or collectively.

 
This Agreement is
comprised of two parts. PART I sets forth the variable provisions of this
Agreement and references the applicable articles in PART II that sets forth the
general provisions. To the extent there is a conflict between PART I and PART
II, the provisions in PART I are controlling.

NOTE TO RETAILER:
THIS AGREEMENT CONSISTS OF PART I AND PART II. PART II OF THIS AGREEMENT IS
ATTACHED HERETO AND INCORPORATED HERE. DO NOT SIGN THIS AGREEMENT UNTIL YOU
HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE PROVISIONS OF PART I AND PART II. SIGNATURE
OF THIS AGREEMENT BY RETAILER CONSTITUTES A REPRESENTATION TO SELLER THAT
RETAILER HAS READ, UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES TO ALL PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
 
(Fahed Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. “B.”) Accordingly, the Court
finds that Plaintiff satisfies its burden of persuasion and establish the
existence of the Sales Agreement between the parties.
 
The Court finds the same is true regarding the Guaranty executed
by Koroteeva. Plaintiff sets forth in the separate statement that “[o]n about December
19, 2022, [Plaintiff] received a credit application from [Ozopac] to purchase
gasoline on credit from [Plaintiff]. The application
included the ‘Personal Guaranty’ of [Koroteeva]. [Plaintiff] reviewed the
credit application, including the Personal Guaranty, and based thereon approved
the application and extended credit to [Ozopac].” (Separate
Statement, p. 1, UMF Nos 1-3.) In UMF Nos. 1-3, Plaintiff incorporates by
reference Exhibit A of the Declaration of Fahed in Support of Motion for
Summary Judgment, which is purported to be a true and correct copy of the Koroteeva’s
Personal Guaranty. The Personal Guaranty is signed by Koroteeva. (Fahed Decl., ¶ 3; Ex. “A.”)
 
As to the second element— plaintiff's performance or excuse
for nonperformance—Plaintiff sets forth in the separate statement that:
 
On April 7, 2023,
[Plaintiff] delivered approximately 6,900 gallons of gasoline to [Ozopac],
which [Ozopac] accepted. [Plaintiff] issued an invoice to [Ozopac], stating the
costs and fees for the gasoline and its delivery, totaling $28,060.69,
requiring [Ozopac’s] payment no later than April 12, 2023. On April 9, 2023,
[Plaintiff] delivered another approximately 6,900 gallons to [Ozopac], which
[Ozopac] accepted. [Plaintiff] issued an invoice to [Ozopac], stating the costs
and fees for the gasoline and its delivery, totaling $28,271.23, requiring
[Ozopac’s] payment no later than April 15, 2023. On April 11, 2023, [Plaintiff]
made its third and final delivery of approximately 6,900 gallons of gasoline to
[Ozopac], which [Ozopac] again accepted. [Plaintiff] issued an invoice to
[Ozopac], stating the costs and fees for the gasoline and its delivery,
totaling $28,640.93, requiring [Ozopac’s] payment no later than April 16, 2023.
 
 (Separate Statement,
pp. 2-3, UMF Nos. 5-10.) Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff satisfies its
burden of persuasion and makes a prima facie showing that Plaintiff performed
under the contract.
 
As to the third element— defendant's breach—Plaintiff sets
forth in the separate statement that neither Ozopac nor Koroteeva paid any
portion of the three invoices; Plaintiff has not been paid any amount under the
Sales Agreement; Plaintiff has not been paid any amount under the Guaranty.
(Separate
Statement, p. 3, UMF Nos. 12, 14-15.) Given that Plaintiff satisfies its burden
of persuasion with regard to the performance under the contract, the Court
finds that Plaintiff satisfies its burden of persuasion and makes a prima facie
showing that Defendants breached the Sales Agreement and Guaranty because
Defendants have not paid the amount due and owing.
 
As to the fourth and final element—the resulting damages to
the plaintiff— Plaintiff sets forth in their separate statement that:
 
The annual accrual
of interest on the aggregate principal sum of $84,972.85 is $12,745.93
($84,972.85 x 15% = $12,745.93). When calculated on a per diem basis, the
amount of daily interest is $34.92 ($12,745.93 ÷ 365 = $34.92). The number of
days from April 16, 2023 to April 26, 2024, the scheduled hearing date of this
Motion, is 376 days. The total accrued interest is thus $13,129.92 ($34.92 x
376 = $13,129.92). Accordingly, the total amount due and owing from Defendants,
which includes principal and accrued interest (but excludes attorney fees, to
be sought at a later time), is $98,102.77 ($84,972.85 + $13,129.92 =
$98,102.77).
 
(Separate Statement, p. 3, UMF Nos. 13.) The Court finds
that Plaintiff satisfies its burden of persuasion and makes a prima facie
showing that Plaintiff was damaged by Defendants’ breaches.
 
Defendants offer no opposition to the motion and, as such,
have not presented evidence to raise a triable issue of material fact.
Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to the
first cause of action for Breach of Contract against Ozopac and the second
cause of action for Breach of Guaranty against Koroteeva. Summary adjudication
is granted as to these causes of action. 
 
II.             
Third Cause of Action (Conversion) against all Defendants.
 
“Conversion is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the property
of another. The elements of a conversion claim are: (1) the plaintiff’s
ownership or right to possession of the property; (2) the defendant’s
conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and (3)
damages.” (Lee v. Hanley (2015) 61 Cal.4th 1225, 1240.) A party must establish
“[t]he act [constituting conversion] must be knowingly or intentionally done,
but a wrongful intent is not necessary. Because the act must be knowingly done,
‘neither negligence, active or passive, nor a breach of contract, even though
it results in injury to, or loss of, specific property, constitutes a
conversion.’” (Taylor v. Forte Hotels International (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1119, 1124.) 
Because this
claim ultimately arises from a breach of contract, the facts here do not
support a cause of action for conversion. Plaintiff has failed to meet its
initial burden.  Accordingly, summary
adjudication is denied as to the third cause of action for Conversion. 
 
III.           
Fourth Cause of Action (Restitution Based on Unjust
Enrichment) against all Defendants and Fifth Cause of Action (Money Had And
Received) against all Defendants.
 
“The elements of an unjust enrichment
claim are the receipt of a benefit and the unjust retention of the benefit at
the expense of another.” (Peterson v. Cellco P’ship (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 1583, 1593.) “Unjust enrichment is not a cause of action, however,
or even a remedy, but rather a general principle, underlying various legal
doctrines and remedies. It is synonymous with restitution.” (Rutherford
Holdings, LLC v. Plaza Del Rey (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 221, 231.)  
 
Unjust enrichment is a cognizable
cause of action in California under certain circumstances, such as when there
is no enforceable express contract between the parties. (Durell v. Sharp
Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1370.)  
 
Common counts, like money had and received, are pled in
quasi-contract. (Gold v. Los Angeles Democratic League (1975) 49
Cal.App.3d 365, 376; CACI 370 [describing money had and received as common
count].) 
 
“A plaintiff may not…pursue or recover on a quasi-contract
claim if the parties have an enforceable agreement regarding a particular
subject matter.” (Klein v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th
1342, 1388.)
 
Because there are remedies available
under another cause of action for Breach of Contract and Breach
of Guaranty, the facts here do not support a
cause of action for Restitution and Money Had and Received. Accordingly, summary adjudication is denied as to
the fourth cause of action for Restitution and fifth cause of action for Money
Had and Received. 
 
Conclusion and Order 
 
Plaintiff Fuel Break, Inc.’s motion for summary judgment is DENIED. 
 
Plaintiff Fuel Break, Inc.’s motion for summary adjudication is GRANTED
as to the first cause of action for Breach of
Contract and the second cause of action for Breach of Guaranty only and otherwise
denied. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
