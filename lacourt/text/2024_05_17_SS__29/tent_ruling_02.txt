 Case Number:  21STCV32851    Hearing Date:   May 17, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Quash filed by Specially
Appearing Defendant Fernan
Balicoco.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
BACKGROUND
On September 7,
2021, Eduardo Gomez and Jennifer Cruz (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a
complaint against Adelio Anglito Cruz and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes
of action for general negligence and motor vehicle negligence arising out of an
alleged accident on June 18, 2020, at or near the intersection of Wilton Place
and San Marino Street in Los Angeles. 
On November 2,
2021, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to name Fernan Marticio Balicoco (“Defendant”)
as Doe 1.
On January 10,
2022, Plaintiffs filed a request to dismiss, with prejudice, the causes of
action in the complaint against Defendant Adelio Anglito Cruz (only).
On August 19,
2022, the Court granted Defendant’s first motion to quash service of summons
and complaint, based on evidence that Defendant was not in fact validly served
by personal service or substitute service (as asserted in proofs of service filed
with the Court).
On August 11,
2023, this Court granted the application of Plaintiffs to serve Defendant by
publication in The Manila Times (published in Manila, Philippines) and in the
Beverly Hills Courier (published in Beverly Hills, California).  Proof of publication in the Beverly Hills
Courier was filed with the Court on September 13, 2023, and proof of
publication in The Manila Times was filed with the Court on April 2, 2024. 
On April 22, 2024,
Defendant filed this motion to quash service of summons. Plaintiffs filed an
opposition on May 6, and Defendant filed a reply on May 8.
LEGAL
STANDARD
Proper service of a summons on each defendant
is a constitutional and statutory requirement in all civil actions.  Without proper service (or, for example,
consent or waiver), a court does not acquire jurisdiction over a defendant, and
in general any judgment rendered against the defendant is void.  (E.g., Kremerman v. White (2021) 71
Cal.App.5th 358, 371; County of San Diego v. Gorham (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 1215, 1231.)
The Code of Civil Procedure provides for
service on a defendant within the State of California by four basic methods:
(1) personal service; (2) substitute service; (3) service by mail and
acknowledgement of receipt; and (4) service by publication.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 415.10, 415.20, 415.30,
415.50.) 
For a defendant located outside of California
but within the United States, service may be made using any of these methods,
any method authorized by the law of the place where the person is served, or by
certified mail with a return receipt. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 413.10, subd. (b) & 415.40.)
For a defendant located outside of the United
States, the rules are slightly more complicated.  The United States and more than 80 other
countries are signatories to the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial
and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters, November 15, 1965,
20 U.S.T. 361, T.I.A.S. No. 6638 (the “Hague Service Convention”).  Where the Hague Service Convention applies, it
preempts state law with regard to service of process, and the parties must
comply with the procedures for service set forth in the Convention.  (Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v.
Schlunk (1988) 486 U.S. 694, 699, 705; Rockefeller Technology
Investments (Asia) VII v. Changzhou Sinotype Technology Co. (2020) 9
Cal.5th 125, 137-138; Code Civ. Proc., § 413.10, subd. (c).)
Where the Hague Service Convention does not
apply, service may be made using any of the four methods for service in California,
or by certified mail with a return receipt. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 413.10, subd. (c) & 415.40.)  Alternatively, service may be made “as
directed by the court in which the action is pending,” or by any method
authorized by the law of the place where the person is served “if the court before
or after service finds that the service is reasonably calculated to give actual
notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 413.10,
subd. (c).)
A defendant may challenge service through a
motion to quash service of the summons filed under Code of Civil Procedure
section 418.10.  “When a defendant
challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper service
of process the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of
jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an effective
service.”  (Summers v. McClanahan
(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413; see also, e.g., Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210
Cal.App.4th 1154, 1163.) 
DISCUSSION
As a threshold matter, the Court notes that
the parties submit no evidence (or judicially noticeable materials) regarding whether
The Philippines is or is not a signatory to the Hague Service Convention.  
Absent objection from either party, the
Court will take judicial notice of the hcch.net website, which appears to be an
official website of an intergovernmental organization named “The Hague
Conference on Private International Law” that maintains information regarding
the Hague Service Convention and numerous other international “Hague”
conventions.  The U.S. State Department
website (travel.state.gov) provides a link to the hcch.net website for
information on the Hague Service Convention. 
According to the hcch.net website, The Philippines joined the Hague
Service Convention in 2020.
The Court also notes, however, that Article
1 of the Hague Service Convention states: “This Convention shall not apply
where the address of the person to be served with the document is not known.”  (See also Lebel, supra, 210 Cal.App.4th at p. 1161 [quoting
Convention].)  Here, Plaintiffs have submitted
evidence, which the Court previously credited in granting the application for service
by publication, and which the Court now credits again, showing that despite their
reasonable diligence, Plaintiffs have been unable to locate an address for Defendant
in The Philippines.  (Application for
Publication [filed August 8, 2023], Declaration of Harry Kazakian, ¶¶ 4-9.)
The Court finds that the Hague
Service Convention does not apply in this set of factual circumstances.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs were not required to serve
Defendant through the procedures set forth in the Hague Service Convention.  
When the Hague Service Convention
does not apply, Code of Civil Procedure section 413.10, subdivision (c), provides
that a defendant located outside of the United States may be served “as provided
in this chapter” (among other options).  “[T]his
chapter,” as used in section 413.10, refers to chapter 4 of title 5 of part 2 of
the Code of Civil Procedure; chapter 4 runs from section 413.10 through 417.40.  That includes the authorization for service
by publication, which appears in section 415.50.
Thus, in these circumstances,
Plaintiffs were authorized by statute (specifically Code of Civil Procedure
section 415.50, as incorporated into section 413.10, subdivision (c)) and the
prior Order of this Court to serve Defendant through publication notice.  Plaintiffs have submitted the proof to show
that they have done so.  
Defendant’s motion to quash is
denied. 
CONCLUSION
The Court DENIES
Defendant’s motion to quash.
Plaintiffs
are ordered to give notice.
