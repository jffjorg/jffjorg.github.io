And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has reviewed the settlement between Nune Badalyan and the plaintiffs, Sigrid Hazel Soto and Jorge Manrique, and has determined that the settlement is in good faith. The court considered the Tech-Bilt factors, including the rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery, the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of the settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and the settling party's financial conditions and insurance policy limits. The court found that the settlement is reasonable and not "grossly disproportionate" to the settlor's proportionate share of liability. The court also noted that the uncertainty surrounding Badalyan's liability and her limited financial resources to pay a judgment in excess of policy limits weighs in favor of finding the settlement in good faith.
