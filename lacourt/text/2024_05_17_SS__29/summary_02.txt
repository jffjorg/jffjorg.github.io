And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has ruled that the motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant Fernan Marticio Balicoco is denied. The Court finds that the Hague Service Convention does not apply in this case, as the Defendant's address is unknown and the Convention only applies where the address of the person to be served is known. The Court also finds that the Plaintiffs were authorized by statute to serve the Defendant through publication notice, and that they have provided proof of such service. Therefore, the Court denies the motion to quash and orders the Plaintiffs to give notice.
