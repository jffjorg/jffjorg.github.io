 Case Number:  21STCV35858    Hearing Date:   May 17, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Determination of Good Faith
Settlement filed by Defendant Nune Badalyan.
 
Tentative
 
The motion is granted.
 
Background
This case arises out of an alleged accident
on February 28, 2020. Plaintiffs Sigrid Hazel Soto and Jorge Manrique
(collectively “Plaintiffs”) allege that Plaintiff Soto was walking near the
valet area in the parking lot of Defendants Specialty Healthcare Properties,
L.L.C. (“Specialty”), Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (“CSMC”), and Does 11 through
50 when Defendant Nune Badalyan (“Badalyan”) drove her vehicle over Plaintiff
Soto’s foot, causing her severe injuries.
On September 29, 2021, Plaintiffs filed the
Complaint in this action, asserting five causes of action: (1) Plaintiff Soto
asserts a motor vehicle negligence claim against Badalyan and Does 1 through
10; (2) both Plaintiff assert a general negligence claim against Badalyan and
Does 1 through 10; (3) Plaintiff Soto asserts a premises liability claim
against Specialty, CSMC, and Does 11 through 50; (4) Plaintiff Soto asserts a
general negligence claim against Specialty, CSMC, and Does 11 through 50; and
(5) Plaintiff Manrique asserts a loss of consortium claim against all
Defendants.
CSMC filed its Answer on February 15, 2023.
Specialty filed its Answer and a Cross-Complaint against Badalyan and Roes 1
through 100 on February 23, 2023. Badalyan filed her Answer and a Cross-Complaint
against Specialty, CSMC, and Roes 1 through 10 on March 8, 2023.
On November 6, 2023, Plaintiffs amended their
Complaint to name ABM Industries Incorporated (“ABM”) as Doe 1.
On February 6, 2024, the Court granted a
motion to contest a previous settlement between Plaintiff and Defendant Badalyan,
without prejudice to a further application or motion based on additional or
different evidence.
On March 22, 2024, the Court, at the request
of Plaintiffs, dismissed ABM without prejudice.
On April 8, 2024, the Court, at the request
of Plaintiffs, dismissed CSMC without prejudice.
On April 22, 2024, Badalyan filed this new motion
for determination of good faith settlement. 
No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
In a case involving two or more alleged joint
tortfeasors, a party may seek a court order under Code of Civil Procedure
section 877.6 determining that a settlement between the plaintiff and one or more
of the alleged tortfeasors is in good faith. A judicial determination of good
faith “bar[s] any other joint tortfeasor … from any further claims against the
settling tortfeasor … for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or
comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 877.6(c).)
In evaluating whether a settlement has been
made in good faith, courts consider the following factors, as set forth by the
California Supreme Court in the landmark case Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d
488: 
             1) “a rough approximation of plaintiffs’
total recovery”;
             2) “the settlor’s proportionate
liability”;
            3)
“the amount paid in settlement”;
     
4) “the allocation of the settlement proceeds among plaintiffs”;
5) “a recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement
than he would if he were found liable after a trial”;
             6) the settling party's “financial
conditions and insurance policy limits”;
7) any evidence of “collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to
injure the interests of nonsettling defendants.”
(Id. at 499.) “Practical
considerations obviously require that the evaluation be made on the basis of
information available at the time of settlement.” (Ibid.)
The “good faith” concept in Code of Civil
Procedure section 877.6 is a flexible principle imposing on reviewing courts
the obligation to guard against the numerous ways in which the interests of
nonsettling defendants may be unfairly prejudiced. (Rankin v. Curtis
(1986) 183 Cal. App. 3d 939, 945.) Accordingly, under Tech-Bilt, the party asserting the lack of “good faith” may meet
this burden by demonstrating that the settlement is so far "out of the
ballpark" as to be inconsistent with the equitable objectives of the
statute. (Tech-Bilt, supra, 38 Cal.3d at 499-500.) Such a demonstration
would establish that the proposed settlement was not a “settlement made in good
faith” within the terms of section 877.6. (Ibid.) 
The Supreme Court explained that Code of
Civil Procedure section 877.6 is designed to further two equitable policies: 
1)
encouragement of settlements; and 
2) equitable
allocation of costs among joint tortfeasors. 

(Ibid.)  
Those policies would not be served by an
approach which emphasizes one to the virtual exclusion of the other. (Ibid.)
Accordingly, a settlement will not be found in good faith unless the amount is
reasonable in light of the settling tortfeasor's proportionate share of
liability. (Std. Pac. of San Diego v. A. A. Baxter Corp. (1986) 176 Cal.
App. 3d 577, 589.) Or, as the California Supreme Court has stated, a
“defendant’s settlement figure must not be grossly disproportionate to what a
reasonable person, at the time of the settlement, would estimate the settling
defendant’s liability to be.” (Tech-Bilt, supra, 38 Cal.3d at 499.)
When a motion seeking a determination under
Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 is not opposed, the burden on the moving
parties to show that the settlement was made in good faith is slight. (City
of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261
[holding that a “barebones motion” including a declaration setting forth “a
brief background of the case is sufficient”].) 
When a good faith motion is contested,
however, the moving parties have the initial burden of producing evidence in
support of the requested good faith determination. (Id. at pp. 1261-1262.)
“Section 877.6 and Tech-Bilt require an evidentiary showing, through expert
declarations or other means, that the proposed settlement is within the
reasonable range permitted by the criterion of good faith.” (Mattco Forge v.
Arthur Young & Co. (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1351.) “Substantial
evidence” is required. (Id. at p. 1352.) A declaration from a settling
defendant’s attorney that states, in conclusory fashion, that the client has little,
or no share of the liability may not be sufficient. (Greshko v. County of
Los Angeles (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 822, 834-35; see also 3 Weil & Brown,
California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023)
¶¶ 12:774, 12:872-873.)  
The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the
party opposing the good faith determination. 
The “party asserting a lack of good faith shall have the burden of proof
on that issue.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §
877.6(d); see also 3 Weil & Brown, supra, at ¶ 12:875.) 
Discussion
Badalyan
seeks a determination that her settlement with Plaintiffs is a good faith
settlement under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6. The Court will review
the settlement and motion, guided by the factors outlined in Tech Bilt v. Woodward-Clyde
& Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, as well as the case law holding that
when a motion seeking a good faith determination is not opposed, the burden on
the moving party is slight. (City of 
Grand
Terrace v. Superior Court (1987) 192
Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261.
 
1. Rough approximation of
Plaintiff’s total recovery. 
 
Plaintiff Soto testified in her
deposition in November 2023 that she owed approximately $250,000 in medical
bills. (Rousier Decl. Exh. B, at p. 137:4-6.) Badalyan states in her motion
that there is evidence showing that the medical bills were much lower, but she does
not submit any such evidence to the Court. 
 
The Court previously determined a
rough approximation of Plaintiff Soto’s total recovery is in the mid six
figures, if not more.
 
2. The
settlor’s proportionate liability. 
 
Other
defendants (since dismissed) previously contended that Badalyan ran over
Plaintiff Soto’s foot. Badalyan now submits evidence, including her own testimony,
that indicates that she did not do so. (Badalyan Decl., ¶¶ 3-6; Rousier Decl.,
Exh. A, at p. 26:2-15 & Exh. B, at p. 50:13-51:18.) 
 
The evidence
in the record at this time is inconclusive on this point, and of course the
Court at this point is evaluating a settlement for good faith, not adjudicating
fault. Settlor’s proportionate liability is in dispute, but at this time no
other party is contesting Badalyan’s assertion that she did not cause the
injury to Plaintiff Soto.
 
3. The
amount paid in settlement. 
 
The
agreement requires Badalyan to pay Plaintiffs a total of $50,000. (Badalyan
Decl., ¶ 7.)
 
4. The
allocation of the settlement proceeds among plaintiffs. 
 
This factor is
not specifically addressed. 
 
5. A recognition
that a settlor should pay less in settlement than she would if she were found
liable after a trial. 
 
This factor weighs
in favor of finding the settlement in good faith.
 
6. The
settling party’s financial conditions and insurance policy limits. 
 
Badalyan is settling
for her policy limits of $50,000. She has no other significant assets to pay a
judgment and makes approximately $22,500 per year. (Badalyan Decl., ¶¶ 7-9.)
 
7. Any
evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests
of nonsettling defendants. 
 
There is no
evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct in the record.
 
The Court
has considered all of the evidence in the record and the arguments submitted.  The Court has considered and weighed each of the
Tech-Bilt factors and finds that the settlement is in good faith. The
Court gives significant weight to the uncertainty surrounding Badalyan’s
liability and the limited financial resources available to her to pay a
judgment in excess of policy limits.
The motion
is granted.
 
Conclusion
 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Badalyan’s Motion for Determination of Good Faith
Settlement.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
