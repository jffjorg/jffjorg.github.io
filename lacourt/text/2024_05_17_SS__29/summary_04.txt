And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The judge finds that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the defendant was properly served with the summons and complaint. The judge notes that the plaintiffs' proof of service is unreliable and lacks credibility. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proof to demonstrate personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The judge concludes that the service of summons was not properly and validly effectuated, and therefore, the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendant.
