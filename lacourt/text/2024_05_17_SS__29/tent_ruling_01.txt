Background
On May 26, 2020, Plaintiff Renee Agnew (“Plaintiff”) filed the
complaint in this action against Defendants Jensen Enterprises, Inc., Jensen
Precast, and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action for premises
liability and negligence arising out of injuries Plaintiff allegedly sustained
after tripping and falling on June 6, 2018, on Defendants’ premises at or near
1375 West Adams in Los Angeles.
On January 3, 2022, Jensen Enterprises, Inc. dba Jensen
Precast (erroneously sued as separate entities) (“Jensen”) filed an answer to
the complaint.
On various dates running from May 2022 through March 2024, Plaintiff
amended the complaint to name Little Shell LLC as Doe 1; Victor Sanchez as Doe
2; Manuel Sanchez as Doe 3; Baskin-Robbins Franchising LLC as Doe 4; Metamoros
LLC as Doe 5; L.A. Grease Solutions, Inc. as Doe 6; Dolce BG, Inc. dba Baskin
Robbins (“Dolce”) as Doe 7; and Tacos El Unico, Inc. as Doe 8.
On various dates running from January through May 2023, Manuel
Sanchez, Victor Sanchez, Matamoros LLC (erroneously sued as Metamoros LLC), and
Baskin-Robbins Franchising LLC filed answers to the complaint.
On November 7, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for
leave to file a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”).  Plaintiff did not file the FAC until March 6,
2024, but Jensen nonetheless filed an answer to the FAC on December 15, 2023.  On March 11, 2024, Dolce filed an answer to
the FAC.
On February 9, 2024, Manuel Sanchez, Victor Sanchez, and
Matamoros LLC filed a cross-complaint against Tacos El Unico, Inc. and L.A.
Grease Solutions, Inc.  On March 8, 2024,
Tacos El Unico was dismissed from the cross-complaint.  On April 8, 2024, a First Amended
Cross-Complaint was filed.
Plaintiff filed requests to dismiss Baskin-Robbins Franchising
LLC (Doe 4) and Jensen in February and April 2024.
There are three motions set for hearing on May 17.
As is relevant to these three motions, Plaintiff served Dolce with
Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests
for Production (Set One) on January 12, 2024. (Steiner Decls., ¶ 8 & Exhs.
1-2.) Dolce served responses on January 23. 
(Id., ¶ 10 & Exhs. 2-4.) 
Plaintiff contends that the responses are not code compliant, but the
parties were unable to resolve the dispute. 
(Id., ¶¶ 11-17 & Exhs. 3-9.) 

The parties participated in an Informal Discovery Conference
(IDC) on March 14, 2024, but the matter was not resolved.
Plaintiff filed these three motions to compel on March 15,
2024. Plaintiff also seeks sanctions.  The
two motions relating to the interrogatories were set for hearing on April 18,
and the motion relating to the document requests was set for hearing on April
26.
Prior to the hearing on April 18, Dolce had not filed any
oppositions.  The Court posted a
tentative ruling, conferred with counsel, and then continued all three hearings
to May 17, 2024.
On May 6, Dolce filed a combined opposition to all three
motions, along with its own request for sanctions.  On May 9, Plaintiff filed replies.
Legal Standard
“On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding
party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be given
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Id.,
subd. (c).)
A motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of the Court, a
“concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Id.,
subd. (b)(1) & (b)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
“The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)
“On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the
following apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete.  (2) A representation of
inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.  (3) An objection in the response is without
merit or too general.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (a).)
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be given
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Id.,
subd. (c).)
A motion to compel further responses must set forth specific
facts showing good cause for the discovery and must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of the Court, a
“concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Id.,
subd. (b)(1)-(3); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
“[T]he court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)
In Chapter 7 of the
Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a)
provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that any person “engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any
attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” A “misuse of
the discovery process” includes (among other things) failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without substantial
justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive
response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide discovery;
and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without substantial
justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)

Sanctions
Plaintiff seeks sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2030.300, 2031.310, and 2023.030. The requests are granted.
Sections
2030.300, subdivision (d), and 2031.310, subdivision (h) require the imposition
of sanctions against a party or attorney “who unsuccessfully makes or opposes”
a motion to compel further responses, unless the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition
of sanctions unjust.  Here, Dolce did not
act with substantial justification in failing to provide code compliant
responses; whatever Dolce may contend (or even ultimately prove) with regard to
the merits, Dolce still must comply with the Civil Discovery Act.  Dolce has not done so.  Nor is there any evidence to support a
determination that the imposition of sanctions against Dolce would be unjust. 
The Court
sets sanctions as follows.  The Court has
taken into consideration the relatively straightforward nature of the motions,
as well as the economies of scale associated with preparing multiple discovery
motions.
With regard
to the motion to compel further responses to the form interrogatories, the
Court awards sanctions in the amount of $1,068.40, calculated based on 2.5 hours
of attorney time, multiplied by a reasonable billing rate of $400 per hour for
work of this nature, plus $68.40 in filing fees.  (See Steiner Decl., ¶¶ 22-23.)
With regard
to the motion to compel further responses to the special interrogatories, the
Court awards sanctions in the amount of $1,368.40, calculated based on 3.25 hours
of attorney time, multiplied by a reasonable billing rate of $400 per hour for
work of this nature, plus $68.40 in filing fees.  (See Steiner Decl., ¶¶ 22-23.)
With regard
to the motion to compel further responses to the requests for production, the
Court awards sanctions in the amount of $1,468.40, calculated based on 3.5 hours
of attorney time, multiplied by a reasonable billing rate of $400 per hour for
work of this nature, plus $68.40 in filing fees.  (See Steiner Decl., ¶¶ 22-23.)
Dolce’s
request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff (in the amount of $15,375) is
denied.
