And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Motion for Attorney's Fees filed by the successor in interest of Pritpal Walia, the Plaintiff. The Motion was brought under Government Code section 12965, which allows for the award of attorney's fees to the prevailing party. However, the Judge found that the Plaintiff did not demonstrate that they were the prevailing party under this statute.

The Judge analyzed the parties' 998 offer to compromise and the judgment entered in favor of the Plaintiff, and concluded that the Plaintiff did not achieve their litigation objectives on a practical level. The Judge also noted that the Plaintiff's successor did not provide a detailed analysis of the prevailing party standard and did not discuss the impact of the Plaintiff's death and the subsequent stipulation to transfer the action to the limited jurisdiction court on the prayer for relief.

The Judge cited several cases and statutes in support of their decision, including Government Code section 12965, FEHA, and Labor Code sections 1198.5 and 226(c)(f). The Judge ultimately concluded that the Plaintiff's successor did not demonstrate that they were the prevailing party and therefore denied the Motion for Attorney's Fees.
