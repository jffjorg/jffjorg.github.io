ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff Samara A. Weiner (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action for recovery of COVID-19 rental debt against Defendants Century Property
Management & Investment, Inc. and Deion Gerhard (“Defendants”) on July 27,
2022. Defendants filed an answer and cross-complaint against Plaintiff, Art
Koomer, and Michael Koomer on November 23, 2022. Arthur Koomer and Michael also
filed cross-complaints against unnamed cross-defendants on May 18, 2023 and
June 30, 2023, respectively.
 
On December 18,
2023, the Court granted Defendants’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings with
respect to the Complaint leave to amend. (Minute Order, 12/18/23.) On February
5, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ ex parte application and dismissed
Plaintiff’s Complaint against them with prejudice. (Minute Order, 02/05/24.) Defendants had filed the instant Motion to
Bifurcate Trial on November 22, 2023. As the instant Motion concerns the trial
on Plaintiff’s Complaint, which has been dismissed against Defendants, it is
now moot. 
 
Therefore, Defendants
Century Property Management & Investment, Inc. and Deion Gerhard’s Motion to
Bifurcate Trial is PLACED OFF CALENDAR AS MOOT.
