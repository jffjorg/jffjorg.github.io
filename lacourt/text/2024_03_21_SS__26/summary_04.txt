And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the petition to confirm arbitration award filed by Qiang Fang is dismissed. The petition was filed on June 15, 2023, and initially set for hearing on October 19, 2023, but was continued to allow Fang to file a proof of service and notice of hearing date. The matter was again continued to March 21, 2024. Fang filed proofs of service by mail on February 20, 2024, and March 7, 2024, but these did not conform to the statutory requirements for service.

The Judge found that Fang failed to meet the statutory requirements for service of the petition and notice of hearing, and also failed to show that the arbitration award was served personally or by registered or certified mail. The Judge also noted that Fang is in pro per and therefore not entitled to attorney's fees.

As a result, the petition to confirm arbitration award is dismissed.
