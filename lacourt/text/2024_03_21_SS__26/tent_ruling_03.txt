ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Jonathan
Nissanoff (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for common counts and
breach of contract against Defendant Oscar Health Plan of California (“Defendant”)
on December 27, 2022. Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on February 14,
2023. 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Further
Discovery Responses on February 20, 2024. Defendant filed an opposition on
March 8, 2024 and Plaintiff filed a separate statement on March 11, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant’s further responses to
the first set of Requests for Admission, and Requests for Production of
Documents, and the supplemental set for Interrogatories. (Notice, p. 2:3-7.)
The Motion has a number of procedural defects, however. 
 
First, the Motion is not accompanied by a proof of service
demonstrating service of the papers or notice of the hearing date on Defendant.
Failure to give notice of a motion is not only a violation of the statutory
requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero
(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) However, Defendant has filed a substantive
opposition that waives any defect in service. 
 
Second, Plaintiff improperly filed a single discovery motion
to compel further responses with respect to three separate sets of discovery:
the first sets of Request for Admissions and Request for Production of
Documents, and the supplemental Interrogatories. Filing the requests as a
single motion negatively impacts the Court’s calendar by placing more motions
on the calendar than slots have been provided by the online reservation system.
Furthermore, it allows the moving party to avoid paying the requisite filing
fees. Statutorily required filing fees are jurisdictional and “it is mandatory
for the court clerks to demand and receive statutorily required filing fees.”
(See Duran v. St. Luke’s Hospital (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 457, 460.) Plaintiff’s
motion, therefore, cannot be heard in full until two additional motion
reservations are made and the corresponding filing fees are paid. 
 
Finally, although the Motion addresses the separate
statement requirement under Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345 and contends that
a separate statement is attached, no such document was included in the Motion
filed with the Court. The separate statement was only filed on March 11, 2024,
and apparently served on Defendant on March 10, 2024. (Separate Statement,
filed 03/11/24, p. 28.) This does not satisfy the requirement of due process,
as set forth above. 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Plaintiff Jonathan Nissanoff’s Motion for Order
Compelling Further Discovery Responses is CONTINUED TO MAY 23, 2024. BY APRIL 18,
2024, PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL PAPERS CORRECTING THE DEFECTS NOTED
ABOVE AND PAY THE ADDITIONAL FILING FEES. ANY OPPOSITION AND REPLY PAPERS ARE
TO BE FILED PURSUANT TO THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
