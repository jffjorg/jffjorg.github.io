ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Jose Casillas (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action for civil rights violations against Defendant Kyle+Shahida, LLC (“Defendant”)
on October 9, 2023. Defendant filed the instant Demurrer to the Complaint on
November 29, 2023. The Demurrer initially came for hearing on December 21,
2023, at which time the Court ruled that its procedural defects had to be
corrected, as follows: (1) the Demurrer was filed by Defendant, a corporation,
in propria persona, through a non-lawyer; and (2) the Demurrer was not
accompanied by a proof of service demonstrating that it, or notice of the
hearing date, was served on Plaintiff. (Minute Order, 12/21/23.) The Court
ordered Defendant to file a substitution of attorney demonstrating it was
represented by a licensed attorney and proof of service of the Demurrer papers
and notice of new hearing date by February 22, 2024. To date, no papers have
been filed as ordered. 
 
Accordingly, the Court strikes the Demurrer pursuant to its
inherent authority under Code of Civil Procedure section 436, subdivision (b). 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant
Kyle+Shahida, LLC’s Demurrer to the Complaint is STRICKEN.
 
THE COURT
SETS AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE RE ENTRY OF DEFAULT FOR MAY 23, 2024 AT 9:30
