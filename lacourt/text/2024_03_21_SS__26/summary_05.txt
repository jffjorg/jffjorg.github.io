And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling strikes the demurrer filed by Kyle+Shahida, LLC to the complaint filed by Jose Casillas on October 9, 2023. The demurrer was initially scheduled for hearing on December 21, 2023, but was continued due to procedural defects. The defects included the filing of the demurrer by a non-lawyer and the lack of proof of service demonstrating that the demurrer papers and notice of the hearing date were served on the plaintiff. Despite being ordered to correct these defects by February 22, 2024, Kyle+Shahida, LLC failed to do so. As a result, the court strikes the demurrer and sets an order to show cause re entry of default for May 23, 2024.
