And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel arbitration of the controversy and stay the action. The arbitration provision in the Lease Agreement is valid and enforceable, and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies to the provision. The judge has determined that the plaintiff's claims fall under the arbitration provision and that the defendant has standing to enforce the provision against the plaintiff. The judge has also found that the defendant's minimal participation in the court proceedings does not provide a basis to find that the defendant waived its right to compel arbitration. The action is stayed pending the resolution of the arbitration.
