SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Jana Burkholder’s
(Plaintiff) tenancy from on or about 3/28/20 to on or about 5/15/23 in an
apartment allegedly owned, controlled and/or managed by Defendant PMI Cielo LLC
(Defendant).  Plaintiff alleges that
during her tenancy the apartment suffered from numerous habitability issues
that negatively impacted her health and eventually led to her moving out of the
apartment.
 
On 9/12/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant
for: (1) Tortious Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability – Violations of
Civil Code 1941; (2) Breach of Contract – Civil Code 3300, et seq.; (3) Breach
of Quiet Enjoyment – Civil Code 1927; (4) Private Nuisance – Civil Code 3501,
et seq.; (5) Premises Liability – Civil Code 1714; (6) Retaliation; (7) Negligence;

(8) Retaliatory Eviction; (9) Constructive Eviction; (10)
Violation of Civil Code 1940.2; 
(11) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (12) Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress; (13) Violation of Business and Professions
Code 17200, et seq.; (14) Fraud; and (15) Violation of Civil Code 1950.5.  The parties were unable to resolve the issues
Defendant has with the complaint; therefore, on 2/2/24, Defendant filed and
served a demurrer to the 1st – 6th and 8th –
15th causes of action in the complaint on the grounds that the
complaint failed to state sufficient facts to constitute any of these causes of
action and each of these causes of action was uncertain.  CCP 430.10(e), (f).  Defendant also filed and served a motion to
strike portions of the complaint regarding punitive
damages; physical and mental discomfort in the 2nd cause of action;
and request for monetary damages in the 13th cause of action.  On 5/23/24, the Court sustained the demurrer
without leave to amend as to the 8th, 10th, 12th
and 13th causes of action; overruled the demurrer as to the 1st,
2nd and 3rd causes of action and sustained the demurrer
with leave to amend as to the 4th, 5th, 6th, 9th,
11th, 14th and 15th causes of action.  (See 5/23/24 Minute Order).  The Court also granted the motion to strike
without leave to amend.  Id.
 
On 6/21/24,
Plaintiff filed the subject First Amended Complaint alleging causes of action
for: (1) Tortious Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability – Violations of
Civil Code 1941, (2) Breach of Contract – Civil Code 3300, et seq., (3) Breach
of Quiet Enjoyment – Civil Code 1927, (4) Premises Liability, (5) Retaliation –
Civil Code 1942.5 and (6) Violation of Civil Code 1950.5.  The parties were unable to informally resolve
the issues Defendant has with the First Amended Complaint.  (See Gruskin Decl.).  Therefore, on 8/22/24, Defendant filed and
served the instant demurrer to the 4th, 5th and 6th
causes of action in the First Amended Complaint.  Plaintiff has opposed the demurrer and
Defendant has filed a reply to the opposition. 
    

 
ANALYSIS 
  
 
4th cause of action – Premises Liability
 
CCP 430.41(b) provides: 
 
“A party demurring to a pleading
that has been amended after a demurrer to an earlier version of the pleading
was sustained shall not demur to any portion of the amended complaint,
cross-complaint, or answer on grounds that could have been raised by demurrer
to the earlier version of the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer.”
 
In its demurrer to the original complaint, Defendant argued
that the premises liability cause of action was duplicative of Plaintiff’s
cause of action for negligence.  (See
Demurrer to Original Complaint filed 2/2/24, p.14:12-p.15:1).  In the demurrer to the original complaint, Defendant
made no argument that the premises liability cause of action was duplicative of
the breach of implied warranty of habitability cause of action which is the
sole basis for the demurrer to the premises liability cause of action alleged
in the First Amended Complaint.  (See
Demurrer to Original Complaint, p.14:12-p.15:1; Demurrer to First Amended
Complaint filed on 8/22/24, p.5:23-p.6:15). 
As such, Defendant is precluded from raising such grounds in the instant
demurrer.  See CCP 430.41(b).
 
5th cause of action – Retaliation – Civil
Code 1942.5(a)  
 
The basis for Plaintiff’s retaliation claim is still
unclear.  The First Amended Complaint
indicates that the cause of action is based on Civil Code 1942.5(a).  (See FAC, p.10:7-8).  Civil Code 1942.4(a) provides: 
 
“If the lessor retaliates against
the lessee because of the exercise by the lessee of the lessee's rights under
this chapter or because of the lessee's complaint to an appropriate agency as
to tenantability of a dwelling, and if the lessee of a dwelling is not in
default as to the payment of rent, the lessor may not recover possession of a
dwelling in any action or proceeding, cause the lessee to quit involuntarily,
increase the rent, or decrease any services within 180 days of any of the
following:
 
(1) After the date upon which the
lessee, in good faith, has given notice pursuant to Section
1942, has provided notice of a suspected bed bug infestation, or has made
an oral complaint to the lessor regarding tenantability.
 
(2) After the date upon which the
lessee, in good faith, has filed a written complaint, or an oral complaint
which is registered or otherwise recorded in writing, with an appropriate
agency, of which the lessor has notice, for the purpose of obtaining correction
of a condition relating to tenantability.
 
(3) After the date of an inspection
or issuance of a citation, resulting from a complaint described in paragraph
(2) of which the lessor did not have notice.
 
(4) After the filing of appropriate
documents commencing a judicial or arbitration proceeding involving the issue
of tenantability.
 
(5) After entry of judgment or the
signing of an arbitration award, if any, when in the judicial proceeding or
arbitration the issue of tenantability is determined adversely to the lessor.
 
In each instance, the 180-day
period shall run from the latest applicable date referred to in paragraphs (1)
to (5), inclusive.”
 
The allegations in the First Amended Complaint fail to
show how Defendant violated Civil Code 1942.5(a).  Further, the opposition indicates that the
claim is actually based on Civil Code 1942.5(d).  (See Opposition, p.3:27-p.4:15).  
 
6th cause of action – Violation of Civil
Code 1950.5
 
In the “General Factual Allegations” of the First Amended
Complaint, which are incorporated into the 6th cause of action,
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to return the Security Deposit and
failed to provide an itemization of same in violation of Civil Code
1950.5.  (See FAC ¶¶16, 43).  As such, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a
claim for violation of Civil Code 1950.5.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer as to the 4th and 6th
causes of action is overruled.  The
demurrer as to the 5th cause of action is sustained with 30 days
leave to amend.  Given the liberal policy
of allowing leave to amend and since this is only the First Amended Complaint,
Plaintiff is given another opportunity to try to cure the defects in the retaliation
cause of action.
