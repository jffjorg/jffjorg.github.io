SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Mario Vega Aguilera’s
(Plaintiff) lease of a new 2020 Honda Pilot on 3/17/20 from non-party Galpin
Honda (Galpin).  The “Closed-End Motor
Vehicle Lease Agreement – California” (Lease Agreement) includes an arbitration
provision which provides:
 
“52. ARBITRATION: 
 
PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION
PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. BY ELECTING ARBITRATION, YOU
AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH
BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR DISPUTE HEARD IN COURT
AND WAIVE THE RIGHT TO BRING CLASS CLAIMS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT DISCOVERY AND
APPEAL RIGHTS ARE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. 
 
Arbitration is a method of
resolving a claim, dispute or controversy without filing a lawsuit. By agreeing
to arbitrate, the right to go to court is waived and instead claims, disputes
or controversies are submitted to binding arbitration. This provision sets
forth the terms and conditions of our agreement. YOU and HONDA
agree and acknowledge that this Lease affects interstate commerce and the
Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA") applies. 
 
By signing the Arbitration Consent,
YOU elect to have disputes resolved by arbitration. YOU, HONDA
or any involved third party may pursue a Claim. "Claim” means any dispute
between YOU, HONDA, or any involved third party relating to your
account, this Lease, or our relationship, including any application, the
Vehicle its performance and any representations, omissions or warranties.
"Claim'' does not include personal injury or wrongful death claims. YOU
or HONDA may seek remedies in small claims court or provisional judicial
remedies without arbitrating. 
 
YOU or HONDA may
select arbitration with American Arbitration Association, JAMS or National
Arbitration and Mediation. Contact these sponsors for their rules. The hearing
will be in the federal district where YOU reside. If agreed, it may be
by telephone or written submissions. Filing and arbitrator fees to be paid per
the sponsor rules. You may contact the sponsor for a fee waiver. If no fee
waivers, HONDA will pay filing and arbitrator fees up to $5,000, unless
law requires more. Each party is responsible for other fees. Arbitrator may
award costs or fees to prevailing party, if permitted by law. HONDA will
not seek fees, unless the claims are frivolous. 
 
Arbitrator shall be an attorney or
current or retired judge familiar with automotive or consumer finance. The
arbitrator shall follow substantive law, statute of limitations and decide all
issues relating to the interpretation, construction, enforceability and
applicability of this provision. The arbitrator may order relief permitted by
law. This provision is governed and enforceable by the FAA. An award shall
include a written opinion and be final, subject to appeal by the FAA. 
 
This provision survives termination
of this Lease or relationship, bankruptcy, assignment or transfer. If part of
this provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect. If
unenforceability allows arbitration as a class action, then this provision is
entirely unenforceable. YOU may opt out within 30 days of signing this
Lease by sending a signed, written notice to HONDA at Honda Financial
Services. P.O Box 165007, Irving, TX 75016. HONDA reserves the right to
make changes to this provision after providing written notice and an
opportunity to opt out. 
 
HONDA means Lessor, Dealer,
Honda Lease Trust, American Honda Finance Corporation (AHFC), American Honda
Motor Co., Inc., Honda Finance Exchange, Inc., Acura Financial Services
(AFS), Honda Financial Services (HFS), HVT, Inc., their parents, subsidiaries,
predecessors, successors, assignees, and officers, employees, representatives
and agents. YOU means Lessee and Co-Lessee to this Lease.”  (Bold in original, Underlining added)
 
(Manigo Decl., Ex.A).
 
 
On 2/21/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant
for: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty, (2)
Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty and (3) Violation of
the Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2.  On
3/24/23, Defendant answered the complaint. 
After Galpin produced the Lease Agreement in October of 2023, Defendant
requested that Plaintiff submit this matter to arbitration which Plaintiff
refused.  (See Michel Decl. ¶¶8-10).
 
Therefore, on 2/5/24, Defendant filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order compelling arbitration of this controversy and
staying this action.  Plaintiff has
opposed the motion and Defendant has filed a reply to the opposition.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) is
granted.  
 
Both federal and California law favor the enforcement of valid
arbitration agreements.  See Sanchez
(2015) 61 C4th 899; Armendariz (2000) 24 C4th 83.  
 
Here, the arbitration provision in the Lease Agreement
acknowledges that the lease affects interstate commerce and that the Federal
Arbitration Act (FAA) applies.  (Manigo
Decl., Ex.A ¶52).  The FAA provides, in
relevant part:
 
“A written provision in any
maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce
to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract
or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an
agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising
out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable,
and enforceable save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the
revocation of any contract or as otherwise provided in chapter 4.”
 
(See 9 USC §2)
 
Based on the strong policy in favor of arbitration,
courts broadly construe “commerce.”  See
Societe Generale de Surveillance, S.A. (1st Cir. 1981) 643
F.2d 863, 867; Concepcion (2011) 131 S.Ct. 1740, 1745-1746.  A “transaction involving commerce” has been
defined as one where the “petitioner while performing his duties under the
employment contract…was producing goods for commerce, or engaging in activity
that affected commerce.”  Bernhardt
(1956) 350 U.S. 198, 200-201.  Here,
Defendant warrants, distributes and, for of the Song-Beverly Act, manufactures  the Subject Vehicle.  Additionally, Defendant manages and responds
to consumer concerns pursuant to the express warranties.
 
In this action, the gravamen of Plaintiff’s claims are
that the Subject Vehicle contained or developed “serious defects and
nonconformities to warranty including, but not limited to, electrical and
structural system defects.”  (Complaint
¶10).  As such, Plaintiff’s claims fall
under the arbitration provision.  Not
only did Plaintiff agree to arbitrate such claims expressly against Defendant
and others, but the California Supreme Court has held that such arbitration
provisions in automobile contracts are not unconscionable and are
enforceable.  See Sanchez (2015)
61 CA4th 899, 907-908.  Plaintiff
provides no support for his claim that the arbitration provision is
procedurally or substantively unconscionable. 
Plaintiff is charged with having read the Lease Agreement he signed
containing the arbitration provision and there is no evidence that the
provision contains one-sided or oppressive terms.
 
Although arbitration under the Lease Agreement is
governed by the FAA, it may also be enforced by the summary procedures under
California law (California Arbitration Act). 
See Sanchez, supra at 922; Rosenthal (1996)
14 C4th 394, 409-410.  As noted above,
California has a strong public policy in favor of arbitration with any
ambiguities in the scope of arbitration being resolved in favor of arbitration.  Moncharsh (1992) 3 C4th 1, 9; Hayes
Children Leasing Co. Children (1995) 37 CA4th 775, 788; See also United
Transportation Union (1992) 7 CA4th 804, 808.  The party opposing arbitration has the burden
of establishing that an arbitration provision cannot be interpreted to require
arbitration of the dispute.  Coast
Plaza Doctors Hospital (2000) 83 CA4th 677, 686-687.  
 
Here, the arbitration provision expressly names Defendant
as one of the parties against whom Plaintiff has agreed to arbitrate disputes such
as the ones set forth in the complaint. 
(Manigo Decl., Ex.A ¶52; Complaint ¶¶4, 8, 14, 21, 45, 46).  The foregoing makes this case distinguishable
from Ngo (9th Cir. 2022) 23 F.4th 942 and Kramer
(9th Cir. 2013) 705 F.3d 1122, relied on by Plaintiff.  In Ngo, the arbitration clause
expressly stated that only three parties – Ngo, the dealership and the assignee
– could compel arbitration.  See Ngo,
supra at 946.  Similarly, in Kramer,
the arbitration clause was limited to claims between plaintiffs and the
dealerships.  See Kramer, supra
at 1128.
 
The broad language in the arbitration provision which
specifically identifies Defendant as a third-party beneficiary provides
Defendant with standing to enforce the provision against Plaintiff.  See Ronay Family Ltd Partnership
(2013) 216 CA4th 830, 838-839.
 
Defendant’s minimal participation in the court
proceedings before filing this motion does not provide a basis to find that
Defendant waived its right to compel arbitration of Plaintiff’s disputes
against it.  See Khalatian
(2015) 237 CA4th 651, 661-662.    
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
This action is stayed pending the resolution of the arbitration.  See 9 USC §3; CCP 1281.4  
 
The Court notes that Plaintiff’s counsel has failed to
electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the Schmitt declaration filed
in support of the opposition.  See
CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  Counsel for the
parties are warned that failure to comply with this rule in the future may
result in matters being continued so that papers can be refiled in compliance
with the rule, papers not being considered and/or the imposition of
sanctions.
