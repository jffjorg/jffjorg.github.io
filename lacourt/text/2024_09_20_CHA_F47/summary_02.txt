Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled on a demurrer filed by the defendant, PMI Cielo LLC, to the First Amended Complaint filed by the plaintiff, Jana Burkholder. The demurrer was filed to the 4th, 5th, and 6th causes of action. The judge has overruled the demurrer as to the 4th and 6th causes of action, but sustained it with 30 days leave to amend as to the 5th cause of action. The 4th cause of action is for premises liability, and the judge has ruled that the defendant is precluded from raising grounds that could have been raised by demurrer to the earlier version of the complaint. The 5th cause of action is for retaliation, and the judge has sustained the demurrer because the basis for the claim is unclear and the plaintiff has not adequately alleged a violation of Civil Code 1942.5. The 6th cause of action is for violation of Civil Code 1950.5, and the judge has overruled the demurrer because the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a claim for failure to return the security deposit and provide an itemization of same.
