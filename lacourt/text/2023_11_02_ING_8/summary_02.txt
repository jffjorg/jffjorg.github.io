And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has ruled on the Defendant's Motion to Compel Further Responses to Plaintiff's Request for Production of Documents Nos. 13-16. The Court has granted the motion, except for tax returns which have an independent basis for privilege. The Court has ordered the Plaintiff to provide verified further written responses to the requests within 30 days and to produce the requested documents in that same time period. However, the tax returns are subject to an independent basis for privilege from discovery, and the parties may enter into a limited protective order with respect to their production. The Court has requested argument on this point.
