```

And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to compel further responses to requests for production, set one, and a request for sanctions. The case involves a lawsuit filed by Maria Lopez and Martin Gonzalez against Matrix Service, Inc. and others, arising from an incident at an oil refinery facility in Torrance, California. The plaintiffs allege that the incident was caused by the defective design and manufacture of a jack stand by Matrix.

The defendant, Matrix, is seeking to compel the State of California, acting by and through the Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health (“Cal-OSHA”), to produce for inspection and testing of tangible things, including the jack stand, air bags, and other equipment. Matrix argues that it needs to inspect and test these items to determine if other products played a causal factor in the occurrence of the incident.

The court has concerns about the potential destruction of evidence if Matrix is allowed to conduct off-site testing of the evidence held by Cal-OSHA. The court is also confused about how Matrix would test the tangible evidence, given that other parties and their experts have previously accessed and inspected the instrumentalities and possibly have already affected or altered the evidence.

The court's tentative ruling is to grant the motion as to inspection only and deny the motion as to destructive testing pending oral argument. The court is seeking further explanation from Matrix as to why it needs to perform destruction testing with the Cal-OSHA tangible evidence and why that testing must be done at an off-site laboratory.
