And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint by Defendant Salim Lallani. The motion seeks to add new parties and causes of action to the Cross-Complaint, which alleges breach of contract and other claims related to the administration of a lease. The Judge has granted the motion, finding that the liberal policy for granting such a motion is only outweighed by substantial prejudice on the adverse party. The Judge notes that the proposed Cross-Complaint is not excessively vague, and that the procedural guidelines have been followed. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiffs have not shown prejudice that would justify denying the motion. The case will proceed with the Defendant's proposed Cross-Complaint.
