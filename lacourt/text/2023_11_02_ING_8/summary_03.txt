Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to discovery requests filed by the plaintiff, Iman Peykar, against the defendant, BMW of North America, LLC. The motion was filed after the defendant failed to provide responsive documents to the plaintiff's requests for production of documents.

The judge granted the motion in part and denied it in part. The judge ordered the defendant to provide further responses to discovery requests, including documents related to the recall policy and procedures, document retention policy, and policies and procedures related to the repurchase of vehicles. The judge also ordered the defendant to provide a verified further written response within 21 days.

The judge denied the motion to compel as to certain requests, including requests for documents related to the recall policy, document retention policy, and policies and procedures related to the repurchase of vehicles. The judge found that these requests were overly broad and unduly burdensome.

The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, but noted that the court will revisit the issue of reasonable attorneys' fees if the case goes to trial and the jury finds in the plaintiff's favor.
