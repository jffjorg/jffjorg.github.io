Here is the English summary:

This is a tentative ruling by the court regarding a motion for reconsideration filed by Defendant Doe A. The court has already granted Plaintiff Financial Services Vehicle Trust a summary judgment and attorneys' fees and costs. Doe A argues that the court should reconsider its decision, but the court finds that the motion is untimely and lacks new facts or law. The court also notes that Doe A's arguments appear to be the same as those presented in her opposition papers, and therefore does not find any new or different facts or circumstances that would warrant reconsideration. The court will allow oral argument, but currently tentatively rules to deny the motion for reconsideration.
