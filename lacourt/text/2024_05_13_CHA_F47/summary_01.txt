The tentative ruling is a decision by a judge in a court case between the Reys and Kei-Ai Los Angeles Healthcare Center. The Reys filed a cross-complaint against Kei-Ai alleging causes of action for retaliation in violation of Labor Code 1102.5, wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, racial retaliation in violation of FEHA, failure to prevent harassment, discrimination, retaliation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Kei-Ai filed a demurrer to the 4th and 5th causes of action in the First Amended Cross-Complaint, arguing that the causes of action are defective and must be dismissed. The Reys opposed the demurrer, arguing that the causes of action should be allowed to proceed. The judge sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the Reys will not be able to re-file their causes of action with changes. The judge concluded that the conduct alleged in the 4th and 5th causes of action did not constitute the type of extreme and outrageous conduct necessary to support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
