I. BACKGROUND¿ 
¿ 
A. Factual¿ 
¿¿ 
On June 24, 2024, Plaintiffs, Christin Jesus Alegria
and Paola Jannette Chaname (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint, in
pro per, against Defendants, Hui Q. Wong, an individual, Wong Family Trust, a
Living Trust, and DOES 1 through 10. The complaint alleges causes of action
for: (1) Constructive Eviction; (2) Breach of Habitability; (3) Negligence; (4)
Breach of Quiet Enjoyment; (5) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress;
(6) Violation of State and Local Health and Safety Codes; and (7) Loss of Use. 
 
            On July 21, 2024, Defendant, Hui Q.
Wong, Trustee of the Wong Living Trust (erroneously sued as Hui Q. Wong, an
individual, Wong Family Trust, a Living Trust) (hereinafter “Defendant”)
propounded his first set of discovery on both of the Plaintiffs. On August 15,
2024, Plaintiffs responded in pro per with their responses. However, Defendant
argues that instead of properly answering the discovery, Plaintiffs objected to
each and every request/interrogatory.  Defendants thus filed motions to compel
further responses. 
 
            On December 3, 2024, this Court granted
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Plaintiffs’ Further Responses to Demand for
Production of Documents, Form Interrogatories, and Requests for Monetary
Sanctions in a lowered amount. This Court also DENIED Defendant’s Motion to
Compel Plaintiffs’ Further Responses to Requests for Admission. 
 
            Now, Plaintiffs file a Motion to
Reconsider this Court’s granting of the Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Defendant’s Demand for Production as well as this Court’s granting of
Defendant’s Request for Monetary Sanctions in the amount of $2,500. 
 
B. Procedural  
 
            On December 6, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
this Motion for Reconsideration. On December 13, 2024, Defendant filed an
opposition brief. To date, no reply brief has been filed. 
 
II. ANALYSIS ¿ 
¿ 
A.   
Legal Standard  
 
When a court granted or
denied a prior application for an order in whole or in part, the original party
making the application may make an additional application for the same order
when it based upon “new or different facts, circumstances, or law in which case
it shall be shown by affidavit what application was made before, when and to
what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1008(b).) If
a party fails to comply with Code of Civil Procedure § 1008(b), the court may
revoke or set aside on ex parte motion any order following the
application. (Id.)  If a change in law warrants
reconsideration of a prior order entered, the court may make a motion on its
own and enter a new order. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1008(c).) An application that
fails to comply with CCP § 1008 cannot be considered. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1008(e).) 
 
Section 1008 is “the
clear legislative intent to restrict motions to reconsider circumstances where
a party offers the court some fact or authority that was not previously
considered by it” and could not have been considered by it.¿ (Gilberd v. AC
Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.)¿ Section 1008 is the exclusive
means for modifying, amending or revoking an order.¿ That limitation is
expressly jurisdictional.”¿ (Id. at p. 1499.)¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
“The burden under
section 1008 is comparable to that of a party seeking a new trial on the ground
of newly discovered evidence: the information must be such that the moving
party could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced it at
the trial.”¿ (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 206, 212-13.)¿ There is a strict requirement or diligence on the
moving party; the moving party must present a satisfactory explanation for
failing to provide the evidence or different facts earlier.¿ (Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690.)¿
Evidence obtained after a is not ground for reconsideration where there was no
showing why evidence could not have been obtained earlier.¿ (Jones v. P.S.
Develop. Co., Inc. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 707, 725, overruled on other
grounds in Reid v. Google, Inc. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 512, 530 [discussing
evidence discovered after a hearing on a motion for summary judgment].)¿
 
B.   
Discussion

 
In their moving papers, Plaintiffs highlight that
they relied on Defense Counsel, Larry Rothman’s September 25, 2024
correspondence letter that granted them until October 18, 2024, to provide
verified responses to discovery requests. Thus, Plaintiffs contend that Larry
Rothman’s October 7, 2024 filing of the Motions to Compel Further were
premature. Moreover, Plaintiffs state that they complied with the October 18,
2024 deadline. 
 
In Defendant’s opposition brief, he asserts that
these “new” facts and/or circumstances, are not in fact new. Although
Plaintiffs’ untimely opposition brief was filed on the same day the Motions to
Compel Further were heard (supposedly because Plaintiffs claim to not have
known about this hearing until December 2, 2024), the Court nonetheless
considered the opposition brief in making its ruling. The Court agrees that
these facts do not constitute “new facts and/or circumstances” under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a). 
 
Here, although the Court acknowledges that
Plaintiffs relied on Defense Counsel’s correspondence, and believed they were
abiding by an extended deadline, the Court emphasizes that Defense Counsel had
no way of knowing this. In offering to extend the deadline to serve Plaintiffs’
responses, Defense Counsel also requested an extension of time to file the
Motions to Compel Further. Having received no response from Plaintiffs, Defense
Counsel abided by his deadline. 
 
 
III. CONCLUSION¿ 
 
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ Motion
for Reconsideration is DENIED. The Court’s December 3, 2024 order is to stand,
and Plaintiffs are required to provide verified further responses, without
objection, as well as the production of the responsive documents as to Defendant’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Demand for Production and Form
Interrogatories on or before December 31, 2024. Plaintiffs are also required to
pay Defense Counsel sanctions in the amount of $2,500 on or before December 31,
2024. 
 
            Defenant is ordered to give notice.
