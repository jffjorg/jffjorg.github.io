And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Larry Turner, has filed a motion to file a second amended complaint in his lawsuit against Elite Group Enterprise, LLC and David Joseph Tapia. The plaintiff seeks to add new causes of action and legal theories to the complaint, as well as correct errors in the existing complaint. However, the judge has denied the motion without prejudice because the plaintiff failed to comply with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324. Specifically, the plaintiff did not provide a supporting declaration that sets forth explicitly what allegations are to be added and where, and explicitly stating what new evidence was discovered warranting the amendment and why the amendment was not made earlier. The judge notes that the policy favoring amendment is strong, but that this policy should be applied only where no prejudice is shown to the adverse party. In this case, the plaintiff's failure to comply with the procedural requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, warrants denial of the motion.
