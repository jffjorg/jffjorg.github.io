And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a preliminary ruling on a case involving Yaco, the plaintiff. Despite Yaco's failure to file his objections separately as required, the judge has still considered them. However, the judge has criticized Yaco's evidence in opposition, citing that it does not comply with court rules. Specifically, the judge noted that Yaco's evidence is unclear and lacks a table of contents, making it difficult to understand what evidence supports his claims. The judge also pointed out that Yaco's evidence exceeds the 25-page limit for separate binding, making it unwieldy and difficult to review. The judge's tentative ruling sets the stage for a future court hearing, where these issues will likely be addressed further.
