[2] The Court ruled on
Plaintiff’s objections despite his failure to file his objections separately as
required by Rule of Court, rule 3.1354.
 


[3] Plaintiff’s evidence in
opposition does not comply with Rules of Court, rule 3.1350(f)(2), which
requires an “opposing party who contends that a fact is disputed” to  “state, on the right side of the page directly
opposite the fact in dispute, the nature of the dispute and describe the
evidence that supports the position that the fact is controverted” including “reference
to the exhibit, title, page, and line numbers.” Because of this, the Court is
left guessing what portion of Plaintiff’s cited evidence supports his claims. 
 
Plaintiff’s
evidence also doesn’t comply with Rules of Court, rule 3.1350(g), which
provides: “If evidence…in opposition to a motion exceeds 25 pages, the evidence
must be separately bound and must include a table of contents.” Here, Yaco
presents one long omnibus document with his Opposition containing three
declarations and purportedly supporting evidence. Yaco’s Memorandum ends on Pg.
11 of the PDF, but his evidence ends on Pg. 82. Yaco’s purported evidence,
therefore, spans 71 pages, nearly three times the upper limit of 25 pages.
