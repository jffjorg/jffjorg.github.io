```

The judge's tentative ruling is that the City's motion for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED without leave to amend, finding that the lawsuit is now moot given the expiration of the City Vaccine Mandate. The judge concludes that there is no longer a present actual controversy related to the expired Covid Vaccine Ordinance and that the City's motion is supported by the undisputed facts and the law. The judge notes that the Plaintiff's arguments that the City is still liable for past wrongs are speculative and conjectural, and that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated that the basis of the action is similarly not moot.
