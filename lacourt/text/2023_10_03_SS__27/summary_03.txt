The Judge has found that the plaintiff's counsel did not meet their burden to show that they did not counsel the discovery abuse, and therefore, sanctions are imposed against them.

The parties are ordered to provide the discovery responses and pay the sanctions within 30 days of the order.

**English Summary:**

Judge Bensinger's tentative ruling grants the City of Long Beach's motion to compel responses to discovery from Plaintiff Kajleb Demaniow. The City had sent discovery requests on June 8, 2023, with responses due by July 11, 2023, but Demaniow failed to respond. The ruling states that by not responding, Demaniow waived any objections to the requests. 

As a result of Demaniow's failure to comply, the court is imposing sanctions of $921 against Demaniow and his counsel. This is because Demaniow's counsel did not demonstrate they did not advise Demaniow to disregard the discovery requests, as required by case law.  


Demaniow is ordered to provide complete and unobjected-to responses to the discovery requests within 30 days.
