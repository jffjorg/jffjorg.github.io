And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the motions to compel responses to discovery filed by the defendant, City of Long Beach. The defendant had served the plaintiff, Kajleb Demaniow, with discovery requests on June 8, 2023, and the responses were due by July 11, 2023. However, the plaintiff failed to serve responses, and the defendant attempted to meet and confer with the plaintiff's counsel. The Judge has ordered the plaintiff to provide verified, objection-free responses to the defendant's Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents.

The Judge has also imposed sanctions against the plaintiff and his counsel in the amount of $921, representing 3 hours of defense counsel's hourly rate. The Judge has found that the plaintiff's counsel did not meet their burden to show that they did not counsel the discovery abuse, and therefore, sanctions are imposed against them.

The parties are ordered to provide the discovery responses and pay the sanctions within 30 days of the order.
