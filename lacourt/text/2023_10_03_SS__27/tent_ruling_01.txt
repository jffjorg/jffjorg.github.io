CASE:                                Babak Mobasser v. Joel Bond Deas, et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 21STCV15412
 





















 
MOTION
TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT



 
MOVING PARTY:                   Specially
Appearing Defendant Edmundo Gerardo Llamas
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On April 22, 2021, Plaintiff, Babak Mobasser, filed a form
complaint in pro per against Defendants, Joel Bond Deas and Edmundo Gerardo
Llamas (“Llamas”), for injuries arising from a motor vehicle collision.  Plaintiff filed a proof of service
purportedly showing Llamas was served with the summons and complaint by
substituted service on July 13, 2023.
 
On September 6, 2023, Llamas filed this motion to quash Plaintiff’s
service of the summons and complaint. 
 
The motion is unopposed.[1]
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
 
            Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10, subd. (a)(1), “[a] defendant, on or before
the last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the
court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one
or more of the following purposes: (1) To quash service of summons on the
ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”¿ When a
defendant moves to quash service of summons, the plaintiff has “the burden of
proving the facts that did give the court jurisdiction, that is the facts
requisite to an effective service.”  (Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245
Cal.App.2d 866, 868.)
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            Llamas argues the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over
him.  In support, Llamas points out that
the proof of service shows Llamas was purportedly served by substituted service
at 320 Florida Avenue NE, Apt. 412, Washington, D.C. by leaving the summons and
complaint with a female at the premises, Yasmin Noohi.  However, Llamas represents he does not reside
at that address nor is Ms. Noohi authorized to accept service on Llamas’s
behalf.  
 
            Llamas
demonstrates Plaintiff has not effected proper service of the summons and
complaint.  Accordingly, the motion to
quash is GRANTED.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The
unopposed motion to quash is granted.
 
            Moving
party to give notice, unless waived.
