[1] Unfortunately,
neither party submitted a copy of the criminal complaint or information (if one
has been filed).

Plaintiff’s opposition was filed and served electronically on September 15,
2023.  As such, the City contends
Plaintiff’s opposition is a day late.  However,
as the City was able to file a reply responding to the merits of Plaintiff’s
opposition, the City cannot, and does not, claim to have been prejudiced by the
late filing.  Accordingly, the Court
exercises its discretion to consider Plaintiff’s opposition.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300(d).)


[3]  Prosecutors often appear in camera and
file matters under seal when invoking the official information privilege.  In doing so, prosecutors identify how
disclosure of information may prejudice ongoing investigations or prosecutions and
how, on balance, disclosure is not in the public interest.  Often, such information includes identification
of other suspects or targets; danger to witnesses or informants; destruction of
evidence or flight from prosecution.  No such
showing was made in this case.

Moreover, Plaintiff has already stated he is amendable to delaying her
deposition or discovery and/or fashioning appropriate protective orders. 


[5] If the
City’s concern relates to inflammatory or gruesome photographs or information, the
City may seek relief from the Court.  And
to the extent any piece of evidence may warrant a protective order, Plaintiff
represents having offered on numerous occasions to enter a stipulated protective
order.  Plaintiff states the City has not
responded to Plaintiff’s offers.
