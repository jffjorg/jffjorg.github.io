```

And here is a summary in English text of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the unopposed motion to quash service of summons and complaint filed by Defendant Edmundo Gerardo Llamas. The motion argues that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Llamas because the proof of service shows that Llamas was served at an address where he does not reside and the person who accepted service is not authorized to accept service on his behalf. The Judge finds that Plaintiff has not demonstrated effective service and therefore grants the motion to quash. The motion is granted without opposition and the parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court indicating their intention to do so.
