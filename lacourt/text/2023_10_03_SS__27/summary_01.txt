The Judge finds that Plaintiff has not demonstrated effective service and therefore grants the motion to quash. The motion is granted without opposition and the parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court indicating their intention to do so.

## English Summary:

Judge Kerry Bensinger tentatively rules to grant Defendant Edmundo Gerardo Llamas's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint.  

The judge finds that Plaintiff Babak Mobasser did not properly serve Llamas. Plaintiff attempted service by leaving the documents with a woman named Yasmin Noohi at an address in Washington, D.C. However, Llamas states he doesn't live at that address and Ms. Noohi is not authorized to accept service on his behalf. Because proper service was not achieved, the judge lacks personal jurisdiction over Llamas.  

Unless either party objects, this tentative ruling will become the final order.
