MOTIONS
TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
City of Long Beach
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On August 29, 2023, Defendant, City of Long Beach, filed these
motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant’s first set of discovery,
including Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for
Production of Documents.  Defendant seek
sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel.
 
            The motions
are unopposed. 
 
II.           LEGAL STANDARD FOR COMPELLING RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY 
 
If a party to whom interrogatories and
inspection demands were directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order to compel responses without
objections.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b), 2031.300, subd. (b).)¿ Failure
to timely serve responses waives objections to the requests.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).)
 
Monetary Sanctions
¿¿¿ 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to impose
discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which includes
(without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without substantial
justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive
response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial justification
making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010.)  
 
If sanctions are
sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that the notice
specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought and the
type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points and
authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the amount
of any monetary sanction. 
 
If the court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made
or opposed a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or inspection
demands, the court “shall impose a monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c),
2031.300, subd. (c).)  
 
Sanctions against
counsel:¿ The court in Kwan Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings
(2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings) noted that discovery sanctions
against an attorney are governed by a different standard than sanctions against
a party:¿¿¿ 
 
By
the terms of the statute, a trial court under section 2023.030(a) may not
impose monetary sanctions against a party's attorney unless the court finds
that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct resulting in
sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions against
a party, which are based on the party's misuse of the discovery process,
monetary sanctions against the party's attorney require a finding the ‘attorney
advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the attorney's
actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986) 181
Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an attorney's
advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,” the attorney
has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery abuse. (Ibid.)
Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an attorney offers
sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the burden shifts to
the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend that conduct. (Id.
at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni, at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d
501.)
 
III.        DISCUSSION
            Defendant
served Plaintiff with the at-issue discovery requests on June 8, 2023.  Responses were due by July 11, 2023.  Having not received responses, Defendant
attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel.  However, to date, Plaintiff has not provided
responses.¿ (See Swift Decls.)¿ Therefore, all objections to the
interrogatories and demand for production are waived.¿¿ 
            As Defendant
properly served the discovery requests and Plaintiff failed to serve responses,
the Court finds Defendant is entitled to an order directing Plaintiff to
provide responses to Set One of Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents.¿ ¿Accordingly, the
motions are GRANTED.
 
            Monetary
Sanctions 
            Defendant
requests sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel.  Given that the
Court has granted these motions, sanctions are warranted.  Pursuant to Hennings,
supra, imposition of monetary sanctions against counsel is also proper
unless counsel shows that he or she did not counsel the discovery abuse.¿ (Hennings,
58 Cal.App.5th at p. 81.)¿¿ Plaintiff’s counsel does not meet their
burden.  Accordingly, sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff and his
counsel in the amount of $921 representing 3 hours of defense counsel’s hourly
rate. 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
The motions are granted. 
Plaintiff Kajleb Demaniow is ordered to provide verified, objection-free
responses to Defendant City of Long Beach’s Form Interrogatories, Set one,
Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production of Documents, Set
One.  
 
The request for sanctions is granted.  Plaintiff and his counsel are ordered to pay,
jointly and severally, sanctions in the amount of $921 to Defendant, by and
through their counsel.
 
Discovery responses are to be provided and sanctions are to
be paid within 30 days of this order.
 
Moving party to give notice.
