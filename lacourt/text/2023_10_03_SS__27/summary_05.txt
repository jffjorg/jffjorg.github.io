And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is based on the lack of information provided by the parties involved. The City claims that the Plaintiff's opposition was filed a day late, but since they were able to file a reply responding to the merits of the opposition, they do not claim to have been prejudiced. The Court exercises its discretion to consider the opposition.

The City also sought to invoke the official information privilege, but failed to provide any showing that disclosure of information would prejudice ongoing investigations or prosecutions. The Plaintiff is willing to delay deposition and/or discovery and/or fashion appropriate protective orders.

The City may seek relief from the Court if its concern relates to inflammatory or gruesome photographs or information, and the Plaintiff has offered to enter a stipulated protective order. However, the City has not responded to these offers.
