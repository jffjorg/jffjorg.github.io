And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant UBS Financial Services Inc.'s motion for an extension of time to file a responsive pleading to the complaint. The motion is deemed moot because the parties had previously agreed to extend the filing deadline, and the court had granted a joint stipulation extending the deadline to December 26, 2024. The judge notes that Defendant UBS has not responded to the complaint and that the motion is unnecessary. The case will proceed without further delay.
