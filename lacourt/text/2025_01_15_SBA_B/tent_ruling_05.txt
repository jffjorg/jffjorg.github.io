Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents
Plaintiff requests that the court compel defendant Honda to provide
a further response to plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One,
Nos. 8, 16, and 23-31.
On August 9, 2024, plaintiff served discovery requests.  (Gopstein Decl., ¶ 13; Exh. 3.)  On October 9, 2024, defendant served
responses. (Id., ¶ 14; Exh. 4.)  On or
about October 16, 2024, plaintiff’s counsel sent defendant’s counsel a letter
attempting to meet and confer regarding defendant’s responses. (Id., ¶ 16; Exh.
5.) On or about October 24, 2024, plaintiff’s counsel sent a second meet and confer
letter to defendant’s counsel. (Id., ¶ 17; Exh. 6.) To date, defendant has not
responded to plaintiff’s counsel’s meet and confer efforts. (Id., ¶ 21.)
Plaintiff notes that to date no documents have been produced, even as to
materials that Defendant indicated would be produced.
The parties are ordered to conduct a good faith meet and
confer to address the issues.  In
particular many of the responses are essentially riddles.  Defendant objects, and then indicates that “subject
to” the objections it will produce documents. 
But the objections purport to go to the entirety of the request.  Riddles are not acceptable.  There must be clarity in the responses.
If the parties are incapable of resolving all the issues,
the Court intends to conduct an Informal Discovery Conference.
The parties should immediately discuss and reach agreement
on a schedule for a detailed meet and confer and a potential Informal Discovery
Conference should that meet and confer fail to resolve all issues.
