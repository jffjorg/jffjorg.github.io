MANAGEMENT SERVICES, LLC, A DELAWARE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, et al.
Case No. 23TRCV00870
Ex Parte Application RE: BRIEFING SCHEDULE ON DEFENDANTS'
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, APPLICATION FOR ORDER
CONTINUING THE FILING DEADLINE FOR PLAINTIFFS' OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR SUMMARY
JUDGMENT
By this ex parte application Plaintiff desires clarification
on when his Opposition is due to the Defendant’s Motion for Summary
Judgment.  He seeks a determination that
the Opposition is due by January 21, 2025. 
This question arises as the motion was filed under the “old” law but is calendared
for hearing in 2025, when the new law arguably changed the Opposition due date.
The Court shall attempt to avoid resolving the burning
question of how to interpret the new statute as applied to a motion filed prior
to the operative date of the new statute. 
Instead, the Court asks that parties to discuss the briefing schedule and
provide the Court a solution that works for all concerned.
The present hearing in scheduled for February 4, 2025.  The jury trial is calendared for July 14,
2025.  The parties should be prepared to
suggest to the Court an acceptable Opposition date, Reply date and Hearing date
that will eliminate this issue.
