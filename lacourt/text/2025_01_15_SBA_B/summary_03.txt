And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in response to the plaintiff's ex parte application to clarify the briefing schedule for the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The motion was filed under the "old" law, but is scheduled for hearing in 2025, when the new law applies. The plaintiff seeks a determination that the opposition to the motion is due by January 21, 2025. The court has decided to avoid resolving the interpretation of the new statute and instead asks the parties to discuss and provide a solution that works for all concerned. The parties are expected to suggest an acceptable opposition date, reply date, and hearing date that will eliminate this issue. The court has scheduled a hearing for February 4, 2025, and the jury trial is set for July 14, 2025.
