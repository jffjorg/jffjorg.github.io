And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jonathan Cruz vs. City of Hermosa Beach and Hermosa Beach Police Department. The case involves a dispute over costs, with the plaintiff seeking to strike filing fees and deposition costs and the defendants seeking to recover those costs.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion in its entirety. The judge finds that the filing fees and deposition costs are reasonable and necessary to the conduct of the litigation. The judge notes that litigants must use electronic filing service providers to file documents electronically, and that the fees charged by those providers are reasonable. The judge also finds that the deposition costs are proper and necessary, despite the plaintiff's argument that they are excessive.

The judge has exercised its discretion to allow the messenger fees as a cost, finding that they are reasonable and necessary. The judge has also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the videotaping of depositions was unnecessary or unreasonable, finding that the deposition costs are properly itemized and that the plaintiff has not shown that the videotaping was not reasonably related to the litigation.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is in favor of the defendants, finding that their costs are reasonable and necessary. The ruling is subject to change after the parties have an opportunity to respond and the judge has considered those responses.
