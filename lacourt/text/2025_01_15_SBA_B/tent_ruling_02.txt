RULING
            The motion is GRANTED in part.
BACKGROUND
On December 8, 2022, plaintiff
Ibeth Jennifer Meza filed a complaint against American Honda Motor Company for
violations of statutory obligations under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act.
Trial commenced on July 17, 2024
and was held over several days.
On August 2, 2024, the jury found for
defendant and plaintiff recovered nothing.
Judgment was entered on August 23,
2024, in favor of defendant and against plaintiff. 
On September 12, 2024, defendant
filed a memorandum of costs seeking $25,424.98. 
On October 1, 2024, plaintiff filed
a motion to strike or tax defendant’s costs. 
On November 25, 2024, the court
continued the hearing on the instant motion, finding that defendant filed a
barebones 1 page Memorandum of Costs (Summary) seeking $25,424.98 as Costs
which merely provided amounts for the 16 categories of costs claimed. The court
ordered defendant to prepare and submit a Memorandum of Costs Worksheet on
MC-011, itemizing each cost and is ordered to attach in an organized manner
corresponding to each category a copy of each invoice or other documentary
evidence that defendant claims supports each item of cost claimed. The court
allowed plaintiff to file a pleading detailing plaintiff’s objections to the
various costs claimed and allowed defendant to file a reply to those
objections.
On December 23, 2024, defendant
filed a Memorandum of Costs supported by a worksheet on MC-010 with copies of various
invoices supporting the Memorandum of Costs.
LEGAL
AUTHORITY
“Except as otherwise expressly
provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs in any action or proceeding. This means that the prevailing party
is entitled to all of his costs unless another statute provides otherwise.
Absent such statutory authority, the court has no discretion to deny costs to
the prevailing party.” (Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111,
128-29 (citations and internal quotations omitted); CCP §1032(b) (“Except as
otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a
matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding”).) 
CCP §1033.5(c) states, in relevant
part: “Any award for costs shall be subject to the following: (1) Costs are
allowable if incurred, whether or not paid. (2) Allowable costs shall be
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation. (3) Allowable costs shall be
reasonable in amount. (4) Items not mentioned in this section . . . may be
allowed . . . in the Court’s discretion.”
“If the items appearing in a cost
bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax
costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if
the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of
proof is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Ladas v. California State
Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774 (citation omitted).) “The
court’s first determination, therefore, is whether the statute expressly allows
the particular item, and whether it appears proper on its face. If so, the
burden is on the objecting party to show them to be unnecessary or
unreasonable.” (Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal. App. 4th 111, 131
(citations omitted).) “[I]t is not enough for the losing party to attack
submitted costs by arguing that he thinks the costs were not necessary or
reasonable. Rather the losing party has the burden to present evidence and
prove that the claimed costs are not recoverable.” (Seever v. Copley Press,
Inc. (2006) 141 Cal. App. 4th 1550, 1557.)
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff requests that the court
strike defendant’s memorandum of costs or, in the alternative, strike Items 1
(filing and motion fees), 4 (deposition costs), 8 (witness fees), 11 (court
reporter fees), 12 (exhibits), and 14 (electronic filing and service fees).
 
Item 1: Filing and Motion Fees of
$64.20
Plaintiff argues that defendant
seeks to recover $64.20 for filing an ex parte application to continue
trial that was not reasonably necessary to the litigation as the primary reason
why AHM sought a trial continuance was because it refused to produce its Person
Most Qualified ("PMQ") for deposition prior to the trial date. Plaintiff
cites CCP § 1033.5(c)(2) which requires recoverable costs to be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation. 
Here, plaintiff does not proffer
sufficient evidence to establish that defendant filed the ex parte for
the sole reason of refusing to produce its PMQ and that the ex parte was
not reasonably necessary to the litigation. No doubt, few cases progress
perfectly. The filing fee was incurred and the Court deems it unnecessary to evaluate
the reason that the ex parte was necessary.
Thus, the motion to tax costs will
be DENIED as to defendant’s filing and motion fees. 
 
Item 4: deposition costs of $8,716.82
A prevailing party is entitled to
costs associated with “taking . . . and transcribing necessary depositions,
including an original and one copy of those taken by the claimant and one copy
of depositions taken by the party against whom costs are allowed.” (CCP
1033.2(a)(3)(A).)          
Plaintiff argues that at least
$2,954.85 must be taxed from defendant’s claimed deposition costs in this
matter because they are improper costs that defendant is not permitted to
recover. Plaintiff argues that AHM claims $1,354.65 related to its taking of a
completely unnecessary deposition of a witness, Juventina Meza. (See Worksheet,
Esquire Invoice 2824289.) Plaintiff contends that Defendant deposed Juventina
Meza knowing that the only thing she did was sign the purchase agreement with
her daughter, plaintiff. Juventina Meza was not included in the joint witness
list filed in this matter and was never called as a witness at trial. (Melton
Decl., ¶ 4.)  The Court rejects the claim
by plaintiff that the deposition was unnecessary. It was proper. The witness reasonably
could be understood to have relevant information.  Hindsight as to the value of the witness is
not the test that the Court should employ. 
Plaintiff has failed to provide any authority for the assertion that
only deposition costs for “necessary witnesses” are recoverable, or that a
witness must be called at trial for their deposition costs to be recoverable. In
reply, defendant establishes that Juventina Meza, plaintiff’s mother, was
listed as the primary buyer on the Retail Installment Sales Contract for the
subject vehicle. In light of this, defendant was entitled to depose her.
Plaintiff also argues that defendant
seeks an exorbitant $3,663.95 in total costs related to the deposition of plaintiff's
expert Darrell Blasjo as defendant paid $1,254.60 to expedite the deposition
transcript (Worksheet, Esquire Invoice # 2841497 "2-DAY EXPEDITE"),
and then paid another $337.15 to "reprint" that same deposition
twenty days later (Worksheet, Esquire Invoice # 2857438). Plaintiff argues that
the terms "taking" and "transcribing" cannot possibly be
interpreted to mean shipping, nor do they include a "reprint".
However, the court agrees that the
$1,254.60 for the “2-day expedite” on Darrell Blasjo’s transcript is excessive.
In reply, defendant provides no response as to why such an expense was
necessary. Nor does it appear that the “reprint” charge of $337.15 is
appropriate.
The
motion to tax costs will be GRANTED as to defendant’s $1,254.60 in costs for the “2-day expedite” fee for Darrell
Blasjo’s deposition transcript and the $337.15 reprint charge. 
 
Item 8: witness fees of $800
Recoverable costs include
“[o]rdinary witness fees pursuant to Section 68093 of the Government Code.” (CCP
§1033.5(a)(7).) Except as otherwise provided by law, witness' fees for each
day's actual attendance, when legally required to attend a civil action or
proceeding in the superior courts, are thirty-five ($35) a day and mileage
actually traveled both ways, twenty cents ($0.20) a mile. (Gov. Code §68093.) 
Plaintiff argues that defendant claims
$800.00 paid to plaintiff's expert, Darrell Blasjo, as "witness fees"
for appearing for his deposition but GOV §68093 applies to ordinary witness
fees, not expert witness compensation, which is governed by GOV §68092.5. Plaintiff
further argues that only fees of expert witnesses ordered by the court are
recoverable per CCP §1033.5(a)(8) such that AHM is not permitted to recover
expert fees in this matter.
Code
of Civil Procedure
§ 2034.450 required the defendant to pay plaintiff’s expert his normal charges
for the deposition.  That was a necessary
charge and will be allowed by the Court.
 
Item 11: court reporter fees of
$14,005.10 
Only court reporter fees “as
established by statute” are recoverable under CCP §1033.5(a)(11). Costs of
acquiring transcripts are not recoverable. (See CCP §1033.5(b)(5).) 
Plaintiff argues that defendant seeks
to recover costs to acquire rough transcripts, charges for real time
transcripts, and a "laptop/tablet rental" fee which are not
recoverable as court reporter fees. 
Plaintiff argues that defendant has
failed to demonstrate the legal basis for which it is entitled to recover court
reporter fees, and specifically which statute permits the recovery of court
reporter fees in this matter.
The Court shall disallow 
The Court GRANTS the motion as to
the deposition charges for a Laptop/ablet Rental ($100 x 3 = $300) and the late
cancellation fee of $2,200 as not necessary costs.
 
Item 12: photocopies of $176.84 
Photocopies of exhibits “may be
allowed if they were reasonably helpful to aid the trier of fact.” CCP
§1033.5(a)(13). Where exhibits were never presented to the trier of fact, such
costs are recoverable in the trial court's discretion under § 1033.5(c)(4). (Segal
v. ASICS America Corp. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 651, 668.) Under CCP § 1033.5
(c)(3), allowable costs awarded to the prevailing party shall be in a
reasonable amount.  
Plaintiff asserts that defendant
only admitted four exhibits at trial in this matter, and it is unclear whether
any of the costs reflected in that invoice relate to any of those four
exhibits. Thus, plaintiff argues, to the extent that defendant seeks recovery
of exhibits not presented to the trier of fact, the costs should be taxed. 
Plaintiff also asserts that defendant’s
efforts to recover $125.00 in delivery fees is an improper convenience fee as
this delivery fee is not a cost incurred to photocopy or prepare exhibits and
is not recoverable.
Thus, the motion to tax costs as to
these items is DENIED.
 
Item 14: fees for electronic filing
or service of $1163.90 
CCP §1033.5(14) allows for recovery
of “fees for electronic filing or service of documents through an electronic
filing service provider if a court requires or orders electronic filing or
service of documents.”  “Allowable costs
shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than
merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.” (CCP §1033.5(c)(2).)
“All documents are to be e-filed
prior to the hearing date. (Local Rule 3.4.) Courtesy copies are not required,
but may be provided.” (Torrance Department B Procedures, p. 1.) “FSC and
Pre-Trial Orders: The parties are to meet and confer at least 11 calendar days
prior to the FSC and both (1) e-file no later than the 7 court days prior to
the FSC and (2) deliver courtesy copies to the courtroom in 3-ring binders no
later than 7 court days prior to the FSC the following Trial documents...” (Id.,
p. 4.) 
Plaintiff asserts that defendant
improperly claims $985.00 in courtesy copy charges under the guise of
"electronic filing fees". Plaintiff’s counsel Shawna Melton declares
that Department B's procedures unequivocally state that for pretrial filings
and ex parte applications, "[c]ourtesy copies are not required."
(Melton Decl., Ex. 2.) 
In reply, defendant simply states
that “the filing and service fees are reasonable and were necessary in this
case because there were all necessitated by plaintiff’s pursuit of a legally
and factually meritless lawsuit.”
As Department B does not require
courtesy copies with the exception of trial documents, the court finds that one
fee of $125 is reasonable for the courtesy copy required for defendant’s trial
documents. The remaining $844.00 in courtesy copy charges is unreasonable. 
Thus, the motion to tax costs will
be GRANTED as to defendant’s $844.00 in fees for electronic filing or service.
 
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the court GRANTS
plaintiff’s motion in part.
The parties shall jointly submit an
order setting forth the amount of costs that are awarded by the court.  It need not recite any details, merely the total
amount of costs awarded to defendant by the Court.
