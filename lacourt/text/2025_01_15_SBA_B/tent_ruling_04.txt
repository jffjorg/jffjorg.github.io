Motion
for Extension of Time to File Responsive Pleading to Complaint 
            The court considered the moving
papers. 
RULING
            The motion is DENIED AS MOOT. 
BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff Grace Kelley Teren
(“Plaintiff”) filed her complaint against Defendants Elliot Glenn Teren (“ET),
UBS Financial Services Inc. (“UBS”), Darren Mark Teren (“DT”) and Does 1-10
(collectively, “Defendants”) on March 13, 2024. UBS was served on or after
October 11, 2024. UBS has not responded.
            On November 1, 2024, the parties
agreed to a 15-day extension of time for UBS to respond to the Complaint
pursuant to California Rules of Court 3.110(d). UBS’s new deadline to file its
responsive pleading was extended until November 25, 2024.
            On December 20, 2024, Plaintiff and
Defendant UBS filed a joint stipulation to further extend time for Defendant
UBS to respond to Plaintiff’s complaint. The Court granted the stipulation and
declared that UBS’s last day to file its responsive pleading was extended from
November 25, 2024, to December 26, 2024.     
LEGAL AUTHORITY
            Code of Civil Procedure Section
1054(a) provides that, “upon good cause shown,” the Court may extend the time
for a party to respond to any pleading by up to 30 days without consent from
the adverse party.
DISCUSSION
            Defendant
UBS requests a 30-day extension of its deadline to answer or otherwise respond
to Plaintiff’s Complaint. Specifically, Defendant requests to have its deadline
moved from November
25, 2024, to December 26, 2024. 
            On December 20, 2024, Plaintiff and
Defendant UBS filed a joint stipulation, which the Court granted, extending the
deadline from November 25, 2024, to December 26, 2024.
            Therefore, the instant motion is
MOOT. 
ORDER
            The motion is DENIED AS MOOT.
            Moving
party is ordered to give notice of ruling.
