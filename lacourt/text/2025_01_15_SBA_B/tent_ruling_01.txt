RULING
            The motion is DENIED in its entirety.
BACKGROUND
            On October 21, 2022, plaintiff
Jonathan Cruz filed a complaint against City of Hermosa Beach and Hermosa Beach
Police Department for the following causes of action: (1) violation of Public
Safety Officers Procedural Bill of Rights Act; (2) declaratory relief; and (3) violation
of Labor Code § 1102.5. On April 13, 2023, plaintiff amended the complaint and
maintained the same causes of action. Plaintiff is a former police officer for
the City of Hermosa Beach. The city separated plaintiff from employment after
determining, through an interactive religious accommodation process, that plaintiff
was not entitled to an exemption from the city’s mandatory COVID-19 vaccination
policy. The plaintiff forfeited his employment rather than comply with the city’s
policy.
            On April 25, 2024, the defendants
moved for summary judgment. On September 17, 2024, the court found in favor of the
defendants. On October 9, 2024, the court entered judgment. 
            On October 14, 2024, the defendants
filed a memorandum of costs. On October 29, 2024, the plaintiff filed a motion
to tax costs. 
LEGAL AUTHORITY
A prevailing party in litigation
may recover costs, including but not limited to filing fees. CCP § 1033.5,
subd. (a)(1).  Under CCP § 1033.5,
subdivision (c)(2), allowable costs are only recoverable if they are
“reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.” Even mandatory costs,
when incurred unnecessarily, are subject to section 1033, subdivision (c)(2). Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS
Enterprises (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 245.
The memorandum of cost is a
verified statement by the party, attorney, or agent that the costs are correct
and were necessarily incurred in the case. Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(a)(1). If the items on a verified cost bill appear proper charges, they
are prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed therein
were necessarily incurred. Oak Grove
School Dist. v. City Title Ins. Co. (1963) 217 Cal.App.2d 678, 698 (Oak
Grove). “The trial court’s first determination is whether the statute
expressly allows the particular item and whether it appears proper on its face;
if so, the burden is on the objecting party to show the costs to be unnecessary
or unreasonable.” Foothill-DeAnza
Community College Dist. v. Emerich (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 11, 29 (Foothill-DeAnza). The burden of showing
that an item is not properly chargeable or is unreasonable is upon the party
challenging the costs. Wilson v. Nichols
(1942) 55 Cal.App.2d 678, 682-683 (Wilson).
Where the items are properly
objected to, they are put at issue, and the burden of proof is on the party
claiming them as costs. Oak Grove, supra,
217 Cal.App.2d at p. 698. In other words, the burden is initially on the
objecting party to show that the costs are not proper on their face. Then, the
burden shifts to the moving party to justify its costs and expenses. If the
costs are not facially proper, that is, the costs are not expressly allowed
under a statute, then the moving party must justify the requests for the
expenses. 
CCP § 1033.5, states: “[a]n item
not specifically allowable under subdivision (a) nor prohibited under
subdivision (b) may nevertheless be recoverable in the discretion of the court
if ‘reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient
or beneficial to its preparation.’” Ladas
v. Calif. State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774 (Ladas).
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
moves to strike the filing fees and deposition costs.
Filing Fees
            Filing and motion fees are allowable as costs. CCP, §
1033.5, subd. (a)(1).
The
requests for filing fees appear proper. Thus, the burden shifts to moving party
to prove otherwise. 
Moving
party argues that the requested amounts include costs that are not filing fees
or motion fees; the cost worksheet does not identify a single motion for which
a motion fee was paid; and there are large amounts of messenger fees and
duplicate costs for filing, which were done electronically. Moving party
further argues that the fees appear to be for electronic processing. 
Regarding
the items identified as filing fees, the court disagrees with Plaintiff. First,
litigants must use electronic filing service providers to file their documents
electronically, and the court mandates electronic filing. The electronic filing
service providers can charge fees independent of the filing fees charged by the
court, which may be electronic processing fees. Such expenses are
reasonable.  Second, there is no
requirement that the litigant identify the motions for which a motion fee was paid.
Further, the litigant does not argue why a specific filing or filings may be
unrelated to any motion.
The Court
chooses to exercise its discretion and allow the messenger fees as a cost.  Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th
111, 132.
Deposition Costs 
CCP § 1033.5, subdivision (a)
includes as allowable costs those involved in “(3) Taking, videotaping, and
transcribing necessary depositions including an original and one copy of those
taken by the claimant and one copy of depositions taken by the party against
whom costs are allowed, and travel expenses to attend depositions.” Gorman v. Tassajara Dev. Corp. (2009)
178 Cal.App.4th 44, 71-72. Costs for videotaping depositions were allowed as
being necessary and reasonable under the circumstances. See Seever v. Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557.
On their fact, the deposition costs
appear proper. Thus, the burden shifts to the moving party to prove otherwise. 
Moving party argues that the
deposition costs appear excessive because defendants seek $3,374.72 for
plaintiff’s deposition and $870.00 for the other two depositions. Moving party
also argues that defendants have not established that the videotaping of
Plaintiff’s depositions were reasonably related to the litigation. Contrary to
what moving party claims, it is moving party’s burden on this motion to explain
that the videotaping was unnecessary or unreasonable.
The Court rejects the arguments. All
the deposition costs are allowed.
ORDER
            The
motion is DENIED in its entirety.
