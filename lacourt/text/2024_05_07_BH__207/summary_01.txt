And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motions filed by Duncan J. McCreary, counsel for the defendants, to be relieved as counsel. The motion is unopposed and the court finds that it complies with the rules of professional conduct and the California rules of court. The conflict of interest between the attorney and client is so serious that it renders it unreasonably difficult for the attorney to carry out the representation effectively. Therefore, the court grants the motion and orders the attorney to serve the signed orders on the clients and all other parties who have appeared in the action, and to file proofs of service within 10 days.
