OPPOSING PARTY


Plaintiff Buddy Chan



 
Plaintiff Buddy Chan (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants
Millbrook Kitchens, Inc. and Michael Navi (collectively, “Defendants”) for 1)
Breach of Contract; 2) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing; 3) Intentional Misrepresentation; 4) Negligent Misrepresentation; 5)
Professional Negligence; 6) Violation of Business and Professions Code § 17200.    
 
Defendant Michael Navi (“Navi”) moves the Court for orders compelling Plaintiff
to serve further responses to the following discovery requests:

·      
Motion Filed: 
                                          March
27, 2024
 
            Plaintiff has filed oppositions to
the motions and Navi replies.  
 
Procedural
Requirements
 
1.    
Timeliness
of Motions 
 
            A notice of motion to compel further
responses must be “given within 45 days of the service of the verified response,
or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date
to which” the parties have agreed in writing.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c),
2031.310, subd. (c), 2033.290, subd. (c).)  Failure to file such a motion within this time
period constitutes a waiver of any right to compel further responses.  (Ibid.)

 
Here, Navi filed the motions on the date set forth above.  Although Plaintiff does not squarely contend
that the motions are untimely, he, in opposing the imposition of monetary
sanctions, implies that the motions are untimely (see Oppositions, p. 4).  
 
However, Navi is correct that the motions are timely as the last
further supplemental responses to the subject discovery requests were served by
Plaintiff electronically on February 9, 2024. 
Thus, the Court finds that the last day to file motions to compel
further responses under the Discovery Act was March 27, 2024 (45 calendar days
+ 2 court days for electronic service).      
 
2.    
Meet and
Confer
 
            A motion to compel must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2016.040.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300,
subd. (b)(1), 2031.310, subd. (b)(2), 2033.290, subd. (b)(1).)  A meet and confer declaration must state
facts showing a reasonable and good-faith attempt at an informal resolution of
each issue presented in the motion.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  
 
            “The Discovery Act requires that,
prior to the initiation of a motion to compel, the moving party declare that he
or she has made a serious attempt to obtain an informal resolution of each
issue. This rule is designed to encourage the parties to work out their
differences informally so as to avoid the necessity of a formal order.  . . . 
This, in turn, will lessen the burden on the court and reduce the
unnecessary expenditure of resources by litigants through promotion of
informal, extrajudicial resolution of discovery disputes.”  (Townsend
v. Superior Court (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1431, 1434-1435 [cleaned  up].)  To
comply, “a reasonable and good-faith attempt at informal resolution entails
something more than bickering with [opposing counsel].  Rather, the law requires that counsel attempt
to talk the matter over, compare their views, consult, and deliberate.”  (Id.
at p. 1439; see also Clement v. Alegre (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1294
[to satisfy the attempt at informal resolution required in section 2016.040
opposing parties must do more than try to persuade each other of their
errors].)  In short, the Discovery Act
“requires that there be a serious effort at negotiation and informal
resolution.”  (Townsend v. Superior Court, supra, 61 Cal.App.4th at p. 1438.)
 
            To that end, trial courts are
entrusted with discretion and judgment to determine the necessary effort
required to satisfy the requirement of an informal resolution. (Obregon v.
Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 433.)  In determining if parties have satisfied Section
2016.040, judges may consider “the history of the litigation, the nature of the
interaction between counsel, the nature of the issues, the type and scope of
discovery requested, the prospects for success and other similar factors can be
relevant.” (Id. at pp. 431-432 [holding that the trial court was correct
in determining that sending a letter with oppositions was an insufficient
attempt at an informal resolution].)  In
sum, meet and confer efforts should go beyond merely sending letters to each
other stating each party’s respective positions. 
 
            Here, as set forth in the
Declarations of Rafi Moghadam (“Moghadam”), counsel for Navi, Navi asserts he engaged
in a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of the issues
presented in the motions.  (See
Declarations of Rafi Moghadam, ¶ 6.)  In
particular, Moghadam sent an initial meet and confer letter to Plaintiff on or
about November 1, 2023, and sent further meet and confer letters to Plaintiff
on or about November 29, 2023 and March 20, 2024.  In addition to the meet and confer letters, Plaintiff
and Navi engaged in efforts to informally resolve the subject discovery
disputes by email and telephonic communications.  (See Declarations of Rafi Moghadam, ¶¶ 6, 12,
Exhibits F.)   
 
            Plaintiff contends that Navi failed
to meet and confer in good faith by sending the March 20, 2024 correspondence, with
a response date of March 22 and within days of the motion deadlines.  (See Declarations of Darryl A. Meigs, ¶¶ 9-12.)  Yet Plaintiff fails to account for the prior
efforts the parties engaged in to resolve the discovery issues commencing in
November 2023 and culminating in Plaintiff failing to extend Navi’s deadline to
file the instant motions.  (Id. at
Exhibits B.)    
 
            Upon consideration of the
declarations of counsel for Plaintiff and Navi, the Court finds that Navi has attempted
in good faith to informally resolve the discovery issues with Plaintiff before
filing the motions as required by the Discovery Act.       
 
3.    
Separate
Statement 
 
            California Rules of Court, rule
3.1345 requires that any motion involving the content of discovery contain a
separate statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement
of factual and legal reasons for why an order compelling further responses is
warranted.  
 
            Here, Navi filed separate statements
related to the motions which complies with Rule 3.1345.
 
Analysis
            
1.    
DISCOVERY – GENERAL PRINCIPLES
 
            “Unless otherwise limited by order
of the court in accordance with this title, any party may obtain discovery
regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in
that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.)  
 
            “The purpose of the discovery rules
is to enhance the truth-seeking function of the litigation process and
eliminate trial strategies that focus on gamesmanship and surprise.  In other words, the discovery process is
designed to make a trial less a game of blindman's bluff and more a fair
contest with the basic issues and facts disclosed to the fullest practicable
extent.”  (Juarez v. Boy Scouts of Am., Inc. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 377, 389
[cleaned up].)   
 
            Where a party objects, or responds
inadequately, to discovery requests, a motion lies to compel further responses,
and that party has the burden to justify the objections or inadequate responses.
(Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255; Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (a) [motion to
compel further responses lies “[o]n receipt of a response to interrogatories”],
2031.310, subd. (a) [motion to compel further responses lies “[o]n receipt of a
response to a demand for inspection”], 2033.290, subd. (a) [motion to compel
further responses lies “[o]n receipt of a response to requests for admissions”].)
 Further, “a trial court's determination
of a motion to compel discovery is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  However, when the facts asserted in support
of and in opposition to the motion are in conflict, the trial court's factual
findings will be upheld if they are supported by substantial evidence.” (Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court
(2009) 47 Cal.4th 725, 733 [cleaned up].) 
 
            With
respect to interrogatories, the Discovery Act requires as follows:  
            
Each answer in a response to interrogatories
shall be as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably
available to the responding party permits. 
If an interrogatory cannot be answered completely, it shall be answered
to the extent possible.  If the
responding party does not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully
to an interrogatory, that party shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and
good faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other natural persons
or organizations, except where the information is equally available to the
propounding party.  
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220, subds.
(a)-(c).)  Similarly, regarding requests
for production of documents or other items, the Discovery Act provides as
follows:
 
The party to whom a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling has been directed shall respond separately to
each item or category of item by any of the following:  (1) A statement that the party will comply
with the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling by the
date set for the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling pursuant to
paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 2031.030 and any related
activities.  (2) A representation that
the party lacks the ability to comply with the demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling of a particular item or category of item.  (3) An objection to the particular demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.210, subd. (a).)  “A
representation of inability to comply with the particular demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm that a diligent search
and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that demand.
This statement shall also specify whether the inability to comply is because
the particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been
lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the
possession, custody, or control of the responding party. The statement shall
set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization known or
believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that item or
category of item.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.230.)
 
            Further,
regarding requests for admission, the Discovery Act provides as follows:
 
(a) Each answer in a response to requests for
admission shall be as complete and straightforward as the information
reasonably available to the responding party permits.
(b) Each answer shall: (1) Admit so much of the
matter involved in the request as is true, either as expressed in the request
itself or as reasonably and clearly qualified by the responding party. (2) Deny
so much of the matter involved in the request as is untrue.  (3) Specify so much of the matter involved in
the request as to the truth of which the responding party lacks sufficient
information or knowledge.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.220, subds.
(a)-(b).)  And “[i]f a responding party
gives lack of information or knowledge as a reason for a failure to admit all
or part of a request for admission, that party shall state in the answer that a
reasonable inquiry concerning the matter in the particular request has been
made, and that the information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to
enable that party to admit the matter.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.220, subd. (c).)  
 
2.     OBJECTIONS
– PLAINTIFF
 
a.    
      BURDENSOME
 
            “The
objection based upon burden must be sustained by evidence showing the quantum
of work required, while to support an objection of oppression there must be
some showing either of an intent to create an unreasonable burden or that the
ultimate effect of the burden is incommensurate with the result sought.”  (West Pico Furniture Co. v. Superior Court
(1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.)  The
California Supreme Court further noted that 
“[s]ome burden is inherent in all demands for discovery.  The objection of burden is valid only when
that burden is demonstrated to result in injustice.” (Id. at p.
418.)   
 
b.    
RIGHT TO PRIVACY
 
            “The
state Constitution expressly grants Californians a right of privacy.  Protection of informational privacy is the
provision’s central concern.  .  . 
.  The party asserting a privacy
right must establish a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively
reasonable expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened
intrusion that is serious.[1]  The party seeking information may raise in
response whatever legitimate and important countervailing interests disclosure
serves, while the party seeking protection may identify feasible alternatives
that serve the same interests or protective measures that would diminish the
loss of privacy.  A court must then
balance these competing considerations.” 
(Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552 [cleaned
up].)


            “Legally
recognized privacy interests [include] interests in precluding the
dissemination or misuse of sensitive and confidential information
(‘informational privacy’) .  .  . 
.”  (Hill v. National
Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 35.)  “A particular class of information is
[sensitive or confidential] when well-established social norms recognize the
need to maximize individual control over its dissemination and use to prevent
unjustified embarrassment or indignity.” 
(Ibid.)  
 
c.     
ATORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE
 
            Per Evidence Code section 954,
“[t]he client, whether or not a party, has a privilege to refuse to disclose,
and to prevent another from disclosing, a confidential communication between
client and lawyer if the privilege is claimed by:  (a) The holder of the privilege; (b) A person
who is authorized to claim the privilege by the holder of the privilege; or (c)
The person who was the lawyer at the time of the confidential communication,
but such person may not claim the privilege if there is no holder of the
privilege in existence or if he is otherwise instructed by a person authorized
to permit disclosure.”  (Evid. Code, §
954.)  And “while attorney-client
communications are presumed to be confidential, the party claiming the
attorney-client privilege as a bar to disclosure has the burden of showing that
the communication sought to be suppressed falls within the parameters of the
privilege.”  (Scripps Health v.
Superior Court (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 529, 533 [cleaned up].)
            
d.     ATTORNEY
WORK PRODUCT DOCTRINE
 
            The attorney work product doctrine
is codified under Code of Civil Procedure section 2018.010 et seq.  It is the policy of the state to do both of
the following:
 
(a) Preserve the rights of attorneys to prepare
cases for trial with that degree of privacy necessary to encourage them to
prepare their cases thoroughly and to investigate not only the favorable but
the unfavorable aspects of those cases.
 
(b) Prevent attorneys from taking undue advantage
of their adversary's industry and efforts.
 
(a) A writing that reflects an attorney's
impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories is not
discoverable under any circumstances.
 
(b) The work product of an attorney, other than a
writing described in subdivision (a), is not discoverable unless the court
determines that denial of discovery will unfairly prejudice the party seeking
discovery in preparing that party's claim or defense or will result in an
injustice.
 
(See
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2018.020, 2018.030.) 
“Absolute protection is afforded to writings that reflect an attorney’s
impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories.  All other work product receives qualified
protection; such material is not discoverable unless the court determines that
denial of discovery will unfairly prejudice the party seeking discovery in
preparing that party’s claim or defense or will result in an injustice.”  (Coito v. Superior Court (2012) 54
Cal.4th 480, 485 [cleaned up].)  Also attorneys
are the holders of the “work product privilege.”  (See Curtis v. Superior Court (2021)
62 Cal.App.5th 453, 468 [“The work product privilege is held by the attorney,
not the client”].)  
 
            In opposing the motions, Plaintiff has
the initial burden to establish that the information or documents responsive to
the SROG, RFP or RFA are privileged or the work products of counsel, or invades
Plaintiff’s, or other third-parties’, right to privacy, warranting protection
from disclosure.  Foremost, Plaintiff has
not produced a privilege log which identifies  responsive documents that are being withheld
because of the attorney-client privilege, attorney-work product doctrine or
right to privacy.  Equally important, in the
oppositions, Plaintiff has failed to proffer sufficient, competent evidence to
establish that the attorney-work product doctrine, attorney-client privilege or
right to privacy thwarts Navi’s efforts to obtain information or documents
responsive to the SROG, RFP and RFA. 
 
            In
addition, with respect to the burdensome objection, the Court finds that Plaintiff
has failed to provide sufficient, competent evidence to establish the quantum
of work required.  As such, without the
requisite proof, Plaintiff cannot rely upon the burdensome objection.  
 
            In short, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s
objections on the grounds of burdensome, right to privacy, attorney-client
privilege and attorney-work product doctrine are unsubstantiated.  Nevertheless, turning to the issue of whether
Plaintiff has provided code compliant responses to the SROG, RFP and RFA, in
conjunction with Plaintiff’s other objections, the Court rules as set forth
below.

c.      REQURSTS
FOR ADMISSION
 
·      
RFA No. 8: 
         GRANTED
 
Sanctions
            
A trial court may sanction a party for engaging in the misuse of
discovery, which includes:  failure to
respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery; making an evasive
response to discovery; making, without substantial justification, an
unmeritorious objection to discovery; and making or opposing, unsuccessfully
and without substantial justification, a motion to compel or to limit
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.) 
 
            In addition, Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.300, subdivision (d) provides: “The court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(See also Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310, subd. (h), 2033.290, subd.
(d).)  
            Here,
Navi seeks monetary sanctions in connection with the motions based upon Plaintiff’s
failure to provide complete, substantive responses to the subject discovery
requests.  The Court finds Plaintiff’s
failure, in part, to provide code compliant responses to be an abuse of the
discovery process, warranting monetary sanctions.  
            
Accordingly, the Court will impose
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and counsel for Plaintiff, Stone &
Sallus, LLP,  in the amount of $2120.00 which
represents four hours of attorney time to prepare the moving and reply papers, and
attend the hearing, at $500.00 per hour, plus filing fees of $120.00 at $60.00
per motion regarding the SROG and RFA only.
CONCLUSION AND ORDERS
 
Therefore, the Court grants in part Navi’s motion to compel further
responses to the SROG per Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300, and grants
Navi’s motion to compel further responses to the RFA per Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.290.  Likewise,
the Court orders Plaintiff to serve further verified, code compliant responses
to the SROG and RFA, as noted above, within 20 days of notice of the Court’s
orders.
 
Further, the Court denies
Navi’s motion to compel further responses to the RFP.  
 
Further, the Court orders Plaintiff
and counsel for Plaintiff, Stone & Sallus, LLP, jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $2120.00
