The court has also ruled that the statute of limitations for a quiet title action has not run, as the plaintiff is still in possession of the property. Additionally, the court has ruled that the unjust enrichment claim is not barred by the statute of limitations, as the breach of the oral agreement occurred within two years of the filing of the complaint. The court has also rejected the defendant's defense of laches, as the application of the doctrine is a factual question that cannot be resolved at the demurrer stage.

Finally, the court has rejected the defendant's argument under the sham pleading doctrine, as the defendant failed to demonstrate inconsistencies between the prior and amended pleadings.
