Case Name:                Markland
v. Miller  
Case No.:                    23STCV09687
Motion:                       Demurrer

Moving Party:             Defendant Delroy Miller, individually and as trustee of the Delroy
F. Miller and Crystal E Wright Family Trust

Opposing Party:          Plaintiffs
Norman Markland and Maise Markland

Tentative Ruling:      The
Demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint is overruled.

             
            This is an action for quiet title.
Plaintiffs Norman and Maisie Markland (Plaintiffs) allege that they entered
into an agreement wherein Eunice Miller (Eunice) (Defendant Delory Miller’s
mother) and Defendant Delroy Miller agreed that the Plaintiffs would give
Eunice the money for the down payment to purchase real property (a residential
home) located at 1502 West 85th Street, Los Angeles, California (Property) and
money for all expenses related to the property; in exchange, Defendant Delroy
would take legal title on the Property until Plaintiffs became legal residents
of the United States. At that time, Defendant Delroy would transfer legal title
of the Property to the Plaintiffs. 
 
On May 1, 2023,
Plaintiffs filed a Complaint. On August 10, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a First
Amended Complaint alleging causes of action for (1.)
quiet title, (2.) unjust enrichment, (3.) resulting trust, (4.) constructive
trust, (5.) injunctive relief, and (6.) declaratory relief. 

 
Defendant Delroy
Miller demurred to each of the six causes of action in the First Amended Complaint.
The Court sustained the demurrer in its entirety with leave to amend. 
 
On December 1,
2023, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint alleging causes of action for
(1.) quiet title, (2.) unjust enrichment, and (3.) declaratory relief. 
 
Defendant Delroy
Miller now demurs to each cause of action in the Second Amended Complaint.
Plaintiffs oppose the demurrer.
 
The demurrer is
overruled. 
 
Defendant’s
request for judicial notice is granted. (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).)
 
Demurrer
 
            A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency
of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v. Harvey (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose
of determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a
view to substantial justice between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The
court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly
pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . ..” ’
” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  
 
Analysis 
            
Defendant
demurs to the SAC on the grounds that the SAC fails to state a claim and is
barred by the statute of limitations, laches, and the statute of frauds.
 
First Cause
of Action for Quiet Title:
 
            With respect to this cause of
action, Defendant largely repeats the arguments made on demurrer to the FAC,
including Defendant’s unsuccessful arguments. 
 
            First, the only grounds that the
Court sustained the demurrer to quiet title previously was based on Plaintiff’s
failure to specifically plead the factual elements pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 761.020. That is, the FAC failed to identify the date as of
which the determination was sought and the FAC was unverified.
 
            The SAC remedied this defect. (SAC
¶¶ 1, 37, see also attached Verifications.) 
 
            Defendant again argues that Plaintiff
is not the legal owner and therefore cannot assert a claim against the legal
owner, Defendant Miller, under a quiet title claim. The Court rejected this
argument on the demurrer to the FAC after finding that the FAC adequately alleged
that Defendant Miller “acquired only bare legal title which [he] held
as constructive trustee for [Plaintiffs], who, based on the equities, held
superior title. (Warren v. Merrill (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 96, 114.)
Thus, this argument failed on the demurrer to the FAC and fails again on the
SAC, which contains a similar allegation. (See SAC ¶ 38.) 
 
Additionally,
Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’ claim for quiet title is barred by the
applicable statute of limitations.
 
            The Court previously rejected the
statute of limitations argument. Nonetheless, Defendant again argues that this
claim is subject to the statute of limitations for an oral contract.  
 
            A quiet title cause of action
generally has two elements: (1) “the plaintiff is the owner and in possession
of the land,” and (2) “the defendant claims an interest therein adverse to [the
plaintiff].” (South Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d
725, 740; see West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th
780, 802–803; Code Civ. Proc., § 761.020.)
            “[Q]uiet title actions have special rules for when
the limitations period begins to run.” (Salazar v. Thomas (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 467, 477.) “ ‘ “[A]s a general rule, the statute of limitations
[for a quiet title action] does not run against one in possession of land.” ’
[Citation.] Part of the rationale for this special rule for quiet title actions
is an unwillingness to convert a statute of limitations into a statute that
works a forfeiture of property rights on the person holding the most obvious
and important property right – namely, possession.” (Ibid.) 
            Further, under well-established law, “A vendee who has
fully performed his part of a contract of sale is the beneficiary of a trust in
the legal title, which is held for him by the vendor; and the statute of
limitations does not run against a cause of action specifically to enforce the
contract until such trust is clearly and unequivocally repudiated by the
vendor.” (Kidd v. Kidd (1964) 61 Cal.2d 479, 481.) A repudiation
requires more than the vendor’s refusal to convey title to the property; where
the vendee is in actual possession of the property, no repudiation by the
vendor is effective unless it includes the vendor's actual taking possession of
the property. (Kidd, supra, at p. 481; Peixouto v. Peixouto
(1919) 40 Cal.App. 782, 788 [statute of limitations will not commence to run
“so long as the purchaser is in possession”]; see also Muktarian v. Barmby
(1965) 63 Cal.2d 558, 560 [“no statute of limitations runs against a
plaintiff seeking to quiet title while he is in possession of the property”
(fn. omitted, emphasis added) ]; Smith v. Matthews (1889) 81 Cal. 120,
121 [right of purchasers and their successors to have quiet title was not and
could not be barred while they “remained in the actual possession of the land,
claiming to be the owners thereof, and the actual owners, as against the defendant,
of all interest therein except the mere naked title”]; see Ankoanda v.
Walker–Smith (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 610, 616–617 [dictum acknowledging
rule].)
            Here, the SAC alleges actions suggesting repudiation sometime
around June 2021. (SAC ¶¶ 7-8, 30.) The Complaint was filed on May 1, 2023. Thus,
the statute of limitations has not run on this claim. (See e.g., Novak v.
Novak (1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 438, 443.) 
            The demurrer to the first cause of action is overruled. 
Second Cause of Action for Unjust Enrichment:     
 
Defendant
also argues that unjust enrichment is not a cause of action but a legal remedy.
The Court previously addressed and rejected this argument. The Court also found
that the FAC adequately stated a claim for unjust enrichment: Plaintiffs paid
for the Property and its expenses but Defendants received the benefit of title
to this Property. (FAC ¶¶ 15-32.)  
 
Defendant
also argues the unjust enrichment cause of action fails under the statute of
limitations. The Court previously found merit to this argument. 
The statute
of limitations for a claim for unjust enrichment depends on the underlying
theory on which recovery is sought. (Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Dintino
(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 333, 348.) Here, the claim arises from an oral
agreement, which is a two year period. (Code Civ. Proc., § 339.) Further, the
statute of limitations for claim for unjust enrichment is subject to the
delayed discovery rule. (Id., 350 [“We must determine when Bank
actually, or reasonably should have, discovered its mistake that resulted in
the unjust enrichment of Dintino”].) Under this rule, “[a] limitations period
... accrues no later than the time the plaintiff learns the facts essential to
a particular cause of action. [Citations.]” (Bernson v. Browning–Ferris
Industries (1994) 7 Cal.4th 926, 941.) 
However,
on this pleading, as noted above, the SAC alleges facts suggesting a breach to any
alleged oral agreement occurred on or around June 2021. This breach was within
two years of the filing of the Complaint on May 1, 2023. The demurrer to the
second cause of action is overruled. 
 
Third Cause
of Action for Declaratory Relief:
 
Defendant
also demurs to the third cause of action arguing that the injunctive relief is
an equitable remedy. (Dem., 10:9-18.) The SAC’s third cause of action is for declaratory
relief. Therefore, the demurrer to this cause of action is not well taken. 
 
Laches:
 
            Finally,
Defendant argues the claims are all barred by the doctrine of laches. 
 
To prevail, the defendant must show (1)
unreasonable delay; and (2) “ ‘ “either acquiescence in the act about which
plaintiff complains or prejudice to the defendant resulting from the delay.”
[Citation.]’ ” (Highland Springs Conference & Training Center v. City of
Banning (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 267, 282.) “[T]he affirmative defense of
laches requires unreasonable delay in bringing suit ‘plus either acquiescence
in the act about which plaintiff complains or prejudice to the defendant
resulting from the delay.’ ” (Miller v. Eisenhower Medical
Center (1980) 27 Cal.3d 614, 624.) 
 
            It is true that “[o]n
undisputed facts, the applicability of laches may be decided as a matter of
law.” (Committee to Save the Beverly Highlands Homes Assn. v. Beverly
Highlands Homes Assn. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 1247, 1266; see Isakoolian
v. Issacoulian (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 225, 229, [laches “may be raised and
determined by a general demurrer”]; Arnold, supra, 45 Cal.App.2d at pp.
530-534 [upholding demurrer under laches doctrine based on judicially noticed
materials].) However, the application of this doctrine is generally a factual
question.


            Here, the facts as
pleaded do not obviate the possibility of discovery shedding light on circumstances
contributing to Plaintiff’s delay in bringing this action. However, based on the
totality of Plaintiffs’ allegations (which are assumed to be true), the
application of the doctrine of laches and whether such delay was reasonable is
far too factual a question to resolve at the demurrer stage. (See City of
Oakland v. Public Employees' Retirement System (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 29, 52
[“Laches in almost all cases raises factual issues regarding the cause of an
asserted delay and the prejudice, vel non, therefrom”].)
 
Moreover, prejudice is never presumed; rather it
must be affirmatively demonstrated by the defendant in order to sustain her
burden of proof and the production of evidence on the issue. (Miller v. Eisenhower Medical Center, supra, at p. 624.) 
 
Here, the demurrer argues that “time
alone is prejudice.” (Dem., 8:24.) However, Defendant cites no legal authority that
time alone is sufficient to demonstrate prejudice. The law is to the
contrary.  “Ordinarily, delay alone does
not constitute laches.”  (Brown v.
State Personnel Bd. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 1151, 1159.) As noted, both
unreasonable delay and prejudice must be shown.
 
The Court again rejects this argument for
laches, which does not arise from the face of the pleadings. 
 
Statute of Frauds:
 
Defendant also again raises the defense of
the statute of frauds. The entirety of Defendant’s argument is:
 
“This so called transaction clearly come
under the Statue of Frauds. (Civil Code S 1624). Due the fact there is no
writing and the requirements of Civil Code S 1624 are not met, the alleged
transaction is not enforceable and the entire complaint must be dismissed with
prejudice. Further we cannot rely on the alleged words of a third party (Mother
now deceased ) 25 years ago. (This is hearsay with no exception).” (Dem.,
8:7-10.) 
 
            This
argument is nearly identical to the argument the Court previously found was “entirely
undeveloped” with respect to both the facts and the law. (See 9/11/23 Dem.,
6:13-16.) Thus, this argument has again been waived for the purposes of this
demurrer. 
 
Sham Pleadings:
 
            Finally,
on demurrer, Defendant identifies numerous different paragraphs that Defendant
argues are inconsistent with the prior pleading and, thus, subjects the SAC to
the sham pleading doctrine. 
 
            Generally, when
ruling on a demurrer, courts must assume the truth of the complaint's factual
allegations. (Owens v. Kings Supermarket (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 379, 383.)
The sham pleading doctrine operates as an exception to this general rule and
applies “where a party files an amended complaint and seeks to avoid the
defects of a prior complaint either by omitting the facts that rendered the
complaint defective or by pleading facts inconsistent with the allegations of
prior pleadings. [Citations.]” (Id. at p. 384.) 
Under
these circumstances, the court is permitted “to take judicial notice of the
prior pleadings and requires that the pleader explain the inconsistency. If he
fails to do so the court may disregard the inconsistent allegations and read
into the amended complaint the allegations of the superseded complaint.
[Citations.]” (Ibid.) “[A] proposed amendment which contradicts
allegations in an earlier pleading will not be allowed in the absence of ‘very
satisfactory evidence’ upon which it is ‘clearly shown that the earlier
pleading is the result of mistake or inadvertence.’ [Citations.]” (American
Advertising & Sales Co. v. Mid–Western Transport (1984) 152 Cal.App.3d
875, 879.)
 
            Here,
the demurrer provides no analysis as to how the allegations in the FAC compared
to the SAC are inconsistent. (Dem., 5:21-6:22.) That is, it is unclear based on
the citations that there are material differences to the SAC indicating
whether or not Plaintiffs have stated a claim. 
 
            Thus,
Defendant has failed to demonstrate that the SAC is a sham pleading. The
demurrer on this ground is overruled. 
 
Conclusion
 
            The demurrer is overruled.  Defendant shall file and serve his Answer on
or before May 13, 2024.
