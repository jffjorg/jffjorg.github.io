BACKGROUND
On October 31, 2023, plaintiff
Gloria Caldwell by and through her power of attorney Terrie Baird filed a
complaint against Driftwood Healthcare Center, LLC dba Driftwood Healthcare
Center, Citrus Wellness Center, LLC, Ensemble Healthcare, LLC, and Rechnitz
Citrus, GP for (1) negligence, (2) violations of Elder Abuse Act, and (3)
violations of Resident Rights. 
On July 3, 2023, the Court granted
defendant’s motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories, set one
and ordered plaintiff to pay sanctions in the amount of $766.50.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
45-Day Rule: 
This motion must be served within 45 days after service of the response
in question (extended if served by mail, overnight delivery, or fax; see CCP
§1013); otherwise, the demanding party waives the right to compel any further
response to the CCP §2031.010 demand. 
CCP §§2031.310(c), 2016.050; see Sperber
v. Robinson (1994) 26 Cal. App. 4th 736, 745.  The 45-day time limit is mandatory and
jurisdictional.  Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal. App. 4th 1403, 1410.  The parties, however, can also agree in
writing on a specific later date by which to file the motion to compel.  CCP §2031.310(c). 
Meet-and-Confer Requirement: 
The motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a
declaration showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the issues
outside of court (so-called “meet and confer”). 
CCP §§2016.040, 2031.310(b)(2).
Separate Statement: 
Any motion involving the content of a discovery request or the responses
to such a request shall be accompanied by a separate statement.  This includes a motion to compel further
responses to demand for inspection of documents or tangible things.  CRC Rule 3.1020(a)(3).  
Interrogatories
CCP §2030.300 states:  “(a) On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following
apply:   (1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. . . . (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general. 
(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040. (c) Unless notice of this motion is
given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing,
the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response to the
interrogatories. . . .”
CCP §2030.220 states:  “(a) Each answer in a response to
interrogatories shall be as complete and straightforward as the information
reasonably available to the responding party permits.  (b) If an interrogatory cannot be answered
completely, it shall be answered to the extent possible.  (c) If the responding party does not have
personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party
shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the
information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where
the information is equally available to the propounding party.”
CCP
§2030.230 states:  “If the answer to an
interrogatory would necessitate the preparation or the making of a compilation,
abstract, audit, or summary of or from the documents of the party to whom the
interrogatory is directed, and if the burden or expense of preparing or making
it would be substantially the same for the party propounding the interrogatory
as for the responding party, it is a sufficient answer to that interrogatory to
refer to this section and to specify the writings from which the answer may be
derived or ascertained. . . .”
CCP §2030.010(b)
provides:  “An interrogatory may relate
to whether another party is making a certain contention, or to the facts,
witnesses, and writings on which a contention is based.  An interrogatory is not objectionable because
an answer to it involves an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the
application of law to fact, or would be based on 
information obtained or legal theories developed in
anticipation of litigation or in preparation for 
trial.”
Request for Production of Documents
On receipt of a response to an
inspection demand, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further
responses to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following
apply:  (1) a statement of compliance
with the demand is incomplete; (2) a representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; or (3) an objection in the response is
without merit or too general.  CCP §
2031.310(a).
A statement of compliance shall
state that the production, inspection, and related activity demanded will be
allowed either in whole or in part, and that all documents or things in the
demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party
and to which no objection is being made will be included in the
production.  CCP § 2031.220.  
“A representation of inability to
comply with [a] particular demand for inspection . . . shall affirm that a
diligent search and reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply
with that demand.  This statement shall
also specify whether the inability to comply is because the particular item or
category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or
stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control
of the responding party.  This statement
shall set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization
known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that
item or category of item.”  CCP §
2031.230. 
A motion to compel further response
to requests for production “shall set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.”  CCP § 2031.310(b)(1).  “To establish ‘good cause,’ the burden is on
the moving party to show both:  [1] Relevance to the subject matter (e.g.,
how the information in the documents would tend to prove or disprove some issue
in the case); and [2] Specific facts justifying discovery
(e.g., why such information is necessary for trial preparation or to prevent
surprise at trial).  The fact that there
is no alternative source for the
information sought is an important factor in establishing ‘good cause’ for
inspection.  But it is not essential in every case.”  Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial, 8:1495.6 (citations omitted).  “Declarations are generally used to show the
requisite ‘good cause’ for an order to compel inspection.  The declarations must contain ‘specific facts’
rather than mere conclusions.”  Id. at 8:1495.7 (citation omitted).  “The declarations may be on information and
belief, if necessary.  However, in such
cases, the ‘specific facts’ supporting such information and belief (the sources
of the information) must also be alleged.” 
Id. at 8:1495.8 (citation
omitted).  “Most declarations are made by
the attorney for the moving party, who is usually more familiar with the
relevancy and ‘specific facts’ constituting ‘good cause’ for inspection.”  Id.
at 8:1495.9.
“If ‘good cause’ is shown by the moving
party, the burden is then on the responding party to justify any objections
made to document disclosure (the same as on motions to compel answers to
interrogatories or deposition questions. . . ).”  Id.
at 8:1496 (citation omitted).
DISCUSSION
            Defendant
Driftwood requests that the Court compel plaintiff to respond further to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 1-8, 10, and 12-30 and Demand for Production of
Documents, Set One, Nos. 1-5, 7-8, 10-18, 21-22, 24, 27-29, and 31-47.
The complaint alleges that plaintiff
Gloria Caldwell was a resident at defendants’ skilled nursing facility,
Driftwood, from September 10, 2022. 
Complaint, ¶23.  At that time, she
was admitted for multiple medical conditions including history of dementia,
type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, osteoarthritis, and an unspecified
fracture of upper end of left humerus subsequent encounter for fracture with
routine healing.  Due to her
comorbidities, Caldwell required assistance with all her activities for daily
living.  Id., ¶24.  The totality of these illnesses indicate and
should have indicated to defendants that Caldwell was a person with low
mobility.  Consequently, Driftwood’s
staff knew or should have known that Caldwell was at high risk for developing
skin breakdowns to her person. Id., ¶25. 
Further, she was incontinent of bowel and bladder.  Id., ¶26. 
Additionally, she required assistance of Driftwood’s staff for nutrition
and hydration.  Id., ¶27.  Despite knowledge of these risks, plaintiff
developed a fungal infection to the skin of her perineal area, cellulitis of
buttock, sepsis, urinary tract infections, E. coli, severe malnutrition, and
dehydration.  Defendants’ staff thus had
a further obligation to treat and contain these illnesses.  Id., ¶29. 
Specifically, while a resident of Driftwood, plaintiff was left in her
soiled diapers by Driftwood nursing staff. 
As a result, the skin degraded, causing infection, cellulitis,
dermatitis and she developed urinary tract infections.  Id., ¶30. 
Further, she was overmedicated and not provided the proper physical
therapy services.  Id., ¶32.
            Defendant
explains that it served discovery requests on plaintiff on December 1, 2023.  Responses were due by January 3, 2024.  On April 5, 2024, plaintiff served
responses.  On May 7, 2024, defense
counsel sent a meet and confer letter to plaintiff’s counsel regarding
plaintiff’s deficient responses and requested supplemental responses by May 14,
2014.  On May 11, 2024, plaintiff’s
counsel sought an extension to May 21, 2021, which defense counsel
granted.  Counsel also agreed to extend
the date to file motions to compel further responses.  As of the date of the filing of the motion,
defense counsel has not received supplemental responses.  
                        Special
interrogatories
            As
to the special interrogatories, defendant asserts that plaintiff’s responses to
Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7, 12, 24, 25, 27, 29, and 30 are deficient because she failed to
provide a full and complete response in compliance with CCP §2030.220.  As to Nos. 10, 14-17, and 28, defendant
contends that plaintiff failed to respond “with particularity,” as the
interrogatories require information regarding “the dates, times and places of
the events complained of; as well as the identity of any persons involved
therein.”  As to Nos. 2, 4, 6, 8, 13, and
18-23, defendant asserts that plaintiff failed to provide full and complete
responses as she failed to respond “with particularity” as they incorporated
“boilerplate allegations from her unverified complaint.”
            There
is no opposition.
            The
Court finds that plaintiff’s responses are deficient as they do not comply with
CCP §2030.220.
            The
motion is thus GRANTED.
                        Demand
for production of documents
            As
to the demand for documents, plaintiff responded:  “Plaintiff refers Defendant to Plaintiff’s
Bates labeled production, which includes . . . medical chart . . . , notes
taken by Plaintiff’s Husband, and Plaintiff’s complaints substantiated by the
California Department of Health that resulted in Deficiencies issued to
Driftwood Healthcare Center. 
Additionally, Plaintiff refers Defendant to Defendant’s production,
which contains Gloria Caldwell’s medical chart, Medicaid Cost Reports from
Defendant’s facility, Defendant’s Clinical Nursing and Operational Policies and
Procedures, and Defendant’s Job Descriptions.” 
Defendant argues that the response is ambiguous and evasive and fails to
comply with CCP §§2031.210, 2031.220, and 2031.230.  Defendant also argues that to the extent that
plaintiff produced documents, she failed to label them in compliance with CCP
§2031.280, and thus it is unclear what categories plaintiff produced documents
in response to and/or whether there are documents being withheld.  Defendant asserts that plaintiff omitted
evidence of her certification and/or admission into hospice.  
            There
is no opposition.
The Court
finds that plaintiff’s responses are deficient as they do not comply with CCP
§§2031.220 and 2031.230 and that plaintiff’s production does not comply with
CCP §2031.280.
            The
motion is thus GRANTED.
Sanctions
Under CCP § 2023.030(a), “[t]he
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct. . . . If a monetary sanction is authorized by any
provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  Under CCP § 2023.010, an example of the
misuse of the discovery process is “(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.” 
Sanctions are mandatory in
connection with motions to compel further responses against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel unless the
court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  CCP § §2030.300(d),
2031.310(h).
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a)
states:  “The court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to
the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed.” 
            Defendant
requests monetary sanctions against plaintiff in the amount of $2,964 for both
motions.  The Court finds that $1,600
plus the $158 filing and remote appearance fees) is a reasonable amount to be
imposed against plaintiff.
 
ORDER
The
motions are GRANTED.  Plaintiff Gloria
Caldwell is ordered to serve further responses to defendant Driftwood
Healthcare Center, LLC’s Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. Nos. 1-8, 10,
and 12-30 and Demand for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. Nos. 1-5, 7-8,
10-18, 21-22, 24, 27-29, and 31-47, within twenty days.
Plaintiff
is ordered to pay a monetary sanction to defendant in the amount of $1,758 plus
the remote appearance fee, within thirty days.
            Defendant
is ordered to give notice of ruling.
