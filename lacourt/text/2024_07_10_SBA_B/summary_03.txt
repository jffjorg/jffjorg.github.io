And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion of defendants' counsel, Phillip Allan, Trajan Perez, and Benjamin P. Tarczy at Miller Nash LP, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was granted because the defendants have not complied with their engagement agreement with Miller Nash LP by failing to pay outstanding attorneys' fees and costs. The court found that the attorney submitted a declaration establishing that the service requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, have been satisfied. The court also found that the attorney has shown sufficient reason why the motion to be relieved as counsel should be granted. The order grants the motion and relieves the attorney as counsel of record for defendants, effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed "Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel â€“ Civil" upon the clients.
