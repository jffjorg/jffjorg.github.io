And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff, Brittany Harman, as it is moot since she has already appeared for a full-day deposition on June 4, 2024. The judge also denies the defendants' request for sanctions, finding that the plaintiff acted with substantial justification in refusing to engage in the discovery process.

The judge also denies the defendants' motions to compel further responses to their discovery requests, finding that they were untimely filed and that the plaintiff has already served supplemental responses. The judge denies the defendants' request for sanctions again, finding that they acted with substantial justification in making the motions.

The judge orders the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
