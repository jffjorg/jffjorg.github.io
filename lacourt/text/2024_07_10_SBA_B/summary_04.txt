This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a civil case, Case Number 23TRCV02998, filed by plaintiff Lillian Smith against defendant Ricardo Hernandez. The defendant has filed a motion to set aside the default entered against him on May 3, 2024. The judge has granted the motion, finding that the default was entered prematurely and that the service of summons and complaint was not valid. The judge has also found that the defendant's lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by his avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The motion is granted, and the default is set aside and vacated. The defendant is ordered to file a responsive pleading within 15 days of the date of the order.
