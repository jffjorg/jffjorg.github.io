RULING
The motion is DENIED without

The Court is ordering the case
bifurcated for both discovery and trial. 
In phase one the parties shall try the basic Song Beverly Act claim
arising from the claimed breach of the Song Beverly statutory obligations.
Phase two shall involve plaintiff’s
claim to a civil penalty under Civil
Code §1794(c) for a willful
violation of the statute.  Discovery on
the phase two issues, such as whether defendant knew that it could not repair
the claimed defects, based on its knowledge learned from internal analysis and
investigation as to certain technical service bulletins, shall be deferred
until after the trier of fact has returned a verdict favorable to plaintiff in
phase one.
Plaintiff is ordered to provide
notice of the ruling.
BACKGROUND
            On November 18, 2022, plaintiff
Rosabel Kim filed a complaint against American Honda 
Motor
Company for violations of statutory obligations under the Song-Beverly Consumer

Warranty
Act. Plaintiff alleges that on August 19, 2019, in exchange for valuable
consideration, 
she
leased a 2019 Honda Odyssey, manufactured and/or distributed by defendant.
During the 
warranty
period, the vehicle contained or developed defects, including defective audio
system, 
defective
electrical system, and defective door system.
            On October 16, 2023, the court
denied defendant’s motion to compel arbitration.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
45-Day Rule: 
This motion must be served within 45 days after service of the response
in question (extended if served by mail, overnight delivery, or fax; see CCP §
1013); otherwise, the demanding party waives the right to compel any further
response to the CCP §2031.010 demand. 
CCP §§2031.310(c), 2016.050; see Sperber
v. Robinson (1994) 26 Cal. App. 4th 736, 745.  The 45-day time limit is mandatory and
jurisdictional.  Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal. App. 4th 1403, 1410.  The parties, however, can also agree in
writing on a specific later date by which to file the motion to compel.  CCP §2031.310(c). 
Meet-and-Confer Requirement: 
The motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a
declaration showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the issues
outside of court (so-called “meet and confer”). 
CCP §§2016.040, 2031.310(b)(2).
Separate Statement: 
Any motion involving the content of a discovery request or the responses
to such a request shall be accompanied by a separate statement.  This includes a motion to compel further
responses to demand for inspection of documents or tangible things.  CRC Rule 3.1020(a)(3).  
Request for Production of Documents
On receipt of a response to an
inspection demand, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further
responses to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following
apply:  (1) a statement of compliance
with the demand is incomplete; (2) a representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; or (3) an objection in the response is
without merit or too general.  CCP §
2031.310(a).  A statement of compliance
shall state that the production, inspection, and related activity demanded will
be allowed either in whole or in part, and that all documents or things in the
demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party
and to which no objection is being made will be included in the production.  CCP § 2031.220.  “A representation of inability to comply with
[a] particular demand for inspection . . . shall affirm that a diligent search
and reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that
demand.  This statement shall also specify
whether the inability to comply is because the particular item or category has
never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has
never been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the
responding party.  This statement shall
set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization known or
believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that item or
category of item.”  CCP § 2031.230. 
A motion to compel further response
to requests for production “shall set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.”  CCP § 2031.310(b)(1).  “To establish ‘good cause,’ the burden is on
the moving party to show both:  [1] Relevance to the subject matter (e.g.,
how the information in the documents would tend to prove or disprove some issue
in the case); and [2] Specific facts justifying discovery
(e.g., why such information is necessary for trial preparation or to prevent
surprise at trial).  The fact that there
is no alternative source for the
information sought is an important factor in establishing ‘good cause’ for
inspection.  But it is not essential in every case.”  Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial, 8:1495.6 (citations omitted).  “Declarations are generally used to show the
requisite ‘good cause’ for an order to compel inspection.  The declarations must contain ‘specific facts’
rather than mere conclusions.”  Id. at 8:1495.7 (citation omitted).  “The declarations may be on information and
belief, if necessary.  However, in such
cases, the ‘specific facts’ supporting such information and belief (the sources
of the information) must also be alleged.” 
Id. at 8:1495.8 (citation
omitted).  “Most declarations are made by
the attorney for the moving party, who is usually more familiar with the
relevancy and ‘specific facts’ constituting ‘good cause’ for inspection.”  Id.
at 8:1495.9.
“If ‘good cause’ is shown by the moving
party, the burden is then on the responding party to justify any objections
made to document disclosure (the same as on motions to compel answers to
interrogatories or deposition questions. . . ).”  Id.
at 8:1496 (citation omitted).  
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff requests that the court
compel defendant Honda to respond further to plaintiff’s Request for Production
of Documents, Set Two, Nos. 70-75, 77-81, 83-88, and 90-97.
In the complaint, plaintiff alleges
that on August 29, 2019, in exchange for valuable consideration, plaintiff
purchased a 2019 Honda Odyssey, manufactured and/or distributed by defendant.  During the warranty period, the vehicle
contained or developed defects including a defective audio system, defective
electrical system, and defective door system. 
Plaintiff provided defendant and its representatives sufficient
opportunity to service or repair the vehicle. 
Defendant and its representatives were unable and/or failed to service
or repair the vehicle within a reasonable number of attempts.
In the motion, plaintiff explains
that during the warranty period, plaintiff presented the subject vehicle for
repairs relating to Electrical Defects on at least eight occasions:  December 3, 2019 (2868 miles), September 23,
2020 (8568 miles), March 4, 2022 (27,120 miles), July 18, 2022 (32,1732 miles),
August 6, 2022 (32,468 miles), October 19, 2022 (35,734 miles), March 14, 2023
(41,478 miles), and April 28, 2023 (42,233 miles).
On March 6, 2024, plaintiff served
Request for Production of Documents, Set Two. 
On April 23, 2024, defendant served unverified responses.  On May 6, 2024, plaintiff’s counsel attempted
to meet and confer regarding the deficiencies. 
Plaintiff’s counsel sent follow up meet and confer correspondence on May
14 and May 28, 2024, but did not receive a response.
The requests at issue can be
categorized as follows:  internal
analysis of investigations (Nos. 74, 81, 88), communications (75), decisions to
issue (83, 90), customer complaints and claims (77, 84, 91), warranty claims
(78, 85, 92), failure rates (79, 86, 93), and all versions (80, 87, 94)
regarding the service bulletins 21-013, 22-027, and 23-046.
Plaintiff requests documents
relating to defendant’s internal investigation and analysis of specific
technical service bulletins addressing the Electrical Defects “plaguing
Plaintiff’s vehicle which would establish that Defendant previously knew of the
Defects, knew of its inability to repair them, and knew it did not repair them,
but nevertheless failed to repurchase the vehicle.”
            Plaintiff further asserts that since
service of its “deficient responses,” defendant has not produced its signed
verifications or any further production.
            In opposition, defendant argues that
its responses are code-compliant and that it produced 1,582 pages of document
pertaining to the subject vehicle and its repair history, including all related
service bulletins.  Defendant also
contends that its objections have merit, including that the requests are overly
broad as they are seeking “all documents.” 
Defendant argues that plaintiff cannot show good cause for the broad
scope of information sought.  Defendant
also contends that the many of the requests are duplicative of her set one
requests, to which defendant has provided substantive responses, pointing to
Nos. 74, 75, 88, and 89, which seek a subset of the same information sought by
No. 16; Nos. 83 and 90 are same as No. 20; Nos. 77, 78, 91, and 92 are same as
No. 22; Nos. 79, 86, 93 are same as No. 24. 
Defendant further argues that plaintiff’s assertions that she needs
investigative information to prove knowledge or willfulness under Song Beverly
is unfounded, as “willful simply means that defendant knew of its legal
obligations and intentionally declined to follow them, citing to CACI
3244.  Defendant also contends that a
service bulletin, or the investigation which formed it, is not proof of any
defect in the subject vehicle, particularly considering that a non-recall
service bulletin is only directed to symptomatic 2019 Honda Odyssey
vehicles.  Defendant argues that
plaintiff does not need “an avalanche of extraneous information relating to
each service bulletin to prove her case.” 
Moreover, defendant argues, plaintiff is not entitled to the production
of other irrelevant complaints.
            In reply, plaintiff asserts that
“[a]dmittedly, there is no question” that plaintiff’s set two is similar to set
two but set two is also substantially different in terms of scope and documents
sought.  Plaintiff reiterates that she
has established good cause for production and defendant failed to justify its
objections.
            The Court rules as follows:  The motion is DENIED without prejudice.  The Court is ordering the case bifurcated for
both discovery and trial.  In phase one
the parties shall try the basic Song Beverly Act claim arising from the claimed
breach of the Song Beverly statutory obligations.
Phase two shall involve plaintiff’s
claim to a civil penalty under Civil
Code §1794(c) for a willful
violation of the statute.  Discovery on
the phase two issues, such as whether defendant knew that it could not repair
the claimed defects, based on its knowledge learned from internal analysis and
investigation as to certain technical service bulletins, shall be deferred
until after the trier of fact has returned a verdict favorable to plaintiff in
phase one.
