And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the defendant without prejudice. The case will be bifurcated for both discovery and trial, with phase one focusing on the basic Song-Beverly Act claim arising from the claimed breach of the Song-Beverly statutory obligations and phase two involving the plaintiff's claim to a civil penalty under Civil Code §1794(c) for a willful violation of the statute. Discovery on the phase two issues will be deferred until after the trier of fact has returned a verdict favorable to the plaintiff in phase one.
