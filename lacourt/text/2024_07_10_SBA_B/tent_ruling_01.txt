The request for sanctions is DENIED as plaintiff acted with substantial justification.BACKGROUNDOn November 7, 2022, plaintiff Brittany Harman filed a complaint against Kaleo Marketing, LLC and Michael Oberlander for (1) pregnancy discrimination, (2) retaliation for taking pregnancy leave, (3) violation of Family Rights Act, (4) violation of pregnancy disability leave, (5) disability discrimination, (6) failure to engage in a good faith interactive process, (7) failure to provide reasonable accommodations, (8) retaliation for reasonable complaint to employer, and (9) wrongful termination in violation of public policy.On December 14, 2022, defendants filed an amended answer.On February 23, 2023, the court sustained with leave to amend plaintiff’s demurrer to the FAA.On March 27, 2023, the court granted plaintiff’s motion for protective order re her deposition, ordering that plaintiff’s deposition was to be conducted after defendant served its further responses and produced responsive documents. The court also granted plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to interrogatories and requests for production and ordered defendant to pay sanctions in the amount of $3338.On July 14, 2023, the court granted defendant’s motion for protective order that plaintiff must view requested documents provided to plaintiff in response to plaintiff’s request for production of documents, set two, Nos. 56-63 in the presence of her counsel, in person, or via video conferencing and shall not make copies or take possession of any of the Confidential Materials.On August 9, 2023, the parties stipulated and the court ordered a protective order – confidential designation only.On October 5, 2023, the court granted plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories – Employment, Nos. 209.2, 211.1, 214.1, 214.2, and 216.1, Special Interrogatories, Nos. 18, 30, 36, 42, and 48, and Request for Production of Documents, Nos. 22-27 and 29-34, within fifteen days and ordered sanctions in the amount of $2538.On April 15, 2024, the parties stipulated and the court ordered a protective order addendum re highly confidential designation.LEGAL AUTHORITYCCP §2025.450(a) provides: “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, . . , without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document . . . described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document . . . described in the deposition notice.”CCP §2025.450(b) provides, “A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of the following:(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”CCP §2025.230 states: “If the deponent named is not a natural person, the deposition notice shall describe with reasonable particularity the matters on which examination is requested.  In that event, the deponent shall designate and produce at the deposition those of its officers, directors, managing agents, employees, or agents who are most qualified to testify on its behalf as to those matters to the extent of any information known or reasonably available to the deponent.”DISCUSSIONDefendants Kaleo Marketing, LLC and Michael Oberlander requests that the Court compel plaintiff to appear for deposition and requests sanctions in the amount of $5,522.50.Defendants explain that on December 6, 2022, defendants noticed the deposition of plaintiff for January 19, 2023. After plaintiff’s counsel informed defense counsel that she would not be attending on that date, defense counsel sought other dates. On January 18, 2023, defendant served a deposition notice for January 31, 2023. Over the course of 2023, defendant served other deposition notices as to plaintiff, including June 12, 2023 and October 5, 2023.On March 27, 2023, the Court granted plaintiff’s motion for a protective order that plaintiff’s deposition was to be conducted after defendant had served its further responses and produced responsive documents.On April 5, 2024, at an IDC, the minute order indicates that the parties have agreed to a date for plaintiff’s deposition on May 7, 2024.In the opposition, plaintiff contends that the motion is moot because she appeared for a full-day deposition on June 4, 2024. She also argues that sanctions are not warranted because the Court had ordered defendants to wait to take plaintiff’s deposition until they served responses to plaintiff’s first set of discovery, and they still have not finished. Further, plaintiff asserts, she tried repeatedly to cooperate with defendants to create a global deposition schedule that worked for all parties, and that defendants “variously ignored plaintiff or changed positions.” Additionally, plaintiff contends, she resisted giving her deposition first because she felt that against these defendants and defense counsel, they would take her deposition and then refuse to give their depositions.In reply, defendant argues that sanctions are warranted based on plaintiff’s refusal to engage in the discovery process in good faith.The Court finds that the motion is MOOT and thus DENIED as plaintiff has appeared for her deposition. As for sanctions, plaintiff acted with substantial justification. The Court had granted a protective order in that before plaintiff’s deposition was taken, defendant had to have served further responses and produced documents. Thus, the Court denies defendant’s request for sanctions.ORDERThe motion is DENIED as MOOT. Defendant’s request for sanctions is DENIED.Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXBRITTANY HARMAN,Plaintiff,Case No.:22TRCV01130vs.[Tentative] RULINGKALEO MARKETING, LLC, et al.,Defendants.Hearing Date: July 10, 2024Moving Parties: Defendant Kaleo MarketingResponding Party: Plaintiff Brittany HarmanMotion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories – GeneralMotion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories – Employment LawMotion to Compel Further Responses to Special InterrogatoriesMotion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of DocumentsMotino to Compel Further Responses to Requests for AdmissionThe court considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers.RULINGThe motions are DENIED as MOOT. The requests for sanctions are DENIED.BACKGROUNDOn November 7, 2022, plaintiff Brittany Harman filed a complaint against Kaleo Marketing, LLC and Michael Oberlander for (1) pregnancy discrimination, (2) retaliation for taking pregnancy leave, (3) violation of Family Rights Act, (4) violation of pregnancy disability leave, (5) disability discrimination, (6) failure to engage in a good faith interactive process, (7) failure to provide reasonable accommodations, (8) retaliation for reasonable complaint to employer, and (9) wrongful termination in violation of public policy.On December 14, 2022, defendants filed an amended answer.On February 23, 2023, the court sustained with leave to amend plaintiff’s demurrer to the FAA.On March 27, 2023, the court granted plaintiff’s motion for protective order re her deposition, ordering that plaintiff’s deposition was to be conducted after defendant served its further responses and produced responsive documents. The court also granted plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to interrogatories and requests for production and ordered defendant to pay sanctions in the amount of $3338.On July 14, 2023, the court granted defendant’s motion for protective order that plaintiff must view requested documents provided to plaintiff in response to plaintiff’s request for production of documents, set two, Nos. 56-63 in the presence of her counsel, in person, or via video conferencing and shall not make copies or take possession of any of the Confidential Materials.On August 9, 2023, the parties stipulated and the court ordered a protective order – confidential designation only.On October 5, 2023, the court granted plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories – Employment, Nos. 209.2, 211.1, 214.1, 214.2, and 216.1, Special Interrogatories, Nos. 18, 30, 36, 42, and 48, and Request for Production of Documents, Nos. 22-27 and 29-34, within fifteen days and ordered sanctions in the amount of $2538.On April 15, 2024, the parties stipulated and the court ordered a protective order addendum re highly confidential designation.LEGAL AUTHORITY45-Day Rule: This motion must be served within 45 days after service of the response in question (extended if served by mail, overnight delivery, or fax; see CCP §1013); otherwise, the demanding party waives the right to compel any further response to the CCP §2031.010 demand. CCP §§2031.310(c), 2016.050; see Sperber v. Robinson (1994) 26 Cal. App. 4th 736, 745. The 45-day time limit is mandatory and jurisdictional. Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal. App. 4th 1403, 1410. The parties, however, can also agree in writing on a specific later date by which to file the motion to compel. CCP §2031.310(c).Meet-and-Confer Requirement: The motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a declaration showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the issues outside of court (so-called “meet and confer”). CCP §§2016.040, 2031.310(b)(2).Separate Statement: Any motion involving the content of a discovery request or the responses to such a request shall be accompanied by a separate statement. This includes a motion to compel further responses to demand for inspection of documents or tangible things. CRC Rule 3.1020(a)(3).InterrogatoriesCCP §2030.300 states: “(a) On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. . . . (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general. (b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. (c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories. . . .”Request for Production of DocumentsOn receipt of a response to an inspection demand, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further responses to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) a statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete; (2) a representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; or (3) an objection in the response is without merit or too general. CCP §2031.310(a). A statement of compliance shall state that the production, inspection, and related activity demanded will be allowed either in whole or in part, and that all documents or things in the demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party and to which no objection is being made will be included in the production. CCP §2031.220. “A representation of inability to comply with [a] particular demand for inspection . . . shall affirm that a diligent search and reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that demand. This statement shall also specify whether the inability to comply is because the particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding party. This statement shall set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that item or category of item.” CCP §2031.230.A motion to compel further response to requests for production “shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.” CCP § 2031.310(b)(1). “To establish ‘good cause,’ the burden is on the moving party to show both: [1] Relevance to the subject matter (e.g., how the information in the documents would tend to prove or disprove some issue in the case); and [2] Specific facts justifying discovery (e.g., why such information is necessary for trial preparation or to prevent surprise at trial). The fact that there is no alternative source for the information sought is an important factor in establishing ‘good cause’ for inspection. But it is not essential in every case.” Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial, 8:1495.6 (citations omitted). “Declarations are generally used to show the requisite ‘good cause’ for an order to compel inspection. The declarations must contain ‘specific facts’ rather than mere conclusions.” Id. at 8:1495.7 (citation omitted). “The declarations may be on information and belief, if necessary. However, in such cases, the ‘specific facts’ supporting such information and belief (the sources of the information) must also be alleged.” Id. at 8:1495.8 (citation omitted). “Most declarations are made by the attorney for the moving party, who is usually more familiar with the relevancy and ‘specific facts’ constituting ‘good cause’ for inspection.” Id. at 8:1495.9.DISCUSSIONDefendants Kaleo Marketing and Michael Oberlander request an order compelling plaintiff to respond further to defendants’ Form Interrogatories – General, Form Interrogatories – Employment, Special Interrogatories, Request for Production of Documents, and Request for Admissions.Defendants explain that on October 3, 2023, defendants served written discovery on plaintiff. Responses were due by November 2, 2023. On November 15, 2023, plaintiff served objections and plaintiff’s counsel sent an email to defense counsel that plaintiff’s counsel needed an additional two weeks “to provide a fuller response shortly.” On January 11, 2024, defense counsel sent an email to plaintiff’s counsel requesting substantive responses. On January 12, 2024, plaintiff’s counsel responded that the deadline to file motions to compel further responses was January 4, 2024 and that although the discovery was excessive, plaintiff expected to “give you all relevant documents, relevant information and answers and so on” and that plaintiff’s counsel had been working on the requests with plaintiff. On January 16, 2024, defense counsel sent an email to plaintiff’s counsel requesting a date for when plaintiff would “send us your responses to the discovery requests.”In opposition, plaintiff asserts that she served further discovery responses on March 29, April 10, and April 18, 2024. Plaintiff also contends that the motions were untimely filed after the 45-day deadline, explaining that plaintiff served objections on November 15, 2023 by email, the deadline to file was January 4, 2024, and the motions were not filed until February 26, 2024.In reply, defendants acknowledge that plaintiff served further responses but still requests sanctions.The Court rules as follows: The motions were untimely filed as notice of the motion was not given within 45 days of the service of the response. Plaintiff served responses, albeit objections only, which do not need to be verified. See CCP §2030.250(a) (“The party to whom the interrogatories are directed shall sign the response under oath unless the response contains only objections.”). Objections are considered responses. See CCP §2030.2310(a), which states, “The party to whom interrogatories have been propounded shall respond in writing under oath separately to each interrogatory by any of the following: . . . . (3) An objection to the particular interrogatory.” Under CCP §2030.300(a), “On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following apply: . . . . (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.”In any event, it appears that the motions are MOOT because plaintiff served supplemental responses.The motions are DENIED.SanctionsUnder CCP § 2023.030(a), “[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. . . . If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” Under CCP § 2023.010, an example of the misuse of the discovery process is “(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”Sanctions are mandatory in connection with motions to compel further responses against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel unless the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” CCP § §2030.300(d), 2031.310(h).Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a) states: “The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.”Defendants request $2024.50 ($575/hr x 3.4 hrs., $595/hr. x 10 min.) as to each motion. In opposition, plaintiff argues that the motions are untimely and that she acted with substantial justification and requests sanctions against defendant and defense counsel.The Court finds that because the motions were untimely filed, sanctions are not warranted. Further, the Court denies plaintiff’s request for sanctions as defendants acted with substantial justification.ORDERThe motions are DENIED as MOOT. The requests for sanctions are DENIED.Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of ruling.
