And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiff, Frank Elias Mancia, worked for the defendants as a forklift operator and alleges that they terminated his employment due to an injury. The defendants argue that Mancia signed agreements to arbitrate any disputes that may arise, and that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies to the dispute. The judge finds that the defendants have met their burden of proving the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate, and that the agreement covers Mancia's claims. The judge also finds that the FAA applies to the dispute, as the agreements reference the FAA and have a substantial relationship to interstate commerce. The judge denies Mancia's opposition to the motion, which argued that the defendants should be jointly and severally liable for arbitration fees. The judge orders the action to be stayed pending the results of the arbitration, and sets a status review/OSC re: dismissal for September 11, 2025.
