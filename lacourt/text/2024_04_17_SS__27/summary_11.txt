And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to provide discovery responses. The defendant failed to provide timely responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests, despite several extensions granted by the plaintiff. The judge has also ordered the defendant and his counsel to pay sanctions of $1,250.00 to the plaintiff. The judge has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. The defendant's counsel contends that they have not resolved a representation issue with the defendant's carrier and intend to move to be relieved as counsel. However, this does not excuse the defendant's failure to provide timely discovery responses.
