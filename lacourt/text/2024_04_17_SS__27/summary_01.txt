This tentative ruling deals with a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Martinian & Associates, Inc, the Plaintiff's Counsel. The motion is unopposed, and the Court grants the motion, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client communication as grounds for withdrawal. The Court notes that the next hearing is scheduled for May 21, 2024, which should be sufficient time for the Plaintiff to retain new counsel. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff or new counsel may need additional time to prepare for trial, and sufficient time exists for the Plaintiff to take action to seek a continuance of the trial.
