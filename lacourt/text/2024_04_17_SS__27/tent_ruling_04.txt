On August 7, 2020, Plaintiff filed the current premises liability
case. On May 18, 2022, Defendant Burlington Coat Factory of Texas, Inc. served
Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Requests for Production of
Documents, and a Statement of Damages on Plaintiff. The original deadline for
Plaintiff’s responses was June 22, 2022. Despite receiving numerous extensions,
Plaintiff failed to serve responses to the written discovery requests at issue.
on June 22, 2023, more than a year after the original requests were served,
Defendant moves the court to compel the discovery responses at issue.
 
On January 26,
2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of non-opposition stating that discovery
responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Requests for Production, Special
Interrogatories, and Statement of Damages had been provided on October 11,
2023. Consequently, the current motions are moot and are therefore DENIED.
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel contends that sanctions should not be imposed because the delays in
this case were unrelated to Plaintiff and resulted from his significant period
of illness. However, Defendant was more than accommodating, granting Plaintiff
over a year's worth of extensions before filing the current motions. Second,
during this extended period, Plaintiff’s counsel had sufficient opportunity to
either transfer the case to another attorney or withdraw from representation
but took no such action. Third, the purpose of awarding sanctions is to
compensate Defendant for the attorneys' fees incurred by having to file the
present motions after waiting more than a year for responses. Defendant
requests sanctions in the amount of $5,490 for all four motions. However,
considering the simplicity of the issues, the court exercises its discretion
and reduces the amount to $2,000. The Court ORDERS Plaintiff and his counsel, jointly and severally, to
pay sanctions of $2000.00 to Defendant within 20 days of today’s date.
