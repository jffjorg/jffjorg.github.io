DOUGLAS WESTHOFF
Motion:                    MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL
Moving Party:           Defendants
Responding Party:    Unopposed
Notice:                     Sufficient
 
Ruling:                     MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS GRANTED.
 
Legal Standard
 
Continuances of trials are disfavored, but
each request for a continuance must be considered on its own merits.¿ (CRC Rule 3.1332(c).)¿ The
Court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause
requiring the continuance.¿ (CRC
Rule 3.1332(c).) The Court may look to the following factors in determining
whether a trial continuance is warranted: (1) proximity of the trial date; (2)
whether there was any previous continuance of trial due to any party; (3) the
length of the continuance requested; (4) the availability of alternative means
to address the problem that gave rise to the motion; (5) the prejudice that
parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; and (6)
whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial.¿ (See generally CRC Rule 3.1332(d)(1)-(11).)¿ Additional factors for the Court to consider include: a party’s
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts; whether all parties have stipulated to a
continuance; and any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair
determination of the motion or application.¿ (CRC Rule 3.1332(c), (d).)
 
Factual Background and Analysis
 
On June 13, 2022, Plaintiff filed the present
trip and fall case. On June 20, 2023, Defendants Douglas Westhoff and Pamela
Westhoff filed their answer. On October 5, 2023, Defendant Kerry Welch filed
her answer. The current trial date is set for June 10, 2024. Defendants now
move the Court to continue the trial date by three months, arguing that they
need more time to conduct discovery. Plaintiff did not file an opposition
alleging prejudice.
 
Given that Defendants filed their answer on
June 20, 2023, and October 5, 2023, their request for additional time to
conduct discovery appears reasonable. Considering the age of the case, the
absence of multiple prior continuances, the lack of opposition alleging
prejudice, and the request for a short continuance of only three months, the
Court grants Defendants' motion to continue the trial date.
 
The new Trial
Date is set for September __, 2024, at 8:30
a.m. The Final Status Conference is continued to September __, 2024, at 10:00
a.m. All other case-related deadlines will follow the new trial date.
