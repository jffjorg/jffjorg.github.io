Ruling
 
Hearing Date:           4/17/2024 at 1:30 p.m.
Case No./Name.:      22STCV07583 DERRYL MINNER vs DAVID REYES
Motion Name:           MOTION TO COMPEL INITIAL RESPONSES TO REQUESTS
FOR PRODUCTION, SET THREE, AND MOTION FOR SANCTIONS
 
Moving Party:           Defendant Postmates, LLC 
Responding Party:    Plaintiff
Notice:                     Sufficient
 
Ruling:                     MOTION TO COMPEL INITIAL RESPONSES TO REQUESTS
FOR PRODUCTION, SET THREE, AND MOTION FOR SANCTIONS ARE DENIED
 
On March 2, 2022, Plaintiff filed the present
auto accident case. On February 27, 2024, Defendant Postmates served its
Requests for Production, Set Three, on Plaintiff. On March 12, Plaintiff served
timely unverified discovery responses consisting of only objections. On March
15, Defendant moved the court to compel initial responses, arguing that
Plaintiff’s responses are not timely because they are unverified. However, the
party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed shall sign the response under oath unless the response contains only
objections. (CCP 2031.250(a).) Since Plaintiff’s responses consist solely of
objections, they were timely, even without verifications. Should Defendant take
issue with Plaintiff’s objections, Defendant is required to meet and confer and
then attend an informal discovery conference (IDC) before filing a motion to
compel further. Defendant’s motion for sanctions is likewise denied for the
reasons above.
