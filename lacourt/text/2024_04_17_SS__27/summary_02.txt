And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for leave to obtain additional physical examination of plaintiff Mireya Lacayo and David Lacayo. The defendant seeks to conduct a second independent medical examination (IME) to assess the success of the spinal surgeries that the plaintiffs underwent in February and March 2024. The court finds that the second IME is necessary to verify the current state of the plaintiffs' health and recovery progress, and to determine the direct impact of the surgeries on the injuries claimed to be caused by the motor vehicle accident. The court also finds that the defendant needs this information to determine what future surgeries or treatments may be required. The plaintiffs argue that requiring them to undergo further examinations based solely on their decision to prioritize their health and well-being is unfair, but the court does not agree.
