And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, David S. Cunningham III, has issued a tentative ruling granting Brinker International Payroll Company LP's motion to stay the case Jones Fernandez (23STCV14269) pending the resolution of a motion for class certification in an earlier-filed federal case called Hale (3:21-cv-09978). The Judge agrees with Brinker that the stay is necessary due to the overlapping putative classes, similar certification issues, and same causes of action between the two cases. The stay will not prejudice Plaintiff Bella Ava Jones Fernandez, and will help to narrow the remaining certification issues, avoid inconsistent rulings, and boost comity. A status conference is set for early October 2024 to assess the status of the stay.
