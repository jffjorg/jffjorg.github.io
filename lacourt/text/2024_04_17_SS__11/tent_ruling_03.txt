Yes, the reason why Plaintiff cannot be compelled to arbitrate (she signed the
agreement as a minor and later disaffirmed it) is different than the reason why
the Hale putative class cannot be compelled to arbitrate (they signed
unconscionable agreements as adults), but the result is the same.  The Court’s understanding is that Plaintiff
and the Hale representatives seek to represent all employees
who cannot be compelled to arbitration. 
Overlap is inevitable.  
 
The only way it might not
be inevitable is if Plaintiff stipulates to shrink her class definition to
workers, like her, who signed the agreements as minors and disaffirmed as
adults.  Even then, the Hale class
definition might still encompass Plaintiff’s putative class.
 
The Court invites the
attorneys to discuss the impact of such a stipulation during oral arguments.
