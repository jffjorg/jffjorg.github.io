TENTATIVE RULING
 
Brinker’s motion to stay is granted.
 
BACKGROUND
 
The instant case – Jones
Fernandez (23STCV14269) – is a wage-and-hour putative class action.  
 
Here, Brinker moves to stay Jones
Fernandez pending resolution of a motion for class certification in an
earlier-filed federal case called Hale (3:21-cv-09978).
 
DISCUSSION
 
Brinker
 
Brinker contends the motion to stay should be granted based
on either the Court’s inherent authority or the doctrine of exclusive
concurrent jurisdiction because (1) Jones Fernandez and Hale
involve overlapping putative class members and allege the same class claims
(see Motion, pp. 1-3, 7), (2) the certification ruling in Hale will
narrow the certification issues in Jones Fernandez (see id. at pp. 4-5),
and (3) there is no prejudice (see id. at p. 5).
 
Plaintiff
 
Plaintiff disagrees. 
She contends the motion should be denied because (1) the putative
classes differ (see Opposition, pp. 4-6, 8), (2) some certification issues
differ and will not be resolved by the Hale ruling (see id. at pp. 8-9),
(3) Plaintiff and the putative class will suffer prejudice (see id. at pp.
6-8), (4) the doctrine of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction does not apply (see
id. at p. 8), and (5) a stay will undermine enforcement of the representative
Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) claim (see id. at pp. 9-10).
 
Reply
 
In reply, Brinker claims (1) Plaintiff’s putative class is
part of the Hale putative class (see Reply, pp. 1-2), (2) Plaintiff
fails to demonstrate that the doctrine of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction is
inapplicable (see id. at pp. 2-3), (3) Jones Fernandez should be stayed
to prevent duplication and inconsistent rulings and to promote comity (see id.
at pp. 3-4), and (4) a stay will not prejudice Plaintiff (see id. at pp. 4-5).
 
Law
 
Inherent Authority
 
Trial courts have inherent
authority to manage and control their proceedings, “including the inherent
authority to stay an action when appropriate . . . [to] overcome problems of
simultaneous litigation.”  (Jordache
Enterprises, Inc. v. Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison (1998) 18 Cal.4th
739, 758.)
 
Exclusive Concurrent
Jurisdiction
 
“Although the rule of exclusive concurrent
jurisdiction is similar in effect to the statutory plea in abatement, it
has been interpreted and applied more expansively, and therefore may apply
where the narrow grounds required for a statutory plea [in] abatement do not
exist.  [Citation.]”  (People ex rel. Garamendi v.
American Autoplan, Inc. (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 760, 770 (“Garamendi”).)  “Unlike the statutory plea [in] abatement, the
rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction does not require absolute identity
of parties, causes of action or remedies sought in the initial and subsequent
actions. [Citations.]”  (Ibid.)  “If the court exercising original jurisdiction
has the power to bring before it all the necessary parties, the fact that the
parties in the second action are not identical does not preclude application of
the rule.”  (Ibid.)  “Moreover, the remedies sought in the separate
actions need not be precisely the same so long as the court exercising original
jurisdiction has the power to litigate all the issues and grant all the relief
to which any of the parties might be entitled under the pleadings.”  (Ibid.)
 
Analysis
 
Given these rules, the Court
agrees with Brinker.  The following
factors – and, at minimum, the Court’s inherent authority – support granting
Brinker’s motion:
 
* Hale is the first-filed
case.
 
* Hale is more
advanced.  (See Opposition, pp. 3-4
[conceding that (1) hearing date
for certification in Hale is September 26, 2024, and (2) Plaintiff does
not need to file her certification motion in Jones Fernandez until April
4, 2025].)
 
* Brinker is the named Defendant
in both cases.
 
* The putative classes appear to overlap in that both include employees
who cannot be compelled to arbitrate their claims.  (See Rodriguez Decl., Ex. C, p. 2 [attaching
8/29/23 Hale Order Granting Motion to Compel Arbitration and Granting in
Part Motion to Strike Class Allegations, which limits the Hale class
definition to workers who signed unconscionable arbitration agreements]; see
also Opposition, pp. 4, 5 [asserting that Plaintiff signed the arbitration
agreement when she was a minor and subsequently disaffirmed it]; id. at 6
[acknowledging that some overlap may exist]; Reply, p. 2 [representing that
Plaintiff’s putative class is a subset of the Hale putative class].)[1]

 
* Hale and Jones
Fernandez assert numerous identical causes of action.  (See Motion, pp. 2-3.) 
 
* A stay will help to narrow the remaining certification issues, avoid inconsistent rulings, and boost
comity.
 
* Absent a stay, the courts will need to duplicate case
efforts on overlapping putative classes, similar certification issues, and the
same claims.
 
* The prejudice, if any, is minimal since Plaintiff will have sufficient
time, more than five months, to conduct discovery and to draft her
certification motion after the Hale court rules.
 
* Because the stay’s duration is modest, prosecution of the
representative PAGA claim will not be harmed.
 
The Court intends to set a status conference for early October 2024 to
assess the status of the stay.
 
The stay does not apply to mediation efforts.  (See Opposition, p. 3 [noting that the Court
set a November 7, 2024 mediation deadline in Jones Fernandez].)
