And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion to quash service of summons filed by the defendants Mullen, Brower, Morris, Alexaki, and Lynds. The judge finds that the defendants do not have sufficient contacts with California to establish personal jurisdiction. The judge notes that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the necessary jurisdictional criteria are met. The judge finds that the defendants' contacts with California are insufficient and that it would not be fair and just to assert jurisdiction over them. The judge orders that the defendants pay the outstanding four filing fees prior to the hearing.
