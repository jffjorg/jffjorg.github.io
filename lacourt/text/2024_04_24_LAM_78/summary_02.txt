And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has denied the defendant's motion to file a cross-complaint three years after the original motion was granted. The defendant, Arts District Patients Collective, Inc. (ADPC), alleges that it did not file the cross-complaint sooner because the plaintiff, 608 Mateo, LLC, changed its legal position repeatedly between 2019 and 2021. ADPC also claims that it found new information during discovery that contradicts the plaintiff's representations. However, the Court finds that ADPC delayed filing the cross-complaint in bad faith, despite the Court granting its first motion for leave to file a cross-complaint in 2022. The Court concludes that ADPC's delay is unacceptable and constitutes a bad faith attempt to delay proceedings and deprive other parties of the opportunity to defend against its cross-complaint.
