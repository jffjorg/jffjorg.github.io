And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to strike certain allegations in the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Nelson Enrique Vanegas Toro, filed a lawsuit against the defendants, Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc. and Hollister Co. California, LLC, alleging general negligence and intentional tort. The defendants moved to strike the plaintiff's claim for punitive and exemplary damages, arguing that the allegations did not set forth facts constituting "oppression, fraud, or malice" within the meaning of Civil Code section 3294.

The judge has denied the motion to strike, finding that the defendants lack standing to bring the motion because the plaintiff does not seek punitive damages against them. As a result, the motion is moot and the judge has denied it as such. The judge has given notice to the parties and has directed them to indicate their intention to submit on the tentative ruling.
