English-text summary:

Judge Theresa M. Traber issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiffs' Motion for Trial Preference in the case of 111 W7 Owner LLC et al. v. 1200 Management LLC. The Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendant refused to pay certain costs under purchase and sale agreements and lease agreements, and seek a declaration that the Defendant is obligated to pay these costs. The Court found that the Plaintiffs' claim for declaratory relief is not strictly a declaratory relief claim within the purview of Code of Civil Procedure section 1062.3, and that the relief sought by the Plaintiffs appears to run afoul of the standard for declaratory relief. The Court also found that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that there is some urgency requiring a speedy trial, and therefore denied the motion for trial preference.
