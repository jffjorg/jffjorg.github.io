 Case Number:  22STCV16462    Hearing Date:   December 17, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
May 18, 2022, Plaintiffs Erika Dominguez and James Roman Arevalo filed this
action against Defendants Deborah Sedarsky Nonberg (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50
for negligence. 
On
November 17, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
May 8, 2024, Plaintiffs The Estate of Erika Dominguez, by and through its
successor-in-interest Teresa Galdamez-Dominguez, and James Roman Arevalo filed a
first amended complaint against Defendant and Does 1-50 for wrongful death and
survival action damages sounding in negligence. 
On
May 8, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to deem admitted matters
specified in requests for admission, set one, served on Plaintiffs and deemed
the matters admitted.  The Court also granted
Defendant’s motions to compel discovery responses and awarded monetary sanctions. 
On
May 16, 2024, Defendant filed an answer to the first amended complaint. 
On
June 28, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. 
On
September 18, 2024, the Court appointed Monica
Jeannettee Vasquez to serve as Plaintiff James Roman Arevalo’s guardian ad
litem. 
On
November 8, 2024, Petitioner Monica Jeannettee Vasquez (“Petitioner”) filed a petition to approve the
compromise of minor Plaintiff James Roman
Arevalo’s claims.  The petition was set
for hearing on December 3, 2024.  The
Court continued the hearing to December 17, 2024. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of minor Plaintiff
James Roman Arevalo (“Plaintiff”). 
DISCUSSION 
          The petition states the following: The
gross settlement amount is $12,500.00. 
Because Plaintiff did not incur medical expenses, none of the settlement
proceeds will be used to pay or reimburse medical providers.  In addition, none of the settlement proceeds
will be used to pay attorney’s fees. 
$711.38 of the settlement proceeds will be used to pay counsel’s
non-medical expenses.  The net settlement
amount for Plaintiff is $11,788.62. 
Section 15 of the petition erroneously states that the
net settlement amount is $6,856.92.  Aside
from this error, Petitioner has submitted a complete petition with all
necessary information. 
With the understanding that the net settlement amount
is $11,788.62, not $6,856.92, the Court grants the
petition and orders that the net settlement proceeds of $11,788.62
are to be deposited in insured, blocked accounts at Bank
of America, Beverly-Wilshire Financial Center, 9454 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly
Hills, CA 90212 (310) 734-0321, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of
the Court. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS the petition to approve the
compromise of minor Plaintiff James Roman Arevalo’s claims filed by Petitioner Monica
Jeannettee Vasquez on November 8, 2024. 
The net settlement proceeds of $$11,788.62 are to be deposited in
insured, blocked accounts at Bank of America, Beverly-Wilshire Financial
Center, 9454 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, CA 90212 (310) 734-0321, subject to
withdrawal only on authorization of the Court.
