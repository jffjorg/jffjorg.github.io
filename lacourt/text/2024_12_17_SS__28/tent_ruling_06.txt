PARTY’S REQUEST 
Lincourt
asks the Court to consolidate case numbers 23STCV08313 and 22STCV31977. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 1048, subdivision (a),
provides: 
“(a) When actions involving a common question of law
or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of
any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions
consolidated and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may
tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1048,
subd. (a).) 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a), provides: 
“(a) Requirements of motion 
“(1)  A notice
of motion to consolidate must: 
“(A)  List all
named parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names
of their respective attorneys of record; 
“(B)  Contain
the captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest
numbered case shown first; and 
“(C)  Be filed
in each case sought to be consolidated. 
“(2)  The motion
to consolidate: 
“(A)  Is deemed
a single motion for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers
must be filed only in the lowest numbered case; 
“(B)  Must be
served on all attorneys of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the
cases sought to be consolidated; and 
“(C)  Must have
a proof of service filed as part of the motion.” 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a).) 
Los
Angeles County Superior Court Local Rule 3.3(g) provides: “(1) Cases may not be
consolidated unless they are in the same department. A motion to consolidate
two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in
different departments, have been related into a single department, or if the cases
were already assigned to that department. (2) Upon consolidation of cases, the
first filed case will be the lead case, unless otherwise ordered by the court.
After consolidation, all future papers to be filed in the consolidated case
must be filed only in the case designated as the lead case. (3) Before
consolidation of a limited case with an unlimited case, the limited case must
be reclassified as an unlimited case and the reclassification fee paid.” 
DISCUSSION 
Lincourt’s
motion to consolidate does not comply with the requirements of California Rules
of Court, rule 3.350(a).  Lincourt did
not file the notice of motion “in each case sought to be consolidated.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a)(1)(C).)  In
addition, while the “memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers
must be filed only in the lowest numbered case,” Lincourt filed these papers in
the higher numbered case.  Finally, the
motion does not “[l]ist all named parties in each case, the names of those who
have appeared, and the names of their respective attorneys of record.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a)(1)(A).) 
The
Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the motion to consolidate case numbers 23STCV08313 and 22STCV31977
filed by Defendant Carrie Lincourt.         
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
