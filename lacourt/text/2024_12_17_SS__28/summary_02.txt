And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant, McDonald's Restaurants of California, Inc., has failed to show that the person most knowledgeable about billing practices at Neurosurgical Associates Medical Group (NAMG) should comply with a deposition subpoena. The defendant had requested that the person most knowledgeable comply with the subpoena and also seek sanctions. The judge denied the motion, citing that the defendant had not shown that the deposition on October 21, 2024 was not feasible, despite NAMG providing an alternative date. The judge also noted that the defendant did not serve a deposition subpoena for the October 21, 2024 deposition.
