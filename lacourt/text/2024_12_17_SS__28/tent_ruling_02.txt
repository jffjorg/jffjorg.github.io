considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
A.   Previous proceedings 
On
October 19, 2021, Plaintiff Maria Socorro Ortega (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action against Defendants McDonald’s Restaurants of California, Inc.,
McDonald’s USA, LLC, and Does 1-50 for general negligence and premises
liability. 
On
November 23, 2021, Defendant McDonald's Restaurants of California, Inc. filed
an answer.  On November 29, 2021,
Defendant McDonald’s USA, LLC filed an answer. On September 10, 2024, the Court granted in part Defendant's ex parte application and continued the trial to January 24, 2025.  The Court denied Defendant's request to reopen discovery and related dates. 
On
November 26, 2024, the Court dismissed Defendant McDonald’s USA, LLC with
prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for January 24, 2025. 
B.   This motion 
On
October 28, 2024, Defendant McDonald’s Restaurants of California, Inc. (“Defendant”)
filed a motion to compel the person most knowledgeable about billing practices
at Neurosurgical Associates Medical Group (“NAMG”) to comply with a deposition
subpoena and for sanctions.  The motion
was set for hearing on December 17, 2024. 
No opposition has been filed. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Defendant
asks the Court to compel the person most knowledgeable about billing practices
at NAMG to comply with a deposition subpoena and to award sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“If
a subpoena requires the attendance of a witness or the production of books,
documents, electronically stored information, or other things before a court,
or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the
court, upon motion reasonably made by any person described in subdivision (b),
or upon the court’s own motion after giving counsel notice and an opportunity
to be heard, may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or
directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall
declare . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (a).) A party to an action
may bring a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.1, subdivision (a).
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (b)(1).) 
“In
California, discovery may be obtained from a nonparty through an oral
deposition, a written deposition, or a deposition for the production of
business records and things.” (Board of Registered Nursing v. Superior Court
of Orange County (2021) 59 Cal.App.5th 1011, 1030.) “To pursue the
deposition of a nonparty, a party must generally serve a deposition subpoena.”
(Ibid.) 
“[I]n
making an order pursuant to a motion made . . . under Section 1987.1, the court
may in its discretion award the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred in
making or opposing the motion, including reasonable attorney’s fees, if the
court finds the motion was made or opposed in bad faith or without substantial
justification or that one or more requirements of the subpoena was oppressive.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.2, subd. (a).) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   The complaint 
Plaintiff’s
complaint alleges that on November 5, 2019, at 555 E. Hardy Street, in
Inglewood, California, Plaintiff slipped and fell on liquid that was on the
floor, suffering injuries. 
B.   Defendant’s motion 
On January
22, 2024, Defendant personally served a deposition subpoena on NAMG.  NAMG did not respond and did not appear for
the February 20, 2024 deposition. 
On July 30,
2024, Defendant personally served another deposition subpoena on NAMG.  The deposition subpoena set a deposition for
NAMG’s person most knowledgeable on August 26, 2024.  NAMG’s counsel informed Defendant’s counsel that
NAMG would not be available on the date of the deposition.  NAMG’s counsel initially did not provide an alternative
date for the deposition. 
On August 27,
2024, Defendant’s counsel asked NAMG’s counsel for an available date for the
deposition. NAMG’s counsel responded that NAMG’s person most knowledgeable
would be available on October 21, 2024.  Defendant’s
counsel responded, “Anything sooner? 
Trial is set for Nov. 1.”  NAMG’s
counsel did not respond. 
Defendant
argues that, despite Defendant’s efforts to meet and confer with NAMG, NAMG has
not appeared for a deposition and has not provided alternative available dates. 
Yet on
August 27, 2024, NAMG provided the alternative deposition date of October 21,
2024.  Even though the trial was then scheduled
to begin on November 1, 2024, Defendant has not argued or shown that a
deposition of NAMG’s person most knowledgeable on October 21, 2024 was not
feasible.  Indeed, on September 10, 2024, the Court continued the trial to January 24, 2025.  Nonetheless, it appears that Defendant
did not serve a deposition subpoena for an October 21, 2024 deposition.  The Court will not assume that NAMG would
have failed to comply with a deposition subpoena to produce its person most
knowledgeable for a deposition on October 21, 2024. 
The Court
denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES Defendant McDonald’s Restaurants of
California, Inc.’s motion to compel the person most knowledgeable about billing
practices at Neurosurgical Associates Medical Group to comply with a deposition
subpoena and for sanctions. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
