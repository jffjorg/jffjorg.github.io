And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to lift the arbitration stay and proceed with the case in state court. The court finds that the defendant's failure to pay arbitration fees for more than eight months warrants lifting the arbitration stay. The court also sets a trial date for the case. The court rejects the defendant's argument that Brentanita was solely responsible for arbitration fees and finds that the defendant failed to provide any evidence to support this claim. The court also rejects the defendant's request for a 90-day continuance, finding that there is no basis to believe that Brentanita will pay the outstanding arbitration fees in the next 90 days.
