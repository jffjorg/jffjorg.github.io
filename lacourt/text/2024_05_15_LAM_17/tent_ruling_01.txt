LWL CO. INC.

FORD MOTOR COMPANY  
 


 Case No.: 
  23STCV13771 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  May 15, 2024
 



 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses is GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART,
consistent with the ruling set forth below. Given this conclusion, the Court
declines to award sanctions at this time. 
 
On June 14,
2023, LWL Co., Inc., (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against Ford Motor Company
(Defendant), alleging: (1) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability under
the Song-Beverly Act and (2) Breach of Express Warranty under the Song-Beverly
Act.
 
            On
1/31/2024, Plaintiff moved to compel further responses to Special
Interrogatories No. 14, 25, 40-46 and 55. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
argues that good cause exists to compel further responses to Special
Interrogatories No. 14, 25, 40-46 and 55.
 
-        
Special Interrogatory No.
14 seeks the identity of all persons who
performed warranty repairs upon the Subject Vehicle. The Court agrees that
Defendant’s response amounts to a “see documents.” Defendant must supplement
its response to specifically identify and summarize the contents of the responsive
documents. 
 
-        
Special Interrogatory No.
25 seeks the identity of all persons
responsible for the customer relations department in the district or region
having jurisdiction over Plaintiffs complaints during the relevant period. The
Court finds this request overbroad and irrelevant, and no further response is
necessary. 
 
-        
Special Interrogatory No.
40 seeks the identity of the individual(s)
whose responsibility it is to supervise to ensure that Defendant is properly
determining whether a vehicle should be repurchased or replaced pursuant to The
Song-Beverly Warranty Act. This request is overbroad, and exceeds the relevant,
but limited, scope of documents evidencing policies and
procedures used to evaluate customer requests. 
 
-        
Special Interrogatory No.
41 asks Defendant to describe with
particularity how the individual(s) identified in its response to Special
Interrogatory above perform their duties. Given that the Court determined SROG
No. 40 was overbroad, the Court determines Defendant need not supplement its
response here.  
 
-        
Special Interrogatory No.
42 asks Defendant to explain with
particularity all aspects of its investigation into whether the Subject Vehicle
qualified or was eligible for repurchase or replacement pursuant to the
Song-Beverly Warranty Act. The Court finds Defendant’s response is evasive and
must clarify whether or not an investigation took place, separate and apart
from whether or not Plaintiff contacted Defendant directly about
repurchase.  
 
-        
Special Interrogatory No.
43 asks Defendant to identify all persons
involved in its investigation of the Subject Vehicle. The Court finds
Defendant’s response is evasive and must clarify whether or not an
investigation took place, separate and apart from whether or not Plaintiff contacted
Defendant directly about repurchase.  
 
-        
Special Interrogatory No.
44 asks Defendant to identify all
documents consulted, reviewed, and/or obtained in its investigation. The Court
finds Defendant’s response is evasive and must clarify whether or not an
investigation took place, separate and apart from whether or not Plaintiff
contacted Defendant directly about repurchase. 

 
-        
Special Interrogatory No.
45 asks Defendant to state the name,
address, and telephone number of all persons responsible for the decision not
to repurchase or replace the subject vehicle. The Court finds Defendant’s
response is evasive and must clarify whether or not an investigation took
place, and who participated in the decision not to repurchase based on that
investigation, separate and apart from whether or not Plaintiff contacted
Defendant directly about repurchase.  
 
-        
Special Interrogatory No.
46 asks Defendant how many repair attempts
it believes it was afforded to fix the vehicle under the terms of the warranty.
The Court finds Defendant’s response to be sufficient. 
 
-        
Special Interrogatory No.
55 asks Defendant to state the total
number of days the Subject Vehicle was out of service for warranty repairs. The
Court finds Defendant’s response is not as straightforward and complete as
possible. Defendant must set forth the specific number of days. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses is granted in part,
denied in part, consistent with the ruling set forth above. Given this
conclusion, the Court declines to award sanctions at this time. 
 
 
 
 
It is so ordered.

LWL CO. INC. 
 
         vs.
 
FORD MOTOR COMPANY  
 


 Case No.: 
  23STCV13771 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  May 15, 2024
 



 
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel the deposition of Defendants’ PMK is DENIED. The Court
declines to award sanctions at this time. 
 
On June 14,
2023, LWL Co., Inc., (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against Ford Motor Company
(Defendant), alleging: (1) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability under
the Song-Beverly Act and (2) Breach of Express Warranty under the Song-Beverly
Act.
 
On 1/3/12023,
Plaintiff moved to compel the deposition of Defendants’ PMK.
 
Discussion 
 
            The
deposition of Defendant's PMK was initially noticed to go forward on October
16, 4 2023, but Ford did not to produce its PMK for deposition on that date.
Then, on 1/22/2024, Defendant offered to produce a PMK on 6/11/2024. Plaintiff
contends that meet and confer efforts to find a new date were unsuccessful.  
 
            Given
that Defendant does not object to the production of its PMK, and did, in fact,
offer a specific date for deposition to take place, the Court finds no basis to
grant this motion and declines to award sanctions at this time. Moreover, the
Court already ruled on Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to
Requests for Production, and has clearly indicated what materials it believes
are discoverable. 
 
In the event
that 6/11/2024 does not work for Plaintiff, Defendant is directed to produce a
list of 3 other available deposition dates within 15 days of entry of this
order. 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel the deposition of Defendant’s
PMK is denied. The Court declines to award sanctions at this time. 
 
It is so ordered.

         vs.
 
FORD MOTOR COMPANY  
 


 Case No.: 
  23STCV13771 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  May 15, 2024
 



 
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses is GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART. Accordingly,
the Court declines to award sanctions at this time. 
 
On June 14,
2023, LWL Co., Inc., (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against Ford Motor Company
(Defendant), alleging: (1) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability under
the Song-Beverly Act and (2) Breach of Express Warranty under the Song-Beverly
Act.
 
            On
1/31/2024, Plaintiff moved to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories
Nos. 12.1 and 17.1. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
argues that good cause exists to compel further responses to Form
Interrogatories Nos. 12.1 and 17.1:
 
Form
Interrogatory No. 12.1 seeks witnesses to the subject vehicle's defects,
whether they were involved in the diagnosis or repair or whether they handled
warranty claims for Ford which would demonstrate the need for repair for a
particular problem. (See Civil Code §§ 1793.2(d), 1793.22(e)(l).)
 
Form
Interrogatory No. 17.1 seeks information regarding Ford's claims and defenses
and the factual bases for them. Plaintiff is entitled to the facts Ford is
relying upon to support its contention that it complied with its obligations
under Song-Beverly and that it repaired the subject vehicle within a reasonable
number of repair opportunities. 
 
As for Form
Interrogatory No. 12.1, the Court agrees that Plaintiff is entitled to know who
these witnesses are in order to depose them and prepare for trial, and that
Ford should supplement its response to identify the technicians listed in the
records. However, the Court finds that Plaintiff failed to adequately meet and
confer with respect to the responses here. In opposition, Ford contends that
“Contrary to Plaintiff’s assertions in their Motion, Plaintiff never contacted
Ford regarding the subject vehicle prior to filing this lawsuit; therefore,
Ford could not supplement its Answer with individuals who communicated with
Plaintiff because there were none. Ford did, however, offer to supplement this
Interrogatory to specifically identify the technicians listed in the records if
Plaintiff’s counsel would agree that doing so would resolve their issues with
Ford’s Answer. Plaintiff ignored this offer and instead filed the instant
Motion.” (Opp., 2: 19-20) Accordingly, while the Court directs Ford to
supplement its response, the Court finds sanctions are not warranted with
respect to this request. 
 
As for Form
Interrogatory No. 17.1, the Court disagrees the responses are not "as
complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the
responding party permits." (C.C.P. § 2030.220(a), (b).) Ford has properly
responded or objected to each of Plaintiff’s requests, produced responsive
documents in its possession, custody, or control, and all of Ford’s responses
to Plaintiff’s discovery requests include objections that identify with
particularity the specific grounds for each objection.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses is granted in part,
denied in part. Accordingly, the Court declines to award sanctions. 
 
It is so ordered.
