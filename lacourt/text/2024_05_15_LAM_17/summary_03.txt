And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The defendant, American Credit Acceptance, has moved to compel arbitration of plaintiff Tasha McGhee's claims. The plaintiff did not oppose the motion, and the court has granted the defendant's motion. The court has ordered that the matter be stayed pending the completion of arbitration proceedings. The underlying contract between the parties includes an arbitration agreement, and the court has found that the plaintiff's claims arise from the vehicle purchase that was the subject of the underlying contract. The court has also found that the defendant has established by a preponderance of the evidence that an arbitration agreement exists and that the plaintiff's claims are covered by that agreement.
