  Case Number:  19STCV23068    Hearing Date:   January 15, 2025    Dept:  T 19STCV23068
ZHOU V SIADATAN
The tentative ruling of the court is to deny the motion to tax costs except
as to $180 in electronic filing fees. 
The moving party misunderstands the issue about necessity as it applies
to the depositions.  The depositions were
reasonably necessary to the preparation of the case.  That the case resulted in summary judgment is
irrelevant.  Once they appeared in the
case, they had to right to prepare as if the case were going to trial.  All of the costs asserted are allowable
costs.  The court finds the costs to be
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and the amount to be
reasonable The court grants the motion to tax the filing fees for the discovery
motions as those fees were requested as part of the motions.  Therefore, Item 1b in the sum of $180 is
stricken.
