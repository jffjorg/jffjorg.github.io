And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to tax costs, except for $180 in electronic filing fees. The judge finds that the depositions taken in the case were reasonably necessary for the preparation of the case, and that the case's outcome in summary judgment is irrelevant. The judge concludes that all costs asserted are allowable and reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and that the amount is reasonable. The judge grants the motion to tax the filing fees for the discovery motions, as those fees were requested as part of the motions.
