  Case Number:  23NWCV00487    Hearing Date:   December 24, 2024    Dept:  F Cureno, et al. v. American Honda Motor Co. 23NWCV00487
 
This lemon law action was filed on February 15, 2023. Trial
is currently scheduled to begin on January 22, 2025. Defendant’s Motion to
Compel the Vehicle Inspection is currently scheduled to be heard after trial,
on February 27, 2025. Defendant now moves ex parte to Continue Trial by four
months or, alternatively, to advance the hearing date on the Motion to Compel
Vehicle Inspection and continue trial for a shorter period. Defendant argues
good cause exists because both parties have yet to complete discovery.
Defendant’s counsel additionally indicates that Plaintiff’s counsel stipulates
to a continuance.
 
Moving party is advised that the ex parte application does
not include a proposed order as required by Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1201.  Nevertheless, Defendant’s ex parte application to Continue Trial
is GRANTED pursuant to California Rules of Court rule 3.1332(c)(6) – a
party's excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other
material evidence despite diligent efforts. A continuance for a trial date on
or after May 22, 2025, is reasonable. The Court will confer with the parties to
select a new trial date. The discovery cut-off will track the new trial date.
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’ alternative request to advance the hearing
date is DENIED. Moving Party to give notice.
