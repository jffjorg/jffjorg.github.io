And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to grant the defendant's ex parte application to continue the trial. The trial was originally scheduled to begin on January 22, 2025, but the defendant has requested a continuance due to the parties' failure to complete discovery. The Judge has found that the defendant has demonstrated good cause for the continuance, citing the party's excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts. A new trial date will be set, and the discovery cut-off will track the new trial date. The Judge has denied the defendant's alternative request to advance the hearing date on the Motion to Compel Vehicle Inspection.
