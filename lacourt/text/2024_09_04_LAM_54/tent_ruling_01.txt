BACKGROUND 
 
On April 7, 2023, Plaintiff Shana Smith filed the operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (“Metro”), and Felipe Gutierrez Olea, asserting causes
of action for (1) sexual harassment (Civ. Code, § 51.9), (2) sexual harassment
(Gov. Code, § 12940, et seq.), (3) hostile work environment (Gov. Code, §§
12940 & 820), (4) gender discrimination (Gov. Code, § 12940, et. seq.), (5)
failure to prevent harassment, discrimination, and retaliation (Gov. Code, §
12940, et. seq.), (6) negligent supervision and retention (Gov. Code, §§ 815.2
and 815.6), and (7) negligent infliction of emotional distress (Gov. Code, §§
815.2 and 815.6). 
 
The FAC alleges, among other things, that Plaintiff’s supervisor, Defendant
Olea, sexually harassed her during her employment.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to
provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order
to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to
resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25
Cal.4th 826, 843.) Trial judges are required “to grant summary judgment if all
the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the
evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there
is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992)
7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) 
 
As to each claim as framed by the complaint, the
defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof
by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a defense.
(CCP § 437c(p)(2).) Once the defendant has met that burden, “the burden shifts
to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Id.)  To establish a triable issue of material fact,
the party opposing the motion must produce “substantial responsive evidence.” (Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.) Courts “liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide,
Inc.¿(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)

STATEMENT OF FACTS
 
A.  
Defendants’ Separate Statement of Facts
 
On June 8, 2021, Plaintiff was hired by Metro as
a part-time bus operator at Division 8, where Felipe Gutierrez Olea, a Transit
Operations Supervisor, also was assigned. (UMF 1, 27, 53, 79, 105.) Olea,
trained in Metro’s Sexual Harassment Policies, had no prior criminal history or
complaints against him before Plaintiff’s complaint. (UMF 2, 28, 54, 80, 106;
UMF 3, 29, 55, 81, 107.) 
 
On October 25, 2021, Plaintiff and Olea exchanged
text messages in which Olea allegedly made inappropriate comments. (UMF 5, 31,
57, 83, 109; UMF 6, 32, 58, 84, 110.) On November 15, 2021, Plaintiff reported
the incident as a sexual harassment complaint to Division 8 management, leading
to an investigation by Metro’s Office of Civil Rights, Racial Equity &
Inclusion, Equal Employment Opportunity Unit. (UMF 8, 34, 60, 86, 112; UMF 9,
35, 61, 87, 113.)
 
On May 12, 2022, Metro informed Olea and
Plaintiff that the investigation found sufficient evidence of a policy
violation. (UMF 10, 36, 62, 88, 114.) A formal hearing for Olea was held on
June 3, 2022. (UMF 12, 38, 64, 90, 116.) Plaintiff was promoted to a full-time
bus operator on June 5, 2022, and transferred to Division 7 due to a lack of
full-time positions at Division 8. (UMF 13, 39, 65, 91, 117; UMF 14, 40, 66,
92, 118.) Plaintiff later requested a transfer back to Division 8, which was
granted on August 14, 2022. (UMF 16, 42, 68, 94, 120; UMF 18, 44, 70, 96, 122.)
 
Olea received a five-day suspension for his
conduct on June 20, 2022. (UMF 17, 43, 69, 95, 121.) Plaintiff filed a tort
claim for damages on November 9, 2022, followed by a Department of Fair Employment
and Housing (DFEH) complaint on March 29, 2023. Plaintiff initiated legal
proceedings on April 6, 2023. (UMF 19, 45, 71, 97, 123; UMF 20, 46, 72, 98,
124; UMF 21, 47, 73, 99, 125.)
 
Olea’s employment terms are governed by the
Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), which considers service length, service
quality, and progressive discipline. Given Olea’s clean prior record, his
conduct did not warrant termination, leading to a suspension as the chosen
disciplinary action. (UMF 23, 49, 75, 101, 127; UMF 24, 50, 76, 102, 128; UMF
25, 51, 77, 103, 129; UMF 26, 52, 78, 104, 130.)
 
B.  
Plaintiff’s Separate Statement of Facts 
 
Plaintiff first met Defendant Olea in July or early
August 2021. Olea requested her personal cell phone number to assist with her schedule
and work adjustments; Plaintiff provided it, because Olea had supervisory
control over her work and potential promotions. (PAMF 136, 138.) Between July
and October 2021, Olea invited Plaintiff to a bar and his family home, which
she declined. (PAMF 140.) On October 25, 2021, Olea started a text conversation
with Plaintiff, making comments that Plaintiff interpreted as sexually
suggestive, including a reference to “knee pads” which she understood to imply
performing oral sex to advance in her career. (PAMF 141, 142.) Plaintiff felt
threatened due to her probationary status and fear of retaliation. (PAMF 144.)
 
On Halloween, Olea referred to Plaintiff as “kitty”
while she was wearing cat ears, adding to her anxiety about job security. (PAMF
145.) Plaintiff filed a written complaint on November 12, 2021, with the
Director of Transportation. (PAMF 146, 147.) Following an investigation by Metro’s
Office of Civil Rights, the findings showed sufficient evidence of a policy
violation. (PAMF 148, 150. After the investigation, Plaintiff became a
full-time bus operator and requested a hardship transfer back to Division 8,
her home division. (PAMF 149.)
 
Olea remained a supervisor, and Plaintiff was
required to interact with him regularly, causing ongoing distress. (PAMF 151.)
Plaintiff faced retaliation, including a three-day unpaid suspension and
multiple “random” drug tests, which impacted her work schedule. (PAMF 152.) On
November 17, 2023, Plaintiff received a suspension that prevented her from
being promoted due to two incidents within an 18-month period. (PAMF 152.) She
faced unequal treatment compared to other bus operators who were not suspended
without pay for similar incidents. (PAMF 152.) The suspension was issued by
Donald Mackenzie, Division Manager, who also supervised Olea and Jennifer
Hopkins, another TOS who allegedly made sexually explicit comments to Plaintiff.
(PAMF 152.)
 
ANALYSIS
 
C.  
Second Cause of Action for Sexual Harassment
 
The Fair Employment and Housing Act prohibition
on harassment states: “It is an unlawful employment practice. . . .[f]or an
employer, labor organization, employment agency, apprenticeship training
program or any training program leading to employment, any other person,
because of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical
disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital
status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual
orientation, or military veteran status, to harass an employee, an applicant,
an unpaid intern or volunteer, or person providing services pursuant to a
contract.” (Govt. Code, § 12940(j)(1).) A hostile work environment is a
recognized form of harassment. To establish a hostile work environment,
harassment must be so severe or pervasive as to alter the conditions of the
victim’s employment and create an abusive working environment based on the
protected characteristic. (See Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1045,
1043.) Harassment must be of a repeated, routine, or generalized nature when
the harassing conduct is not severe. (See Lyle v. Warner Bros. Television
Productions (2006) 38 Cal.4th 264, 283.) Harassment that is occasional,
isolated or sporadic is insufficient. (See id.)  
 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff's Second Cause of
Action for Sexual Harassment is duplicative of her Third Cause of Action for
Hostile Work Environment, warranting summary adjudication. They contend that both
causes of action are based on the same allegations against the same Defendants,
Metro and Olea. Defendants say that sexual harassment claims are generally
classified into two categories: quid pro quo and hostile work environment, but
the Second Cause of Action refers to the creation or maintenance of a hostile
work environment, so it is not a separate sexual harassment claim. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that there
are sufficient disputed facts to show that the Second Cause of Action is a
separate and distinct cause of action. Plaintiff also argues there are
sufficient facts to demonstrate a hostile work environment, including her
transfer, continued interaction with Olea, additional harassing comments by
another supervisor, and multiple random drug tests and a three-day suspension
without pay. 
 
Summary adjudication on harassment claims is
disfavored, and whether an employee was subjected to a hostile work environment
is typically a question of fact. (Nazir v. United Airlines (2009) 178
Cal.App.4th 243, 263.) As noted, California courts recognize two categories of
sexual harassment: quid pro quo and hostile work environment. (Hicks v.
Gates Rubber Co. (10th Cir. 1987) 833 F.2d 1406, 1413.) Quid pro quo
harassment involves making submission to sexual conduct a condition of
employment benefits; a hostile work environment involves conduct that is severe
or pervasive enough to interfere with the use and enjoyment of the workplace. (Fisher
v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 607; Brown v.
Smith (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 767, 781-782.) 
 
The Court finds that there are triable issues of
fact concerning the second cause of action. Plaintiff’s transfer, coupled with
the continued interaction with Olea after his inappropriate comments, along
with evidence of repeated harassment by other supervisors, multiple random drug
tests, and a three-day unpaid suspension, create a pattern of adverse actions
that is sufficient to support a sexual harassment claim, which may be distinct
from a hostile work environment claim.
 
D.  
Fourth Cause of Action for Gender Discrimination
 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s Fourth Cause of
Action for Gender Discrimination fails because Plaintiff cannot prove an “adverse
employment action.” To establish a discrimination claim, a plaintiff must show:
(1) membership in a protected class, (2) qualification for the position or
competent performance, (3) suffering an adverse employment action, and (4)
circumstances suggesting a discriminatory motive. (Guz v. Bechtel Nat’l,
Inc. (2000) 24 Cal. 4th 317, 355.) An “adverse employment action” requires
a substantial adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment. (Holmes
v. Petrovich Development Co., LLC (2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1063.) Defendants
contend that harassment, discrimination, failure to investigate, and failure to
reinstate are separate causes of action and cannot be considered “adverse
employment actions” for a discrimination claim. 
 
In claims of discrimination under FEHA the burden
on the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case is light, requiring only
minimal evidence to raise a reasonable inference of discrimination. (Sandell
v. Taylor-Listug, Inc. (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 297, 310.) Plaintiff’s Fourth
Cause of Action includes claims of both unlawful gender discrimination and
hostile work environment, which often are pleaded jointly because they can
overlap. (Roby v. McKesson Corp. (2009) 47 Cal.4th 686, 709; Lyle v.
Warner Brothers Television Productions (2006) 38 Cal.4th 264, 278.) Plaintiff
asserts multiple adverse actions, including her forced transfer to a division more
than an hour away, a three-day unpaid suspension, and repeated random drug
tests, all of which occurred after she complained about sexual harassment.
(PAMF 152.) Plaintiff asserts that these actions collectively constitute
adverse employment actions. 
 
The Court finds that there are triable issues of
fact on whether Plaintiff suffered an adverse action. Plaintiff’s transfer,
three-day unpaid suspension, and numerous random drug tests, all following her
complaint of sexual harassment, are adverse employment actions. They are sufficient
to create a triable issue of fact as to whether Plaintiff suffered an adverse
employment action.
 
E.  
Fifth Cause of Action for Failure to Prevent
Discrimination and Retaliation
 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s Fifth Cause of
Action for Failure to Prevent Discrimination and Retaliation fails because,
under Government Code § 12940(k), an employer is liable only if there is an
actual underlying violation of discrimination or retaliation. A claim for
failure to prevent discrimination or harassment cannot succeed if the
underlying discrimination did not occur. (Trujillo v. N. Cty. Transit Dist. (1998)
63 Cal. App. 4th 280.) Defendants contend that since Plaintiff’s gender
discrimination claim fails due to the lack of an adverse employment action, the
Fifth Cause of Action also must fail. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues under Government
Code section 12940(j)(1) employers must take all reasonable steps to prevent
harassment, and section 12940(k) makes it unlawful for employers to fail to
prevent discrimination and harassment. These provisions create causes of action
when coupled with actual acts of discrimination or harassment. An employer’s
awareness of sexually harassing conduct triggers a duty to take prompt
corrective action that is reasonably calculated to end the harassment. This
includes temporary steps to address the situation and permanent steps to
prevent future harassment after the investigation (Swenson v. Potter
(9th Cir. 2001) 271 F.3d 1184, 1192; Bradley v. California Dept. of
Corrections & Rehab. (1997) 158 Cal.App.4th 1612, 1630.) 
 
As discussed above, the Court has found triable
issues of fact as to Plaintiff’s sexual harassment claim. Plaintiff also may
maintain her fifth cause of action for failure to prevent discrimination and
retaliation. A jury may find that Defendants did not take all reasonable steps
to prevent the alleged conduct, as required under Government Code sections
12940(j)(1) and 12940(k). 
 
F.   
Sixth Cause of Action for Negligent Supervision
and Retention; Seventh Cause of Action for Negligent Infliction of Emotional
Distress
 
Defendants’ Motions for Summary Adjudication as
to Causes of Action 6 (Negligent Supervision and Retention) and 7 (Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress) are moot. Plaintiff dismissed these causes of
action on July 17, 2024.
