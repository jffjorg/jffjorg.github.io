And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants (Darryl Wong, 3344 Rowens Avenue LLC, and Emily Aspland) is granted, except for Defendant Aspland's joinder motion.

The defendants contend that their activities, which included filming activities authorized by permits from the City of Los Angeles, did not constitute a private nuisance. The Judge finds that the defendants have met their initial burden of proof and that the plaintiff (Skyler Wells) has not shown a triable issue of fact to establish a private nuisance claim.

The Judge also finds that the defendants have not participated in the alleged wrongful acts by Aspland and FilmL.A., and that the plaintiff has not shown a triable issue of fact on the issue of landlord's nonliability.

The joinder motion filed by Defendant Aspland is denied because she did not provide her own separate statement supporting the motion.

The Judge's ruling is based on the evidence presented, including the fact that the filming activities occurred for only 48 out of the 417 days during the subject period, and that the plaintiff had advance notice of the filming activities. The Judge also considered the City of Los Angeles's issuance of 21 film permits to FilmL.A. between September 13, 2021, and November 15, 2022.
