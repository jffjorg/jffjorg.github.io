And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to its Requests for Production, but only partially. The plaintiff had requested communications related to the June 2022 reorganizing transactions that suspended the tax credits allocated by the plaintiff. The defendant argued that these communications were irrelevant and unduly burdensome, but the court finds that they may lead to admissible evidence about how the execution of the June 2022 Purchase Agreement impacted the terms of the contract. The court orders the defendant to provide code-compliant responses to the disputed requests within 30 days, except for documents created between June 1, 2021, and the filing of the complaint, and with certain narrowing of the language used in the requests. The court also finds that the defendant was substantially justified in opposing the motion and awards no sanctions.
