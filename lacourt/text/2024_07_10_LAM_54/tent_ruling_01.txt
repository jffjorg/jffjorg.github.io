BACKGROUND
 
            On January 9,
2023, Plaintiff Skyler Wells filed the operative first amended complaint
against Defendants Darryl Wong, 3344 Rowens Avenue LLC, and Emily Aspland,
asserting causes of action for (1) private nuisance; and (2) injunctive relief.

 
EVIDENTIARY MOTION
 
Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice of Exhibits A-D is granted
under Evidence Code §451(a).  Plaintiff’s
request for judicial notice of Exhibit E is granted under Evidence Code § 452(c).
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
“The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide
courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties' pleadings in order to
determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to
resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25
Cal.4th 826, 843.) Trial judges are required “to grant summary judgment if all
the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the
evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there
is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the complaint, the defendant
moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof by
presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a defense.
(CCP § 437c(p)(2).) Once the defendant has met that burden, “the burden shifts
to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Id.)  To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce “substantial
responsive evidence.” (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in
support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning
the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006)
39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
 
A. Private
Nuisance 
            
To establish an action for private
nuisance, (1) “the plaintiff must prove an interference with his use and
enjoyment of his property”; (2) “the invasion of the plaintiff’s interest in
the use and enjoyment of the land must be substantial, that is, that it causes
the plaintiff to suffer substantial actual damage”; (3) “the interference with
the protected interest must not only be substantial, but it must also be
unreasonable, i.e., it must be of such a nature, duration, or amount as to
constitute unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the land.” (Mendez
v. Rancho Valencia Resort Partners, LLC (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 248, 262-263,
citations, italics, brackets, and quotation marks omitted.) 
 
Defendants contend that their
activities cannot constitute a private nuisance because the filming activities
were expressly authorized by permits from the City of Los Angeles. Defendants also
argue that Plaintiff cannot establish that the filming activities rose to the
level of Nuisance. 
 
Defendant provides evidence that
from the entire period between September 13, 2021, to November 15, 2022 Defendant
owned a two-unit apartment building at 3344-3346 Rowena Ave., Los Angeles. Darryl
Wong is the manager of 3344 Rowena Avenue LLC, which is owned by him and his
immediate family. Aspland began a tenancy at Rowena 3344 in 2013 and continued
a month-to-month lease. Plaintiff lived at 3345 ½ Rowena Avenue. 
 
Aspland made 3344 Rowena available
to production companies for filming activities. The filming activities were
permitted by the City of Los Angeles through FilmL.A., the official film office
for the Greater Los Angeles region. A total of 21 permits were issued between
September 13, 2021, and November 15, 2022. All the filming activities were done
within the permitted scope. Filming activities occurred for only 48 out of the
417 days during the Subject Period. Plaintiff had advance notice of the filming
activities. Each time, about two business days in advance, FilmL.A. would
distribute an official “Notice of Filming” to all residences and businesses in
the area near the filming location. These “Notices of Filming” contained
details regarding when the filming done and whom the community members could
call to share any concerns. After November 15, 2022, no filming occurred at
3344 Rowena. 
 
The evidence shows that Aspland
and FilmLA’s filming activities were not unreasonable; they were done by permit
and Plaintiff and other residents and businesses were given notice. Defendants
have met their initial burden.  
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues
that a filming permit is not a statute. Plaintiff provides evidence that during
the subject period, a filming notice was not provided for many of the 21 permit
numbers with Distributed status in the FilmLA Filming Frequency Report. During
the Filming Period, Aspland filming activities exceeded the dates, hours,
locations, crew count, and cast count associated with the terms & scope of
the 21 permit numbers.  
 
This shows a triable issue of fact.
Plaintiff’s evidence directly contradicts Defendant’s contention that the
filming activities did not exceed the scope of the permits. The court cannot
grant summary judgment on this basis.
 
B. Rule of Landlord Non-Liability 
 
Defendants alternatively argue
that Wong should not be liable for Aspland’s filming activities under the rule
of landlord's nonliability. 
“Generally, ‘a landlord is not
responsible to other parties for the misconduct or injurious acts of his tenant
to whom his estate has been leased for a lawful and proper purpose when there
is no nuisance ... at the time of the leasing.’ (Anderson v. Souza
(1952) 38 Cal.2d 825, 831; see also Napolin v. Hotel Rose (1955) 137
Cal.App.2d 701, 706; Mundt v. Nowlin (1941) 44 Cal.App.2d 414, 415–416.)
In Kalis v. Shattuck (1886) 69 Cal. 593, the court held: ‘ “To bring
liability home to the owner of real property ... the nuisance must be one which
is in its very essence and nature a nuisance at the time of the letting, and
not something which is capable of being thereafter rendered a nuisance by the
tenant.”’ (Id. at p. 597.) Limited exceptions to the general rule of
nonliability may hold the landlord responsible where the landlord ‘participated
in the wrongful act by authorizing or permitting it to be done’ (Id. at
p. 600), or where the landlord failed to conduct a reasonable inspection of the
premises before renewing a lease (Burroughs v. Ben's Auto Park, Inc. (1945)
27 Cal.2d 449, 453–454).”  (Chee v.
Amanda Goldt Property Management (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1360, 1373,
parallel citations omitted.)
Defendants’ evidence shows
that Plaintiff issued two cease and desist letters on October 6, 2022, and
November 14, 2022. In both instances, Wong states that he never received the
letters from Plaintiff and that the address on the letters was not his address.
Defendants have shifted the burden to Plaintiff to show a triable issue of
fact. 
Plaintiff’s opposition argues
that under the theory of constructive notice Defendant knew about the filming
activities. Plaintiff provided evidence that the letters were addressed to
"Darryl Wong and/or Owners, 3344 Rowena Avenue, Los Angeles, CA
90027." 
This does not present a
triable issue of fact. As discussed, Defendants provided evidence that the
landlord was not aware of and did not participate in the alleged wrongful acts
by Aspland and FilmLA. Wong and 3344 Rowena Avenue LLC have shown that they did
not receive the notice to cease and desist. Plaintiff provides no evidence
disputing this. Plaintiff has not shown a triable issue of fact on the issue of
landlord’s nonliability. 
C. Aspland’s
Joinder Motion
 
            Defendant Aspland moves to join Wong and 334 Rowena Avenue LLC’s motion, with exception to
argument D. Each moving party shall support [the] motion for summary judgment
with a separate statement.” (Frazee v. Seely (2002) 95 CA4th 627, 636,
115 CR2d 780, 786 (emphasis in original); see Barak v. Quisenberry Law Firm
(2006) 135 CA4th 654, 661, 37 CR3d 688, 693—joining party should provide
evidence.) Aspland does not provide her own separate statement supporting the
motion. In any event, the Court has found triable issues of fact as to the
private nuisance claim.
