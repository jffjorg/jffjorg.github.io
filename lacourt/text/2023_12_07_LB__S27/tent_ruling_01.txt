  Case Number:  19LBCV00161    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  S27 Defense Counsel, Jenos Firouznam-Heidari,
attorney for Defendants, Direct Automotive Corporation, NK Financing Corporation,
and Car Credit Auto Sales Corporation, seeks to be relieved as counsel,
contending there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship such that
further representation is not possible.  
 
Counsel declares each client’s
address has been confirmed by conversation, and Counsel has filed proof of
service of the moving papers on all parties and all clients.  The time for opposition has run, and the
Court has not received opposition to the motions.  There is an OSC re: bankruptcy status on
calendar on 1/10/24, but no trial date in the action has been set, and therefore
there will be no prejudice to Defendants if the motions are granted.  
 
In light of the lack of opposition
and the lack of prejudice, the motions are granted.  The ruling will be effective upon filing
proof of service of the final order with the Court.  
 
Moving Defense Counsel is ordered
to give notice.
