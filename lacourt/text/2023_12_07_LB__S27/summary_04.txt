And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint is overruled. The plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that the defendant's website is a "place of public accommodation" and that the lack of closed captioning is a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The court finds that the plaintiff has alleged a sufficient nexus between the website and the physical place of public accommodation, and that the plaintiff has standing to bring a claim under the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the California Disabled Persons Act. The court also finds that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a claim under the ADA, and that the defendant's arguments about the lack of closed captioning are not persuasive. The court orders the defendant to answer the complaint in 20 days.
