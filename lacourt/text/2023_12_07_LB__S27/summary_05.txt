And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a dispute over discovery motions. The defendant had propounded various discovery requests and the plaintiff had failed to respond in a timely manner. The defendant moved to compel the plaintiff's responses, which the plaintiff opposed. The judge found that the defendant's motions were substantively moot because the plaintiff had served responses to the outstanding discovery on the same day as the defendant's moving papers. The judge also found that the plaintiff had failed to state reasons for the delayed responses.

The judge denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, as the plaintiff had not responded to meet and confer efforts and had failed to timely serve responses. The judge, however, found that the defendant had given the plaintiff sufficient notice of its intent to seek sanctions and therefore imposed sanctions on the plaintiff and his attorney. The sanctions include an award of $1000 in attorneys' fees, $92 in filing fees, and $1092 in costs, to be paid within 20 days.
