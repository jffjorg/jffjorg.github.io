Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The ruling is based on the parties' pleadings and the judge's own research.

The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend on several grounds:

* The demurrer on the ground that TMH, LLC is a cancelled entity is overruled.
* The demurrer on the ground that Shokr and TMH are not proper parties to the lawsuit is sustained, but leave to amend is granted if the plaintiffs can plead the existence of a duty, whether as third-party beneficiaries or otherwise.
* The demurrer on the ground that the conversion cause of action is not properly pled is sustained, but leave to amend is granted if the plaintiffs can re-plead the cause of action, omitting the claim for conversion of monies paid to third parties.
* The demurrer on the ground that the fraud cause of action is not properly pled is sustained, but leave to amend is granted if the plaintiffs can add allegations showing knowledge of falsity and clarify the nature of the damages sought.
* The demurrer on the ground that the breach of oral contract claim fails is sustained without leave to amend.

The judge has also granted the motion to strike several allegations:

* The motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages is granted with leave to amend if the plaintiffs can allege conduct on the part of the defendant, in his individual capacity, that supports imposition of punitive damages.
* The motion to strike the prayer for noneconomic damages is granted with leave to amend if the plaintiffs can properly allege claims sounding in tort.
* The motion to strike all references to an accounting is granted without leave to amend.
* The motion to strike all references to TMH being free of incumbrances is granted without leave to amend.

The judge has ordered the plaintiffs to file a Second Amended Complaint within 20 days and the defendant to file a responsive pleading within the statutory time thereafter. The parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so.
