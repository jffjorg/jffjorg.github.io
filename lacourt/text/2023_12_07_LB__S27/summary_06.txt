And here is the English-text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling concerns a motion to compel responses to special requests for outstanding goods (SROGs) and imposition of sanctions. The Plaintiff propounded SROGs on the Defendant, who responded with objections. The Plaintiff then filed a motion to compel responses without objections and imposed sanctions. The Defendant argues that his responses were untimely due to a clerical error and seeks to relieve waiver of objections. The Court finds that the motions are substantively moot since the Defendant served responses the same day the motion was filed. Additionally, the Court encourages the parties to resolve the issues without law and motion practice. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's conduct was unreasonable and will not award sanctions. The motion is denied, and the parties are instructed to submit on the tentative or appear remotely at the hearing.
