And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This judge's tentative ruling addresses the increasing number of motions to compel further responses and PMK depositions in lemon law cases. The court has seen a dramatic increase in these motions and believes that counsel for both parties can easily resolve the issues with the help of the court's prior rulings. The court has ruled on similar motions in other cases and finds that the attorneys in these lemon law cases are acting in a way that does not benefit their clients. The court expects counsel to meet and confer before the continued hearing on the motion and will allow them to file a joint statement of items that remain in dispute if they cannot resolve all issues. The court also warns that if the parties do not resolve their issues, they will be required to file briefs and declarations detailing their efforts to meet and confer and making any arguments against imposition of sanctions.
