Defendant to give notice. 

 

 
Background
 
This is a dispute
arising in connection with the work of Defendant Sonia I. Zaldivar (“Zaldivar”)
as an Immigration Consultant in California. Immigrant Rights Defense Council,
LLC (“Plaintiff”) alleges that Defendant failed to comply with the Immigration
Consultants Act of California (“ICA”) when she operated as an Immigration
Consultant.  
 
Plaintiff brings this claim for an
injunction on behalf of the general public as authorized by Business & Professions
Code § 22446.5(a).¿ Plaintiff asserts that Defendant has violated multiple
provisions of ICA
and, as such, Plaintiff is entitled to obtain an injunction on behalf of the
general public.¿¿
On June
14, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”)
alleging a single cause of action for injunctive relief for violation of the
Immigration Consultant Act (“ICA”). Plaintiff also filed a Doe amendment,
adding Z Legal Services Inc. (“Z Legal”) as a Defendant. 
On August 8 and 9, 2023,
Defendant Zaldivar filed Motions to Compel Further Response to Special
Interrogatories (“SROGS”), for Set 1 and Set 2. Plaintiff opposed the motions
on September 21, 2023.  Defendant filed reply
briefs on September 28 and 29, 2023.  
 
On September 19,
2023, the court entered a default against Zaldivar.  On November 6, 2023, the court granted
Zaldivar’s motion to set aside the September 19, 2023, entry of default.   
 
MOTION TO COMPEL
FURTHER DISCOVERY RESPONSES
 
I.         Legal Standard 
 
On receipt of a
response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that: (1) an
answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete; (2) an exercise
of the option to produce documents under CCP § 2030.230 is unwarranted or the
required specification of those documents is inadequate; or (3) an objection to
an interrogatory is without merit or too general. (CCP § 2030.300(a).) The
responding party has the burden of justifying its objections. (Coy v.
Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-21.)¿ 
 
Notice of a motion to
compel further must be given 45 days of service of the response or any
supplemental response, or on or before any specific later day to which the
propounding party and responding party may have agreed in writing. (CCP §
2030.300(c).)¿Finally, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345 requires that all
motions or responses involving further discovery contain a separate statement
with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of factual and
legal reasons for compelling further responses. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1345(a)(3)).¿¿ 
 
II.         Request for Judicial Notice 
 
The Court may
take judicial notice of records of any court of record of the United States.
(Evid. Code, § 452(d)(2).) However, the court may only judicially notice the
existence of the record, not that its contents are the truth. (Sosinsky
v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.) 
 
Defendant
Zaldivar requests judicial notice of the following: 
 
Exhibit F: A true and correct copy of Plaintiff's Reply to
Defendant's Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Terminating Sanctions, served
on July 20, 2023.  Defendant is seeking
judicial notice of only part of the document; namely, page 7, lines 14-28.
 
Exhibit G: A true and correct copy of Plaintiff's
Opposition to a motion to disqualify Plaintiff's counsel, Mr. Medvei, filed on
June 23, 2020, in LASC Case Number 20STCV00503, captioned as Immigrant
Rights Defense Council, LLC v. Joe Renderos Iraheta, et al. Defendant is
seeking judicial notice of only part of the document; namely, the Declaration
of Sebastian Medvei, page 6, lines 2-12. 
Exhibit M: A true and correct copy of Plaintiff's Reply to
Defendant's Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Terminating Sanctions, served
on July 20, 2023.  Defendant is seeking
judicial notice of only part of the document; namely, page 7, lines 14-28.
Exhibit N: A true and correct copy of Plaintiff's
Opposition to a motion to disqualify Plaintiff's counsel, Mr. Medvei, filed on
June 23, 2020, in LASC Case Number 20STCV00503, captioned as Immigrant
Rights Defense Council, LLC v. Joe Renderos Iraheta, et al. Defendant is
seeking judicial notice of only part of the document; namely, the Declaration
of Sebastian Medvei, page 6, lines 2.
 
Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice as to Exhibit F
and M are granted but denied as to Exhibit G and N, because the contents of a declaration
are reasonably subject to dispute and not a proper subject for judicial notice.
(See Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell, Green,
Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 882 [“Courts may not
take judicial notice of allegations in affidavits, declarations and probation
reports in court records because such matters are reasonably subject to dispute
and therefore require formal proof.”].) 
 
III.      Discussion 
 
            A.        MTCF Responses to SROGS, Set 1
 
Defendant Zaldivar seeks
further response to SROGS, Set 1 not because the responses themselves are
deficient, but because Plaintiff’s counsel, Sebastian M. Medvei, signed the
discovery verifications. 
 
CCP § 2030.250 states
that “[t]he party to whom the interrogatories are directed shall sign the
response under oath unless the response contains only objections.” In responding
to Plaintiff’s SROGS, Set 1, Plaintiff’s counsel responded as an agent of
Plaintiff and “waive[d] any lawyer-client privilege and any protection for work
product [] during any subsequent discovery from that attorney concerning the
identity of the sources of the information contained in the response.” (CCP §
2030.250(b).) Therefore, attorney-client privilege and work product privilege are
waived as to any questions contained in SROGS, Set 1. 
 
An attorney cannot verify a response on
behalf of an individual party. [Citation] However, an attorney may verify a
response as officer or agent of a corporate party. (§§ 2030.250, subd. (b);
2033.260, subd. (b).) Doing so, however, will constitute a limited waiver of
the attorney-client and work product privileges, ‘during any subsequent
discovery from that attorney concerning the identity of the sources of the
information contained in the response.’ (§§ 2030.250 (b); 2033.260(b).)
 
(Melendrez v. Superior Court
(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1343, 1351; see also CCP § 2030.250.)
 
Plaintiff’s counsel
can verify Plaintiff’s responses to SROGS, Set 1. Consequently, the responses
to SROGS, Set 1 are not made deficient by the fact that the responses were
verified by Plaintiff’s counsel acting as an agent for Plaintiff. 
 
California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345 requires that a separate statement be filed whenever a
motion to compel further responses to interrogatories is made. Section C of
rule 3.1345 states the requirements of the contents of a separate statement: 
 
The
separate statement must be full and complete so that no person is required to
review any other document in order to determine the full request and the full
response. Material must not be incorporated into the separate statement by
reference. The separate statement must include-for each discovery request
(e.g., each interrogatory, request for admission, deposition question, or
inspection demand) to which a further response, answer, or production is
requested-the following:
(1)  The text of the request,
interrogatory, question, or inspection demand;
(2)  The text of each
response, answer, or objection, and any further responses or answers;
(3)  A statement of the
factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses, answers, or
production as to each matter in dispute;
(4)  If necessary, the text
of all definitions, instructions, and other matters required to understand each
discovery request and the responses to it;
(5)  If the response to a
particular discovery request is dependent on the response given to another
discovery request, or if the reasons a further response to a particular
discovery request is deemed necessary are based on the response to some other
discovery request, the other request and the response to it must be set forth;
and
(6)  If the pleadings, other
documents in the file, or other items of discovery are relevant to the motion,
the party relying on them must summarize each relevant document.
 
Here, Defendant Zaldivar’s
separate statement is woefully deficient because it makes references to Exhibit
E, which is not included in the separate statement but is instead an attachment
to the Motion. Exhibit E provides only Plaintiff’s response and not the text of
the interrogatories, which would allow the court to ascertain if Plaintiff’s
response to the interrogatory is incomplete or evasive. Moreover, both of
Defendant Zaldivar’s discovery motions failed to “identify the interrogatories, demands, or requests by set and
number.” (CRC Rule, 3.1345(b).
 
Searching through
Defendant Zaldivar’s papers, in Exhibit D, offered in support of the parties
meet and confer effort, the court found that Plaintiff was responding to this
interrogatory: 
 
State
the date of each alleged violation of the Immigration Consultant Act that YOU
allege in YOUR Complaint, in addition to all facts relating to each alleged
violation. 
 
(See Exhibit E, SROGS, Set 1, No. 4.) 
 
Plaintiff’s response is as follows: 
 
As to
the Business and Professions Code section 22441(d) violations, Plaintiff is
informed and believes that those violations have been ongoing from the
inception of the business to the present. Plaintiff is informed and believes
that those violations continue to this date because Defendant continues to advertise
those services. As to the Business and Professions Code section 22442
violations, Plaintiff is unable to determine when the violations occurred
because Defendant has refused to respond to Request for Production No. 1,
whether those violations have actually occurred-Plaintiff is, however, in
possession of circumstantial evidence of noncompliance by virtue of Defendant's
refusal to comply with discovery. The date of discovery of this circumstantial evidence
is the date of receipt by Plaintiffs counsel of Defendant's responses to the
discovery. As to the Business and Professions Code section 22442.1 violations,
Plaintiff is unable to determine, because Defendant has refused to respond to
Request for Production No. 2, whether those violations have actually
occurred-Plaintiff is, however, in possession of circumstantial evidence of
noncompliance by virtue of Defendant's refusal to comply with discovery. The
date of discovery of this circumstantial evidence is the date of receipt by
Plaintiff's counsel of Defendant's responses to the discovery. As to the
Business and Professions Code section 22442.2 violations, Plaintiff contends
that those violations have occurred from the inception of the business to the present.
More specifically, those violations were known to occur on the following dates:
I) as to the website, zlegalservices.com, the violation was first discovered on
February 2, 2023; 2) as to the GMB page, the violation was first discovered on
February 2, 2023, and the violation has continued to occur as of 2:00 p.m. the
date of the signing of this verification; 3) as to the instagram/z.legal.services/page
the violation was first discovered on May 18, 2023 and the violation has
continued to occur as of 2:00 p.m. the date of the signing of the verification.
As to the Business and Professions Code section 22443 .1 violations, Plaintiff
contends that Defendant, herself, violated between 2000 and 2017 and that, on
information and belief, Maritza Montes is presently violating that provision as
of 2:00 p.m. the date of the signing of the verification. Plaintiff reserves
the right to supplement this response as additional information comes to light.
 
(See Motion, Exhibit D.)
 
The court finds that
the response to SROGS, Set 1, No. 4 is not incomplete or evasive. Defendant Zaldivar’s
motion is denied, as is her request for sanctions. 
 
Plaintiff’s request
for sanctions is also denied. 
 
A.        MTCF Responses to SROGS, Set 2
 
Defendant
Zaldivar argues that Plaintiff’s responses to SROGS, Set 2 are untimely because
they were served by mail rather than electronically, and when Plaintiff’s
counsel did serve them electronically, they were served to Defense counsel’s
business address and not the email address for service. CCP § 1010.6 states a
document may be served electronically, but there is no evidence that the
parties formally agreed that service would only be by electronic service rather
than by mail. Furthermore, at the November 6, 2023, hearing, it was agreed that
Defendants would be served at the following email address:  assistantoharalaw@gmail.com.
 
Accordingly,
the court is unpersuaded that Plaintiff’s discovery responses were untimely because
they were served electronically. 
 
As
explained above, Plaintiff’s discovery responses are not unverified simply they
were verified by counsel rather than by Plaintiff. (CCP
§ 2030.250.) Plaintiff’s counsel did not improperly verify a response on
behalf of an individual party, but raised objections such that attorney-client
privilege was not waived. (See Melendrez, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th
at p. 1351; see also CCP, § 2030.2450 [“The
party to whom the interrogatories are directed shall sign the response under
oath unless the response contains only objections.”].) 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s responses contained boilerplate objections to
SROGS, Set 2, Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. For example, Plaintiff’s
response to SROGS, Set 2 No. 7 states: 
 
Objection: 1)
Relevance/Scope, CCP §2017.01 0; 2) Attorney work product; 3) Unintelligible as
to “YOU” Plaintiff is not a natural person and cannot independently engage in
acts, or be ‘told” anything; 4) Attorney-client privilege. 
 
The
court agrees that Plaintiff failed to show that its objections have merit.  Accordingly, Defendant Zaldivar’s request for
further responses to SROGS, Set 2, Nos. 7 to 14 is granted. 
 
            C.        Request for Sanctions 
 
CCP § 2030.300(d) provides:  
 
The court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
Defendant
Zaldivar requests sanctions in the sum of $3,500.00 against Plaintiff’s counsel
Sebastian Medvei, in addition to $60.00 spent on the filing fee. Defendant’s counsel
asserts that her hourly billing rate is $700.00 per hour for personal injury
cases and that she spent 5.0 hours preparing the Motion. 
 
The
court finds that hours billed by counsel are excessive, particularly in light
of counsel’s failure to comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.145.  The court grants the request of counsel for Defendant
Zaldivar for sanctions in the sum of $500.00, plus $60.00 in filing fees
against Plaintiff’s counsel. 
 
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Zaldivar’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to
SROGS, Set 1, No. 4 is denied, as are the parties’ respective requests for
sanctions. 
 
Defendant Zaldivar’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to
SROGS, Set 2, Nos. 7 to 14, is granted. The court awards Defendant’s counsel sanctions
in the sum of $500.00, plus $60.00 for the filing
fee, against Plaintiff’s counsel of record, Sebastian M. Medvei, to be paid within 30 days.

 Background This
is a dispute arising in connection with Defendant, Sonia I. Zaldivar’s (“Zaldivar”)
operating as an Immigration Consultant in California. Plaintiff, Immigrant
Rights Defense Council, LLC. (“Plaintiff”) alleges that Defendant has operated
as an Immigration Consultant not in conformity with the Immigration Consultants
Act of California (“ICA”).  Plaintiff
brings this claim for an injunction on behalf of the general public as
authorized by Business and Professions Code § 22446.5(a).¿ Plaintiff asserts
that Defendant has violated multiple provisions of ICA and as such
Plaintiff is entitled to obtain an injunction on behalf of the general
public.¿¿ On June 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative Second
Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleging a single cause of action for injunctive
relief for violation of the Immigration Consultant Act (“ICA”). Plaintiff also
filed a Doe amendment, adding Z Legal Services Inc. (“Z Legal”) as a Defendant.
On July 17, 2023, Defendant Z Legal filed a motion to quash
the service of summons of the SAC. Plaintiff filed opposing papers on October
23, 2023. Defendant Z Legal filed a reply on October 27, 2023.  The court continued the motion hearing on
November 3, 2023, to November 6, 2023, and, again, to November 15, 2023.  The court now rules as follows.   MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS I.         Legal
StandardCCP § 418.10(a) states: “A defendant, on or before the last day
of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court may for
good cause allow, may serve or file a motion…[t]o quash service of summon on
the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”¿¿¿  A court of this state may exercise jurisdiction on any basis
not inconsistent with the California or United States Constitutions. (CCP §
410.10.) When a nonresident defendant challenges personal jurisdiction, the
burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate by a preponderance of the
evidence that all necessary jurisdictional criteria are met. (Jewish Defense
Org. v. Superior Court¿(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 1045, 1054-55; see also
Aquila, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 556, 568 [“When a motion
to quash is properly brought, the burden of proof is placed upon the plaintiff
to establish the facts of jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.”].)
This burden must be met by competent evidence in affidavits and authenticated
documentary evidence. (Jewish Defense Org., at p. 1055.) II.        Request for
Judicial Notice The court may take judicial notice
of “official acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial departments of
the United States and of any state of the United States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any
court of this state or (2) any court of record of the United States or of any
state of the United States,” and “[f]acts and propositions that are not
reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate
determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid.
Code § 452(c), (d), and (h).) “Taking judicial
notice of a document is not the same as accepting the truth of its contents or
accepting a particular interpretation of its meaning.” (Joslin v. H.A.S.
Ins. Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374.) Defendant
Z Legal requests judicial notice of the following: 1)    
EXHIBIT A: Summons, filed on February
3, 2023
EXHIBIT B: Complaint, filed on February 3, 2023 2)    
EXHIBIT C: (474) Amendment to

22443, 22443.1, 22443.2, 22443.3, 22444, 22445, 22446.5, and 22447.7)    
EXHIBIT H: Conformed copy first page of
Plaintiff's Opposition to Motion to Quash Service of Summons, filed on October
23, 2023.Z
Legal’s request for judicial notice is granted.  III.      Evidentiary Objections Defendant
Z Legal’s objections to the Declaration of Sebastian M. Medvei and Exhibit 1 in
the declaration are overruled.  IV.       Discussion  Specially
appearing defendant, Z Legal moves to quash the service of summons of the SAC
on the basis that Plaintiff’s Doe Amendment adding Z Legal as a named Defendant
was improper because Z Legal did not exist at the time of the filing of the
original Complaint. The parties do not dispute that Z Legal was formed on
February 9, 2023, and that Plaintiff had already filed this action on February 3,
2023.  (Defendant’s RJN Ex. E.)
Therefore, Defendant argues that because Z Legal did not exist at the time this
action was filed, Plaintiff cannot name Z Legal as Doe Defendant 1.  CCP
§ 474 states in relevant part:  When the plaintiff is
ignorant of the name of a defendant, he must state that fact in the complaint,
or the affidavit if the action is commenced by affidavit, and such defendant
may be designated in any pleading or proceeding by any name, and when his true
name is discovered, the pleading or proceeding must be amended accordingly;
provided, that no default or default judgment shall be entered against a
defendant so designated, unless it appears that the copy of the summons or
other process, or, if there be no summons or process, the copy of the first
pleading or notice served upon such defendant bore on the face thereof a notice
stating in substance: “To the person served: You are hereby served in the
within action (or proceedings) as (or on behalf of) the person sued under the
fictitious name of (designating it).”  Plaintiff
fails to point to any language in section 474 or cite any relevant legal
authority holding that a Doe amendment is invalid against an entity that did
not exist at the time the Complaint was filed.  The limitation placed on section 474 is
that the amendment not be made in “bad faith” and that the plaintiff be truly
ignorant of the true names of the fictitious defendants. (See Breceda v. Gamsby
(1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 167, 176.) “The purpose of this section is to help a
plaintiff who truly does not know the name of someone against whom he states a
cause of action, in order to prevent the running of the statute of
limitations.” (Schroeter v. Lowers (1968) 260
Cal.App.2d 695, 700.) Therefore, by Z Legal’s own admission, Plaintiff could
not have discovered its identity prior to the filing of the Complaint because Z
Legal did not exist at the time.  Moreover, a complaint can be amended to
add new facts which occurred after the filing of the initial complaint. (Honig v. Financial Corp. of America (1992) 6
Cal.App.4th 960, 966.) This also includes adding a new defendant. (McGee Street Productions v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 717, 724 [Finding a complaint may
be amended to add a new defendant if the statute of limitations has not passed
or plaintiff was unaware of the true identity of party at the inception of the
suit and made the amendment pursuant to CCP § 474].) Accordingly, Z Legal fails
to show that Doe amendment was improper. Secondly, Z Legal asserts that Doe 1
cannot be Z Legal because the allegations in the SAC refer to a person and not
an entity and that per the provisions of the ICA, only a person—not an
entity—can be held liable for violating the ICA. The proper mechanism to
challenge the pleadings is by demurrer or a motion for judgment on the
pleadings, not a motion to quash the service of summons. Any alleged defects in
Plaintiff’s pleadings do not establish that service was improper on Z Legal.
(See Armstrong v. Superior Court In and For Los Angeles County (1956)
144 Cal.App.2d 420, 424 [“If it be a fact that the complaint here does not
state a cause of action against the fictitiously named defendants, and that
therefore an amended complaint naming them might be barred by the statute of
limitations, this did not prevent them from being parties to the action.”].) Third, Z Legal argues that service was
invalid because Plaintiff failed to comply with California Rules of Court, rule
3.221(c) which requires that Plaintiff serve a copy of the ADR information
package on each defendant along with a copy of the Complaint. Rule 3.221(c)
does not state that the failure to serve a copy of the ADR packet results in
improper service. Defendant Z Legal fails to show how Plaintiff’s failure to
include the ADR packet in its service of summons made the service ineffective
pursuant to CCP §§ 413.20, 415.10, or 416.10. The purpose of rule 3.221(c) is
to promote alternative and more effective and efficient dispute resolution.
(See Bus. & Prof. Code, § 465.)  Rule
3.221(c) does not govern whether service was proper and whether the defect had
actual notice that a suit was pending. Furthermore, Defendant Z Legal fails to
cite any legal authority holding that the failure to serve the ADR packet
renders service improper.  Fourth, Z Legal argues that its Motion to
Quash should be granted because Plaintiff failed to check the fictitious name
box in the summons are required by CCP § 474. The relevant provision of section
474 states: [N]o
default or default judgment shall be entered against a defendant so designated, unless it appears that the copy of the summons
or other process, or, if there be no summons or process, the copy of the first
pleading or notice served upon such defendant bore on the face thereof a notice
stating in substance: “To the person served: You are hereby served in the
within action (or proceedings) as (or on behalf of) the person sued under the
fictitious name of (designating it).” Here, Z Legal asserts that
the summons it was served failed to check the fictitious name box and was blank
as the “Notice of person being served.”
(Zaldivar Decl. Ex. D) Plaintiff argues that the summons informed Z Legal that
it was being sued Doe 1 because even though the fictitious name box was blank,
the summons informed Z Legal it was being “sued herein as DOE 1.” (Medvei Decl.
Ex. 2.)  In Carol Gilbert, Inc. v. Haller (2009), the summons
was not marked to indicate that the party was being sued under a fictitious
name and instead checked the box that the party was being sued “as an
individual defendant.” (179 Cal.App.4th 852, 858–859.) The
form of summons used in this state is intended to
facilitate compliance with the foregoing requirement by providing a checkbox whereby the serving party can indicate that
the recipient is being served as a person sued under a fictitious name, with
the name to be written on the form at that point. [] The summons served here
had not been so marked. It was only marked to show service on defendant “as an
individual defendant.. . . The problem lies in the failure to check the box and
fill in the blank so as to “stat[e] in substance” that he was sued as the
person named in the accompanying pleadings as Doe 1. (§ 474.) (Id. at p. 858.)  Unlike the plaintiff in Carol Gilbert, Inc., Plaintiff did comply “in substance” with the
requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 474 by informing Z Legal on the
face of the summons that it was being “sued herein as DOE 1,” its fictitious
name. (Medvei Decl. Ex. 2; Zaldivar Decl. Ex. D.) There was no “complete absence of the required notice
from the summons” to support the finding that
Plaintiff failed to comply with notice requirements of section 474. (Carol Gilbert, Inc., supra, 170 Cal.App.4th
at p. 859.) Accordingly, the court finds that Plaintiff substantially complied
with the notice requirements of section 474 because the summons made clear to Z
Legal that it was being sued a Doe 1. Such notice “made it highly probable”
that had Plaintiff checked the fictitious name box and written Doe 1 “it would
have impart[ed] the same notice as full compliance” and provided “such notice”
as to “put the defendant on his defense.” (Carol Gilbert, Inc., supra,
170 Cal.App.4th at p. 866 [interna citations and quotation marks omitted].)
Therefore, Plaintiff substantially complied with notice requirements of section
474 by giving Z Legal explicit notice it was being sued as Doe 1. 
Lastly, Plaintiff’s proof of service for Z
Legal, filed on November 6, 2023, and completed by a California registered
process server, establishes the presumption that service was proper upon Z
Legal’s agent for service of process. “Evidence Code section 647 provides that
a registered process server's declaration of service establishes a presumption
that the facts stated in the declaration are true.” (Rodriguez v. Cho¿(2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 742, referencing American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara¿(2011)
199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390.) Defendant Z Legal failed to present any evidence to
rebut Plaintiff’s evidence that Sonia Zaldivar was personally served, as Z
Legal’s agent for service of process, on July 14, 2023. Zaldivar’s declaration
does not deny that she was served nor does her declaration provide any facts as
to why the July 14, 2023 service was improper. Accordingly, Defendant Z Legal’s Motion
to Quash the Service of Summons is denied.  Conclusion 
Defendant Z Legal Services, Inc’s Motion to Quash the
Service of Summons is denied.
