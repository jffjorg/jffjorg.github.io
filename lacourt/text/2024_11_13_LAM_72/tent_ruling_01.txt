Background
 
This is a contract case.
 
Defendant owns real property located at 2047 Hercules Drive,
Los Angeles, CA 90046 (the “Property”). On June 6, 2023, Plaintiff and
Defendant entered into a written contract (the “Contract”) under which
Plaintiff performed cleanup and dry-out services on the Property to remediate
water damage.
 
The Contract provided that any amount not paid by
Plaintiff’s insurance company would be owed by Plaintiff. (Siso Decl., Ex. A.) Defendant’s
insurance carrier made partial payments on Plaintiff’s invoices for the
services performed. Plaintiff requested that Defendant pay the remaining
balance owed to Plaintiff. Defendant failed to make any payment of the
outstanding balance.
 
            Plaintiff
filed this action on June 14, 2024, raising claims for (1) open book account;
(2) account stated; (3) reasonable value; an (4) breach of written contract.
 
On October August 20, 2024, the Court entered default
against Defendant.
 
Legal Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Form CIV-100 Request for Court Judgment, and: 
 
(1) Proof of service of the complaint and summons;
(2) A dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought (including Doe defendants) or
an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(7));
(3) A declaration
of non-military status as to the defendant (typically included in Form CIV-100)
(CRC 3.1800(a)(5));
(4) A brief summary of the case (CRC 3.1800(a)(1)); 
(5) Admissible
evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief requested
(Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362); 
(6) Interest computations as necessary (CRC 3.1800(a)(3)); 
(7) A memorandum of
costs and disbursements (typically included in Form CIV-100 (CRC 3.1800(a)(4));

(8) A request for
attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties (CRC
3.1800(a)(9)), accompanied by a declaration stating that the fees were
calculated in accordance with the fee schedule as per Local Rule 3.214.  Where a request for attorney fees is based on
a contractual provision the specific provision must be cited; (Local Rule
3.207); and
(9) A proposed form
of judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(6));
(10) Where an
application for default judgment is based upon a written obligation to pay
money, the original written agreement should be submitted for cancellation (CRC
3.1806). A trial court may exercise its discretion to accept a copy where the
original document was lost or destroyed by ordering the clerk to cancel the
copy instead (Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
1118, 1124);
(11) Where the
plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury or wrongful death, they must serve
a statement of damages on the defendant in the same manner as a summons (Code
Civ. Proc. § 425.11, subd. (c), (d)).
 
 
(California Rules
of Court rule 3.1800.)
 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1), items are
allowable as costs under Section 1032 if they are “filing, motion, and jury
fees.”
 
A party who defaults only admits facts that are well-pleaded
in the complaint or cross-complaint. (Molen v. Friedman (1998) 64
Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154.) Thus, the complaint must state a claim for the
requested relief.
             
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Complaint and Summons
 
            According
to the proof of service filed on July 17, 2024, Defendant was personally served
on July 16, 2024 at 4163 Longridge Avenue, Sherman Oaks, California 91423.
 
Dismissal of Other Parties
 
The Doe defendants were dismissed from the action on August
28, 2023, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request.
 
 
Non-Military Status
 
Arthur L. Lensky avers to Defendant’s non-military status.
 
 
Summary of the Case
 
Plaintiff provides a brief summary of the case in its Application
for Entry of Judgment. Plaintiff adequately pleads its causes of action in the
Complaint.
 
 
Evidence of Damages and Interest
 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 580 prohibits the entry of
a default judgment in an amount in excess of that demanded in the complaint.”  (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011)
201 Cal.App.4th 267, 286.) Moreover, “a statement of damages cannot be relied
upon to establish a plaintiff's monetary damages, except in cases of personal
injury or wrongful death.” (Ibid.) “In all other cases, when recovering
damages in a default judgment, the plaintiff is limited to the damages
specified in the complaint.” (Ibid.) Moreover, a plaintiff must submit admissible
evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief
requested (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362.)
 
            Liran
Siso avers that Defendant owed Plaintiff $29,351.67 as of the filing of this
case on June 14, 2024. (Siso Decl. ¶ 8.) Siso states that this amount is
“inclusive of interest.” (Siso Decl. ¶ 8.)
 
            The
Complaint demands interest. (Complaint at p. 5:17-23.) 
 
The Contract provides that interest will accrue at the
monthly rate of 1.5 percent. (Siso Decl., Ex. A.)
 
Plaintiff does not provide calculations for the
pre-litigation interest. The Court requests that Plaintiff separate out its
pre-litigation interest from the unpaid principal damages and provide its
calculations for pre-litigation interest.
 
Plaintiff additionally requests $909.58 in interest which
has accrued since the filing of this case. The Court provisionally accepts this
amount, but notes that it may be subject to change if the pre-filing interest
is not properly demonstrated.
 
 
Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements
 
Plaintiff includes a memorandum of costs in the submitted
Form CIV-100. Arthur L. Lensky avers that Plaintiff expended $580.45 in costs.
 
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
            Plaintiff
requests $1,270.55 in attorney’s fees.
 
This is an action on a contract. Because the judgment is
between $10,000.01 and $50,000, the maximum recovery of attorney’s fees is
equal to $690 plus 3% of the excess over $10,000. (Local Rule 3.214.) The
excess over $10,000 here is $20,261.25. 3% of that amount is $607.83. Thus, the
maximum amount of attorney’s fees is $1297.83. Plaintiff’s request is within
this amount.
 
The Court notes that this finding is dependent on
Plaintiff’s interest calculations, and may change if the interest calculations
require a different result.
 
 
Proposed Form of Judgment
 
            Plaintiff
has submitted a proposed form of judgment.
 
 
Submission of the Written Agreement
 
            California
Rule of Court 3.1806 states that “unless otherwise ordered” judgment upon a
written obligation to pay money requires a clerk’s note across the face of the
writing that there has been a judgment. Here, Plaintiff has not submitted the
original documents. The Court does not discern any practical need for such a
clerk’s note on the written obligation in the current case and therefore orders
that it need not be included. If this causes any issues for any party or
non-party, they are authorized to bring the matter to the Court’s
attention.  
 
 
Statement of Damages
 
Plaintiff does not need to submit a statement of damages
because this is not a personal injury or wrongful death case.
