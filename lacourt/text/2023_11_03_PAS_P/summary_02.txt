And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Community Health Alliance of Pasadena's motion to dismiss with prejudice the complaint filed by Rashyn R. Reynolds. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant gave her son a vaccination he had already received and recommended elective surgery he did not need, without her consent. The defendant demurred to the complaint and the plaintiff was granted 20 days to file an amended pleading. Despite this, the plaintiff failed to file an amended pleading and instead filed an ex parte application to extend the time to amend, which was denied. As a result, the court grants the defendant's motion to dismiss, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 581(f)(2) and previous case law.
