```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to reclassify the case from unlimited to limited jurisdiction. The defendant argues that the amount in controversy is necessarily less than $25,000.00, citing the plaintiff's special damages of $605.00 and $395.00. However, the court finds that the defendant has not demonstrated how the plaintiff's total potential recovery would necessarily be less than $25,000.00, and that there is a possibility that the damages will exceed this amount. The court also finds that the defendant has demonstrated good cause for not seeking reclassification earlier.
