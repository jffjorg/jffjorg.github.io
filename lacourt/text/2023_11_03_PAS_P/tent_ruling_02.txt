Case No.: 21STCV42443
 
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER GRANTING  DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO
  DISMISS WITH PREJUDICE
 
Date:   November
  3, 2023
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
          I.        INTRODUCTION
          In this action for negligence and negligent infliction of
emotional distress, Plaintiff Rashyn R. Reynolds (Reynolds) alleges that
Defendant Community Health Alliance of Pasadena (Community Health) and Dr. Lekovik
gave her son a vaccination he had already received; and recommended that he
undergo elective surgery he did not need. Reynolds alleges the vaccination was
given and surgery was performed without her consent. 
          Before the Court is Community Health’s motion to dismiss
filed October 4, 2023. A demurrer by Community Health was heard and sustained
on September 13, 2023. Reynolds was granted 20 days’ leave to file an amended
pleading. Reynolds failed to file an amended pleading. Accordingly, Community
Health’s motion to dismiss is granted. 
           
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
          The court may dismiss a complaint where a demurrer is
sustained with leave to amend, the plaintiff fails to amend within the time
permitted, and the defendant moves for dismissal. (CCP § 581(f)(2).) Such
dismissals are “with prejudice.” (Cano v. Glover (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th
326, 329-330.)
 
III.     ANALYSIS
          Community Health urges that the complaint be dismissed
because “plaintiff fail[ed] to amend the Complaint in the time allowed by the
Court after the sustaining of defendant’s demurrer” (Demurrer, p. 5: 3-4.) Community
Health demurred to the first amended complaint on September 13, 2023. The
demurrer was sustained and Reynolds was given 20 days to file a second amended
complaint. (Rosenberg Decl. ¶¶ 5,6.) The second amended complaint was due
October 3, 2023. (9/13/23 Minute Order; Demurrer p.5: 5-7.) However, Reynolds
failed to file an amended pleading within the time permitted. Reynolds instead
filed an ex parte application to extend the time to amend. The ex parte was
denied. (10/12/23 Minute Order.) As Reynolds did not file an amended complaint,
prevail on the ex parte order, or otherwise provide substantial justification
for her failure to timely amend her complaint, the Court grants Community
Health’s motion to dismiss. (CCP § 581(f)(2), see Gitmed v. General Motors
Corp (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 824, 827-828.) 
 
 
 
IV.     CONCLUSION
          Defendant Community Health’s motion to dismiss is granted for
plaintiff failing to file an amended complaint within the time required. This order
is with prejudice.
          Moving party is ordered to
lodge a proposed judgment of dismissal forthwith, and is ordered to give notice
of this ruling.
