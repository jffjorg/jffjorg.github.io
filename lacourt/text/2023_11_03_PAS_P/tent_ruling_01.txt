[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO JOINDER
 
Date: November 3, 2023
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
          I.        INTRODUCTION
This is a medical malpractice action. Plaintiff
Qingfen Wang (Wang) underwent surgery at Defendant Pasadena Advanced Surgical
Institute (PASI) on October 12, 2020. The surgery, an abdominoplasty, was
performed by Defendant Thomas Taylor, M.D. (Taylor). Wang woke up after surgery
with a bandage around her right leg, covering a burn. Taylor informed Wang that
during surgery something had gone wrong with a “Bovie pad,” and that this had
caused her leg injury.  
PASI’s motion for summary judgment was filed August
3, 2023. The motion for summary judgment was heard and granted October 19,
2023. Taylor’s motion for joinder to PASI’s motion for summary judgment was filed
August 17, 2023. The motion for joinder is unopposed. Taylor filed a notice of
non-opposition to the joinder on October 27, 2023.
For the reasons that follow, the joinder to the
motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.                    
 
II. MOTION FOR JOINDER TO SUMMARY
JUDGMENT
          A party may join a motion for summary judgment by filing a
separate statement that identifies the evidence demonstrating that the joining party
is entitled to summary judgment.  (Frazee v. Seely (2002) 95
Cal.App.4th 627, 636.)  In addition, the party must provide the notice
required in CCP section 437(c) when they file the joinder.  (Id.,
at 636-37.)  In Frazee, the Court of Appeal found that the trial
court had incorrectly granted summary judgment on a joinder, because the
joinder did not include a separate statement and because the joinder was
untimely.  
          Here, Defendant Taylor has included a separate statement
with his joinder. The proof of service attached to the notice of joinder demonstrates
that Taylor timely served the notice of joinder on August 17, 2023. As such,
Defendant Taylor’s joinder is proper. 
          PASI’s motion for summary judgment was granted with respect
to the medical malpractice cause of action alleged against it. The motion was
granted October 19, 2023. Plaintiff Wang asserts one cause of action for
medical malpractice against Defendant Taylor. (First Amended Complaint, p.4:
13-16.) As the cause of action for medical malpractice asserted against Taylor
arose out of identical underlying facts and conduct as the medical malpractice
cause of action asserted against PASI, joinder is appropriate. (Homestead
Sav. v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 494, 498, see also Calvert Fire
Ins. Co. v. Cropper (1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 901, 905 [“to require a co-party,
whose interest is identical, to engage in a formal ritual simply duplicating
the original party’s… would serve no legitimate discovery purpose.” (allowing
for joinder to conserve judicial resources as to discovery)].)  
 
III.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          Taylor’s joinder to the motion for summary judgment is
GRANTED. 
          Taylor is ordered to give
notice of ruling.
