And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court grants the motion for leave to amend, allowing the defendants to file a First Amended Answer. The defendants seek to amend their Answer to include affirmative defenses, specifically Proposition 213, Last Clear Chance, and reasonable and necessary medical expenses. The Court notes that the defendants failed to include the courthouse address in the Notice of Motion, but this failure was rectified when the case was reassigned to Judge Moskowitz and notice was sent to the plaintiff. The defendants have complied with the California Rules of Court and provided a copy of the proposed First Amended Answer. The Court finds that the defendants would be severely and irreparably harmed if they are not allowed to file their First Amended Answer, and the plaintiff has not filed an opposition showing that they would be prejudiced by the amendment. Therefore, the Court grants the motion and orders the defendants to file the First Amended Answer within 20 days of this order.
