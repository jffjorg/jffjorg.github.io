BACKGROUND
 
On October 1, 2019, Plaintiff, Araceli Sanchez
(“Plaintiff”), filed this action against Defendant, Alicia Rivera (“Defendant”)
for damages arising from a motor vehicle accident.
 
Defendant now moves for the Court to impose terminating,
evidentiary, issue sanctions, and /or monetary sanctions against Plaintiff on
the grounds that Plaintiff has violated 
prior court orders concerning her neurological examination, failed to
provide documents relating to a subsequent September 4, 2018 accident
(presumedly the result of spoliation of evidence), engaged in other forms of
discovery abuse, and failed to pay monetary sanctions. Plaintiff opposes. 
 
Trial is set for July 23, 2024.
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
As a preliminary matter, the court finds that the instant
motion is untimely. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2024.020, “any party
shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings on or
before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or
before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the
action.” In this instance, trial is set for July 23, 2024. Therefore, any
motion concerning discovery had to have been heard on or before July 8, 2024. 
 
In her reply, Defendant claims that the instant motion is
not a discovery motion. (Reply at pg. 5.) However, this argument is not
persuasive because Defendant requests the Court to issue sanctions due to
Plaintiff’s purported discovery abuses. Consequently, the statutory deadline
set forth under Code of Civil Procedure § 2024.020 applies. Such discovery
deadlines are jurisdictional. (See Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.4th 1403, 1409.) Defendant could have either sought to have the instant
hearing advanced or moved pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2024.050 to
have this matter heard, but Defendant chose to do neither. 
 
Moreover, Defendant insists that the deadline pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure § 2024.030 should apply because Plaintiff obstructed
Defendant’s medical expert from completing the medical examination, rendering
the matter an expert witness issue. (Reply at pg. 5.) This argument is also not
persuasive because the sanctions that Defendant seeks goes beyond expert
discovery, and it seeks to curtail Plaintiff’s ability to admit certain
evidence into the record.
 
Accordingly, because the instant motion is untimely, the
motion is denied.
