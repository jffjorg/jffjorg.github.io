And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's motion for sanctions is untimely and is therefore denied. The motion was filed after the deadline set by the California Code of Civil Procedure, which requires that all discovery proceedings be completed and all motions concerning discovery be heard no later than 15 days before the initial trial date. The judge notes that the defendant could have sought to have the instant hearing advanced or moved to have this matter heard, but instead chose to do neither. The judge also rejects the defendant's argument that the deadline should apply because the plaintiff obstructed the defendant's medical expert from completing a medical examination, finding that the sanctions sought by the defendant go beyond expert discovery and seek to curtail the plaintiff's ability to admit evidence into the record.
