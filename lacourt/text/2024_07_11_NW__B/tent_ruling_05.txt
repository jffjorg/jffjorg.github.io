ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On April 28, 2022, Plaintiff Eduardo
Galeno (“Galeno”) filed an action against Defendants Pacific Mechanical
Contractors (erroneously sued as “Pacific Mechanical Contractor”) (“Pacific”)
and John Venegas (“Venegas”) (collectively “Defendants”) for motor vehicle and general negligence. 
 
 
On May 10, 2024, Defendant Pacific
filed the instant Motion for Terminating Sanctions (“Motion”).  No opposition has been filed.  On July 3, 2024, Defendant filed a Notice of
Non-Opposition to the Motion.
 
            On June 6,
2024, the matter was assigned to Judge Karen Moskowitz in Department B of the
Van Nuys Courthouse East.  Plaintiff was
ordered to give notice to all parties in this action within 10 days of service
of this notice and file proof of service thereof within 12 days of this
notice.  The Court notes that Plaintiff
has failed to file proof of service of the Notice of Case Reassignment.
 
 
II.                
Legal Standard
 
Where a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts
have discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence, or monetary
sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2023.010(d), (g), 2023.030; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.)
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.040 requires that “[a]
request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every person,
party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify the type
of sanction sought.”  Furthermore, the
notice of motion shall be supported by a memorandum of points and authorities,
and accompanied by a declaration setting forth facts supporting the amount of
any monetary sanction sought.  (Code of
Civ. Proc. § 2030.040.)
 
Monetary sanctions may be imposed “ordering that one engaging in the
misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both
pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct…unless [the Court] finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(a).)
 
Issue sanctions may be imposed “ordering that designated
facts shall be taken as established in the action in accordance with the claim
of the party adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery process. The
court may also impose an issue sanction by an order prohibiting any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from supporting or opposing
designated claims or defenses.”  (Code of
Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(b).)
 
Evidence sanctions may be imposed “by an order prohibiting any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from introducing designated
matters in evidence.”  (Code of
Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(c).)
 
In more extreme cases, the Court may also impose
terminating sanctions by “striking out the pleadings or parts of the
pleadings,” “staying further proceedings,” “dismissing the action, or any part
of the action,” or “rending a judgment by default” against the party misusing
the discovery process.  (Code of Civ.
Proc. § 2030.030(d).)  The court should
look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether terminating
sanctions are appropriate.  (Lang v.
Hochman (2000) 77¿Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) 
Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a willful
discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules.  (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011)
196¿Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.)  “[A]
penalty as severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance
with discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or
bad faith.”  (Brown v. Sup. Ct.
(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) 
“Although in extreme cases a court has the authority to order a
terminating sanction as a first measure [citations], a terminating sanction
should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less severe
alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows
lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” 
(Lopez v. Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.
(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604-605.)
 
In City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC, the Court ruled
that Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2023.010 and 2023.030 list the available
discovery sanctions but do not independently authorize a court to impose
specific sanctions.  (PriceewaterhouseCoopers
(2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 503-504.) 
Thus, a court’s authority to impose the sanctions specified in
§§ 2023.010 and 2023.030 must arise from a statute governing a particular
method of discovery.  (Ibid.)
 
III.             
Discussion
 
Defendants Pacific and Venegas move for terminating
sanctions against Plaintiff Galeno or in the alternative, issue and evidentiary
sanctions.  Defendants also request an
order imposing monetary sanctions in the amount of $921.65 against
Plaintiff.  (Ibid.)
 
The Court notes that during the pendency of the instant
action, it has granted the following motions filed by Defendants against
Plaintiff:
 
(1)  
Motion for Order
Deeming Admitted Truth of Facts and Imposing Monetary Sanctions, granted on
April 3, 2024;
(2)  
Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Responses to Interrogatories, granted on April 3, 2024;
(3)  
Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Responses to Production of Documents, granted on May 8, 2024.
 
According to defense counsel, the Court’s orders were
served on Plaintiff; however, Plaintiff has not responded to the discovery or
paid any of the sanctions ordered by the Court. 
(Shepard II Decl. ¶ 5.) 
Additionally, as the Court has deemed the Requests for Admission
admitted, Plaintiff has admitted that Defendants were not negligent or liable,
and Plaintiff did not incur any damages. 
(Ibid. at ¶ 6.)  Defendants
also request monetary sanctions as follows: 2.3 hours spent on preparing the
instant Motion, 1 hour to reply to an anticipated opposition and prepare for
the hearing, and another hour to appear at the hearing, at a billing rate of
$200.00, as well as $61.65 in filing and service fees, for a total of
$921.65.  (Shepard Decl. ¶¶ 7-10.)
 
Defendants
argue that “Plaintiff has willfully and consistently misused the discovery
process by continually refusing to respond to written discovery” and directly
disobeying the Court’s orders.  (Mot. p.
3.)  Moreover, Plaintiff’s failure to pay
monetary sanctions demonstrates that lesser sanctions are not effective in
compelling Plaintiff to comply with discovery. 
(Ibid.)
 
            Plaintiff has not opposed the
Motion.
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.290 governs the imposition
of sanctions in regard to failure to respond to interrogatories.  Section 2030.290(c) states that:
 
The court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party
then fails to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those orders
that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence
sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).
 
(Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(c), emphasis added.)
 
Similarly, Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.300 governs the
imposition of sanctions in regard to failure to respond to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling. 
Section 2031.300(c) states:
 
… the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order
compelling a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including
the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or
in addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).
 
(Code of Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(c), emphasis added.)
 
Based on §§ 2030.290(c) and 2031.300(c), the Court has
authority to impose any of the sanctions specified in § 2030.030.
 
In determining whether terminating sanctions are
appropriate in the instant case, the Court considers the totality of the circumstances,
including whether there has been a willful discovery order violation, a history
of abuse, and evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not produce
compliance with discovery rules.
 
Here, the Court finds that Defendant has presented
sufficient evidence to support its request for terminating sanctions.  Plaintiff has failed to respond to Requests
for Admission, Interrogatories, and Requests for Production.  Furthermore, the Court’s order compelling
compliance with these discovery requests and monetary sanctions have not been
effective.  The Motion is unopposed, and
Plaintiff has not demonstrated any justification for his failure to comply with
discovery.
 
The Court also finds $721.65 in monetary sanctions to be
appropriate, as no reply has been filed.
