And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The defendant, Walgreen Co., has asked the court to continue the trial date in a case involving a slip and fall accident and premises liability. The court has granted the motion, citing good cause for the delay. The court has twice previously continued the trial date, and the defendant has shown that essential witnesses will be unavailable until the end of September. Additionally, the defendant needs additional time to obtain the plaintiff's medical records and depose her new treating physicians. The court has taken into account the proximity of the trial date, the brief continuance requested, the plaintiff's lack of opposition, and the need for additional discovery. The trial date has been continued to a date on or after October 29, 2024, and a final status conference has been scheduled.
