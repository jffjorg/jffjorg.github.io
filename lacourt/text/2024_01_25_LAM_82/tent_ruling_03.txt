[1]           Petitioner does not otherwise
challenge the findings upon which the decision is based, i.e.,
reasonable cause that petitioner drove under the influence of alcohol, lawful
arrest, and notice of consequences for failure to submit to a chemical test. (See
AR 11; Veh. Code § 13353(d) [listing factors necessary to trigger penalty of
suspension].)


[2]           As a whole, the hearing officer found
there is reason to give “little weight” to petitioner’s testimony in that it
was “vague and inconsistent with the evidentiary documentation.” (AR 11.)  The Court agrees with that assessment.
