Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled in favor of Receiver Pacific Crest Realty Advisors, LLC's motion to authorize the sale of the Mansfield Property and its motion to approve its fifth interim request for fees. The court finds that the proposed sale of the property is reasonable, given the circumstances discussed in the declaration of the Receiver. The Receiver has marketed the property informally since March 2022 and listed it on the MLS in June 2022. The Receiver received an offer of $1,900,000, which was mutually executed on October 20, 2023. The court approves the sale of the property and the Receiver's request to hold back $250,000 for operating expenses and normal travel reimbursement.

The court also approves the Receiver's interim fees of $77,430.70, which were incurred between October 2022 and February 2023. The Receiver's fees are reasonably related to the administration of the Receivership Estate, and the court finds that the Receiver has provided sufficient evidence to support its request for fees.
