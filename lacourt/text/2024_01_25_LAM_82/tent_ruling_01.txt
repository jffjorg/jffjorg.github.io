Case:                           Sound Equity High Income Debt
Fund, LLC v. Top Flight Investments LLC et al. (21STCV13141)
 
TENTATIVE RULING:      
 
Receiver Pacific Crest Realty Advisors, LLC’s Motion for
Order Authorizing Sale of Receivership Estate is GRANTED. 
 
Receiver Pacific Crest Realty Advisors, LLC’s Motion for
Approval of Receiver’s Fifth Interim Request for Fees is GRANTED. 
 
I.          PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On April 6, 2021, plaintiff Sound Equity High Income Debt
Fund, LLC filed a verified complaint against defendants Top Flight Investments
LLC (“Top Flight”), Palms Blvd Venice Beach, LLC, Doug Sanchez, and Andre
Wegner for multiple causes of action for judicial foreclosure and specific
performance of deed of trust, among other claims.
 
On March 10, 2022, the Court granted plaintiff’s motion to
impose a full equity receivership on Top Flight. On March 17, 2022, the Court
entered an Order Appointing Equity Receiver and Preliminary Injunction (“2022
Appointment Order”). The 2022 Appointment Order granted Receiver the authority
to take possession of the receivership property and “to operate, manage,
maintain, preserve, market, and sell the Property ….” The term “Property” in
the order referred to real property listed in Exhibit A. The Mansfield Property
was included as receivership properties in Exhibit A. 
 
Pursuant to the Order Appointing Equity Receiver and
Preliminary Injunction entered on March 17, 2022, Receiver is authorized to
prepare “periodic interim statements reflecting the Receiver’s fees and
administration of the Receivership Estate.” (3/17/22 Receiver Order ¶ 11.)
Receiver is obligated to submit its fees and expenses to the Court for approval
and confirmation by way of a noticed interim request for fees, a stipulation
among the parties, or the Receiver’s final account and report. (Ibid.) 
 
II.        MOTION FOR SALE OF PROPERTY
 
Receiver Pacific Crest Realty Advisors, LLC (“Receiver”)
moves for an order authorizing Receiver to sell the real property commonly
known as 816/818 N Mansfield Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90038 (“Mansfield
Property”), which is in the Receivership Estate.  No
oppositions or replies have been filed. 
 
CCP § 568.5 states: “A receiver may, pursuant to an order of
the court, sell real or personal property in the receiver's possession upon the
notice and in the manner prescribed by Article 6 (commencing with Section
701.510) of Chapter 3 of Division 2 of Title 9. The sale is not final until
confirmed by the court.”
 
A receivership court is not strictly bound to the procedure
set forth in section 568.5. “Code of Civil Procedure section 568 grants
receivers the general power ‘to do such acts respecting the property as the
court may authorize.’ Read together, these provisions permit a court to tailor
the method of sale of receivership property to the circumstances before it.” (County
of Sonoma v. Quail (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 657, 684.) The receivership court
has broad discretion in determining the proper manner of sale of the property.
(Lesser & Son v. Seymour (1950) 35 Cal.2d 494, 499 [“a court in an
equity proceeding has the power to change the manner of sale of property in its
custody by a receiver appointed by it from that previously prescribed by it in
the order directing the sale”].)
 
The 2022 Appointment Order expressly granted Receiver the
authority to take possession of the receivership property and “to operate,
manage, maintain, preserve, market, and sell the Property ….” However, a sale
of receivership property by the Receiver is not final until confirmed by the
court. (CCP §§ 568, 568.5; see also Cal-American Income Property Fund VII v.
Brown Development Cor. (1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 268, 273-74 [CCP sections 568
and 568.5 “authorize the receiver to … [sell] real and personal property upon
notice and subject to court confirmation”].)
 
Notice procedures for the sale of real property are set
forth in CCP § 701.540, et seq. (CCP § 568.5.) While a court sitting in
equity is not strictly required to follow such procedures, the court must
consider the circumstances of the case in determining the appropriate method of
sale, including the notice given. (County of Sonoma, 56 Cal.App.5th 657,
684.) Absent some reason to not give notice of the sale, it would appear notice
generally should be given. (See Cal-American Income Property Fund VII,
138 Cal.App.3d at 273-74 [CCP sections 568 and 568.5 “authorize the receiver to
… [sell] real and personal property upon notice and subject to court
confirmation”].) It appears from the proofs of service and Receiver’s
declaration that all parties and interested non-parties have been served with
the motion. (See Constantinescu Decl. ¶¶ 32-34 & Ex. C.) 
 
“Judicial confirmation of a receiver's sale rests upon the
appointing court's sound discretion exercised in view of all the surrounding
facts and circumstances and in the interest of fairness, justice and the rights
of the respective parties. [Citation.] The proper exercise of discretion
requires the court to consider all material facts and evidence and to apply
legal principles essential to an informed, intelligent, and just decision.” (Cal-American
Income Property Fund VII, 138 Cal.App.3d at 274.)
 
In the course of his duties under the Appointment Order,
Receiver “conducted numerous internal valuations, surveyed brokers, analyzed comparable
sales, and reviewed appraisals, all in order to sell the Mansfield Property for
a market-correct price….” (Constantinescu Decl. ¶ 5.) Receiver marketed the
property informally since March 2022 and listed the property on the MLS in June
2022. (Id. ¶¶ 6, 10.)
 
In or about October 2023, Receiver received an offer, which
was mutually executed on October 20, 2023, to purchase the Mansfield Property
for $1,900,000. (Id. ¶ 14 & Ex. A.) Receiver declares that the
proposed sale is in the best interest of the Receivership Estate. (Id. ¶¶
21, 24.) The debts on the Mansfield Property currently incur $38,000 in monthly
default interest. (Id. ¶ 21(d).)
 
Receiver explains that the Mansfield Property is occupied by
a leasehold estate, which has served as an impediment to selling the property.
(Id. ¶¶ 12, 13, 18.) The tenant currently pays $2,100 per month – 65%
below market – on a month-to-month lease. (Ibid.) The tenant has disparaged
and sabotaged the Mansfield Property to scare off buyers. (Ibid.) The
tenant refuses to voluntarily leave. (Id. ¶ 13.) 
 
Despite the leasehold estate, Receiver has obtained an offer
for $1.9 million. (Id. ¶ 14.) Based on rent equivalent analyses, surveys
of comparable sales, reviews of the lender’s appraisals, and the opinion of a
broker, Receiver values the Mansfield Property between $1.8 and $2.1 million. (Id.
¶ 17.) Receiver notes that defendants attempted to sell the property throughout
2021. (Id. ¶ 8.) In the 30 months that the property was listed for sale,
either by defendants or Receiver, $1.9 million was the highest bona fide offer
received. (Id. ¶¶ 18, 20, 21(c).) The purchase price appears to be
market correct. 
 
Receiver seeks the approval of closing costs, including
listing and selling broker commissions, escrow fees, title insurance, and outstanding
and delinquent property taxes. (Id. ¶¶ 26, 27.) As indicated in the preliminary
settlement statement, the closing costs are estimated to total $851,635.33. (Id.
¶ 28 & Ex. B.) The closing costs are reasonable. 
 
The Court finds the proposed sale of the Mansfield Property
to be reasonable in light of the circumstances discussed above and in
Receiver’s declaration.
 
Receiver is requesting approval of a disbursement of $250,000
from the sale proceeds to cover actual and anticipated professional fees, as
well as operating, legal, and administrative expenses for management of the
Receivership Estate. (Id. ¶¶ 29, 30.) In light of the total $267,224.70
in interim fees approved on August 29 and October 26, 2023 and today in the
concurrently heard motion to approve fifth interim request for fees (see 8/29/23
and 10/26/23 Orders Approving Interim Fees), Receiver’s request to hold back $250,000
is reasonable. 
 
Receiver requests authorization to reduce the sale price to
no less than $100,000 in case concessions to the buyer are needed to close
escrow. (Id. ¶ 25.) Receiver’s request is reasonable.
 
For the foregoing reasons, the motion is GRANTED. The $250,000
the receiver holds back may be used for receivership operating expenses and
normal travel reimbursement. It is not to be used for payment of the receiver's
professional costs without court approval.
 
The Court will sign the Proposed Order Granting Sale of
Receivership Estate: 816/818 N Mansfield Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90038,
submitted December 28, 2023.
 
III.       MOTION
FOR APPROVAL OF FEES
 
Receiver Pacific Crest Realty Advisors, LLC moves for
approval of its interim fees incurred in the performance of its duties.  Specifically, receiver seeks approval of $77,430.70
incurred between October 2022 and February 2023.   As noted above, the Receiver is authorized
to prepare periodic interim statements reflecting the Receiver’s fees and
administration of the Receivership Estate, and the Court may approve payment of
such fees by way of a noticed interim request for fees.  (3/17/22 Receiver Order ¶ 11.) 
 
“Interim fees are subject to final review and approval by
the court. The court retains jurisdiction to award a greater or lesser amount
as the full, fair, and final value of the services rendered.” (Cal. Rule pf
Court 3.1183(a).) “Unless good cause is shown, objections to a receiver’s
interim report and accounting must be made within 10 days of notice of the
report and accounting, must be specific, and must be delivered to the receiver
and all parties entitled to service of the interim report and accounting.” (Id.
Rule 3.1183(b).) No objections were received. 
 
A review of the invoices received in support of the motions
reveals that Receiver paid utilities and vendors; continued property management
activities, including collecting rents, negotiating leases, as well as
maintaining and repairing the properties; marketed the properties for sale;
assisted in the preparation of sale motions; reviewed and responded to
objections to sale of properties; closed transactions and paid closing costs;
prepared financial statements; and continued the advancement of the eviction of
unlawful occupants from the properties. (Constantinescu Decl. ¶¶ 5-11 &
Exs. 1-5; 3/17/22 Receiver Order ¶ 3(b) [“The Receiver is granted the following
powers and duties…[t]o operate, manage, maintain, preserve, market, and sell
the Property, and to collect revenues, security deposits, storage fees, income,
issues, and profits thereof….”].) Receiver billed $295 per hour for Sidney
Constantinescu, $160 per hour for accounting tasks, and $50 per hour for
administrative tasks, rates which are permitted in the March 17, 2022 order
appointing Receiver. (3/17/22 Receiver Order ¶ 2(d).) Having reviewed the
supporting declaration and invoices, the Court finds that the fees claimed by
Receiver are reasonably related to the administration of the Receivership Estate.

 
The motion is GRANTED. The Court strikes the words “and
costs” from paragraph 2 from the Proposed Order lodged on December 28, 2023, as
Receiver is not seeking costs. (Motion at 8, fn. 1.) The Court will sign the Proposed
Order so amended.
