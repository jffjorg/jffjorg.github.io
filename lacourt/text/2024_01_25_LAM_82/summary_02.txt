Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the petition for writ of mandate filed by James Chen, who seeks to set aside the administrative decision of the DMV to suspend his driving privileges. The Court finds that the weight of the evidence supports the finding that James Chen refused to do what was needed for him to give a blood sample as required by law. The Court also finds that James Chen's claim that he could not read the blood test request form due to lack of eyeglasses is insufficient to demonstrate that he was rendered incapable of refusing the test. Therefore, the Court denies the petition for writ of mandate and sustains the suspension of James Chen's driving privileges for one year.
