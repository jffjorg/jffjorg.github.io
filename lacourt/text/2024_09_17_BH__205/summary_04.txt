And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Poon Design Inc.'s motion for summary judgment. The motion was brought to dismiss the plaintiff's breach of contract and negligence claims. The judge found that the plaintiff's breach of contract claim is time-barred because it was filed more than four years after the alleged breach occurred. The judge also found that the plaintiff's negligence claim is barred by the two-year statute of limitations because it was filed more than two years after the plaintiff discovered or should have discovered the defendant's negligence. As a result, the judge granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the plaintiff's claims.
