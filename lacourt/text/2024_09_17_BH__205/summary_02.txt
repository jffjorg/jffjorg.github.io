Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants summary judgment in favor of the defendants, Laserway Medical Group, Inc. and Laserway, LLC, in a medical malpractice case brought by Mumtaz Jetha. The judge finds that the defendants did not breach the standard of care and did not cause Jetha's alleged injuries. The judge also finds that Jetha failed to provide a competing expert declaration and did not demonstrate diligence in securing the evidence she now claims will defeat the motion for summary judgment. The judge declines to consider Jetha's negligent infliction of emotional distress claim, finding that there is no independent tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress and that the defendants were not negligent.
