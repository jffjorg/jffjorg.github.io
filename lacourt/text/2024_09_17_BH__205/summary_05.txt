Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants (Kenneth Kai Chang, Hui O Ka La, LLC, et al.) to the complaint filed by the plaintiffs (Patrick Bertranou and Walker Land LLC). The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants breached a loan agreement, committed fraud, and engaged in financial elder abuse.

The Court sustained the demurrer to the plaintiffs' breach of oral contract claim, finding that the written option agreements superseded any prior oral agreements and precluded any future oral modifications.

The Court overruled the demurrer to the plaintiffs' financial elder abuse claim, finding that the plaintiffs had alleged all the necessary elements of the claim, including that the defendants took advantage of Bertranou's vulnerability and that the defendants' conduct was a substantial factor in causing Bertranou's harm.

The Court sustained the demurrer to the fraud claim with 20 days' leave to amend, finding that while the plaintiffs had alleged misrepresentations and reasonable reliance, they had not alleged facts to support a finding of an intent to deceive.

The Court overruled the demurrer to the negligent misrepresentation claim, finding that the plaintiffs had alleged actionable misrepresentations and reasonable reliance.

The Court ordered that the defendants' demurrer be sustained in part and overruled in part, with leave to amend the fraud claim.
