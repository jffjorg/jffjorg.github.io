And here is the summary in English text:

The Tentative Ruling states that the Court will reconsider its previous order that granted Defendants' motion to quash and dismiss the Plaintiffs' complaint. The Court finds that it inadvertently overlooked an attorney declaration filed with the complaint explaining the reason for failing to submit a certificate of merit. The Court also takes into account the recent decision in Roe v. Doe 1, which established that the statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse claims had been tolled by 178 days. Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration and sets aside the judgment in favor of Defendants.
