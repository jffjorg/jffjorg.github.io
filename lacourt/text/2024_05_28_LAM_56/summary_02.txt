And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the petitions to confirm the minor's compromise for Amiya Parrish and Amere Hicks. The proposed settlements appear to be fair and reasonable under the circumstances. The requested attorney's fees, which amount to approximately a third of the total settlements, are also considered fair and reasonable. After the previously identified defects have been corrected, the court grants the petitions. The moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
