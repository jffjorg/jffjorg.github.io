```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendant, Rosa A. Trujillo, to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Naomi Ortega. The defendant argues that the plaintiff has failed to strictly comply with the statutory notice requirements for an unlawful detainer action. The judge agrees that the plaintiff has not alleged compliance with the statutory notice requirements and therefore sustains the demurrer. However, the judge finds that the defendant's second argument, that a proof of service was not attached to the complaint, is unsupported. The judge overrules the demurrer on this ground. The judge sustains the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend and orders the defendant to give notice of this ruling.
