And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the motion to consolidate the cases 19STCV23747 and 23TRCV02505, which involve allegations of sexual abuse by Daniel Ayon, an afterschool staff coordinator. The Plaintiffs argue that consolidation is warranted because the cases present overlapping issues and are based on the same facts. The Court finds that consolidation is warranted to promote judicial efficiency, despite LAUSD's concerns about completing discovery. The motion is GRANTED, and the parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
