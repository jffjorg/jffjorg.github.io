BACKGROUND
This
is an action for unlawful detainer. On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff Naomi Ortega
(“Plaintiff”) initiated this action against Defendant Rosa A. Trujillo
(“Defendant”).  The complaint alleges
that Defendant entered into a lease agreement with Plaintiff since March 1,
2017 in connection with the residential property located at 734 E. 42nd Place,
Los Angeles, CA 90011. The complaint further alleges that the tenancy was terminated
for at-fault just cause. 
 
On
March 27, 2024, Defendant filed a demurrer to the complaint. No opposition has
been received.
 
MEET
AND CONFER
Because
no declaration has been attached to the instant demurrer, the Court finds that the
meet and confer requirement has not been met. 
Nonetheless, the Court will proceed to address the merits of the
demurrer despite this deficiency. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41(a)(4).) The Court admonishes
the parties to abide by the requirements set forth in the Code in future
matters.
 
DISCUSSION
            “A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a
matter of law.”  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)
“[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation, and treats the
demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.”  (Id.)  “The court accepts as true all material
factual allegations, giving them a liberal construction, but it does not
consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions, speculation, or allegations
contrary to law or judicially noticed facts.” 
(Shea Homes Limited Partnership v.
County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246, 1254.)  In the demurrer context a court “may also
take notice of exhibits attached to the complain[t].”  (Holland
v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447.)  “If facts appearing in the exhibits
contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence.”  (Id.)
 
            Here, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to
strictly comply with all the statutory requirements necessary to bring an
unlawful detainer action.  (Demurrer at
pg. 2, relying on Jordan v. Talbot (1961) 55 Cal.2d 597 and Borsuk v.
Appellate Div. of Sup. Ct. (2015) 202 Cal.App.4th 607.) In particular,
Defendant points out that Sections 9 and 10 of the form complaint have not been
filled out, and thus, she asserts that Plaintiff has not made any allegation
concerning the service of the 3 day notice to pay rent or quit. (Demurrer at
pg. 2.) Additionally, Defendant contends that the proof of service of the 3-day
notice to pay or quit was not attached to the complaint. 
 
            Upon review of the complaint, the Court finds that
Defendant’s first argument has merit. Because Plaintiff must strictly comply
with the statutory notice requirement set forth under Code of Civil Procedure §
1161, facts must be alleged to show that Plaintiff has adhered to that
requirement. (Borsuk v. Appellate Div. of Sup. Ct. (2015) 202
Cal.App.4th 607, 610, fn. 1.) Because the complaint is devoid of any facts to
show that Plaintiff complied with the statutory notice requirement, it has not
been sufficiently alleged. Thus, on this ground, the demurrer is sustained. 
 
            As to Defendant’s second argument that a proof of service
was not attached to the complaint, this argument is unsupported. Based on the
complaint filed with the Court, a proof of service of the 3-day notice to pay
or quit is attached as the last page of Exhibit 2. While the complaint did not
separately include an Exhibit 3, the required proof of service is there.
Therefore, the demurrer is overruled on this ground. 
 
            Based on the foregoing, because sufficient facts have not
been alleged regarding Plaintiff’s compliance with the statutory notice
requirements, the Court sustains the instant demurrer is sustained with 20 days
leave to amend. 
 
Defendant
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
