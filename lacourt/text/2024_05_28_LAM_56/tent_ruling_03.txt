BACKGROUND
On
December 30, 2022, Plaintiffs, who are listed under the pseudonyms of John Doe
or Jane Doe, filed a complaint against Defendants Doe Archdiocese and Doe
Seminary (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging: (1) negligence; (2) negligent
supervision; (3) negligent hiring/retention; (4) negligent supervision of a
minor; and (5) vicarious liability. The complaint alleges that Plaintiffs were
sexually abused by various unnamed priests in Arizona, and it further alleges
that the Defendants bear responsibility for conduct of those priests because Doe
Seminary allowed the offending priests to become employees and educators of the
Plaintiffs’ parishes and Doe Archdiocese transferred the offending priests to
areas near the Plaintiffs, despite knowing their proclivities to commit sexual
crimes. 
 
            Concurrently filed with their complaint, Plaintiffs filed
with the Court the Declaration of Ashley Pileika, Esq regarding the inability
to obtain a certificate of merit pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
340.1(g)(3) due to statute of limitation concerns.
 
            On February 28, 2023, Plaintiffs lodged with the Court
certificates of merit for in camera review pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
§ 340.1.
 
            On June 27, 2023, the Court reviewed the certificates of
merit and found that Plaintiffs had complied with the necessary procedures set
forth under Code of Civil Procedure § 340.1 and permitted the complaint to be
served.
 
On
October 10, 2023, Defendants filed their motion to quash and dismiss on the
grounds that there had not been effective service of process on them and
Plaintiffs did not timely file jurisdictional certificates of merit. While
Defendants raise two separate grounds for their motion, it is clear from their
argument for lack of effective service was due to Plaintiffs’ failure to comply
with the prior version of Code of Civil Procedure § 340.1(g)(3). (See generally
Motion to Quash filed on October 10, 2023.) 
 
On
January 23, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to quash on the ground
that “Plaintiffs have not complied with the specific statutory requirements for
effective service of the Summons and Complaint.”  (January 23, 2024 Minute Order at p. 3.) 
 
On
February 2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion for reconsideration of
the Court’s January 23, 2024 Order on the ground that the Court inadvertently
overlooked the declaration of counsel filed on December 30, 2023 pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure § 340.1(g)(3) and that recent precedent established in Roe
v. Doe 1 (2024) 98 Cal. App. 5th 965 determined Emergency Rule 9 tolled
Code of Civil Procedure § 340.1, subdivision (q)’s three-year lookback window
for 178 days. 
 
On
May 7, 2024, Defendants filed their opposition. 
 
DISCUSSION
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1008(a), it states:

“When an
application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused
in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any
party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order.  The party making the application shall
state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge,
what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.”
 
Also,
the court may on its own motion reconsider a prior order in order to correct an
error. (Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1106-1107.) “[T]he
stated legislative purpose behind the 1992 amendment to section 1008 was to
conserve judicial resources. . . . Forcing the parties to proceed where there
is recognized error in the case would result in an enormous waste of the
court's and the parties' resources.” (Case v. Lazben Financial Co.
(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 172, 187.)
 
            Under the circumstances, the Court finds that sua
sponte reconsideration of its January 23, 2024 Order is warranted. First,
the Court had inadvertently overlooked the attorney declaration concurrently
filed with the complaint on December 30, 2022 that explained the reason for
failing to submit a certificate of merit pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
340.1(g)(1) was because the statute of limitations was set to expire on
December 31, 2022. (See Declaration of Ashley Pileika, Esq filed on December
30, 2022.) Thus, by assuming that the deadline to file the complaint fell on
December 31, 2022 and lodging the certificates of merit on February 28, 2023,
Plaintiffs had complied with Code of Civil Procedure § 340.1(g)(3).) 
 
            Second, in light of the recent decision in Roe v. Doe
1, the statute of limitations of claims for childhood sexual abuse had been
tolled by 178 days pursuant to Emergency Rule 9. (Id., surpa, 98
Cal.App.5th at pg. 973.) Thus, for this case, the correct statute of
limitations deadline was June 27, 2023 when taking into account the tolling
provision set forth under Emergency Rule 9. Thus, because the certificates of
merit were eventually lodged with the Court on February 28, 2023 and the Court
did not issue an order regarding these certificates until June 27, 2023, the
Court finds that Plaintiffs had substantially complied with Code of Civil
Procedure § 340.1(g).  (Carr v. Rosien
(2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 845, 855 [“Substantial compliance contemplates that
there is at least some compliance with all of the statutory requirements.”].) For
these reasons, sua sponte reconsideration is warranted to reverse a
recognized error. (Case, supra, 99 Cal.App.4th at 187.) 
 
            Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’
motion for reconsideration. Consequently, the judgment entered on February 13,
2024 in Defendants’ favor is set aside. Because Plaintiffs had complied with
Code of Civil Procedure § 340.1(g), Defendants are ordered to submit their
responsive pleadings within 20 days of the date of this Order. 
 
Plaintiffs
are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
