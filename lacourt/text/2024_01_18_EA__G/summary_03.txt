And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint will be granted. The plaintiff's counsel, Tom Kinan, had failed to appear for a case management conference and an OSC Re: Default/Default Judgment, resulting in the complaint being dismissed without prejudice. Kinan blames a paralegal for the calendaring errors, but the court notes that Kinan failed to explain why he was unaware of the November 7 case management conference when he was present at the previous case management conference on October 2. The court also notes that it is counsel's responsibility to ensure upcoming court hearings are properly calendared, not the paralegal's. The judge will hear from counsel regarding the issues identified above at the hearing on January 18, 2024.
