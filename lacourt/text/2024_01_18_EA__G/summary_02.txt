And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted plaintiff Tai Ku's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) that adds Shugui Gu as a second plaintiff. The court found that the amendment is necessary and proper, and that the delay in seeking leave to amend was reasonable. The judge noted that the amended complaint does not add new causes of action, but rather adds a new plaintiff to the existing action. The court also found that the delay was not unwarranted, as the plaintiff's original verified complaint referenced the defendant by name on several occasions, suggesting that the facts supporting the amendment were known since the beginning of the action. The judge ordered the plaintiff to file the proposed FAC with the court forthwith.
