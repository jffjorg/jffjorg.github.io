And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Alma Coronado's Motion for Reconsideration of Order Granting Defendant Nissan North America, Inc.'s Motion to Compel Arbitration. The case involves a lemon law action, where Coronado alleges that the 2021 Nissan Sentra she leased has a defective continuously variable transmission. Coronado's motion for reconsideration is denied as it is untimely and does not provide new or different facts, circumstances, or law. The Judge notes that the court's inherent power to reconsider prior rulings is limited and does not authorize parties to file written motions for reconsideration.
