 Plaintiff David Williamson seeks to compel further responses from Defendant Janik Roskovani as to his form interrogatories.   The Motion is denied because there was not a sufficient meet and confer effort.  Specifically, Defendant sent a responsive meet and confer letter on May 3, 2023, stating that there should be further discussions before any IDC, but there is no evidence Plaintiff ever contacted Defendant about the responsive letter.   The Court declines to award sanctions.  Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
