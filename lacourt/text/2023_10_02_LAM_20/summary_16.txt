And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the motion of Holistic Supplements, L.L.C. (Plaintiffs) to file a second supplemental complaint, which seeks to add claims for declaratory relief and quiet title against new defendants, People's Los Angeles, LLC, Unrivaled Brands, Inc., and Bernard Steimann. The Plaintiffs claim that they recently learned of potential competing claims to the Business Tax Registration Certificate (BTRC) and cannabis licenses, but the Court finds that there has been a long, unexplained delay in seeking leave to amend, which would prejudice the defendants by delaying trial and increasing the costs of litigation. The Court is not inclined to relate any such case to this one and denies the motion.
