And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion by the plaintiffs to add claims for Declaratory Relief and Quiet Title against new defendants. The motion was filed just one week before the trial date, and the judge finds that there has been a long, unexplained delay that would prejudice the defendants by delaying trial and increasing the costs of litigation. The judge also notes that the plaintiffs' claims are unrelated to the original case and that the court is not inclined to join the new claims to the existing case. The judge's decision is based on the principles of liberally exercising discretion to permit amendment of pleadings, but only if the party seeking to amend has not been dilatory in bringing the proposed amendment before the court.
