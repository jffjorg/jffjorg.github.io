And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to grant Defendant Catarina Counts' motion to vacate the entry of default on condition that a copy of her proposed responsive pleading is filed by the time of the hearing. The Judge considered the facts of the case, including the delay in serving Defendant Metro with the lawsuit and Defendant Counts' reasonable mistake in believing that Defendant Metro would handle the defense of the action. The Judge noted that the motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), which allows for relief from an entry of default if the moving party can show that the default was caused by mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The Judge also cited several case law precedents to support the decision.
