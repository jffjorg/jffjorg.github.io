Discussion
 
The Complaint alleges causes of action for motor vehicle
negligence and general negligence based on a motor vehicle accident that
occurred on August 15, 2019 on the SR-90 westbound near Lincoln Boulevard in
the City of Marina del Rey, Los Angeles, California. (Compl., ¶¶MV-1.) Specifically,
the Complaint alleges Defendant was not paying attention and failed to
adequately and properly drive at a safe speed, when operating the subject motor
vehicle, thereby causing Plaintiff damage and serious injuries. (Id. at
¶GN-1.) 
 
Defendant moves for summary judgment on the Complaint
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c. A defendant seeking summary
judgment must show either (1)
that one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established; or (2) that there is a complete
defense to that cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)
Plaintiff is under no evidentiary burden to produce rebuttal evidence until
Defendant meets its initial moving burden. (Binder v. Aetna Life Insurance
Company (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839-840.) 
 
Defendant’s Initial Burden of Proof
 
The Motion is brought on the grounds that Plaintiff has
admitted facts showing conclusively that (1) Defendant’s alleged negligence was
not a substantial factor in Plaintiff’s injuries; and (2) Plaintiff suffered no
damages related to the accident. Therefore, Plaintiff cannot establish the
elements of causation or damages. (See County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318.) In support of the Motion,
Defendant presents the following facts. On November 2, 2022, Defendant served
Requests for Admission, Set One, on Plaintiff. (Motion, Separate Statement,
Fact No. 2; Blamires Decl., Exh. A.) Following Plaintiff’s failure to serve
responses, the Court granted Defendant’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission,
Set One, Admitted on August 30, 2023. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos.
3-5; Blamires Decl., ¶¶3-5 and Exh. B.) Via the admissions, Plaintiff admits
that Defendant was not a substantial factor in causing her alleged injuries,
that Plaintiff was not injured in the subject accident, that Plaintiff did not
receive medical treatment as a result of the accident, that Plaintiff did not
lose any income as a result of the subject accident, that Plaintiff will not
lose any future income as a result of the subject accident, and that Plaintiff
did not suffer any loss of earning capacity as a result of the subject
accident. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 6-11; Blamires Decl., Exh. A,
Request Nos. 1-6.) This evidence of Plaintiff’s admissions, as established by
the Court’s August 30, 2023 order, carries Defendant’s initial burden of proof
that Plaintiff cannot establish the elements of causation and damages. 
 
The burden now shifts to Plaintiff to demonstrate the
existence of a triable issue of material fact. Plaintiff, however, has not
filed any opposition to the instant Motion.
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Defendant Rachel Nicole Lee’s Motion for Summary
Judgment is GRANTED. DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN
20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
