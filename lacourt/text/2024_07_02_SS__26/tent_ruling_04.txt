ANALYSIS:
 
On April 24, 2023, Plaintiff Richard Heng Taing DBA USA
Donuts (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendant Worldwide ATM,
Inc. (“Defendant”). Defendant filed an answer and cross-complaint on June 28,
2024 and July 5, 2023, respectively. On November 20, 2023, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses to Special and Form Interrogatories and
awarded sanctions of $1,043.61 against Defendant. (Minute Order, 11/20/23.) The
sanctions were to be paid within 20 days’ service of the order. (Ibid.) 
 
On March 5, 2024, the Court granted defense counsel’s motion
to be relieved as counsel. (Minute Order, 03/05/24.) On May 7, 2024, at the
order to show cause regarding legal representation for Defendant, there was no
appearance by Defendant and the Court struck its answer. (Minute Order,
05/07/24.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses to
Request to Inspect Writings to Enforce Order Dated 11-20-23, and Request for
Sanctions on May 22, 2023. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The Motion is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 680.230, 680.270, and 708.030 on the grounds that any court order
requiring the payment of money is treated as a money judgment. 
 
Monetary sanction orders are
enforceable through the execution of judgment laws. (Weil & Brown,
Cal.Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial 3 (1994) ¶¶ 9:344.21,
9:344.22, p. 9(1)–92.) These orders have the force and effect of a money
judgment, and are immediately enforceable through execution, except to the
extent the trial court may order a stay of the sanction. (See §§ 680.230,
680.270, 699.510, subd. (a); Jones v. Otero, supra, 156 Cal.App.3d at p. 759,
203 Cal.Rptr. 90.)
 
(Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608,
615.) Enforcement of judgment laws provide that the judgment creditor may
demand that the judgment debtor produce and permit the inspection of a document
if the demand requests information to aid in the enforcement of the money
judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.030, subd. (a).) The judgment debtor must
respond and comply with the demand within 30 days of its service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 708.030, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260.) Plaintiff contends
it served Defendant with the demand for inspection on March 4, 2024. (Motion,
Gentino Decl., Exh. 1.) The attached inspection demand, however, does not
include a proof of service showing the manner and location of its service. Accordingly,
the Court cannot make a finding regarding the date and propriety of service of
the inspection demand, or the date on which Defendant’s responses were due. 
 
The Court additionally notes that service of the instant
Motion is questionable. Defendant is currently an unrepresented party over whom
electronic service is dictated by Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6,
subdivision (c)(1). Under this statute, an unrepresented party may consent to
receive electronic service by either serving a notice on all parties and filing
the notice with the court or by “[m]anifesting affirmative consent through
electronic means with the court or the court's electronic filing service
provider, and concurrently providing the party’s electronic address with that
consent for the purpose of receiving electronic service.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1010.6, subd. (c)(3).) Defendant is currently in a limbo state as an
unrepresented corporation but is still entitled to proper notice of the instant
Motion. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff Richard Heng Taing dba USA
Donuts’ Motion to Compel Responses to Request to Inspect Writings to Enforce
Order Dated 11-20-23, and Request for Sanctions is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
