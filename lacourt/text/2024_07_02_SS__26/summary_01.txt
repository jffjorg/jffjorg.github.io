And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, ruling that the plaintiff cannot establish the elements of causation and damages. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had admitted facts showing that the defendant's alleged negligence was not a substantial factor in the plaintiff's injuries, and that the plaintiff suffered no damages related to the accident. The judge found that the defendant had met its initial burden of proof and that the plaintiff had failed to file any opposition to the motion. As a result, the judge granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment and ordered the defendant to file and serve a proposed judgment within 20 days.
