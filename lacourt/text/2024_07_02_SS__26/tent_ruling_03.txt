ANALYSIS:
 
On April 18, 2023, Plaintiff Valerie Hurtado (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for motor vehicle negligence against Defendants
Catarina Counts (“Defendant Counts”) and Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (“Defendant Metro”) (erroneously sued as “Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transit Authority”). Following Defendant Count’s failure to file a
responsive pleading, the Court entered their default on September 25, 2023.
Defendants then filed answers to the Complaint on November 17, 2023.
 
Defendant Counts filed the instant Motion to Vacate Default
on March 22, 2024. The Motion initially came for hearing on April 22, 2024, at
which time the Court continued the matter to allow Defendant to file a
supplemental brief. (Minute Order, 04/22/24.) At the hearing on April 22, 2024,
the matter was continued again to allow for Defendant’s supplemental briefing.
Supplemental declarations were filed on June 7, 2024, which the Court did not
see in time for the hearing on June 11, 2024. At the June 11, 2024 hearing, the
Court continued the matter to allow Plaintiff to file a supplemental brief
within ten days. 
 
Discussion
 
The Court already has stricken Defendant Counts’ answer filed on
November 17, 2023 pursuant to its inherent authority under Code of Civil
Procedure section 436, subdivision (b). The answer was filed while Defendant
Counts was in default and not permitted to file a responsive pleading. (Sporn
v. Home Depot USA, Inc. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1294, 1301 [holding that entry
of default cuts off the defendant's right to take further affirmative steps
such as filing a pleading or motion].) 
 
The Motion to Vacate is brought pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), which states that an application for
relief must be made within a reasonable time, no more than six  months after entry of the order from which
relief is sought, and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to
the mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect of the moving party or its
attorney. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business
Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) The motion must also be
accompanied by a copy of the moving defendant’s proposed pleading. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This can be corrected if the defendant submits a
proposed responsive pleading by the hearing date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b); Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.) 
 
Where the statute requires
that “ ‘ “the application must be made within a ‘reasonable time’ … what is a
reasonable time in any case depends upon the circumstances of that particular
case.” While in “the determination of that question, a large discretion is
necessarily confided to [the trial] court” ... there must be some showing—some
evidence—as the basis for the exercise of such discretion.’ ” (Caldwell v.
Methodist Hospital (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1521, 1524 [citing Carrasco v.
Craft (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 796, 805].)
 
Defendant Counts now provides a declaration that states that
upon being served with the Summons and Complaint on July 31, 2023, she reached
out to her supervisor at Defendant Metro. (Motion, Supp. Counts Decl., ¶3.) The
supervisor stated that since Defendant Metro was named as a defendant, its
legal department would have a copy of the lawsuit and would timely respond on
behalf of Defendant Counts. (Ibid.) Defendant Metro, however, was not
served with the lawsuit until October 26, 2023. (Motion, Supp. Yehoshua Decl.,
¶4.) This was after the date for Defendant Counts to respond, at which point
Plaintiff had already taken her default. (Id. at ¶¶3-4.) Defendant
Counts also reiterates that she only first discovered the entry of default on
March 21, 2024, the day before hearing the instant Motion. (Motion, Supp.
Counts Decl., ¶4.) Defense counsel also points out that the answer filed on
behalf of Defendant Counts on November 17, 2023 was accepted by the Court and
that Plaintiff propounded discovery on Defendant Counts on January 30, 2024. (Id.
at ¶¶6-8.) As a result, defense counsel did not discover the entry of default
until later reviewing the docket. (Id. at ¶9.) 
 
This additional evidence demonstrates that Defendant Counts
sought relief shortly after learning of the entry of default and that her
failure to timely respond to the Complaint was due to mistakenly believing that
Defendant Metro would handle the defense of the action. This mistake was
reasonable in light of Defendant Counts’ conversation with her supervisor. The
Court notes that the Motion is not accompanied by a copy of Defendant Counts’
proposed answer, which must be submitted by the time of the hearing. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Catarina Counts’ Motion to Vacate Entry of Default
is GRANTED ON CONDITION THAT A COPY OF THE PROPOSED RESPONSIVE PLEADING IS
FILED BY THE TIME OF THE HEARING.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
