And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to substitute Bobby Marcellus Gould as the successor in interest to decedent Simone Palmer. The motion was filed by Gould after Palmer's death, seeking to continue the action for motor vehicle negligence against defendants Hortencia Reyes Torres and Samantha Reyes Torres. However, the judge found that Gould's declaration did not comply with the statutory requirements set forth in the California Code of Civil Procedure, specifically sections 377.10, 377.11, 377.31, and 377.32. The judge ruled that Gould failed to provide all required information, including the date and place of Palmer's death, and did not provide supporting facts to show that he is the beneficiary of Palmer's estate or succeeds to a cause of action or to a particular item of property.
