ANALYSIS:
 
On July 26,
2023, Plaintiff Douglas Melson (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendant Mario Gonzalez, Jr. (“Defendant”). Defendant
filed an answer on November 27, 2023. On February 26, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s Motions to Compel Defendant’s Responses to Demand for Production of
Documents, Set One, and Form Interrogatories, Set One. (Minute Order 02/26/24.)
The Court also deemed Requests for Admission, Set One, admitted against
Defendant. (Ibid.) Defendant was ordered to serve verified responses
and pay sanctions within 20 days’ service of the order. (Ibid.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Terminating and Monetary Sanctions
against Defendant on May 6, 2024, which seeks an order striking Defendant’s
answer and entering default. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Legal Standard
 
Where a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts
have the discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence or monetary
sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subds. (d), (g); R.S. Creative,
Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) The court
should look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether
terminating sanctions are appropriate. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there
is a willful discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence
showing that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery
rules. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A]
penalty as severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance
with discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or
bad faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) “The
court may impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: 
 
(1)   An
order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.
 
(2)   An
order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed.
 
(3)   An
order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party.
 
(4)   An
order rendering a judgment by default against that party.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)
 
 
Discussion
 
On February 26, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s Motions
to Compel Defendant’s Responses to Demand for Production of Documents, Set One,
and Form Interrogatories, Set One. (Motion, Piazza, Jr. Decl., ¶12 and Exh. A.)
Defendant was ordered to serve verified responses and pay sanctions
within 20 days’ service of the order. (Ibid.) Notice of the ruling was mailed to Defendant the next day. (Id.
at ¶13 and Exh. B.) As of the filing of this motion, Defendant has not served
responses as ordered. (Id. at ¶15.) Plaintiff now moves for terminating
sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 by striking
Defendant’s answer and entering default. 
 
The Court finds that terminating sanctions are warranted for
Defendant’s non-compliance with the discovery order. Despite notice of the
Court’s ruling, Defendant failed to serve responses as ordered. Nor has
Defendant filed an opposition to this noticed motion. This demonstrates that
compliance with the Court’s orders cannot be achieved through lesser sanctions.
Although terminating sanctions are a harsh penalty, “[t]he court [is] not
required to allow a pattern of abuse to continue ad infinitum.” (Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 280.) However, it is not
clear whether Plaintiff seeks entry of default against Defendant, or default
judgment. The former is not provided for in the moving statute, and the latter
is not supported by any evidence. The terminating sanction, therefore, is
limited to striking Defendant’s answer. 
 
Finally, Plaintiff is sanctioned for the fees incurred
bringing this action in the amount of $310.00 based on one hour of attorney
time billed at $250.00 and $60.00 in filing fees. (Motion, Piazza, Jr. Decl.,
¶16.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Douglas Melson’s Motion to Strike Answer and Enter
Default; Request for Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. DEFENDANT
MARIO GONZALEZ, JR.’S ANSWER FILED ON NOVEMBER 27, 2023 IS STRICKEN AND
DEFENDANT IS TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $310.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS
OF THIS ORDER. PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT IS DENIED. 
 
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE RE ENTRY OF DEFAULT/DEFAULT JUDGMENT IS
