And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the motion to compel arbitration. The defendants, Let's Jett, Inc. and Conner Jadwin, had moved to compel arbitration of the dispute between themselves and the plaintiff, Dave Ventrella. The plaintiff had filed a complaint alleging breach of contract, constructive fraud, and other claims. The defendants argued that the arbitration agreement signed by the plaintiff applied to the dispute, but the plaintiff argued that the agreement did not apply because the dispute arose from an oral partnership agreement, not an employment contract. The judge found that the defendants had met their initial burden of proving the existence of the arbitration agreement, but the plaintiff did not challenge the authenticity of the agreement. The judge also found that the arbitration agreement did not apply to the subject dispute because it only covered claims related to the employment agreement, not the oral partnership agreement.
