And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is in favor of the defendants, sustaining their demurrer without leave to amend. The court finds that the plaintiffs lack standing and there is no private right of action for the alleged violations of California Constitution, Article I, § I and Health and Safety Code § 111550. The court also denies the defendants' request for judicial notice of exhibits 1-19. The court concludes that the plaintiffs have not affirmatively set forth the intent of the legislature to create a private right of action, and therefore, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
