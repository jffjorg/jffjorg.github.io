Background
 
On December 05,
2022, Jacob Shaw (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Honda Performance
Development, Inc.; Experis US, Inc.; Experis US, LLC; Manpower Group US, Inc.
(collectively “Defendants”) and Does 1 to 50.  
 
On May 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint.  On July 7, 2023, the parties stipulated to allow
Plaintiff to file the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”).    
 
On October 4, 2023, the court granted Plaintiff’s
Motion for Leave to file a Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”). The TAC alleges
fifteen causes of action: (1)
disability discrimination, (2) failure to engage in the interactive process,
(3) failure to accommodate disability, (4) retaliation in violation of Gov.
Code § 12940(m)(2), (5) violation of the California Family Rights Act, (6)
failure to prevent discrimination and harassment, (7) violation of Labor
Code section 233 and 234, (8) wrongful termination in violation of public
policy; (9) failure to pay overtime wages; (10) failure to provide meal
periods, (11) failure to authorize and permit rest periods, (12) failure to pay
all wages due upon separation, (13) failure to furnish accurate itemized wage
statements, (14) failure to maintain required records, and (15) unfair and
unlawful business practices.  
 
On November 15, 2023,
the demurrer with motion to strike to the first to seventh and ninth through
fifteenth cause of action was sustained with leave to amend. On December 15,
2024, Plaintiff filed the operative Fourth Amended Complaint (4AC) alleging the
same fifteen causes of action as the TAC. 
 
Defendants now
demurrer solely to Plaintiff’s eighth cause of action for wrongful termination
and moves to strike Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages. Plaintiff opposes
the Motion. The matter is now before the court. 
 
discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿“To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For the purpose of
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992)
2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67
Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP, § 436(a)-(b);
Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading
which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally granted
to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
A.        Eighth Cause of
Action: Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
 
“The elements of a
claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy are (1) an employer -employee
relationship, (2) the employer terminated the plaintiff’s employment, (3) the
termination was substantially motivated by a violation of public policy, and
(4) the discharge caused the plaintiff harm.” (Yau v. Allen (2014) 229
Cal.App.4th 144, 154.) The court determines if the purported reason for the
firing was a violation of public policy. (See Gantt v. Sentry Insurance
(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1083, 1092, overruled on other grounds in Green v. Ralee
Engineering Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 66, 80 fn. 6.) 
 
Defendant’s demurrer to the eighth cause
of action on the grounds that Plaintiff cannot premise a wrongful termination
claim on the employer’s failure to renew an employment contract. “Decisional
law does not allow a plaintiff to sue for wrongful termination in violation of
public policy based upon an employer's refusal to renew an employment
contract.” (Touchstone Television Productions v. Superior Court
(2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 676, 680.) 
 
Here, the  4AC alleges that Defendant Honda wrongfully
decided not to renew Plaintiff’s contract because of Plaintiff’s disabilities,
perceived disabilities, and need for accommodation. (4AC ¶¶ 30, 37, 40, 41, 42,
43, 44, 53, 90, 104, 129.) Plaintiff cannot premise a wrongful termination
claim on Defendant’s failure to renew the employment contract as a matter of
law. 
 
In opposition,
Plaintiff argues that the wrongful termination claim is based on constructive
discharge because Plaintiff continued to be an employee by Defendants and was
eligible to be placed with other clients of Defendants, but because Plaintiff
earned no income Plaintiff was forced to seek other employment options. (4AC ¶¶
43, 44.) Plaintiff fails to specifically allege that he resigned from his
employment with Defendants because he refused to engage in a practice that
violated public policy or because he was required to endure intolerable working
conditions that violated public policy. (See CACI Nos. 2431, 2432.)
 
“Standing alone,
constructive discharge is neither a tort nor a breach of contract, but a
doctrine that transforms what is ostensibly a resignation into a firing. Even
after establishing constructive discharge, an employee
must independently prove a breach of contract or tort in connection with
employment termination in order to obtain damages for wrongful discharge.” (Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc.
(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1238, 1251.) Here, the 4AC is devoid of allegations as to how
Defendants breached the employment contract by failing to renew it. The 4AC is
also devoid of allegations that Plaintiff 
was forced to resign, and that the resignation was wrongful. Instead,
the 4AC alleges that Defendants’ decision not to renew Plaintiff’s contract was
wrongful due to Plaintiff’s actual or perceived disabilities. (4AC ¶¶ 30, 37,
40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 53, 90, 104, 129.) “In other words, Defendants
terminated Plaintiff’s employment after seven years, refused to hire Plaintiff
for a direct hire position and refused to consider Plaintiff for open
positions.” (FAC ¶ 38) Such a refusal to hire or employ
Plaintiff by not renewing the employment contract, is an allegation that is
subsumed in Plaintiff’s disability discrimination claim under FEHA. (See Gov.
Code, § 12940(a).)
 
As this is Plaintiff’s fourth amended
pleading and Plaintiff has failed to show that the eighth cause of action is
capable of successful amendment, the demurrer to the eighth cause of action is
sustained without leave to amend. 
 
III.      Motion to Strike
 
Defendants maintain that Plaintiff fails
to plead sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages against
Defendants. Accordingly, Defendants move to strike the following portions of
the 4AC: 
 

Paragraphs 58-59,
     71-72, 84-85, 95-96, 109-110, 118-119, 134-135, 145-146;
Page 35, Prayer
     for Relief, Paragraph 5: “For punitive … damages where available by law;”

 
To state a claim for
punitive damages under Civ. Code § 3294, a plaintiff must allege specific facts
showing that the defendant has been guilty of malice, oppression or fraud. (Smith
v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th 1033, 1042.)¿ The basis for
punitive damages must be pled with specificity; conclusory allegations devoid
of any factual assertions are insufficient. (Ibid.)¿¿“Malice” is defined
in Civ. Code, § 3294 (c)(1) as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to
cause injury” or “despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with
a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” “Oppression”
is defined as “despicable conduct subjecting a person to cruel and unjust
hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.” (Civ. Code §,
3294(c)(2).) The term “despicable” has been defined in the case law as actions
that are “base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.” (Shade Foods, Inc. v. Innovative
Products Sales & Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 847, 891.) Fraud
means “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material
fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of
thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing
injury.” (Civ. Code, § 3294(c)(3). When the defendant is a¿corporation,
“the oppression, fraud, or malice must be perpetrated, authorized, or knowingly
ratified by an officer, director, or managing agent of the¿corporation.” (Wilson
v. Southern California Edison Company (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 123, 164; see
Civ. Code, § 3294(b).)
 
The 4AC alleges that “Pierre Descamps and Masatsugu Endo,” as
managing agents of Defendant “were angry with Plaintiff because of his
inability to travel and his need for accommodation” and that “Sarah Hughes,
Consultant Services Manager, and Anthony Del Preto, Vice President of Sales and
Operations” condoned illegal conduct by failing to take “prompt corrective
measures within their control and failed to contact Plaintiff regarding his
health condition and need for time off.” (4AC ¶¶ 31, 32.) The 4AC alleges that
“Pierre Descamps and Masatsugu Endo” were Plaintiff’s supervisors and managing
agents of Defendants, and said supervisors were unfit yet Defendants continued
to employ the supervisors despite knowing they disregarded of the rights or
safety of others. (4AC ¶¶ 30, 85.) 
 
The court agrees that Plaintiff fails to
allege facts sufficient to show that an officer, director, or managing agent of
Defendants acted with malice, oppression, or fraud to support a claim for
punitive damages. The 4AC specifically fails to allege that an officer,
director, or managing agent of Defendants knew that Plaintiff had a disability
and had requested a reasonable accommodation, and that said accommodation was
unreasonably denied by an officer, director, or managing agent of Defendants
with willful and/or conscious disregard for Plaintiff’s rights under FEHA.  The 4AC also fails to allege that an officer,
director, or managing agent of Defendants knew about Plaintiff’s disability and
requested accommodation and, with a willful and/or conscious disregard for
Plaintiff’s rights, refused to hire Plaintiff based on Plaintiff’s
disability/perceived disability by not renewing his employment contract despite
having done so previously.  Moreover, as
the 4AC alleges that Defendants compromised Plaintiff’s safety, Plaintiff must
plead specific facts as to  how
Plaintiff’s safety was compromised and why said conduct was done with malice,
fraud, or oppression by a managing agent of Defendants or ratified by said
agent.  
 
As Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages
is capable of successful amendment, Defendants’ motion to strike is granted
with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’
demurrer to the eighth cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of
public policy is sustained without leave to amend. Defendants’ motion to strike
punitive damages from the 4AC is granted with leave to amend. Plaintiff
is granted 30 days leave to amend. The court sets the OSC RE: Amended Complaint
for May 28, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Defendants to give notice.
