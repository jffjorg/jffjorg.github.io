[1] Pursuant to CCP §§ 430.41 and section 435.5(a), the partis
are required to meet and confer prior to filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike. Defense counsel asserts that they have attempted to meet and confer
with Plaintiff’s counsel, but the Plaintiff’s counsel has not responded.
(Kabani Decl. ¶¶ 10, 11, Ex. H.)“Any
determination by the court that the meet and confer process was insufficient
shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.” (CCP § 430.41(a)(4).) As
the failure to meet and confer does not constitute grounds to overrule a
demurrer, the court continues to the merits.
