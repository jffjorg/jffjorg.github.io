And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of LFT Holdings, LLC vs. Galia Kassabian. The Judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's deposition, requiring the defendant to appear and answer questions at deposition and to produce documents and things described in the notice of deposition. The parties are ordered to meet and confer to set the defendant's deposition date, which will occur on February 12, 13, or 15, 2024.

The Judge has denied the defendant's request to continue the trial, as the defendant did not make a properly noticed motion or application for a continuance. The Judge has also denied the defendant's request for monetary sanctions, citing the defendant's representation that she is unable to pay such sanctions.

The Judge's ruling is based on the fact that the defendant failed to serve an objection to the notice of deposition and failed to provide dates prior to mid-February for which she would appear for deposition. The Judge has also considered the Code of Civil Procedure and the California Rules of Court in making its decision.
