And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike the plaintiff's request for past-due rent and the defendant's demurrer to the complaint for unlawful detainer. The judge has denied the motion to strike and overruled the demurrer.

The plaintiff, Beverly Hills Properties, LLC, served a 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit on July 12, 2023, and the defendant, Lisa J. Gastineau, argues that the notice was not properly served. The judge found that the plaintiff properly pleaded that the defendant was served with the notice and that the notice was properly served in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 1162, subdivision (a)(3).

The judge also found that the complaint states a claim for unlawful detainer based on nonpayment of rent, and that the plaintiff may amend the complaint to conform to the proof pertaining to the 3-Day Notice at the time of trial.

The defendant's demurrer is overruled, and the defendant is ordered to file and serve an answer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint within five days.
