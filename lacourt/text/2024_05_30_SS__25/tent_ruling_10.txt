[1] The
Court notes that Plaintiff is requesting two forms of relief in the
Interrogatories Motion. Plaintiff should have filed separate motions to compel
responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories. Plaintiff cannot
seek to avoid the filing fee. However, the Court will still consider the
Interrogatories Motion on its merits.
