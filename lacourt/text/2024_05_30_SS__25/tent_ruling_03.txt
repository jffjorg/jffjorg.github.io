 
BACKGROUND
 
On May October
24, 2018, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint alleging a single cause of action for
Subrogation against Defendant Jose Andrade (“Defendant”) and DOES 1 to 10. The
Complaint arises from Defendant colliding with the vehicle of Plaintiff’s
insured. 
 
On
January 8, 2019, Plaintiff filed a Stipulation for Judgment (the “Stipulation”)
which indicates that Plaintiff and Defendant stipulate that Defendant owes
Plaintiff “the principal amount of $15,750.86, plus interest at the legal rate
of 7% from August 7, 2018 in the amount of $293.01, plus costs of $370.00. As
such, judgment for said amount is agreed to and shall be entered in favor of
plaintiff and against defendant.” (Stipulation at ¶ 1.) The Stipulation
provides that Defendant shall make fixed monthly payments and that the
settlement amount is $13,600.69. (Stipulation at ¶ 2.) Specifically, an initial
payment was to be made by Defendant’s insurance carrier on January 15, 2019 in
the amount of $5,000.00. (Stipulation, ¶ 2.) Then, starting on January 15,
2019, Defendant was to make monthly payments of $150.00 and then one final
payment of $50.69 on October 15, 2023. (Stipulation, ¶ 2.) The stipulation
further provides that “[i]f defendant fails to pay on time and in the full
amounts as they become due, plaintiff will be entitled to seek a writ and use
any legal means to enforce the judgment. Plaintiff will be entitled to take
such measures upon submission to the Court of a declaration showing the default
by plaintiff’s counsel.” (Stipulation, ¶ 2.) According to the Stipulation, any
dispute arising out of the Stipulation entitles the prevailing party to an
award of reasonable attorney fees and costs. (Stipulation, ¶ 3.) 
 
On June
5, 2019, the Court entered an Order for Dismissal with Reservation to Vacate
and Enter Judgment Upon Breach. The Court’s June 5, 2019 order provides that
the entire case is dismissed without prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation for
Dismissal and that the Court retains jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6. 
 
Also, on
June 5, 2019, the Court dismissed this action pursuant to the Stipulation, and
ordered this action dismissed without prejudice. (06/05/19 Minute Order.) The
Court retained jurisdiction to enforce any and all terms of settlement,
including judgment, pursuant to CCP § 664.6. (06/05/19 Minute Order.) 
 
On
September 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed and served the instant Motion to Vacate
Dismissal and Enter Judgment Pursuant to CCP § 664.6. As of May 28, 2024, the
motion is unopposed. Any opposition to the motion was required to have been
filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (CCP §
1005(b).)

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Enforcing
the Settlement Agreement   
A.               
Legal Standard 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6
provides a summary procedure to enforce a settlement agreement by entering
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” Hines
v. Lukes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182. “[I]f the parties to
pending litigation enter into a settlement either in writing signed by the
parties or orally before the court, the court, upon a motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” Ibid. “The court
retains jurisdiction to enforce a settlement under the statute even after a
dismissal, but only if the parties requested such a retention of jurisdiction
before the dismissal.” Ibid. “Such a request must be made either in
writing signed by the parties or orally before the court.” Ibid. 
“A court ruling on a motion under Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 must determine whether the parties entered
into a valid and binding settlement.” Ibid. “A settlement is enforceable
under section 664.6 only if the parties agreed to all material settlement
terms.” Ibid. “The court ruling on the motion may consider the parties’
declarations and other evidence in deciding what terms the parties agreed to.” Ibid.
“If the court determines that the parties entered into an enforceable
settlement, it should grant the motion and enter a formal judgment pursuant to
the terms of the settlement.” Ibid. Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6 “expressly
provides for the court to enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement.” Id. at p. 1183. “It is widely recognized that the courts are not at
liberty to revise an agreement under the guise of construing it.” Series AGI Est Linn of Appian Group Investors
DE, LLC v. Eves (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 156, 164. A prevailing party is entitled to its costs in
any action or proceeding. (CCP § 1032(b).) A prevailing party is a party with a
net monetary recovery. (CCP § 1032(a)(4).) 
B.        Discussion  
In support of the motion, Plaintiff’s
counsel, Harlan M. Reese (“Reese”), declares that on December 29, 2018, the
parties entered into the Stipulation, in which Defendant agreed to make monthly
payments to settle this matter. (Reese Decl., ¶ 2; Exh. A.) Subsequently on
June 5, 2019, this action was dismissed with reservation to vacate and enter
judgment upon breach pursuant to CCP § 664.6. (Reese Decl., ¶ 3; Exh. B.) Defendant’s
insurance carrier made a one-time payment in the amount of $5,000.00. (Reese Decl.,
¶ 4.) Defendant made monthly payments pursuant to the stipulation totaling
$5,100.00; however, Defendant has since defaulted on payments. (Reese Decl., ¶
5.) Pursuant to the terms of the Stipulation, on or about May 26, 2023,
Plaintiff mailed Defendant a default letter regarding the missed payments.
(Reese Decl., ¶ 6; Exh. C.) Since payment was not made within 14 days,
Plaintiff is entitled to have any dismissal in this action set aside and
judgment entered, minus credit for payments received. (Reese Decl., ¶ 7.) 
Plaintiff now seeks to set aside the
dismissal “and enter judgment in the amount of $13,600.69, less the later
payments of $10,100.00 plus court costs Plaintiff has incurred of $509.50
consisting of: $370.00 filing fee, $79.50 service fee, $60.00 motion fee, for a
total judgment in the amount of $4,010.19.” (Reese Decl., ¶ 2.) 
 The Court finds that it has authority to
enforce the Stipulation pursuant to Hines v. Lukes, supra, 167
Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182. Plaintiff and Defendant signed the Stipulation. The
Court also has jurisdiction to enforce the Stipulation as the Court entered an
order indicating that it retained jurisdiction under CCP § 664.6. The Court
furthermore determines that the parties entered into a valid and binding
agreement. The declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel sets forth the terms of the Stipulation
and indicates that Defendant has breached the Stipulation. 
 
The Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment is
therefore GRANTED. 
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside
the Dismissal Entered on 06/05/2019 and to Enter Judgment is GRANTED. 
 
The Court
will enforce the Stipulation and enter judgment thereto in favor of Plaintiff
and against Defendant Jose Andrade in the amount of $4,010.19.
  Counsel for Plaintiff is ordered to electronically submit a proposed form of judgment, consistent with today’s Court’s Ruling, within 10-days of this Court’s order.
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
