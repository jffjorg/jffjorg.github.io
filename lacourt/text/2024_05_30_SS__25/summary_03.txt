English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment in the amount of $4,010.19. The plaintiff filed a complaint alleging a single cause of action for subrogation against the defendant. The parties stipulated to settle the case, and the defendant agreed to make monthly payments. However, the defendant has defaulted on payments, and the plaintiff seeks to enforce the stipulation and enter judgment. The court finds that it has jurisdiction to enforce the stipulation and determines that the parties entered into a valid and binding agreement. The court grants the motion and enters judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant.
