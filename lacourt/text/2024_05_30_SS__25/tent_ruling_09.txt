On June
30, 2023, Plaintiff Fredy Moncada (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against
Defendants Karplus Warehouse, Inc. (“Karplus”), Westlake Services, LLC dba
Westlake Financial Services, Western Surety Company (collectively
“Defendants”), and DOES 1 through 40, inclusive, alleging causes of action for:
(1) Violation of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act; (2) Violation of California
Business and Professions Code § 17200, et seq.; and (3) Claim Against Dealer
Bond. The Complaint arises from Plaintiff’s purchase of “a used 2016 Mitsubishi
Outland [sic].” (Complaint, ¶ 16.) Plaintiff alleges that at the time of sale,
the vehicle had at least one open recall. (Complaint, ¶ 18.)   
On August
10, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of service indicating that Defendant Karplus
was served with the summons and complaint by substituted service on July 13,
2023. 
 
On April
3, 2024, Defendant Karplus filed an Answer to the Complaint. 
 
On April
4, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served an unopposed motion to compel Defendant
Karplus to serve complete verified responses, without objection, to Plaintiff’s
Request for Production of Documents, Nos. 1-12 (the “RPD Motion”). 
 
Also, on
April 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served an unopposed motion to compel
Defendant Karplus to serve complete verified responses, without objection, to
Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories Nos. 103.1, 104.1, 112.1, 112.5, 115.2, and
150.1 and to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories Nos. 1-7 (the “Interrogatories
Motion”).[1] 
 
On April
5, 2024, Plaintiff filed an unopposed motion to deem facts as admitted against
Defendant Karplus in Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions Nos. 1-6 (the “RFA
Motion”) (collectively, the “Motions”).
 
The
Motions each seek monetary sanctions against Defendant Karplus and/or its
counsel in the amount of $1,525.00. The Court also initially notes that the
declarations of Kasra Sadr (“Sadr”) in support of each of the Motions are
identical. Thus, the Court will address the Motions in this one ruling. 
 
Any
opposition to the Motions was required to have been filed and served at least
nine court days prior to the hearing. (CCP § 1005(b).)

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Compelling Discovery
Responses, Deeming the RFAs as Admitted, and the Imposition of Sanctions 
A.               
Legal Standard/Applicable Law 

“Any party may obtain discovery . .
. by a written request that any other party to the action admit the genuineness
of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact, opinion
relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for admission may
relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.010.) “Within 30 days
after service of requests for admission, the party to whom the requests are
directed shall serve the original of the response to them on the requesting
party, and a copy of the response on all other parties who have appeared.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.250(a).)
 
When a party fails to serve a
timely response to requests for admission “[t]he party to whom the request was
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product.” (Code Civ. Proc § 2033.280(a).) “The
requesting party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as
well as for a monetary sanction.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(b).) The court
shall issue this order unless the party to whom the request was made serves a
response in substantial compliance prior to the hearing on the motion. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).) “It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction . . . on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated [the] motion.” Id.

 
“Within 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the
interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them
on the propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court
has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding
party the court has extended the time for response.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.
(a).)  If the party to whom interrogatories
are directed fails to serve a timely response, “[t]he party to whom the interrogatories
are directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
“The party propounding interrogatories may move for an order compelling
response to the interrogatories.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)  
 
Any party may obtain discovery . . . by inspecting, copying, testing, or
sampling documents, tangible things, land or other property, and electronically
stored information in the possession, custody, or control of any other party to
the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010, subd. (a).) Where a party fails to
timely respond to demand for inspection, copying, testing or sampling “[t]he
party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(a).) Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(b) provides that “[t]he party making the
demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand.”
 
Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(d)
provides that a misuse of the discovery process is “[f]ailing to respond to or
to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(h) states that a
misuse of the discovery process includes “[m]aking or opposing, unsuccessfully
and without substantial justification, a motion to compel or limit
discovery.”   “The court may impose a
monetary sanction against a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process, or any attorney advising that conduct” under Code Civ. Proc. §
2023.030(a).  A court has discretion to
fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions.  Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit
Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.
 
B.        The Interrogatories
Motion
            As indicated
above, Plaintiff’s counsel, Kasra Sadr (“Sadr”) provides identical declarations
in support of the Motions. As such, the Court’s recitation of the declaration
of Mr. Sadr concerning the Interrogatories Motion will also apply to the RPD
Motion and the RFA Motion.  
            Mr. Sadr
declares the following: On October 6, 2023, his office served discovery
requests on Defendant Karplus including Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, Requests for Admissions, and Requests for Production of
Documents. (Sadr Decl., ¶¶ 3-6; Exhs. 1-4.) The discovery at issue was served
by mail to the address of Defendant Karplus confirmed on the Answer of
Defendant Karplus to the Complaint. (Sadr Decl., ¶ 3.) Mr. Sadr received an
Answer to the Complaint by Defendant Karplus on August 21, 2023 via e-mail.
(Sadr Decl., ¶¶ 11-12; Exhs. 9 and 10.) Defendant Karplus has still not provided
any responses to Plaintiff’s discovery requests. (Sadr Decl., ¶ 13.) 
            Mr. Sadr
states that he spent 6.3 hours researching and drafting the Motions, which were
done consecutively. (Sadr Decl., ¶ 14.) Mr. Sadr states that his ordinary rate
is $650.00 per hour, and it will presumably cost him $100.00 to serve the
motions supported by his declaration based on past experience. (Sadr Decl., ¶¶
16-17.)
            Here,
Plaintiff has propounded discovery on Defendant Karplus and Defendant Karplus
has failed to respond to such discovery. 
            Defendant Karplus is therefore ORDERED to provide
verified, complete, and code-compliant responses, without objections, to
Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories Nos. 103.1, 104.1, 112.1, 112.5, 115.2, and
150.1 and to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7
within 30 days of the date of notice of this order. 
            As to
monetary sanctions, given that the Motions rely on the same declaration, were
researched and drafted consecutively, and are all brief, the Court GRANTS IN
PART Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions as to the Interrogatories
Motion. The Court exercises its discretion and AWARDS Plaintiff reasonable
monetary sanctions as to the Interrogatories Motion in the sum of $325.00 per
hour, which represents 0.5 hours of work on such motion at the rate of $650.00
per hour. The Court reduces the total hours given the straightforward nature of
the Motions. 
            Monetary
sanctions are to be paid to Plaintiff by Defendant Karplus and its counsel of
record, Jay Smith, jointly and severally, in the amount of $325.00 within 30
days of the date of this order as to the Interrogatories Motion.  
C.        The RPD
Motion   
 
            The Court references the declaration of Mr. Sadr from
above and incorporates it herein. Defendant Karplus has failed to respond to
Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents. 
 
            Defendant
Karplus is therefore ORDERED to provide verified, complete, and code-compliant responses,
without objections, to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents Nos. 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 within 30 days of the date of notice of
this order. 
 
            The
Court reduces the total hours concerning monetary sanctions as to the RPD
Motion for the reasons articulated above as to the Interrogatories Motion. The
Court therefore GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions as to
the RPD Motion and AWARDS Plaintiff reasonable monetary sanctions as to the RPD
Motion in the sum of $325.00 per hour, which represents 0.5 hours of work on
such motion at the rate of $650.00 per hour.
 
            Monetary
sanctions are to be paid to Plaintiff by Defendant Karplus and its counsel of
record, Jay Smith, jointly and severally, in the amount of $325.00 within 30
days of the date of this order as to the RPD Motion.  
 
D.        The
RFA Motion   
 
            The
Court references the declaration of Mr. Sadr from above and incorporates it
herein. Defendant Karplus has failed to respond to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission.
The Court therefore deems the matters in Set One of Plaintiff’s Requests for
Admission as admitted. 
 
            The
Court reduces the total hours concerning monetary sanctions as to the RFA
Motion for the reasons articulated above as to the Interrogatories Motion.
 
            The
Court therefore GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions as to
the RFA Motion and AWARDS Plaintiff reasonable monetary sanctions as to the RFA
Motion in the sum of $325.00 per hour, which represents 0.5 hours of work on
such motion at the rate of $650.00 per hour.
 
            Monetary
sanctions are to be paid to Plaintiff by Defendant Karplus and its counsel of
record, Jay Smith, jointly and severally, in the amount of $325.00 within 30
days of the date of this order as to the RFA Motion.  

 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Based on the foregoing, the Interrogatories Motion and the RPD Motion are both GRANTED IN PART. 
 
            Defendant Karplus is
ORDERED to provide verified, complete, and code-compliant responses, without
objections, to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories Nos. 103.1, 104.1, 112.1,
112.5, 115.2, and 150.1 and to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories Nos. 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 within 30 days of the date of notice of this order.

            Plaintiff’s
request for monetary sanctions as to each of the Motions is GRANTED IN PART.
