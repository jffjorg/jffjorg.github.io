Leave to
file late government claim
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Before a suit for damages may be filed against a public entity, a
claimant must present a timely written claim to the public entity and the claim
must have been acted upon by the board or deemed rejected.¿(Gov. Code § 945.4; Munoz
v. State of California (1995) 33 Cal. App. 4th 1767, 1777.) A claim
relating to a cause of action for injury to person or personal property must be
presented to the public entity not later than six months after the accrual of
the cause of action. (Gov. Code § 911.2; Munoz, at p. 1777.¿) 
 
If an injured party who has failed to timely file a claim has
submitted a written application to the public entity for leave to present such
claim and the application has been denied, the injured party may petition the
court for relief from the claim requirements.¿(Munoz, supra, 33
Cal.App.4th at . 1777.) A petition pursuant to Gov. Code § 946.6 must be “filed
within six months after the application to the board is denied or deemed to be
denied pursuant to section 911.6.”¿(Gov. Code § 946.6(b); see also City of
Los Angeles v. Superior Court (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 621, 627.) This
requirement is mandatory. (Lineaweaver v. S. Cal. Rapid Transit Dist.
(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 738, 741.) 
II.        Discussion
 
“If the
public entity denies the application to file a late claim, section 946.6
authorizes the injured party to petition the trial court for relief from the
claim filing requirements. In ruling on the petition, the trial court “shall
relieve the petitioner from the requirements of Section 945.4” to timely file a
claim if two requirements are met. (§ 946.6, subd. (c).) First, the application
to the public entity to file a late claim must have been made within a
reasonable time not exceeding one year after the accrual of the cause of
action. (§ 946.6, subd. (c).) Second, one of the four circumstances set forth
in section 946.6, subdivision (c) must be shown by a preponderance of the
evidence. (§ 946.6, subd. (c).” (N.G. v. County of San Diego (2020) 59
Cal.App.5th 63, 72.) “The court decides whether to grant relief pursuant to
Section 946.6 on the basis of the petition, declarations, and evidence offered
in support of or opposition to the petition.” (Garber v. City of Clovis
(E.D. Cal. 2010) 698 F.Supp.2d 1204, 1210.) 
 
On March 23, 2022,
Petitioner was seriously injured as a result of a trip and fall that occurred
in the crosswalk at the northwest corner of the intersection of Colorado Blvd
and Allen Ave in Pasadena, California. (Hundley Decl. ¶ 1.) Petitioner believed
that a private construction company, Chi Construction, was responsible for the
fall and sought legal counsel to pursue a claim against the private company but
did not know at the time that she could pursue a claim against the City of
Pasadena. (See i.e. Supp. Hudley Decl. at p. 2) It was not until talking with counsel
on March 2, 2023, that Petitioner learned she had a claim against Respondent.
(Hudley Decl. ¶ 1.) Accordingly, on March 7, 2023, Petitioner formally retained
counsel to represent her and present a late claim to Respondent for her March
23, 2022, fall. (Hudley Decl. ¶ 2.) According to Respondent, on March 8, 2023,
Petitioner via her counsel requested leave to submit a late claim for damages,
via a letter dated March 7, 2023. (St. Clair Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. 1.) On April 3,
2023, the city rejected Petitioner’s request for leave to present a late claim.
(Id. ¶ 3, Ex. 2.) 
 
The
Respondent asserts that Petitioner was dilatory in seeking counsel to present a
late claim. “The claimant must, at a minimum, make a diligent effort to obtain
legal counsel within six months after the accrual of the cause of
action.” (Munoz v. State of California (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th
1767, 1779 (Munoz) [italics added].) Here, within one year of her
injury, on March 2, 2023, Petitioner sought legal counsel and did in fact
retain legal counsel to March 7, 2023. (Hudley Decl. ¶ 3.) However, “[w]hen the
underlying application to file a late claim is filed more than one year after the
accrual of the cause of action, the court is without jurisdiction to
grant relief under Government Code section 946.6.” (Munoz, at p. 1779.)
Respondent asserts that because Petitioner’s injury occurred on March 22, 2022,
her cause of action accrued on September 21, 2022, which is six months from the
date she sustained her injury under Gov. Code section 911.2. (See People ex rel. Dept. of Transportation v. Superior Court (2003)
105 Cal.App.4th 39, 43 [“Section 911.2 requires that a claim for personal
injury or wrongful death against a public entity be filed ‘not later than six
months after the accrual of the cause of action.’”] [italics added].) 
 
Assuming
the Petitioner’s claim did accrue on September 21, 2022, the Petitioner had six
months after this date, or until March 21, 2023, to file a late claim with the
city under Gov. Code section 911.2. The facts establish that Petitioner filed
her request with the City on March 8, 2023, well within the six-month deadline.
(St. Clair Dec, ¶ 3, Ex. 1.) Accordingly, the Petition is timely, and
Respondent fails to show that the court is without jurisdiction to grant the
relief requested. “A trial court has broad discretion in ruling on a petition
for relief from the claim-filing requirement as long as the issue is whether the late claim
was presented within a ‘reasonable time’ not to exceed one year after the
accrual of the cause of action. [Citations.] When an application to file
a late claim is itself not timely filed, however, the court is without
jurisdiction to grant relief under section 946.6. [Citations.]” (County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (Crystal B., Steven G.,
Anita G.) (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1303, 1313–1314.) “When the
underlying application to file a late claim is filed more than one year after
the accrual of the cause of action, the court is without jurisdiction to grant
relief under Government Code section 946.6.” (J.J. v. County of San Diego
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1221.) Here, the underlying application was filed
on March 8, 2023, within one year after the accrual of the cause of action.
After the Petition was denied by Respondent City on April 3, 2023, Petitioner
had six months, or until October 3, 2023, to file this Petition. (Gov. Code, §
946.6.) Petitioner filed this Petition on October 2, 2023. 
 
The court further finds that Petitioner
was diligent in seeking counsel and the failure to present the claim was due to
“mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect” as the Petitioner
thought she only had claims against a private entity and not the city. (Supp. Hudley
Decl.) Petitioner further asserts that Respondent City would not be prejudiced
because the City investigated the fall on the date it occurred, obtained a
police report, has pictures of the location where the incident occurred, and
has already tendered this matter to the insurance company for Chi Construction.
(Petition Ex. A, Supp. Hudley Decl. )


Accordingly, the Petition is granted. 
 
Conclusion
 
The Petition is granted.
Petitioner to give notice.
