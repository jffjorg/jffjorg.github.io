Background
 
On
October 23, 2023, Elliott Boys and Shannon White (“Plaintiffs”) filed a
Complaint against Ford Motor Company; South Bay Ford Inc. (collectively “Ford
Defendants”); and Does 1 to 10. The Complaint alleges six causes of action for
violations of: (1) Civ. Code § 1793.2(d); (2) Civ. Code § 1793.2(b); (3) Civ.
Code § 1793.2(a)(3); (4) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability; (5)
fraudulent inducement; and (6) negligent repair.
 
On
November 27, 2023, the Ford Defendants filed a demurrer to Plaintiffs’
Complaint. Plaintiffs oppose the demurrer. The matter is now before the court. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP, § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
Defendants demur to Plaintiffs’ fifth
cause of action for fraudulent inducement and sixth cause of action for
negligent repair. 
 
The
complaint asserts that on October 31, 2020, the Plaintiffs purchased a 2020
Ford Explorer (the “subject vehicle”) which was manufactured and disturbed by
Defendant Ford Motor Company. (Compl. ¶ 9.) 
The Complaint asserts that Defendants had superior knowledge that
vehicles equipped with a 10-speed transmission as the subject vehicle suffered
from a “Transmission Defect” such as “hesitation and/or delayed acceleration;
harsh and/or hard shifting; jerking, shuddering, and/or juddering[.]” (Compl. ¶
25.) 
 
The
Complaint alleges that Defendants has superior knowledge of the Transmission
Defect through various sources of information including “pre-production
testing, pre-production design failure mode and analysis data, production
failure mode and analysis data, early consumer complaints made exclusively to
Ford's network of dealers and directly to Ford, aggregate warranty data
compiled from Ford's network of dealers, testing conducted by Ford in response
to consumer complaints, and repair order and parts data received by Ford from
Ford's network of dealers.” (Compl. ¶ 26.) This resulted in Ford issuing a
technical service bulletins (“TSB”) regarding the Transmission Defect,
including a TSB on March 2, 2018, regarding the Ford 2017 F-150 that had the
same type of transmission as the subject vehicle. (Compl. ¶ 28.) Ford
subsequently issued other TSB regarding transmission troubles such as TSB
18-2079, TSB 18-2274, TSB 18-2079, TSB 18-02274, and TSB 21-2315. (Compl. ¶¶
29-32.)
 
The
Complaint alleges that despite Ford knowing about the Transmission Defect, they
failed to fix the defects that affect the Subject Vehicle and Plaintiffs would
not have purchased the vehicle or paid less had they known about the
Transmission Defect. (Compl. ¶¶ 34, 35.) Plaintiffs further assert that the
Transmission Defect exposed Plaintiffs to the risk of accident, injury, and/or
liability to others and that they expected the Subject Vehicle to be safe and
free of defects and that Defendants would not sell or lease a vehicle with
known safety-related defects. (Compl. ¶ 35.) The Complaint assert that because
Defendant ford was fully aware of the Transmission Defect, it actively
concealed the existence and nature of the defect from Plaintiffs at the time of
purchase, repair, and thereafter. (Compl. ¶ 36.)
 
A.        Fifth
Cause of Action – Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment
 
“In
California, fraud must be pled specifically; general and conclusory allegations
do not suffice.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631,
645.) “The elements of fraud, which give rise to the tort action for deceit,
are (a) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or
nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to
defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting
damage.” (Id. at p. 638.)¿¿ 
 
“The requirement of
specificity in a fraud action against a corporation requires the plaintiff to
allege the names of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent
representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said
or wrote, and when it was said or written.” (Tarmann v. State Farm Mut.
Auto. Ins. Co.¿(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.) “We acknowledge that the
requirement of specificity is relaxed when the allegations indicate that ‘the
defendant must necessarily possess full information concerning the facts of the
controversy’ [citation] or ‘when the facts lie more in the knowledge of the
opposite party[.]’ [Citation.]” (Id. at 158.)¿ 
 
The
court finds that the Plaintiffs have properly pled facts to show that the
defect that Defendants concealed was the transmission defect and that
Defendants had a duty to disclose the defect because they had superior
knowledge of the Defect. (Compl. ¶¶ 29-32.) There are four circumstances in
which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable fraud: “(1) when
the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff; (2) when the
defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff;
(3) when the defendant actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff;
and (4) when the defendant makes partial representations but also suppresses
some material facts.” (Heliotis v. Schuman (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d
646, 651.)
 
Ford’s superior knowledge of the Transmission Defect came
from “warranty data compiled from Ford's network of dealers, testing conducted
by Ford in response to consumer complaints, and repair order and parts data
received by Ford from Ford's network of dealers.” (Compl. ¶ 26.) It also came
from previous TSBs that were issued and warned about the same problems with the
transmission in vehicles that had the same transmission as the subject vehicle.
(Compl. ¶¶ 29-32.) Accordingly, due to Ford’s superior knowledge, it had a duty
to disclose a known defect to Defendants. “Whether the plaintiff will be able
to prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.” (Stevens
v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)
 
Moreover,
the
specificity requirement is harder to meet when the fraud cause of action is
based on nondisclosure. (See Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement System
& Planning Assn., Inc.¿(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1384 [“How does one
show ‘how’ and ‘by what means' something didn't happen, or ‘when’ it never
happened, or ‘where’ it never happened?”].) “One of the purposes of the
specificity requirement is ‘notice to the defendant, to furnish the defendant
with certain definite charges which can be intelligently met.’ ” (Id. at
p. 1384 [internal quotations omitted].) “Also ‘considerations of practicality
enter in,’ when multiple plaintiffs and defendants are involved.¿[Citation.]” (Ibid.) 
 
In Jones v.
ConocoPhillips, Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, the appellate court found
that the plaintiff’s fraudulent concealment claim against multiple defendants
was adequately pled when material facts known to the defendants were not
disclosed and the defendant had exclusive knowledge of the material facts not
known to the plaintiffs and defendants actively concealed the material fact
from plaintiffs. (Id. at pp. 1199-1200 [“Each defendant is therefore on
notice that it allegedly concealed or failed to disclose the toxic properties
of the product it sold to Goodyear and Upjohn during the course of Carlos's
employment. Although sparse, nothing more is required at this early stage of
the litigation.”].) Here, the fifth cause of action is pled only against one
defendant, Ford, and the defect specifically relates to issues in the
transmission of the Subject Vehicle. The facts as pled are sufficient to put
Defendant Forn on notice of the claims alleged against it without Plaintiff
needing to specify the name of the agent(s) who specifically concealed the
transmission defect. 
 
Furthermore, Defendant
Ford fails to cite case law to show that under the Song-Beverly Act, Plaintiff
must plead a direct transactional relationship or show privity with the vehicle
manufacturer to bring a claim. Moreover, the court
disagrees that under the Song-Beverly Act, the plaintiff must plead a direct
transactional relationship or privity with the manufacturer to allege fraud. “‘[W]here
material facts are known to one party and not to the other, failure to disclose
them is not actionable fraud unless there is some relationship between the
parties which gives rise to a duty to disclose such known facts.’ ” (LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 337.)
“Actionable fraud may be found where  the
defendant has exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff
and actively conceals the material facts, but the “failure to disclose them is not actionable
fraud unless there is some relationship between the parties which gives
rise to a duty to disclose such known facts.” (Hoffman v. 162 North Wolfe LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th
1178, 1187.) “Thus, a duty to
disclose may arise from the relationship between seller and buyer[.]” (Id.
at p. 1187.) 
 
While Ford was not the direct
seller of the Subject Vehicle, Ford was the manufacturer and the source of the
vehicle warranty. Moreover, it  was
foreseeable that the Subject Vehicle would be sold through its network of
dealers. Moreover, the rule in California is that “a  vehicle manufacturer owes a duty to purchasers of its
vehicles to disclose known defects.” (Gilead Tenofovir Cases
(2024) 98 Cal.App.5th 911, 949.) Accordingly, Ford’s argument that direct
transactional relationship or privity is required for Ford to have a duty to
disclose is without merit. 
 
Lastly, Defendant Ford argues that the
economic loss rule bars the Plaintiffs’ claim for fraudulent concealment. California law does not permit a plaintiff to recover
tort damages for contract claims. As explained by the California Supreme Court,
“the economic loss rule prevents the law of contract and the law of tort from
dissolving into the other.” (Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp.
(2004) 34 Cal. 4th 979, 989 (Robinson).) However, if the claim is
based on fraudulent inducement, such claims are not barred by the economic loss
rule. (Id. at p. 989-800 [“Tort damages
have been permitted in contract cases where . . . the contract was fraudulently
induced”].) Hence, tort damages have been permitted in contract cases where the
contract was fraudulently induced, where “the duty that gives rise to
tort liability is either completely independent of the contract or arises from
conduct which is both intentional and intended to harm.” (Erlich v. Menezes
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 552.)
 
In Dhital
v. Nissan North America, Inc. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th
828, the appellate
court held that the economic loss rule does not bar claims for fraudulent
concealment. “Applying Robinson here (and cognizant that our Supreme
Court may soon provide additional guidance), we conclude plaintiffs’ claim for
fraudulent inducement by concealment is not subject to demurrer on the ground
it is barred by the economic loss rule.” (Id. at p. 840.) Recently, the
California Supreme Court granted the review of Dhital in relation to
the Ninth Circuit’s request for certification of the question of whether claims
from fraudulent concealment are exempted from the economic loss rule in Rattagan
v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (9th Cir. 2021) 19 F.4th 1188.¿ 
 
The court finds that because no defects exist on the face of
the Complaint, the court will allow the Plaintiff to proceed with a claim for
fraudulent inducement via concealment. Accordingly, the demurrer to the fifth
cause of action is overruled. 
 
B.        Sixth
Cause of Action – Negligent Repair
 
“The elements of a
cause of action for negligence are well established. They are (a) a legal duty
to use due care; (b) a breach of such legal duty; [and] (c) the breach as the
proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.” (Ladd v. County of San
Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 917 [internal quotations omitted].) “A duty
may arise through statute, contract, or the relationship of the parties.” (Lichtman
v. Siemens Industry Inc. (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 914, 920 [internal
quotations and citations omitted].) The existence of a legal duty is a question
of law for the court to decide. (Adams v. City of Fremont (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 243, 265.) “However, the elements of breach of that duty and
causation are ordinarily questions of fact for the jury's determination.” (Vasquez
v. Residential Investments, Inc. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 269, 278.) “One who
undertakes repairs has a duty arising in tort to do them without negligence.” (Southwest Forest Industries, Inc. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp.
(9th Cir. 1970) 422 F.2d 1013, 1020.)
 
The sixth cause of
action is alleged against Defendant South Bay Ford Inc. (“South”). The
Complaint alleges that the Subject Vehicle was delivered to Defendant South for
substantial repair on at least one occasion and that South owed a duty to use
ordinary care and skill in “storage, preparation and repair of the Subject
Vehicle in accordance with industry standards. (Compl. ¶ 73, 74.) Defendant
South breached its duty to use ordinary care and skill by failing to properly
store, prepare and repair the Subject Vehicle in accordance with industry
standards and the breach of a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s damages. (Compl.
¶¶ 75, 76.) 
 
Plaintiff’s
opposition argues that an exception to the economic loss rule does bar recovery
for damage to a defective product such as when a manufacturer’s defective
product, like a window, causes damage other portions of the larger product,
such as a house. (Jimenez v. Superior Court (2002) 29
Cal.4th 473, 483.) “
Multiple district courts have recognized
the potential applicability of the component exception in cases involving
negligent repair claims against parties sought to be joined in breach of
warranty cases against manufacturers” (Velasco v. Ford Motor Company
(S.D. Cal., June 24, 2022, No. 22-CV-366-MMA (DEB)) 2022 WL 2287258, at p. *4.)

 
The court need not decide if the
component exception applies because Plaintiff’s sixth cause of action fails to
allege facts to show Defendant South damaged certain components of the product.
In other words, Plaintiff fails to state what defects or damage to components
of the Subject Vehicle substantially impaired, the safety, use, and/or value of
the subject vehicle such that the component exception to the economic loss rule
should apply. 
 
Therefore, the demurrer to the sixth
cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’
demurrer is overruled as to the fifth cause of action for fraudulent
inducement-concealment and sustained with leave to amend as to the sixth cause
of action for negligent repair. Plaintiffs are given 30 days leave to amend.
