And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Petitioner Svetlana Gennadyeuna Brouke's petition for leave to file a late government claim against the City of Pasadena. The Petitioner was seriously injured in a trip and fall on March 23, 2022, and did not know she could pursue a claim against the City until March 2, 2023. The Petitioner filed her request for late claim with the City on March 8, 2023, which was within the six-month deadline. The Respondent denied the Petitioner's request on April 3, 2023, and the Petitioner filed this petition on October 2, 2023. The court finds that the Petitioner was diligent in seeking counsel and that the failure to present the claim was due to "mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect." The court also finds that the City would not be prejudiced by the late filing of the claim.
