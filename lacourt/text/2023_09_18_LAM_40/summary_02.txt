The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant terminated her employment due to age and disability discrimination, and that the production of the offer letters is necessary to support her claims.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff has made a prima facie showing that the information sought is relevant and that good cause exists for its production.

The Court denies the Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the Defendant, and also denies the Defendant's request for monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff.

The Court orders the Defendant to produce responsive offer letters, without objection and with verification, within 10 days of this ruling.

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Maria Leon's motion to compel further response to Plaintiff's Request for Production of Documents, Set Two, Number 79, and request for monetary sanctions.

On March 24, 2023, Plaintiff requested production of offer letters given to individuals between January 1, 2020 and present. Defendants objected and did not provide a supplemental response. Plaintiff moved to compel further production and sanctions.
