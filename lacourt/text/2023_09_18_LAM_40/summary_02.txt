The judge ruled that Leon's request for offer letters from January 1, 2020, to the present is relevant and needed. However, the judge narrowed the scope to just 18 months (from January 1, 2021) because the company already provided information about all employees hired since January 2020. The request for monetary sanctions from both parties was denied.

The Plaintiff is seeking to compel further production of documents, specifically offer letters given to individuals hired by the Defendant since January 1, 2020.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff has made a prima facie showing that the information sought is relevant and that good cause exists for its production. However, the Court also finds that the production request is overbroad and modifies the scope to 18 months' worth of offer letters, beginning on January 1, 2021.

The Court denies the Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the Defendant, and also denies the Defendant's request for monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff.

The Court orders the Defendant to produce responsive offer letters, without objection and with verification, within 10 days of this ruling.

**English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge is considering Maria Leon's motion to compel Villa Scalabrini to provide further responses to a request for document production, specifically offer letters given to new employees. Leon argues these letters are relevant to proving she was discriminated against and wrongfully terminated. The Judge finds that the "meet and confer" requirement was satisfied by Plaintiff Leon. The Judge tentatively GRANTS the motion IN PART, finding good cause for the production of the documents, but limits the scope of the request. Instead of providing offer letters from January 1, 2020, to the present, Villa Scalabrini must produce offer letters only from January 1, 2021, for an 18-month period. The Judge believes this narrower time frame is sufficient to determine if Leon was replaced and if the stated reason for her termination (financial constraints) was pretextual.  Both Leon's and Villa Scalabrini's requests for monetary sanctions are DENIED. Villa Scalabrini is ordered to produce the documents within 10 days.

Specifically, the Defendant must provide offer letters issued between January 1, 2021, and the present (an 18-month period, shorter than originally requested).  The Judge found the offer letters relevant to determining if the Defendant's stated reason for terminating the Plaintiff (financial constraints) was pretextual, as the letters could show whether someone was hired to replace the Plaintiff.  The Judge denied both parties' requests for monetary sanctions. The Defendant is ordered to produce the documents within 10 days.

**Defendant:** Fathers of St. Charles dba Villa Scalabrini Retirement Center & Special Care Unit (and others)

**Background:**

Maria Leon sued her former employer, Fathers of St. Charles, alleging discrimination and retaliation based on age and disability. She claims she was terminated after requesting reasonable accommodations and exercising her rights under the California Family Rights Act (CFRA).

**Disputed Issue:**

* **Offer letters:** Leon requested all offer letters given to new employees between January 1, 2020, and the present. Fathers of St. Charles objected, claiming overbreadth and privacy concerns.

**Judge's Ruling:**

* **Motion to Compel GRANTED in Part:** The judge ordered Fathers of St. Charles to produce offer letters for the period from January 1, 2021, to the present (an 18-month window) to determine if anyone was hired to replace Leon's specific role after she requested medical leave in January 2021. 
* **Sanctions DENIED:** The judge declined to impose sanctions on either party as the motion had mixed results.

**Rationale:**

* **Relevance:** The judge found the offer letters relevant to Leon's claims of pretextual termination, as they could show if her employer genuinely hired someone to replace her or used financial constraints as a cover.
* **Overbreadth:** The judge narrowed the production request from 3 years to 18 months, finding the 18-month window sufficient to investigate the relevant period.
* **Privacy:** The judge acknowledged privacy concerns but balanced them against the strong state interest in preventing discrimination. The judge also noted that Fathers of St. Charles already provided employee names, ages, and hiring dates, mitigating some privacy concerns.

**Next Steps:**

Fathers of St. Charles must produce the requested offer letters within 10 days.


**English Summary:**

The judge ruled in favor of Maria Leon, ordering her former employer to provide offer letters for a specific period to support her claims of age and disability discrimination. The judge narrowed the request time frame and considered privacy concerns but ultimately prioritized Leon's right to investigate potential discrimination.  No sanctions were imposed on either party.
