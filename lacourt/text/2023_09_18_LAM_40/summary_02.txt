The Plaintiff is seeking to compel further production of documents, specifically offer letters given to individuals hired by the Defendant since January 1, 2020. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant terminated her employment due to age and disability discrimination, and that the production of the offer letters is necessary to support her claims.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff has made a prima facie showing that the information sought is relevant and that good cause exists for its production. However, the Court also finds that the production request is overbroad and modifies the scope to 18 months' worth of offer letters, beginning on January 1, 2021.

The Court denies the Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the Defendant, and also denies the Defendant's request for monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff.

The Court orders the Defendant to produce responsive offer letters, without objection and with verification, within 10 days of this ruling.
