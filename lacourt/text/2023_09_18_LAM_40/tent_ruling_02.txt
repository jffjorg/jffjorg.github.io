Plaintiff Maria
  Leon’s Motion to Compel Further Response to Plaintiff’s Request for
  Production of Documents, Set Two, Number 79, and Request for Monetary
  Sanctions.



 
Background
Pleadings
Plaintiff Maria Leon sues Defendant Fathers of St. Charles dba Villa
Scalabrini Retirement Center & Special Care Unit (allegedly erroneously
sued as Villa Scalabrini, Villa Scalabrini Council, and Villa Scalabrini
(9682); collectively referred to hereafter as Employer Defendants), Ardeshir
Afshar, Rolando Escamilla, Alicia Ávila, and Does 1 to 100.
Her August 9, 2021 Complaint
alleges causes of action of: (1) FEHA Age Discrimination; (2) FEHA Age
Harassment; (3) FEHA Disability Discrimination; (4) FEHA Failure to Provide
Reasonable Accommodation [re Disability]; (5) FEHA Failure to Engage in the Interactive
Process [re Disability]; (6) FEHA Failure to Prevent Discrimination and
Retaliation; (7) FEHA Retaliation; (8) Violation of California Family Rights
Act [CFRA]; (9) CFRA Retaliation; (10) Wrongful Termination in Violation of
Public Policy; and (11) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
These claims arise from allegations
that Plaintiff Leon—who was born in 1947—was employed by Employer Defendants as
a Food Service Employee between March 31, 1995 and August 6, 2020, during which
time, she was discriminated against and harassed based on her age and her
actual or perceived disabilities, terminated from her employment due to her
age, disabilities and/or perceived disabilities (injured shoulder and left
wrist), due to her requests for reasonable accommodations, exercise of rights
under the California Family Rights Act (CFRA), and need for leave under the
CFRA and/or taking and/or requesting medical leave, and for opposing practices
prohibited by the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) (e.g., reporting
discrimination and harassment she experienced to management).
Motion Before Court
On March 24, 2023, Plaintiff
propounded Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two (RPDs, Set Two), on
Fathers of St. Charles. Included in this request was Request No. 79, which
reads:
“Please produce all offer letters
given to any individual by DEFENDANT, limited to the time period of January 1,
2020-present.”
On May 12, 2023, after various
extensions, Fathers of St. Charles responded to Plaintiff’s discovery, offering
only objections to RPDs, Set Two, No. 79.
Between June 13, 2023 and July 14,
2023, the parties met and conferred regarding supplemental responses to, among
other things, RPDs, Set Two. During this time, on June 15, 2023, the parties
agreed to extend Plaintiff’s time to move to compel further production to July
28, 2023.
On July 24, 2023, Fathers of St.
Charles served some supplemental responses to discovery, but did not provide a
supplemental response to RPDs, Set Two, No. 79.
On July 28, 2023, Plaintiff moved
to compel a further response and production related to RPDs, Set Two, No. 79.
On September 5, 2023, Fathers of
St. Charles opposed the motion.
On September 11, 2023, Plaintiff
replied to the opposition.
Plaintiff Leon’s motion is now
before the Court.
 
Motion to Compel Further Production

Meet and Confer
A motion to compel further
production must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)
A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing
a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)
The Court initially notes that it
finds that the meet and confer requirement was satisfied by Plaintiff Leon.
Though the parties did not reach an agreement resolving disputes related to
RPDs, Set Two, No. 79, and while the parties disagree as to the merits of the
production request, that does not mean that the meet and confer efforts were
not sufficient. (Mot., Rodriguez Decl., ¶¶ 16-27, Exs. 5-9; Opp’n, Craven
Decl., ¶¶ 8-14, Exs. A-D.)
Legal Standard
A motion to compel a further
response is used when a party gives unsatisfactory answers or makes untenable
objections to interrogatories, demands to produce, or requests for admission.
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) To
request further production, a movant must establish: (1) good cause for the
production (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1); Sinaiko, supra,
at p. 403); and (2) that a further response is needed because (a) the
responding party’s statement of compliance with the demand to produce is
incomplete Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b) the responding
party’s representation that it is unable to comply is inadequate, complete, or
evasive (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2)), (c) the responding party’s
objection in the response is without merit or is too general (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court
(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or (d) if the responding party objected to
the production of ESI on the ground that it is not reasonably accessible the
movant can show that the (i) ESI is reasonably accessible or (ii) there is good
cause for production of the ESI regardless of its accessibility (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (e)).
Order Compelling Further
Production: GRANTED, in Part.
After review, the Court first finds
that the information sought by Plaintiff is relevant and that good cause is
shown for its production. Specifically, the information is relevant to
determining whether Fathers of St. Charles in fact hired someone to take over
the specific job duties performed by Plaintiff Leon during her employment with
Fathers of St. Charles. While Fathers of St. Charles has produced “information
regarding all employees hired since January 1, 2020, including their names,
ages, dates of hire, and dates of termination, if applicable,” as well as the
“last known contact information for all former employees” (Opp’n, Craven Decl.,
¶¶ 7-8, 13, Exs. A, C, D), such information does not describe whether the
individuals that were hired took over the kinds of tasks performed by Plaintiff
Leon. If Fathers of St. Charles did not hire anyone, or delayed much beyond
January 1, 2021, to hire someone to replace Plaintiff Leon’s specific role,
then the evidence could lend to a finding that her termination was based on
discrimination. Moreover, such evidence could show that the reason advanced by
Fathers of St. Charles for Plaintiff’s termination—financial constraints in
keeping Plaintiff employed—are pretextual because if Fathers of St. Charles did
not use its freed-up resources to hire a replacement for Plaintiff Leon’s
specific role and tasks, then its reason for termination is undercut.
The Court however finds that the
production request is overbroad. It is unclear why Plaintiff needs more than 30
months’ worth of offer letters to determine whether, after she was set to
return to work following her final request for medical leave (January 2021,
with termination in August 2020), Fathers of St. Charles hired individuals to
perform her job duties. Fathers of St. Charles represents that it hired Maria
Ochoa to replace Plaintiff Leon. (Mot., Rodriguez Decl., Ex. A, p. 9,
Interrogatory Nos. 201.5, 201.6.) (This hiring appears to have taken place on
September 13, 2021 given that Fathers of St. Charles’s discovery shows that the
only “Maria” hired for a “dietary” server role after January 1, 2023 was hired
on September 13, 2021. (Opp’n, Craven Decl., Ex. A, p. VS 001261.)) As a
result, the Court finds that an 18-month window is more appropriate, beginning
on January 1, 2021, for evidence that would tend to undercut the reason given
by Fathers of St. Charles for her termination.
The Court also finds that the
production request is not vague or ambiguous. The request is quite clear as to
the information it seeks: offer letters given to individuals between January 1,
2020 and the present. (Mot., Separate Statement, p. 3.)
To the extent that confidentiality
and privacy rights are raised against this production, the Court finds that the
needs of discovery—particularly the authority cited in support by Plaintiff, Department
of Fair Employment and Housing v. Superior Court (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 896,
905, which was not rebutted in the opposition—shows a compelling need for the
offer letters. If the offers letters show that no person was hired to replace
Plaintiff Leon’s specific role for an extended period of time after January 1,
2021, then that evidence supports a finding that her termination was not based
on financial constraints, thus lending support to discrimination and pretextual
termination, and overriding any privacy interest in the offer letters. (Ibid.
[“[T]he state has a compelling interest in prohibiting racial or ethnic
discrimination. …. Th[is] compelling state interest[] outweigh[s] the intrusion
on the privacy of third party tenants and applicants that might result from
disclosure of rental records. Petitioner has no other means of obtaining the
requested records because the only known records are solely within the custody
and control of Keller and Mattox.”].)
To the extent that production of
the offer letters shows identifying information that connotes a right to
privacy, the Court notes that Fathers of St. Charles has already provided
“information regarding all employees hired since January 1, 2020, including
their names, ages, dates of hire, and dates of termination, if applicable,” as
well as the “last known contact information for all former employees.” (Opp’n,
Craven Decl., ¶¶ 7-8, 13, Exs. A, C, D.) Any such concern is therefore abated.
Plaintiff Leon’s motion is
therefore GRANTED, in Part, subject only to a modification in scope: 18 months’
worth of offer letters.
Sanctions: DENIED.
Except in certain circumstances
involving electronic stored information, the court must impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(h).)
The Court declines to issue the
sanctions sought by both parties because, based on the mixed results of the
motion, sanctions are not merited. (Mot., p. 9; Opp’n, p. 9.)
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff Maria Leon’s Motion to
Compel Further Response to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set
Two, Number 79, is GRANTED, in Part, with one modification to the request: a
reduced time window of 18 months from January 1, 2021.
Defendant Fathers of St. Charles is
ORDERED to produce responsive offer letters, without objection and with
verification, within 10 days of this ruling.
Plaintiff Maria Leon’s Request for
Monetary Sanctions is DENIED.
Defendant Fathers of St. Charles’s Request
for Monetary Sanctions is also DENIED.
