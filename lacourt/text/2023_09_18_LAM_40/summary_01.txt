And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the demurrer filed by Defendant Pacific Urban Investors (Pacific) to the Complaint filed by Plaintiffs Marisela Vasquez, Anthony Ixta, Anabelle Ixta, Luna Vasquez, and Manuel Vasquez. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the Complaint's first cause of action, alleging battery, and the Complaint's sixth cause of action, alleging violation of Civil Code section 1942.4.

The Court finds that the Complaint does not allege the requisite intent for the purposes of a battery claim. The allegations of inaction by Defendants do not amount to intent to harm or offend the Plaintiffs. The Court sustains the demurrer as to the Complaint's first cause of action, With Leave to Amend.

The Court also finds that the Complaint fails to allege the public officer or employee requirement of Civil Code section 1942.4. The Court grants the motion to strike claims for statutory damages, costs, and attorneys' fees related to the Complaint's sixth cause of action, With Leave to Amend.

Plaintiffs are provided 14 days' leave to amend the pleadings.
