* The motion to strike claims for statutory damages, costs, and attorneys' fees related to the Complaint's sixth cause of action, alleging a violation of Civil Code section 1942.4, is granted with leave to amend.

english_summary: |
  The Judge is tentatively ruling on Pacific Urban Investors' demurrer and motion to strike portions of the complaint filed by Marisela Vasquez and her children. The lawsuit stems from a bed bug infestation at the Haven Warner Center where the Vasquez family resided.

  The Judge is sustaining the demurrer to the first cause of action (Battery) because the complaint doesn't adequately allege the intent to harm or offend necessary for a battery claim. The Judge finds that simply claiming "inaction" by the defendants is not enough to establish intent. While a bed bug bite *could* be the basis for a battery claim, the complaint needs to show that the *defendants' conduct* caused the bites with the intent to harm or offend.  The demurrer to the sixth cause of action (Violation of Civil Code § 1942.4) is also sustained because the complaint fails to allege that a public officer or employee responsible for housing law enforcement notified the defendants in writing about the need to abate the nuisance, a requirement of the statute.

  The motion to strike claims for statutory damages, costs, and attorney's fees related to the sixth cause of action is granted, with leave to amend, because the demurrer to that cause of action was sustained.

  The plaintiffs are given 14 days to amend their complaint.

  - "The essential elements of a cause of action for battery are: (1) defendant touched plaintiff, or caused plaintiff to be touched, with the intent to harm or offend plaintiff; (2) plaintiff did not consent to the touching; (3) plaintiff was harmed or offended by defendant’s conduct; and (4) a reasonable person in plaintiff’s position would have been offended by the touching."
  - "The Complaint does not allege the requisite “intent to harm or offend” necessary for battery."
  -  "A landlord of a dwelling may not demand rent...if all of the following conditions exist..." (Regarding Civil Code 1942.4)
  - "Plaintiffs...are provided 14 days’ leave to amend the pleadings."

```

Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The judge *sustained* (agreed with) the defendant's (Pacific Urban Investors) arguments regarding both the battery claim (first cause of action) and the violation of Civil Code 1942.4 claim (sixth cause of action).  The judge found that the complaint did *not* sufficiently allege the necessary *intent* for a battery claim, merely alleging inaction rather than a deliberate act to cause harm.  The judge also found that the complaint failed to allege that a *public officer* had notified the landlord of the need to abate the nuisance, a requirement of Civil Code 1942.4.

Because the demurrer to the sixth cause of action was sustained, the judge also *granted* the defendant's motion to *strike* the related allegations and requests for statutory damages and attorney's fees.

Crucially, the judge granted the plaintiffs *leave to amend* their complaint.  This means the plaintiffs have 14 days to file a revised complaint that attempts to correct the deficiencies identified by the judge. They can try to add more specific facts to show intent for the battery claim and to meet the requirements of Civil Code 1942.4. The case is not dismissed, but the plaintiffs must revise their claims to proceed.

## Tentative Ruling Summary

**Case:** 21STCV20276

**Plaintiffs:** Marisela Vasquez, Anthony Ixta, Anabelle Ixta, Luna Vasquez, Manuel Vasquez

**Defendant:** Pacific Urban Investors (formerly sued as Haven Warner Center)

**Issue:** Demurrer and Motion to Strike

**Background:** 

The Vasquez family sues Pacific Urban Investors, alleging battery, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, breach of implied warranty of habitability, breach of quiet enjoyment, violation of Civil Code § 1942.4, public nuisance, and breach of contract stemming from a bed bug infestation during their tenancy at 6530 Independence Ave, Canoga Park, CA. 

**Key Points:**

* The Court **sustained** Pacific's demurrer to the **first** cause of action (battery) and the **sixth** cause of action (violation of Civil Code § 1942.4) **with leave to amend**.
* The Court **granted** Pacific's motion to strike claims for damages, costs, and attorneys' fees related to the sixth cause of action **with leave to amend**.

**Demurrer - First Cause of Action (Battery):**

* The plaintiffs alleged battery based on bed bug bites during their tenancy, arguing Pacific's inaction constituted intent.
* **Court Ruling:**  The Court found the plaintiffs failed to sufficiently allege Pacific's intent to cause harm through bed bugs, stating that inaction alone doesn't equal intent for battery.
* **Leave to Amend:** Plaintiffs have 14 days to amend the complaint to allege a stronger claim for battery.

**Demurrer - Sixth Cause of Action (Civil Code § 1942.4):**

* The plaintiffs alleged violation of Civil Code § 1942.4, which prohibits landlords from demanding rent when a dwelling is uninhabitable due to violations and a public official has notified the landlord.
* **Court Ruling:** The plaintiffs failed to allege a public official notified Pacific of the bed bug problem, a requirement for this cause of action.

**Motion to Strike - Attorneys' Fees:**

* Pacific moved to strike claims for attorneys' fees related to the sixth cause of action.
* **Court Ruling:** The Court granted the motion as the sixth cause of action was dismissed.


**Conclusion:**
* The Court gave the plaintiffs 14 days to amend their complaint addressing the Court's rulings on the demurrer and motion to strike.
