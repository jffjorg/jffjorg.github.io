##  Tentative Ruling Summary: Stibbe v. State of California 

**Case Number:** 22STLC05484
**Hearing Date:** September 18, 2023

**Summary:**

The court has **sustained the State of California's demurrer** to Plaintiff Matthew Stibbe's Third Amended Complaint, without leave to amend.  

**Key Points:**

* **Plaintiff's Claim:** Stibbe alleges the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) recklessly disregarded its own published procedures (Publication 985) during an audit, causing him harm.
* **Statute of Limitations:** Stibbe's cause of action is barred by the two-year statute of limitations under the Government Claims Act. The court finds that Stibbe knew or should have known about the FTB's alleged misconduct as early as August 2018, when the FTB debited his bank accounts. The lawsuit was filed in August 2022. 
* **Estoppel Argument Fails:** Stibbe's argument that the FTB's actions should prevent the statute of limitations from applying (estoppel) is rejected. The court finds Stibbe was aware of the relevant facts and the FTB did not intend for him to rely on their actions to his detriment.
* **Government Claims Act Compliance:** The court also found that Stibbe failed to properly comply with the Government Claims Act, which requires a formal claim to be filed before a lawsuit can be brought.

**Outcome:**

Stibbe's case is dismissed because the statute of limitations has expired and he failed to properly comply with the Government Claims Act.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the State of California's demurrer to the plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint, without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Matthew Stibbe, alleges that the Franchise Tax Board (FTB) recklessly disregarded published procedures during an audit, causing him harm and resulting in debits to his Wells Fargo Bank account(s). The FTB demurred to the complaint, arguing that it was barred by the statute of limitations, and the court has agreed.

The court found that the plaintiff's claim accrued at least as early as August 13, 2018, when he became aware of the audit, and that the two-year statute of limitations had expired by the time the complaint was filed in August 2022. The court also found that the plaintiff's Protest Letter, which was sent to the FTB in July 2020, failed to comply with the Government Claims Act.

The court rejected the plaintiff's argument that estoppel should apply, finding that the FTB did not intend to deceive the plaintiff and that the plaintiff was aware of the true facts relating to the FTB's failure to follow procedures.

As a result, the court has sustained the demurrer and dismissed the complaint, making it impossible for the plaintiff to amend the complaint to cure the defects identified by the court.

English text:
The tentative ruling is that the California Franchise Tax Board’s demurrer to plaintiff’s third amended complaint is sustained, without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Matthew Stibbe, brought a lawsuit against the defendant, the State of California, alleging that the Franchise Tax Board (FTB) recklessly disregarded published procedures in informing him that he was under audit. The plaintiff seeks equitable relief, actual and direct damages, and reasonable litigation costs. However, the court finds that the plaintiff’s claim is barred by the statute of limitations and cannot be cured based on the pleadings and the pleadings’ attachments before the court. The plaintiff first became aware of being under audit as early as August 13, 2018, and discovered his injuries as of that date. Therefore, the lawsuit should have been filed within two years of that date, but it was not. The court also finds that estoppel does not save the claim. Additionally, the plaintiff’s protest letter fails to comply with the Government Code Section 910 in multiple ways.
