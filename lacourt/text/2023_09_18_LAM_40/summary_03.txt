##  Tentative Ruling Summary: Stibbe v. State of California 

**Case Number:** 22STLC05484
**Hearing Date:** September 18, 2023

**Summary:**

The court has **sustained the State of California's demurrer** to Plaintiff Matthew Stibbe's Third Amended Complaint, without leave to amend.  

**Key Points:**

* **Plaintiff's Claim:** Stibbe alleges the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) recklessly disregarded its own published procedures (Publication 985) during an audit, causing him harm.
* **Statute of Limitations:** Stibbe's cause of action is barred by the two-year statute of limitations under the Government Claims Act. The court finds that Stibbe knew or should have known about the FTB's alleged misconduct as early as August 2018, when the FTB debited his bank accounts. The lawsuit was filed in August 2022. 
* **Estoppel Argument Fails:** Stibbe's argument that the FTB's actions should prevent the statute of limitations from applying (estoppel) is rejected. The court finds Stibbe was aware of the relevant facts and the FTB did not intend for him to rely on their actions to his detriment.
* **Government Claims Act Compliance:** The court also found that Stibbe failed to properly comply with the Government Claims Act, which requires a formal claim to be filed before a lawsuit can be brought.

**Outcome:**

Stibbe's case is dismissed because the statute of limitations has expired and he failed to properly comply with the Government Claims Act.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the State of California's demurrer to the plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint, without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Matthew Stibbe, alleges that the Franchise Tax Board (FTB) recklessly disregarded published procedures during an audit, causing him harm and resulting in debits to his Wells Fargo Bank account(s). The FTB demurred to the complaint, arguing that it was barred by the statute of limitations, and the court has agreed.

The court found that the plaintiff's claim accrued at least as early as August 13, 2018, when he became aware of the audit, and that the two-year statute of limitations had expired by the time the complaint was filed in August 2022. The court also found that the plaintiff's Protest Letter, which was sent to the FTB in July 2020, failed to comply with the Government Claims Act.

The court rejected the plaintiff's argument that estoppel should apply, finding that the FTB did not intend to deceive the plaintiff and that the plaintiff was aware of the true facts relating to the FTB's failure to follow procedures.

As a result, the court has sustained the demurrer and dismissed the complaint, making it impossible for the plaintiff to amend the complaint to cure the defects identified by the court.

English text:
The tentative ruling is that the California Franchise Tax Board’s demurrer to plaintiff’s third amended complaint is sustained, without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Matthew Stibbe, brought a lawsuit against the defendant, the State of California, alleging that the Franchise Tax Board (FTB) recklessly disregarded published procedures in informing him that he was under audit. The plaintiff seeks equitable relief, actual and direct damages, and reasonable litigation costs. However, the court finds that the plaintiff’s claim is barred by the statute of limitations and cannot be cured based on the pleadings and the pleadings’ attachments before the court. The plaintiff first became aware of being under audit as early as August 13, 2018, and discovered his injuries as of that date. Therefore, the lawsuit should have been filed within two years of that date, but it was not. The court also finds that estoppel does not save the claim. Additionally, the plaintiff’s protest letter fails to comply with the Government Code Section 910 in multiple ways.

```

**English Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge is inclined to sustain the State of California's demurrer to Matthew Stibbe's Third Amended Complaint (TAC) without leave to amend.  Stibbe's claim of reckless disregard of published procedures by the Franchise Tax Board (FTB) is likely barred by the statute of limitations. The Judge believes Stibbe was aware of potential harm (FTB's actions, account debits) as early as August 2018, but did not file the lawsuit until August 2022, exceeding the two-year limit. The Judge finds the estoppel argument unpersuasive as Stibbe was aware of the facts relating to the FTB failing to follow its procedures.  The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff has not alleged satisfactory compliance with Section 910 of the Government Code. Because the statute of limitations issue is clear, the Judge does not believe the complaint can be amended to overcome this defect.

English-text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to **SUSTAIN** the State of California's demurrer *without leave to amend*.  This means the Judge is inclined to dismiss Matthew Stibbe's case against the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) and will *not* allow Stibbe to revise and resubmit his complaint.

The Judge's reasoning is based on two main points:

1.  **Statute of Limitations:** Stibbe's claim alleges that the FTB recklessly disregarded published procedures during an audit. The Judge determined that Stibbe was aware of the potential harm and the FTB's alleged failure to follow procedures as early as August 2018, when his bank account was first debited and when he contacted the FTB.  The lawsuit, however, was not filed until August 2022.  California law requires such lawsuits to be filed within two years of the "accrual" of the cause of action (when the harm was discovered).  Because more than two years passed, the lawsuit is time-barred. The judge also found that the doctrine of estoppel does not apply.

2.  **Non-Compliance with Government Claims Act:**  Stibbe did not properly file a claim with the government before filing the lawsuit, as required by the Government Claims Act. The Protest Letter sent by Stibbe did not meet the Act's requirements (wrong form, wrong recipient, insufficient information).

Because the lawsuit was filed too late and proper pre-litigation procedures weren't followed, the Judge believes the case should be dismissed, and the defects cannot be fixed by simply revising the complaint.

##  Tentative Ruling Summary: Stibbe v. State of California 

**Case Number:** 22STLC05484
**Hearing Date:** September 18, 2023
**Dept:** 40, Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Matthew Stibbe
* **Defendant:** State of California (specifically, the California Franchise Tax Board)

**Summary:**

Judge sustains the California Franchise Tax Board's demurrer to Plaintiff Matthew Stibbe's Third Amended Complaint without leave to amend. The Court finds that Stibbe's claim for reckless disregard of published procedures under Revenue and Taxation Code section 21021 is barred by the statute of limitations.

**Key Points:**

* **Claim:** Stibbe alleges that the FTB repeatedly informed him he was under audit while failing to follow the procedures outlined in their Publication 985. He seeks damages and equitable relief.
* **Statute of Limitations:** The Government Code requires lawsuits against state entities to be filed within two years of the cause of action accruing.
* **Accrual Date:** The Court finds Stibbe's cause of action accrued at least as early as August 13, 2018, when he was informed he owed money and allegedly discovered the FTB's failure to follow procedures. The lawsuit was filed in August 2022.
* **Estoppel:** Stibbe's argument that estoppel applies fails because he cannot demonstrate that the FTB intended for him to rely on their audit communications to his detriment.
* **Government Claims Act:** Stibbe also failed to adequately comply with the Government Claims Act requirements for filing a claim before commencing litigation.

**Outcome:** The Court sustains the demurrer, meaning Stibbe's lawsuit is dismissed. He cannot amend his complaint because the Court finds the statute of limitations issue cannot be cured.

**Tentative Ruling Summary in Markdown Format**

**Case Number:** 22STLC05484
**Hearing Date:** September 18, 2023
**Plaintiff:** Matthew Stibbe
**Defendant:** State of California
**Background:** Plaintiff Matthew Stibbe sues the State of California, alleging a single claim of Reckless Disregard of Published Procedures under California Revenue and Taxation Code § 21021. The claim arises from allegations that the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) failed to follow procedures during an audit, causing Plaintiff to incur bank fees and other damages.

**Demurrer:** The State of California demurred to the Third Amended Complaint, claiming that the claim is barred by the statute of limitations.

**Tentative Ruling:** The Court sustains the State's demurrer, without leave to amend, due to the expiration of the statutory deadline to file the lawsuit.

**Key Points:**

* The statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit against the State of California is two years from the accrual of the cause of action (Gov. Code, § 945.6, subd. (a)(2)).
* Plaintiff alleges that the FTB debited his Wells Fargo Bank account(s) on May 18, 2015, and August 2, 2018, and failed to follow procedures during an audit.
* The Court finds that the claim is barred by the statute of limitations, as Plaintiff did not file the lawsuit until August 2022, more than two years after the alleged harm occurred.
* The Court also finds that estoppel does not apply, as Plaintiff was aware of the FTB's alleged failure to follow procedures and did not rely on the FTB's representations to his injury.
* The Court notes that Plaintiff's Protest Letter, which was sent to the FTB, fails to comply with the Government Claims Act (Gov. Code, § 910 et seq.).

**Significant Statements:**

* "A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action." (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747)
* "To survive a [general] demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff's proof need not be alleged." (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872)
* "The proper remedy is to ascertain the factual basis of the contention through discovery and, if necessary, file a motion for summary judgment …" (Roman v. County of Los Angeles (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 316, 325)

### English Summary
The judge's tentative ruling in the case of Matthew Stibbe vs. State of California is to sustain the State of California's demurrer to the Third Amended Complaint without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Matthew Stibbe, alleges that the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) recklessly disregarded published procedures in handling his audit, resulting in damages. However, the court finds that the claim is barred by the statute of limitations, which started to run in August 2018 when the plaintiff became aware of the alleged wrongdoing. The plaintiff's argument that he did not discover the FTB's failure to follow procedures until later is not persuasive, as the complaint alleges that the FTB failed to follow procedures starting in August 2018. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not alleged satisfactory compliance with the Government Claims Act, which requires that a claim be presented to the proper authority in a timely manner. Therefore, the court sustains the demurrer, and the plaintiff's claim is dismissed.
