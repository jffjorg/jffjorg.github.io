Order
  RE:
 
defendants’ motion to compel arbitration
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:
            Defendants Church of
Scientology International, Bridge Publications, Inc., and Religious Technology
Center (joined by defendant Gavin Potter on September 21, 2023)
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Jane Doe
Motion to Compel Arbitration
Defendants Church of Scientology International, Bridge Publications, Inc.,
and Religious Technology Center, joined by defendant Gavin Potter
(collectively, “Defendants”) filed the pending motion to compel arbitration on September
18, 2023, moving the court for an order compelling plaintiff Jane Doe (“Plaintiff”)
to submit all the claims alleged in her Second Amended Complaint to binding
arbitration. 
The court notes several issues with the papers filed by the parties. 
First, Plaintiff’s opposition brief does not comply with California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1113.  “Except in
a summary judgment or summary adjudication motion, no opening or responding
memorandum may exceed 15 pages.”  (Cal.
Rules of Ct., rule 3.1113, subd. (d).) 
Plaintiff’s memorandum of points and authorities in opposition to
Defendants’ motion is nearly 20 pages in length and therefore violates rule
3.1113.  (Opp., pp. 7-26; Cal. Rules of
Ct., rule 3.113, subd. (d).) 
Second, the “Application to File Certain Exhibits and Declaration
Paragraphs Under Seal,” filed with the court on February 8, 2024 by defendants
Church of Scientology International, Bridge Publications, Inc., and Religious
Technology Center does not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 2.551.
“A party requesting that a record be filed under seal must file a
motion or an application for an order sealing the record.  The motion or application must be accompanied
by a memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify the
sealing.”  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule
2.551, subd. (b)(1).)  Further, “[t]he
party requesting that a record be filed under seal must lodge it with the court
under (d) when the motion or application is made, unless good cause exists for
not lodging it or the record has previously been lodged . . . .”  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 2.551, subd.
(b)(4).) 
Defendants Church of Scientology International, Bridge Publications,
Inc., and Religious Technology Center’s application (1) is not accompanied by a
memorandum and a declaration containing facts to justify the sealing, and (2)
does not state that the records to be sealed have been lodged with the court.  The application therefore does not comply
with rule 2.551.  
The court therefore exercises its discretion to continue the hearing
on Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration in order (1) to give Plaintiff an
opportunity to file an amended opposition memorandum that complies with
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, and (2) to give Defendants an
opportunity to file a revised application to seal that complies with California
Rules of Court, rules 2.550-2.551.
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
defendants Church of Scientology International, Bridge Publications, Inc., and
Religious Technology Center (and joined by defendant Gavin Potter)’s motion to
compel arbitration is continued from February 16, 2024 to March 26, 2024, at
10:00 a.m. 
            The court orders plaintiff Jane Doe
to file an amended memorandum of points and authorities in opposition to the
motion to compel arbitration (that does not exceed 15 pages) no later than
March 7, 2024. 
            The court orders that defendants
Church of Scientology International, Bridge Publications, Inc., Religious
Technology Center, and Gavin Potter may file amended memoranda of points and
authorities in support of their reply to the motion to compel arbitration no
later than March 15, 2024. 
            The parties may not file additional
evidence in connection with the motion to compel arbitration.  
            The court sets defendants Church of
Scientology International, Bridge Publications, Inc., and Religious Technology
Center’s application to seal for hearing on March 26, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in
Department 53. 
            The court orders defendants Church
of Scientology International, Bridge Publications, Inc., and Religious
Technology Center to file an amended application to seal no later than February
28, 2024.
            The court orders that the Case
Management Conference is continued from February 16, 2024 to March 26, 2024, at
10:00 a.m. 
The court orders defendants Church of Scientology International,
Bridge Publications, Inc., and Religious Technology Center to give notice of
this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
