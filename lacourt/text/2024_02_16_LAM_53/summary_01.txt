And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling sets forth the schedule for a hearing on the defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The motion was filed by the Church of Scientology International, Bridge Publications, Inc., and Religious Technology Center, and joined by Gavin Potter on September 21, 2023. The Judge notes that the plaintiff's opposition brief exceeds the 15-page limit set by California Rules of Court, and that the defendants' application to file certain exhibits and declaration paragraphs under seal does not comply with California Rules of Court. As a result, the Judge continues the hearing from February 16, 2024 to March 26, 2024, and orders the parties to file amended briefs and memoranda. The Judge also sets the defendants' application to seal for hearing on March 26, 2024, and orders the parties to give notice of the ruling.
