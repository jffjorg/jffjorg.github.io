And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has deemed the defendant's motions to compel further responses to discovery as moot. The plaintiff had served responses to the discovery requests on April 18, 2023, and the defendant had filed their motions on June 2, 2023. The plaintiff then served further responses on September 29, 2023 or October 2, 2023, which rendered the original motions unnecessary. The judge has imposed sanctions of $1,360 per motion, totaling $4,080, on the plaintiff and his attorneys for failing to serve the initial responses in a timely manner. The sanctions are to be paid within 30 days.
