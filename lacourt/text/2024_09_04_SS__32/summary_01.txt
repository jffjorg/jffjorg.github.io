Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Defendant Steven Blum's motion for summary judgment. The judge found that Defendant has not produced admissible evidence sufficient to meet his initial burden. The judge also found that Defendant's new declaration, submitted in reply, was conclusory and lacked authentication. The judge notes that the elements of a cause of action for negligence are: (1) a duty on the part of the defendant toward the plaintiff; (2) the defendant's breach of that duty; and (3) harm to the plaintiff caused by that breach. The judge concludes that the evidence presented by Defendant is insufficient to establish that he is not liable for the accident. The judge orders Defendant to give notice of this ruling and file a proof of service of such.
