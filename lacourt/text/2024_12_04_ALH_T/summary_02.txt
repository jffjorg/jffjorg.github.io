And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is a continuation of the case Cavanaugh Thompson v. City of Pasadena regarding a motion to compel compliance with a previous court order. The defendant, City of Pasadena, filed a motion to compel the plaintiff, Cavanaugh Thompson, to produce documents responsive to the defendant's discovery requests. The plaintiff had previously served two unverified responses and objections to the defendant's discovery requests, but failed to produce any documents. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's responses failed to comply with the Civil Discovery Act and that the plaintiff had failed to provide responsive documents as indicated in his responses.

The court found that the parties had failed to make good faith efforts to resolve the dispute and that the plaintiff's responses failed to state whether he had documents in his possession that were responsive and not subject to Pitchess protections. The court ordered the parties to provide a joint status report addressing whether the plaintiff produced supplemental responsive documents and a verification, and whether the plaintiff has documents, some which are protected by Pitchess and some that are not. The court also suggested that the parties enter into an appropriate stipulated protective order to effectuate the production of the plaintiff's personnel file without the need for unnecessary motion practice.

The hearing on this motion is continued to December 20, 2024 at 10:00 a.m., and counsel for both parties are ordered to attend the hearing in person.
