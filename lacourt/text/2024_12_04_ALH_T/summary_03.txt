And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Oscar Herrera Perez, et al. v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The case is a lemon law case regarding the purchase of a 2022 Honda Odyssey. The plaintiffs allege that the car had serious defects and nonconformities with its electrical system and that the defendant failed to repair the car to conformity with its warranties. The plaintiffs filed a motion to compel the defendant to produce a witness for a deposition, which the defendant opposed.

The judge granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel deposition, but denied their motion for sanctions. The judge found that the defendant actively engaged in meet and confer efforts to schedule a date for the deposition and that the parties' inability to arrive at an agreeable date justified the court's intervention. The judge ordered that the deposition of the defendant's person most qualified be completed by the end of March 2025.

The judge also found that the defendant's objections to the deposition notice were partially sustained, and that the parties should further meet and confer to reach an agreement on the permissible scope of discovery on certain issues. The judge rejected the plaintiffs' characterization of the defendant's conduct as "bad faith" and found that the defendant did not act in bad faith in its meet and confer efforts.
