And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Omead Lavassani's motion to strike certain paragraphs from Plaintiff Zenya Dennis's complaint. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff failed to properly allege recovery of punitive damages against him, and that the Plaintiff's allegations are conclusory and insufficiently specific to support the request. The Judge agrees, citing Civil Code §3294 and Noonan v. Rousselot, and finds that the Plaintiff's allegations do not meet the requirements for punitive damages. The Judge grants the Defendant's motion to strike, but does not grant leave to amend.
