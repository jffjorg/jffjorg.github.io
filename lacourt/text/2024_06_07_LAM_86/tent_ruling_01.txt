[TENTATIVE] RULING ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
 
Dept. 86 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



Petitioner
Latina Marie Young filed a petition for writ of mandate, wherein she challenges
the decision of respondent California Victim Compensation Board (“CalVCB” or
“Board”) to deny her compensation for relocation expenses after she purportedly
had been a victim of rape, battery, and criminal threats. 
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.          
Petitioner
Submits an Application for Victim Compensation on April 6, 2022 Based on
Multiple Crimes
 
On
April 6, 2022, Petitioner filed application no. A22-8808115 (“Application”)
with the CalVCB for emergency compensation. (AR 915-21.) Petitioner further
provided records in support of her Application. (AR 922-77.) The same day, the
CalVCB acknowledged its receipt of the Application. (AR 982.) On April 8, 2022,
the CalVCB denied immediate payment or reimbursement. (AR 1010.) The same day,
the CalVCB further requested additional information from petitioner, crime
reports from law enforcement, and income related information from other
government agencies. (AR 835, 853, 860-63, 912-13, 986-1005.)
 
1.           
Alleged
Crimes
 
In
the Application, petitioner claimed that, between October 6, 2020 and November
1, 2021, she was the victim of, among other things: (1) numerous rapes; (2)
battery; and (3) criminal threats while she was a resident at the group home
referred to as Janet’s Island House, located at 11810 Radio Dr., Los Angeles,
California 90810. (AR 915-21, 948.) Los Angeles Police Department (“LAPD”)
crime reports provided the following:
 
a.           
June
12, 2021 Report of Sexual Assault
 
On
June 12, 2021, petitioner filed a report with LAPD. (AR 870-75.) Petitioner reported
that, on the night of June 10, 2021 between the hours of 9:35 p.m. and June 21,
2021 at 7:00 a.m., “she was ‘raped in her sleep’…[S]he did not see, feel or
hear anyone performing sexual acts on her while she slept, but believed she was
raped based on a conversation amongst her roommates that she overheard from a
separate room in the house.” (AR 871.) Petitioner stated that she overheard her
roommates say: “She was asleep the whole time, do you know what happened to
her? Someone came in while she was asleep.” (AR 871.) Petitioner did not report
any vaginal pain, but requested a SART[1]
exam, pregnancy test, and VD/STI/STD screening. (AR 871, 873.) Officers
transported petitioner for treatment at L.A. County / U.S.C. Medical Center
RTC/VIP for further treatment. (AR 873.) Petitioner did not provide a medical report
or other medical summary concerning the outcome of the treatment as part of her
initial Application. (AR 915-77.)
 
b.           
August
3, 2021 Report of Battery
 
On
August 3, 2021, petitioner filed a report with the LAPD in which she alleged
that, on July 10, 2021, her housemate Delia Duplessis used a water hose to
spray her with water multiple times at Janet’s Island House. (AR 855-59, 969.) Petitioner
further stated to officers that she had two prior incidents with Duplessis. (AR
857.) Specifically, petitioner states that, on May 11, 2021, Duplessis became
verbally aggressive with petitioner and grabbed petitioner’s arm tightly as she
continued to yell. (AR 857.) Further, on July 5, 2021, petitioner states
Duplessis sprayed her with water from a hose. (AR 857.) The report did not
identify any medical treatment or injury. (AR 857.) Accordingly, LAPD
characterized the interaction as assault/battery for the unlawful use of force
or violence against another. (AR 859.) 
 
On
September 15, 2021, via email to LAPD, petitioner expressed interest in moving
forward with prosecution of the case. (AR 970.) In the same email, petitioner
further complains of severe back pain arising out of the “attacks.” (AR 974.)
  
c.           
October
11, 2021 Report of Assault
 
On
October 11, 2021, petitioner filed a report with the LAPD alleging that, on
that same day, a white male with facial scars verbally harassed her and then
spat on her before fleeing the scene. (AR 837-41.) The LAPD canvassed the areas
with negative results. (AR 839.) The report did not identify any medical
treatment or injury. (AR 839.) Accordingly, LAPD characterized the interaction
as an assault, without weapons or injuries. (AR 841.)
 
d.           
October
14, 2021 Report of Battery
 
            On October 14, 2021, petitioner
filed a police report with the LAPD alleging that, on the same day, a Hispanic
male got into a verbal dispute with petitioner, pushed petitioner, and then fled
the scene. (AR 842-46.) Petitioner stated to officers that “she had a previous
encounter with the suspect approximately a week ago…[and] she does not know the
suspect.” (AR 844.) The report noted that petitioner did not sustain any
visible injuries and refused medical treatment. (AR 844.) Accordingly,
LAPD characterized the interaction as assault/battery for the unlawful use of force
or violence against another. (AR 846.)
 
e.           
October
28, 2021 Report of Criminal Threats
 
On
October 28, 2021, petitioner filed a police report with LAPD alleging that, on
October 27, 2021, an unknown assailant in a gold vehicle followed her around
the neighborhood and began to speak to her. (AR 847-52.) Petitioner reported
that she did not understand much of what the suspect said, but did specifically
hear: “I want to rape you…I can see you in the house.” (AR 849.) The report did
not identify any medical treatment or injury. (AR 849.) Accordingly, the LAPD
characterized the interaction as criminal threats. (AR 852.)
 
f.            
January
8, 2021 Report of Criminal Threats
 
On
January 8, 2021, petitioner filed a report with the LAPD alleging that Delia
Duplessis made criminal threats. (AR 973.)
 
g.           
November
8, 2021 Restraining Order
 
On
November 8, 2021, the court granted a restraining order in favor of petitioner
and against Delia Duplessis. (AR 834.) The restraining order does not indicate
the circumstances leading to the restraining order. (AR 834.)
 
2.           
Alleged
Injury and Request for Compensation
 
As
noted above, petitioner claimed she sustained “head injury” and “irregularity
at the junction of the sacrum/coccyx/knee,” due to the alleged crimes. (AR
917.) Petitioner sought compensation from the CalVCB for income loss, moving or
relocation expenses, home or vehicle modifications, job retraining, and “stolen
SBA loan monies.” (AR 917.) CalVCB received, in relevant part: petitioner’s
2019 and 2020 tax return statements (AR 876-911); coding summary for the
treatment she received at LAC / USC VIP (AR 950-56); and a single page of a partial
X-ray report of her head (AR 965). Petitioner did not submit any out-of-pocket
expenses to the CalVCB with her initial application. (AR 915-77.)
 
B.          
CalVCB
Staff Recommends the Denial of Petitioner’s Application Based on Insufficient
Evidence, Which Petitioner Does Not Appeal
            
On
July 21, 2022, the CalVCB staff recommended that petitioner’s application for
crime victim compensation be denied because it “has been unable to verify
physical injury, a threat of physical injury, or emotional injury specific to
certain crimes as required by California Government Code section 13955(f)
through a crime report or other evidence.” (AR 60.) As the CalVCB explained,
“crime documentation received from LAPD does not provide sufficient evidence
that a covered crime occurred…Therefore, [staff is]…unable to determine by a preponderance
of evidence that a crime occurred.” (AR 60.)
 
Because
the staff recommendation did not constitute a final administrative
determination to deny petitioner’s application or claim, the CalVCB provided petitioner
with notice of her right to appeal the staff recommendation, and advised her
that, if she disagreed with the recommendation, she had 45 days in which to
submit evidence demonstrating that there was a basis of relief. (AR 60-61; see
2 C.C.R. § 647.4(c).) Petitioner failed to appeal the decision within the
45-day
period, i.e., by September 4, 2022. (AR 6-56.) 
 
On
September 15, 2022, the Board accepted the staff recommendation to deny petitioner’s
application. (AR 64, see 2 C.C.R. § 647.4(c).) When advising the petitioner
of the Board’s decision, the Board’s order told her that that she had 60 days
in which to request reconsideration of the Board’s decision. (AR 64, Gov. Code,
§ 13959(i); 2 C.C.R. § 647.38.) To make this request, the CalVCB instructed petitioner
that she “must provide NEW and relevant information” she did not have when the
Board denied her application. (AR 64, 2 C.C.R. § 647.38.)
 
C.          
Petitioner’s
Request for Reconsideration
 
On
October 3, 2022, petitioner requested reconsideration. (AR 66.) That same day,
the CalVCB acknowledged its receipt. (AR 1041.) Between October 4, 2022 and
April 28, 2023, petitioner submitted additional records for reconsideration.
(AR 67-377, 438.) Such additional records included: paperwork regarding
numerous complaints against law enforcement agencies; paperwork regarding her
towed vehicle; records related to an unlawful detainer proceeding and housemate
disputes; various photographs of housemates, furniture, building interiors, and
the public; text messages; paperwork regarding missing persons information; a
copy of the Civil Harassment Restraining Order against Delia Duplessis;
paperwork related to Delia Duplessis’s request for a restraining order against
Petitioner; paperwork related to a Covid-19 economic injury disaster loan;
information regarding incidents involving petitioner’s children; paperwork
related to a criminal defendant; SBA application alerts; and complaints against
a medical professional. (AR 67-377, 438.) Of relevance to the underlying
Application, petitioner submitted the following:
 

An order renewing petitioner’s grant of a
     civil harassment restraining order against Delia Duplessis (AR 100)

 

An X-ray of the thoracic spine taken on March
     7, 2022 that shows mild degenerative changes to the thoracic spine (AR
     318)

 

A partial CT report of the head taken on
     January 21, 2022, that reports “No mass, lesion, mass effect, acute
     infarction or hemorrhage is identified.” (AR 319-20.)

 

A partial MRI report of the head taken on
     October 25, 2022, that reports “no evidence of acute intracranial
     hemorrhage…” or “acute infarct.” (AR 321.)

 

A November 17, 2021 Police Report where petitioner
     claims she was raped on 6/11/2022 by an unknown assailant. (AR 343-47.) 

 

A partial medical report that indicates petitioner
     contracted a sexually transmitted disease, based on a specimen collected
     on April 28, 2022. (AR 351.) The partial report does not note when petitioner
     contracted a sexually transmitted disease. (AR 351.)

 
On
May 18, 2023, the Board denied petitioner’s request for reconsideration. (AR
1047-49.) The Board determined that the information did not meet the criteria
for granting reconsideration because petitioner did not provide new and
additional information that was not reasonably available at the time of the
hearing. (AR 1047-49.) The Board further determined that, even if the
additional information did meet the criteria for reconsideration, it did not overcome
the reason for the staff’s recommendation that her application be denied as
there remained insufficient evidence to demonstrate that petitioner was injured
or threatened with injury as a direct result of a crime. (AR 1047-49.)
 
Post-decision,
between May 18, 2023 and May 24, 2023, petitioner continued to submit records
to the CalVCB. (AR 378-432.)
  
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
July 21, 2023, petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandate. On January 3,
2024, respondent filed an Answer. On January 12, 2024, petitioner filed a
“Reply (Traverse) to Return.”
 
            On
March 15, 2024, petitioner filed an opening brief. On April 16, 2024, respondent
filed an opposition. On April 29, 2024, respondent filed an errata to the
opposition. On May 3, 2024, petitioner filed a reply. The Court has received
lodged copies of the joint appendix and administrative record.
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
The
Court reviews the Board’s final decisions of applications for compensation
pursuant to CCP § 1094.5. (Gov. Code § 13960(a).) Under CCP § 1094.5(b), the pertinent issues are
whether the respondent has proceeded without jurisdiction, whether there was a
fair trial, and whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. An abuse
of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in the manner
required by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings
are not supported by the evidence. (CCP § 1094.5(b).)
 
Because petitioner does
not have a fundamental vested right to compensation from the Board, the court
reviews the Board’s decision to determine whether it is supported by
substantial evidence. (Madrigal v. California Victim Comp. & Government
Claims Bd. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 1108, 1113; Blazevich v. State Bd. of
Control (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 1121, 1125.) Substantial evidence is
“relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a
conclusion” (California Youth Authority v. State Personnel Board (2002)
104 Cal.App.4th 575, 584-85), or evidence of ponderable legal significance
which is reasonable, credible and of solid value (Kuhn v. Department of
General Services (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1627, 1633). “Courts may reverse an
[administrative] decision only if, based on the evidence…a reasonable person
could not reach the conclusion reached by the agency.” (Sierra Club v.
California Coastal Com. (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 602, 610.)
 
An agency is presumed to
have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code § 664.) A reviewing
court “will not act as counsel for either party to an appeal and will not
assume the task of initiating and prosecuting a search of the record for any purpose
of discovering errors not pointed out in the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742.) When an appellant
challenges “‘the sufficiency of the evidence, all material evidence on the
point must be set forth and not merely their own evidence.” (Toigo v. Town
of Ross (1998) 70 Cal.App.4th 309, 317.) 

  
IV.     Analysis
 The
Victim Compensation Board is charged with determining claims for financial
assistance from crime victims pursuant to California’s legislative finding that
providing compensation to victims of crimes to defray pecuniary losses is in
the public interest. (Gov. Code § 13950(a).) An applicant carries the burden of
proof to establish an entitlement to relief by a preponderance of the evidence
in these hearings. (Gov. Code § 13959(c); see also 2 C.C.R. § 647.32(a),
(c).) An applicant who meets all the following requirements are eligible for
compensation: (1) the applicant is a victim; (2) the crime occurred in
California or the victim was a resident of California; (3) the application is
timely; (4) the injury was a direct result of a crime; (5) as a direct result
of the crime, the victim sustained physical injury or emotional injury and a
threat of physical injury; and (6) the injury has resulted or may result in
pecuniary loss within the statutory scope of compensation. (Gov. Code §§ 13955,
13959(c) [referring to section 13955].)
 
            The statutory scheme permits
delegation of hearing of appeals to hearing officers. (Gov. Code § 13959(g).) The
Board is required to issue a written decision, typically based on Board action
adopting or rejecting the proposed decision of the hearing officer. (Gov. Code 13959(h),
2 C.C.R. §§ 647.36, 647.37.1.)
 
A.          
Merits
 
“In
general, a party must exhaust administrative remedies before resorting to the
courts.” (Coachella Valley Mosquito & Vector Control Dist. v. California
Public Employment Relations Bd. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1072, 1080.) The
exhaustion doctrine “requires that a party must not only initially raise the
issue in the administrative forum, but he must proceed through the entire
proceeding to a final decision on the merits of the entire controversy.” (McHugh
v. County of Santa Cruz (1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 533, 539.) “[E]xhaustion of
the administrative remedy is a jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the
courts.” (Abelleira v. District Court of Appeal, Third Dist. (1941) 17
Cal.2d 280, 293.) “The exhaustion doctrine is principally grounded on concerns
favoring administrative autonomy (i.e., courts should not interfere with an
agency determination until the agency has reached a final decision) and
judicial efficiency (i.e., overworked courts should decline to intervene in an
administrative dispute unless absolutely necessary).” (Farmers Ins. Exchange
v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 391.) Petitioner bears the burden
to establish that it exhausted administrative remedies. (Westinghouse Elec.
Corp. v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 32, 37.) 
 
Section
647.4 of title 2 of the California Code of Regulations governs the administrative
review process for crime victim assistance applications. The Board’s
determination on applications for assistance is initially addressed by a staff
recommendation. (2 C.C.R. § 647.4(a).) Staff may recommend approval, denial, or
approval in part and denial in part of an application. (2 C.C.R. § 647.4(a).)
If staff recommends denial in whole or in part, “the applicant has 45 calendar
days from the date of the mailing of the notice of the staff recommendation to
request in writing that the matter be set for hearing to contest the staff
recommendation.” (2 C.C.R. § 647.4(a).) The Board informs applicants that,
if they do not appeal within 45 days, the application becomes final. (AR 1029.)
The applicant may then either file a petition for writ of administrative
mandate or seek reconsideration from the Board. (Gov. Code § 13960.) Where the
applicant seeks reconsideration, the applicant must produce “new and additional
evidence not reasonably available to the applicant at the time of the hearing” or
reconsideration will not be granted. (2 C.C.R. § 647.38.) 
 
On
July 21, 2022, staff mailed a notice to petitioner informing her that their
recommendation was to deny the application for crime victim compensation. (AR 1027.)
The notice informed petitioner that she had a right to request a hearing. (AR
1027.) The notice also stated: “Read the following page carefully and fill out
as completely as possible. It is an Appeal Form. You must return this form
within 45 days if you wish to request a hearing.” (AR 1027.) The next page was
an “Appeal Verification Form,” which informed petitioner that she had 45 days from
July 21, 2022, the date listed in the notice, to file an appeal. (AR 1029.) The
Appeal Verification Form stated: “If you do not appeal within 45 days, the
recommendation will become final.” (AR 1029.) 
 
Petitioner
did not file an appeal. (AR 7.) After staff mailed the notice to petitioner,
petitioner called to follow up on her application on September 12, 2022. (AR
7.) Staff informed petitioner that her application was denied and the reasons
for denial. (AR 7.) Petitioner then asserted that her application should be
reconsidered. (AR 7.) Staff told petitioner that reconsideration had not
occurred. (AR 7.) Petitioner then filed a request for reconsideration. (AR 7.)
 
Petitioner’s
failure to request an appeal by September 4, 2022 (45 days from the date of the
notice) is fatal to the instant petition for writ of mandate. “The exhaustion
doctrine…recognizes and gives due respect to the autonomy of the executive and
legislative branches, and can secure the benefit of agency expertise, mitigate
damages, relieve burdens that might otherwise be imposed on the court system,
and promote the development of a robust record conducive to meaningful judicial
review.” (Hill RHF Housing Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2021)
12 Cal.5th 458, 478.) Had petitioner filed an appeal, petitioner would have
been granted a hearing, after which the Board would have provided a written
decision on petitioner’s application. (See Gov. Code § 13959(a), (h).) Having
failed to file an appeal, petitioner deprived the Court of the benefit of the Board’s
expertise in its review and development of the record and issuance of a written
decision. 
 
In
the opening brief, petitioner asserted that she requested an appeal hearing by
facsimile on July 13, 2022. (Opening Br. at 4:3-6.) In the reply, petitioner
contends that she requested an appeal on July 13, 2022 after staff informed her
of the denial by phone. (Reply at 17:1-3; see also Reply at
5:24-26.) Petitioner does not cite to the administrative record by Bates stamp
number indicating where the purported appeal request is located. The Court is
not required to search the record to ascertain whether it supports an
appellant’s contentions, nor make the parties’ arguments for them. (See Inyo
Citizens for Better Planning v. Inyo County Board of Supervisors (2009) 180
Cal.App.4th 1, 14.) 
 
In
any event, the Board’s case management system reflects that, on July 13, 2022,
petitioner submitted a “Request for Reconsideration” and “Medical Records.” (AR
8.) The case management system also reflects that on July 13, 2022, petitioner
called staff upset that her application has not been processed and that “her EA
was denied.” (AR 7.) The “EA” referenced was the emergency award, which was
denied on April 8, 2022 as no losses have been submitted. (AR 8; see 2
C.C.R. § 649.8(c) [“An emergency award may be allowed when it is necessary to
avoid or mitigate a substantial hardship to the applicant that is the direct
result of the qualifying crime”].) The denial of the emergency award was not a
recommendation to deny petitioner’s application for victim compensation under section
647.4(a) of title 2 of the California Code of Regulations. Petitioner contends
that there was no reference to emergency compensation in the denial. (Reply at
5:24-25.) However, respondent’s case management records constitute substantial
evidence that the denial discussed during petitioner’ s call on July 13, 2022
was about an emergency award, not the subject application for victim
compensation. 
 
Moreover,
petitioner was not notified until July 21, 2022 of staff’s recommendation to
deny her application. (AR 1027.) Accordingly, petitioner’s purported “Request
for Reconsideration” before the notice of the denial recommendation either was
premature or could not have related to the staff’s recommendation to deny her
application.
 
To
the extent that petitioner contends her request for reconsideration submitted
on October 3, 2022 and received on October 4, 2022 constitutes an appeal (AR 66,
1041), such contention would be unavailing. A request for reconsideration can
only be granted if the applicant produces “new and additional evidence not
reasonably available to the applicant at the time of the hearing.” (2 C.C.R. §
647.38.) The Board reviewed the 254 pages of documents petitioner submitted and
determined, “While Latina Y. provided new and additional information, there is
no evidence that it was unavailable to her at the time of the hearing.” (AR
1048-49.) Petitioner has not provided any argument regarding how the Board was
incorrect in this conclusion. Accordingly, petitioner has failed to meet her
burden to demonstrate that she exhausted the available administrative remedies,
specifically the appeal and hearing available under section 647.4(c) of title 2
of the California Code of Regulations and Government Code § 13959. 
 
Even
if the Court were to reach the question of whether substantial evidence
supported the denial of petitioner’s application, the Court would find that
denial was warranted. To be eligible for compensation, petitioner was required
to show that she was a “victim,” namely, someone who sustained injury as a
direct result of a crime. (Gov. Code §§ 13951(b)(1), 13951(g), 13955(a)(1),
13955(e)(1).) A “crime” is defined as a “a crime or public offense, wherever it
may take place, that would constitute a misdemeanor or a felony if the crime
had been committed in California by a competent adult.” (Gov. Code §
13951(b)(1); see also 2 C.C.R. § 649(a)(17) [defining “qualifying crime”
as “a crime as defined in Government Code section 13951(b) that resulted in”
injury, threat of injury, or death].) 
 
The
Board may rely on written reports from law enforcement during the hearing. (2
C.C.R. § 647.31(d).) “Significant weight may be given to the evidence from and
conclusions of a law enforcement agency after investigation of the qualifying
crime when determining whether or not a qualifying crime occurred.” (2 C.C.R. § 649.38(b).)
Evidence of a sexual assault may include “[p]hysical evidence or medical
documentation that demonstrates an injury consistent with sexual assault such
as sexual assault examination findings.” (2 C.C.R. § 649.49(a)(3).) 


Police
reports do not indicate any conclusion from law enforcement that petitioner was
the victim of sexual assault. (AR 343-47, 870-75.) Petitioner’s medical records
do not indicate the occurrence of any sexual assault. (AR 318-21.) Petitioner’s
x-ray demonstrated mild degenerative changes in her spine. (AR 318.) Petitioner’s
CT scan of her head did not show any evidence of hemorrhage, infarction, or fracture.
(AR 319-21.) There were no results of any rape kit in the record. 
 
Police
records do not indicate that she was the victim of any other qualifying crime. The
LAPD never concluded that petitioner’s allegations of battery or threat of
battery were substantiated. (See AR 837-59, 969, 973.) Although
petitioner obtained a restraining order against Delia Duplessis, the order did
not indicate any actions from Duplessis that justified the order. (AR 100,
834.) The medical records discussed above do not demonstrated petitioner having
suffered acute trauma or injury.
 
For
the foregoing reasons, even assuming petitioner exhausted her administrative
remedies, substantial evidence supports the conclusion regarding insufficient
evidence of a qualifying crime having occurred. (AR 1027.)
 
V.      Conclusion
 
The petition is DENIED. Pursuant to Local Rule
3.231(n), respondent California
Victim Compensation Board shall prepare, serve, and ultimately file a
proposed judgment.
