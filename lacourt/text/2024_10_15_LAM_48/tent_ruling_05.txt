  CASE NO.: 24STCV09315
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 15, 2024



 
GRANT
| SHENON, A Professional Law Corporation (counsel of record for Defendants Amanda
Castillo, Eusebio Salazar, and Pica Pica Texas Snacks Inc.) seeks to be relieved
as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states
that there has been a total breakdown in communication and the attorney-client relationship
that prevents counsel from effectively representing Defendants, and Defendants have
expressed their inability to fulfill obligations under the agreement as to fees
and expenses.  No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial is not until March 16, 2026, and there is
no prejudice to Defendants.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on Amanda
Castillo, Eusebio Salazar, Pica Pica Texas Snacks Inc., and all parties who have
appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  Therefore, an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure
to Retain New Counsel for Pica Pica Texas Snacks Inc. is scheduled for January 17,
2025 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
Pica
Pica Texas Snacks Inc. must retain new counsel by that date or the Court may strike
its answer and place it in default.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 15th day of October 2024
