Summary:

Judge Thomas D. Long has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Bahram Rasizadeh's motion for attorney fees in the amount of $60,330.00. The Plaintiff seeks fees for work done in connection with the motion for terminating sanctions, but the Judge finds that most of the fees sought are unrelated to the relief obtained by Defendant Schuster Real Estate Co., Ltd. The Judge awards fees only for the November 16, 2023 motion for terminating sanctions, which is reasonable given the circumstances. The Plaintiff has already been compensated for this motion through sanctions awarded and paid. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's opposition to Defendant's motion to set aside/vacate default was unnecessary and unsubstantiated, and therefore will not award fees for time spent opposing this motion.
