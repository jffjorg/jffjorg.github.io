And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for approval of a proposed Private Attorney General Act (PAGA) settlement between Kortine Hawkins, the plaintiff, and PLS Check Cashers of California Inc., the defendant. The settlement provides for a payment of $425,000.00, with $148,750.00 going to the plaintiff's counsel as attorney fees, $15,323.86 going to cover costs, and $6,250.00 going to a settlement administrator. The remaining amount will be distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) and the aggrieved employees on a pro rata basis.

The judge finds that the settlement is entitled to a presumption of fairness, as it was reached through arm's-length bargaining, investigation and discovery were sufficient, counsel is experienced in similar litigation, and the percentage of objectors is small. The judge also finds that the release of all PAGA claims against the defendant is permissible, and that the attorney fees and costs are reasonable.

The judge orders that the motion for approval of the PAGA settlement be granted, and that the parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so. If all parties submit on the tentative, no appearances before the court are required unless a companion hearing is also on calendar.
