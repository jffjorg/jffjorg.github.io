And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the motion of SHENON, A Professional Law Corporation, to be relieved as counsel for Amanda Castillo, Eusebio Salazar, and Pica Pica Texas Snacks Inc. The motion was unopposed, and the judge found that the breakdown in communication and the inability to fulfill obligations prevented the attorney from effectively representing the defendants. The judge also scheduled an Order to Show Cause for Pica Pica Texas Snacks Inc. to retain new counsel by January 17, 2025, or risk having its answer struck and being placed in default.
