[1]
Plaintiff asserts that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies.
(Opposition at pgs. 18-19.) Although the argument is unclear in the context of
this particular case, the Court assumes it has to do with the placement of the
slippery substance. However, the Court need not reach the issue of who placed
the slippery substance on the stairs, as discussed above.


[2] The
complaints were made to Defendant’s handyman or property manager, Paul Backes,
which the parties appear to agree constitute notice to Defendant.


[3]
Plaintiff cites to Andrews, as well as various lease provisions, for the
proposition that Defendant has a general duty of care to provide quiet
enjoyment of its tenants. (Opp. at pgs. 19-23.) However, Plaintiff has not pled
any causes of action relating to any implied or express lease terms.
Accordingly, the Court does not address these arguments.


[4] This
section repeats the same arguments as Plaintiffs’ arguments against Edgerton.
