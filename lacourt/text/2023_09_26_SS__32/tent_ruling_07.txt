  26, 2023




CASE NUMBER:


21STCV33971




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Order Relieving Plaintiffs from Gov’t Code section 945.4 and to submit
  late claim against City of Pico   




MOVING PARTY:


Petitioners Francisco Monterrosas and Hugo
  Garcia Rosas  




OPPOSING PARTY:


Respondent
  City of Pico Rivera 



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Petitioners
Francisco Monterrosas and Hugo Garcia Rosas move the Court for relief from the
provisions of Government Code section 945.4 to permit Plaintiff to proceed on
his claims against Respondent City of Pico Rivera.  Respondent opposes the
motion.  
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Pursuant to the Government Claims Act, a party with a claim
for damages against a public entity must first timely present the claim
directly with that entity.¿ The party may file a lawsuit only if the public
entity denies or rejects the claim (either expressly or by operation of law).
(Gov. Code §§ 905, 945.4; City of Ontario v. Superior Court (1993) 12
Cal.App.4th 894.)¿ The claims presentation requirement provides the public
entity with an opportunity to evaluate the claim and decide whether to pay on
the claim.¿ (Roberts v. County of Los Angeles (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th
474.)¿  
 
A party must file a claim based on “a cause of action for
death or for injury to person”
within six months.
(Gov. Code, §§ 911.4, 911.2, subd. (a).) A party may apply for leave to present
an untimely claim (Govt. Code § 911.4), which the board “shall grant or deny …
within 45 days after it is presented to the board. The claimant and the board
may extend the period within which the board is required to act on the
application by written agreement made before the expiration of the period.”
(Gov. Code § 911.6(a).) “The board shall grant the application if one of more
of the following is applicable: (1) The failure to present the claim was
through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect and the public
entity was not prejudiced in its defense of the claim by the failure to present
the claim within the time specified in Section 911.2.” (Gov. Code § 911.6(b).)  

 
“If the board fails or refuses to act on an application
within the time prescribed by this section, the application shall be deemed to
have been denied on the 45th day or, if the period within which the
board is required to act is extended by agreement pursuant to this section, the
last day of the period specified in the agreement.” (Gov. Code § 911.6(c).) “In
all circumstances, a late claim application is deemed denied after 45 days,
even though section 911.6(b)(2) would entitle the [individual] to relief if the
application had merit. By placing this limitation on the entity’s time to act,
the Legislature ensured that applications would not languish.” (J.M. v.
Huntington Beach Union High School Dist. (2017) 2 Cal.5th 648, 653.)
 
“If an application for leave to present a claim is denied
or deemed to be denied pursuant to Section 911.6, a petition may be made to the
court for an order relieving the petitioner from Section 945.4.” (Gov. Code §
946.6(a).) The petition shall show each of the following: (1) the application
was denied or deemed denied, (2) the reason for the failure to present a timely
claim, and (3) information required in section 910. (Gov. Code § 946.6(b).) “The
applicant has six months to seek relief in court ‘after the application to the
[entity] is denied or deemed to be denied.’ The six-month period
‘operates as a statute of limitations. It is mandatory, not discretionary.’” (J.M.,
supra, 2 Cal.5th at 653 (alterations and emphasis in original,
citations omitted).)
 
The court must grant a petition for relief from the claims
filing requirements of the Government Claims Act if the court finds, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the petitioner filed an application within
a reasonable time after the cause of action accrued, which may not exceed one
year, it was denied or deemed denied pursuant to Section 911.6, and that the
petitioner’s failure to present a timely claim was due to minority, incapacity
or death, or “mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect[.]”¿ (Gov.
Code, § 946.6(c); El Dorado Irrigation Dist. v.
Superior Court (1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 57, 62.) “Relief from
the six-month limit is granted under the same showing as is required for relief
under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.” (Munoz
v. State of California (1995)
33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1778.) 
 
The excusable
neglect standard assumes that there has been some sort of inattention or
carelessness and asks “whether a
reasonably prudent person might have made the same error under the same or
similar circumstances.”  (Munoz v. State of California (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 1767, 1783.) In applying this standard, a court must also examine
whether the party or her counsel were “otherwise diligent in investigating and
pursuing the claim.”  (Id.) “To obtain
relief under section 946.6, subdivision (c)(1), ‘[t]he mere recital of mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect is not sufficient to warrant
relief. Relief on grounds of mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable
neglect is available only on a showing that the claimant's failure to timely
present a claim was reasonable when tested by the objective ‘reasonably prudent
person’ standard.’ [Citation.]”  (N.G. v. County of San Diego
(2020) 59 Cal.App.5th 63, 73-74.)   
 
If the petitioner proves grounds for relief, the burden
shifts to the entity to demonstrate prejudice “in the defense of the claim[.]”
(Gov. Code, § 946.6, subd. (c)(1).)¿¿ 
 
JUDICIAL
NOTICE
 
The following
requests for judicial notice by Respondents are granted under Evidence Code
section 452(d): Exhibits A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Petitioners’ cause of action accrued on May 30, 2021, when they
allegedly suffered physical injuries. (Elmassian Decl. ¶ 1.) Therefore, under
Government Code section 911.2, their claim needed to be presented to Respondent
within six months.
 
The complaint was filed on September 15, 2021.
 
On April 29, 2022, the Court denied Petitioners’ motion for an order
permitting them to file a late claim, concluding that “Petitioners have failed
to meet their burden to demonstrate they presented a timely claim to
Respondent, or applied to Respondent to present a late claim within a
reasonable time after the cause of action accrued.”[1]
(Minute Order Dated April 29, 2022.)
 
On May 11, 2022, Plaintiffs presented an application for leave to
present a late claim, which was stamped received by the City Clerk, City of
Pico Rivera. (Elmassian Decl., Ex. B.) 
 
Plaintiffs assert that “[n]o denial was received.” (Elmassian Decl. ¶
9.) Counsel asserts that he engaged in discussions with counsel for the City,
however, he does not assert that they extended the
period within which the board is required to act on the application by written
agreement made before the expiration of the period, pursuant to Government Code
section 911.6.
 
On April 4, 2023, Petitioners filed the instant motion, for an order
permitting Plaintiffs to file a late claim. 
 
            The May 11, 2022 application for
leave to present a late claim was deemed denied on June 27, 2022, 45 days after
the application, taking into account the weekend.  Accordingly, the application to seek relief
in this Court was due by December 27, 2022. Plaintiffs’ instant motion filed on
April 4, 2023, is untimely. The six-month time period is mandatory, not
discretionary, as explained above.
 
            Plaintiffs argue that because no
denial was received, a two-year statute of limitations applies. (Motion at pg.
10.) Plaintiffs are mistaken. The two-year period applies pursuant to section 945.6
when no response is received regarding the initial claim. (Gov. Code 945.6 (“If
written notice is not given in accordance with Section 913, within two years
from the accrual of the cause of action.”); Gov. Code 913(a) (“Written notice
of the action taken under Section 912.5, 912.6, 912.7, or 912.8 or the inaction
that is deemed rejection under Section 912.4 shall be given in the manner prescribed
by Section 915.4…”).) Section 913 does not state that it includes section 911.6,
for the purpose of determining when the six-month limitations period to file an
application in the superior court begins. (Compare J.M, supra, 2 Cal.5th
at 651 (counsel petitioned superior court for relief from obligation to present
a claim within two years of accrual of cause of action, Supreme Court held that
the petition must be filed within six months after the late claim application
is deemed denied.)            
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Order Relieving Plaintiffs from
Provisions of Cal. Gov. Code Section 954.4 and to Submit Late Claim DENIED.
 
Plaintiffs
shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service of
such.
