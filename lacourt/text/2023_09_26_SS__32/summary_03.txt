And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel responses to special interrogatories, set two, filed by Plaintiff Karapet Talasyan against Defendants Wadie Simaan and Jouhaina Simaan. The Plaintiff served the special interrogatories on May 25 and May 31, 2023, and the Defendants served unverified responses consisting solely of objections on July 5, 2023. The Judge finds that the Defendants' responses lack verification statements, but are still considered "responses" under the Code of Civil Procedure. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff failed to meet and confer and to participate in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) as required by the Eighth Amended Standing Order Re Procedures for the Personal Injury Hub, making the motions procedurally defective. Therefore, the Judge denies the motions without prejudice and denies the requests for sanctions. The hearing set for September 27, 2023, is advanced to today's date and vacated.
