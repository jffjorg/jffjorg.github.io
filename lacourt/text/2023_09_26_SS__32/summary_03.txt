And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel responses to special interrogatories, set two, filed by Plaintiff Karapet Talasyan against Defendants Wadie Simaan and Jouhaina Simaan. The Plaintiff served the special interrogatories on May 25 and May 31, 2023, and the Defendants served unverified responses consisting solely of objections on July 5, 2023. The Judge finds that the Defendants' responses lack verification statements, but are still considered "responses" under the Code of Civil Procedure. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff failed to meet and confer and to participate in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) as required by the Eighth Amended Standing Order Re Procedures for the Personal Injury Hub, making the motions procedurally defective. Therefore, the Judge denies the motions without prejudice and denies the requests for sanctions. The hearing set for September 27, 2023, is advanced to today's date and vacated.

## English Summary:

This tentative ruling concerns two motions filed by Plaintiff Karapet Talasyan to compel Defendant Wadie Simaan and Defendant Jouhaina Simaan to provide complete answers to special interrogatories. 

The Defendants responded to the interrogatories with objections but did not provide any substantive answers. The Plaintiff argues that these objections are improper and requests the Court to order the Defendants to provide full responses.

The Judge finds that while the Defendants' objections technically constitute a "response," the Plaintiff did not properly follow the court's procedural rules for discovery disputes by failing to meet and confer with the Defendants and participate in an informal discovery conference. 

Therefore, the Court denies the Plaintiff's motions without prejudice, meaning the Plaintiff can refile them after properly following the required procedures.  The Court also denies the Plaintiff's request for sanctions against the Defendants.

```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motions to compel responses to special interrogatories, set two, as to both defendants. The plaintiff served the interrogatories on May 31, 2023, and May 25, 2023, but the defendants only served unverified responses consisting solely of objections. The judge finds that the motions are procedurally defective because the plaintiff failed to meet and confer and participate in an informal discovery conference. The judge also cites Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.220, which requires that each answer to an interrogatory must be as "complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party permits." The judge orders that the motions be denied without prejudice and that the plaintiff provide notice of the court's order and file a proof of service.
