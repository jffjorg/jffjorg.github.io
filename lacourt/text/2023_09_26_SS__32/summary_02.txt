And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Armando Granadero (Plaintiff) vs. None (no Defendant). The motion is to be relieved as counsel, filed by Attorneys Gary Dordick and Nicholas Myers (Counsel) on behalf of the Plaintiff. The Court finds that the breakdown in communication between Counsel and the Plaintiff is substantial and irreconcilable, making it unreasonable for Counsel to continue representing the Plaintiff. Therefore, the Court grants the motion and orders Counsel to serve the signed order and file a proof of service within 10 days. Counsel will remain the attorney of record for the Plaintiff until the order is served and filed.
