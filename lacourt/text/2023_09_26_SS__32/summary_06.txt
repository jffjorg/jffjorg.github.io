And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case where the plaintiff claims that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies, which would shift the burden of proof to the defendant to show that they did not cause the slippery substance on the stairs. However, the judge is not convinced that this doctrine applies in this case. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not pled any causes of action related to the lease terms, so this argument is not addressed. The judge believes that the defendant received notice of the slippery substance through complaints made to their handyman or property manager, Paul Backes. Overall, the judge is not taking sides and is simply presenting their tentative thoughts on the case before the next hearing.

## English Summary

The judge is analyzing arguments from a Plaintiff who fell on a slippery substance on stairs, potentially related to a landlord-tenant situation. The Plaintiff argues that the doctrine of *res ipsa loquitur* applies, meaning the incident speaks for itself and the Defendant should be held liable. However, the judge notes the argument is unclear and doesn't need to decide who placed the substance on the stairs. 

The Plaintiff also cites lease provisions and a case called *Andrews* to argue the Defendant had a duty to provide a safe environment for tenants.  The judge declines to address these arguments because the Plaintiff hasn't brought any specific claims based on the lease. 


The judge's tentative ruling suggests they may be leaning towards dismissing the Plaintiff's case, at least based on the arguments presented so far.

The judge is considering the case involving a slippery substance placed on the stairs, which caused harm to the plaintiff. The plaintiff argues that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies, but the judge is unclear about what this means in the context of this case. The judge notes that the plaintiff's complaints were made to the defendant's handyman or property manager, Paul Backes, which the parties agree constitutes notice to the defendant. The plaintiff also cites to a case called Andrews and various lease provisions to argue that the defendant has a general duty of care to provide quiet enjoyment to its tenants. However, the judge does not address these arguments because the plaintiff has not pled any causes of action related to implied or express lease terms. The judge intends to consider these issues further at the upcoming court hearing.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a future court hearing. The Plaintiff argues that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies, which suggests that the Defendant is responsible for the placement of a slippery substance on the stairs. However, the Court does not need to decide who placed the substance, as the complaints made to the Defendant's handyman or property manager, Paul Backes, constitute notice to the Defendant. The Plaintiff also cites the case of Andrews and various lease provisions to argue that the Defendant has a general duty of care to provide quiet enjoyment of its tenants. However, the Court does not address these arguments as the Plaintiff has not pled any causes of action related to lease terms. The ruling repeats similar arguments made against another party, Edgerton. Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling suggests that the Court is not convinced by the Plaintiff's arguments and is unlikely to rule in their favor.

---

The Judge's tentative ruling summarizes the arguments made by the Plaintiff and Defendant in a case. The Plaintiff asserts that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies, but the Judge assumes it relates to the placement of the slippery substance and need not reach the issue. The complaints were made to Defendant's handyman or property manager, Paul Backes, which the parties agree constitutes notice to Defendant. The Plaintiff cites Andrews and various lease provisions for the proposition that Defendant has a general duty of care, but the Plaintiff has not pled any causes of action relating to any implied or express lease terms. The Plaintiff's arguments against Defendant are the same as those against Edgerton.
