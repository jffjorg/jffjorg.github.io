```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case where the plaintiff claims that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies, which would shift the burden of proof to the defendant to show that they did not cause the slippery substance on the stairs. However, the judge is not convinced that this doctrine applies in this case. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not pled any causes of action related to the lease terms, so this argument is not addressed. The judge believes that the defendant received notice of the slippery substance through complaints made to their handyman or property manager, Paul Backes. Overall, the judge is not taking sides and is simply presenting their tentative thoughts on the case before the next hearing.
