The court has denied both motions without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff has the opportunity to respond and the court will reconsider the motions.

The court notes that the guardian ad litem cannot appear on behalf of the minor, and that the plaintiff's lack of representation has caused delays in the case. The court has set the case for a status conference to determine how to proceed.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Layla Tafoya vs. City of West Covina, case number 19STCV42599. The defendant, City of West Covina, had filed two motions to compel the plaintiff's deposition and expert witness deposition. However, the judge has denied both motions without prejudice due to insufficient evidence that the plaintiff has notice of the motions and insufficient basis to compel the depositions. The defendant had also sought monetary sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel, but the judge has denied this request as well, finding that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust. The court has ordered the defendant to give notice of the court's order and file a proof of service. The plaintiff, who is a minor, has not properly appeared through counsel, and the court has noted that the guardian ad litem cannot appear on behalf of the minor without constituting the unauthorized practice of law. The case will proceed with the defendant giving notice of the court's order, and the plaintiff will need to properly appear through counsel in order to proceed with the case.
