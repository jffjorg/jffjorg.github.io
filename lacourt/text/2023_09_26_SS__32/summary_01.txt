And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Layla Tafoya, a minor, against the City of West Covina. The defendant has moved to compel the deposition of the plaintiff and her expert witnesses, and has also sought monetary sanctions. The court has denied both motions without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff has the opportunity to respond and the court will reconsider the motions. The court has also denied the request for monetary sanctions, finding that it would be unjust to impose sanctions on the plaintiff and her original counsel, who have not properly appeared in the case. The court notes that the guardian ad litem cannot appear on behalf of the minor, and that the plaintiff's lack of representation has caused delays in the case. The court has set the case for a status conference to determine how to proceed.
