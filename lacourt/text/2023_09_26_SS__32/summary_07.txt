And here is a summary in English text:

The Tentative Ruling is a decision by the Court regarding a motion filed by Petitioners Francisco Monterrosas and Hugo Garcia Rosas to relieve them from the provisions of Government Code section 945.4, which requires claims against public entities to be filed within a certain time period. The motion is denied because the application for leave to present a late claim was deemed denied 45 days after it was submitted and the six-month time period to file a petition in the superior court has expired. The Court also finds that the two-year statute of limitations applies, but that the petition was filed too late. The Court notes that the excusable neglect standard requires a showing that the claimant's failure to timely present a claim was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, and that the Court must also examine whether the party or her counsel were diligent in investigating and pursuing the claim. The Court concludes that the petitioners' motion is untimely and denied.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiffs' motion for an order relieving them from the provisions of Government Code section 945.4 and permitting them to submit a late claim against the City of Pico Rivera. The Court found that the Plaintiffs' application for leave to present a late claim was deemed denied on June 27, 2022, and that their instant motion filed on April 4, 2023, was untimely. The Court also found that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that they presented a timely claim to the Respondent or applied to present a late claim within a reasonable time after the cause of action accrued. The Court concluded that the six-month time period to file an application in the superior court is mandatory, not discretionary, and that the Plaintiffs' motion was therefore denied. The Plaintiffs are required to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service.

English text:
The tentative ruling for case number 21STCV33971, scheduled for hearing on September 26, 2023 in department 32, is as follows. Plaintiffs Francisco Monterrosas and Hugo Garcia Rosas move for relief from the provisions of Government Code section 945.4 to permit them to proceed on claims against defendant City of Pico Rivera. The legal standard for this motion is that a party with a claim for damages against a public entity must first timely present the claim directly with that entity, and a party must file a claim based on 'a cause of action for death or for injury to person' within six months. Plaintiffs filed their complaint on September 15, 2021, and presented an application for leave to present a late claim on May 11, 2022. However, the application was deemed denied on June 27, 2022, 45 days after the application. Plaintiffs' instant motion, filed on April 4, 2023, is therefore untimely. The six-month time period is mandatory, not discretionary.
