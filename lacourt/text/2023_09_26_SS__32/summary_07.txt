And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petitioners' motion to permit them to file a late claim against the City of Pico Rivera. The petitioners had failed to present their claim within the six-month time period required by the Government Claims Act, and their subsequent application for leave to present a late claim was deemed denied by the City on June 27, 2022. The judge finds that the petitioners' delay in presenting their claim was not excusable neglect and that the City was not prejudiced by the delay. The judge also notes that the six-month time period is mandatory, not discretionary, and that the petitioners' instant motion filed on April 4, 2023, is untimely.
