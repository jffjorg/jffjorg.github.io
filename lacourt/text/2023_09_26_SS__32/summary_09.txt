**English Summary:**

In this tentative ruling, the Court is considering three motions filed by Defendant Karen Sargsyan, seeking to compel Plaintiff Nazario Mejia Jimenez to answer her discovery requests. These requests include Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents. The Plaintiff has failed to respond to these requests despite extensions. The Court finds that Plaintiff's lack of response constitutes discovery abuse and grants Defendant's motions to compel.

However, the Court notes that Plaintiff's counsel has attempted to contact Plaintiff and points to a motion filed to be relieved as counsel. Considering these factors, the Court reduces the requested sanctions from the original amount to $705. Plaintiff is required to provide responses to Defendant's discovery requests within 30 days.
