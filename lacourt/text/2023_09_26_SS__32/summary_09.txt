And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by the defendant, Karen Sargsyan, to compel responses to discovery requests. The defendant served Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Demand for Production of Records on October 24, 2022, but no responses were provided. The judge grants the motion to compel and orders the plaintiff, Nazario Mejia Jimenez, to provide responses without objection within 30 days.

The judge also awards the defendant monetary sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $705, which is to be paid to the defendant's counsel within 30 days. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to maintain contact with their counsel and respond to discovery requests warrants sanctions, but reduces the amount requested by the defendant.
