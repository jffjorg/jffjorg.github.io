[1] The previous
judge rejected Plaintiffsâ€™ claims that a June 3, 2021 letter addressed to Pico
Rivera Sports Arena, and a February 14, 2022 claim form which was not date-stamped,
were sufficient to demonstrate that a claim or an application to file a late
claim were timely presented. Accordingly, to the extent that Plaintiffs seek to
renew these arguments before this Court, they are not properly presented in a
motion for reconsideration.
