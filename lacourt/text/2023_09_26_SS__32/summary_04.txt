## English Text Summary

The judge issued a tentative ruling declining to address two separate motions filed by the Plaintiff. The motions, titled "Memorandum in Support of Motion to Compel Responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set Two," seem to request responses to interrogatories, not requests for admission as indicated in the memorandum titles. 

The judge noted this discrepancy and, consequently, declined to rule on the motions. However, the judge recognized that the same issues raised in these memoranda are also addressed in the Defendants' oppositions.
