And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is unsure what to make of two separate documents filed by the plaintiff, which seek to compel responses to special interrogatories. The first document has a hearing date of September 20, 2023, while the second has a hearing date of September 27, 2023. The court declines to address these documents because it is unclear what they refer to, although it notes that the same issues are raised in the defendant's opposition to these documents.
