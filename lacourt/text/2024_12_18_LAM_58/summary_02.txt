And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to consolidate two separate cases, 24STCV05755 and 24SMUD00429. The plaintiff, Emir Phillips, sought to consolidate the cases on the grounds that they involve common questions of law and fact, as well as overlapping parties. However, the court found that the cases involve different parties and issues, and that there are no overlapping legal questions or evidence that would justify consolidation. The court also noted that consolidation would remove the summary proceeding nature of the unlawful detainer action in the second case, which would not be justified. The judge concluded that the motion to consolidate must be denied.
