And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by plaintiffs Wasserman against General Insurance Company of America, which intervened in the case seeking to recover $153,865.07 paid under the plaintiffs' insurance policy. The judge will consider the late-filed opposition by General Insurance, which argues that the made-whole doctrine does not prevent subrogation and the common-fund doctrine does not apply. The judge has sustained the demurrer with 15 days' leave to amend, meaning that General Insurance can revise its complaint to address the issues raised by the demurrer. The judge's ruling is based on case law, including Holiday Matinee, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc. and Progressive West Ins. Co. v Superior Court, which hold that an insurer must wait until the insured has been made whole before seeking reimbursement. The judge has determined that General Insurance's claims are not ripe under the made-whole doctrine, and that the common-fund doctrine is inapplicable because General Insurance is actively participating in the litigation.
