The summary displayed below was created by an LLM named 'llama3-8b-8192':
**Case Number:** 21STCV38929
**Hearing Date:** December 4, 2023
**Dept:** 11
**Judge:** David S. Cunningham III

**Tentative Ruling:**

Government Defendants' demurrer to the eighth cause of action is overruled.

**Background:**

This is a toxic tort action. The second amended master complaint (SAMC) alleges that Plaintiffs were exposed to elevated levels of hydrogen sulfide in their homes and communities, causing harm, as a direct and proximate result of Defendants' conduct.

**LAW:**

Demurrer: When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context, and "treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law." (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.

Dangerous Condition of Public Property: A public entity is liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property if the plaintiff establishes that the property was in a dangerous condition at the time of the injury, the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous condition, and the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury incurred. (Cal. Gov. Code ยง 835.)

**DISCUSSION:**

Plaintiffs contend that a public entity may be liable for injuries that result from a combination of the condition of the public property and negligent conduct by third persons on or about the property.

Plaintiffs argue that the SAMC alleges such a combination: the condition of the public property (decay in the Channel) combined with third-party conduct (known illicit runoff). While the Warehouse Defendants had the responsibility to clean up and manage the waste on their property, because of the decayed condition of the Channel and the unsealed and unplugged storm drains and catch basins that lead to it, the Government Defendants had the responsibility to ensure that the massive quantity of toxic waste did not enter the Channel through their public property.

Government Defendants contend that the demurrer should be sustained because the allegations fail to identify a defect in the public property that caused Plaintiffs' injuries. They cite Zelig v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112 and Hacala v. Bird Rides, Inc. (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 292 as support.

**RULING:**

On balance, the rules favor Plaintiffs' position at this stage. The alleged third-party conduct was the generation of toxic runoff from the Warehouse Defendants' property. Government Defendants' alleged contributions were their failures to (1) monitor eutrophication indicators, vegetation decay, potential contaminants, or dissolved oxygen levels in the Channel prior to September 16, 2021, (2) plug storm drains, catch basins, and the Channel, and (3) cut off flow to the Channel. It is a question of fact whether Government Defendants' actual or constructive knowledge of unremoved contaminated sediment and lowered oxygen levels caused the Channel to be in a decayed state, creating a dangerous condition during and after the fire.
