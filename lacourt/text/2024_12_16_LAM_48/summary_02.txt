And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, 10630 Wilkins LLC, is seeking to enter a default judgment against the defendant, Ed Ovasapyan, for unpaid rent and related fees. However, the court has found that the plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its claims. Specifically, the plaintiff did not provide individual itemized amounts for the charges, nor did it provide evidence that those charges are part of the lease or an open book account. Additionally, the plaintiff did not provide calculations for prejudgment interest, and it did not verify that the defendant is not in the U.S. military service.

The court has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice, and the plaintiff is given the opportunity to submit an amended request for default judgment using the proper form. The court has also scheduled an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to Obtain Default Judgment for June 17, 2025.
