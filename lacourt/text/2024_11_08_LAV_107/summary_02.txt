Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the Plaintiff's motion for sanctions against Defendant Sami's Auto Body Inc. The Plaintiff had filed a complaint against the Defendant for failing to pay $42,645 for catering services provided. The Defendant had filed a pro per answer, which the Plaintiff argued was filed for an improper purpose. However, the judge found that the Plaintiff did not comply with the safe harbor provision of California Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, which requires a 21-day period before filing a motion for sanctions. Therefore, the judge is denying the motion for sanctions.
