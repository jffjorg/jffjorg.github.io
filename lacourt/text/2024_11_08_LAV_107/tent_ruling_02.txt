I.               
BACKGROUND
On
December 6, 2024, Defendants Saro Dereghishian and Sami’s Auto Body Inc.
(“Defendants”) hired Plaintiff Sason Catering Inc. (“Plaintiff”) to cater an
event. (Complaint ¶ 12.) Defendants and
Plaintiff signed a contract, which required Defendants to pay Plaintiff $42,645
for Plaintiff’s services. (Complaint ¶ 13.) Defendants’ checks bounced. (Complaint ¶¶ 13, 15.) On April 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against
Defendants Saro Dereghishian, Sami’s
Auto Body Inc., and Does 1 through 10, alleging five causes of action.
 
On July 30, 2024, Defendant Saro Dereghishian filed a pro per answer on
behalf of Defendant Sami’s Auto Body Inc. On August 26, 2024, this court held a Case
Management Conference, where this court advised Defendants that “a corporation
may not be represented by an individual in pro per” and Plaintiff made an oral
motion to strike Defendant Sami’s Auto Body Inc.’s answer. (08/26/24 Minute
Order.) This court deferred Plaintiff’s oral motion so Plaintiff could file a
noticed motion. (08/26/24 Minute Order.)
On
August 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to strike Defendant Sami Auto Body
Inc.’s answer (the “Motion”). On October 14, 2024, this court granted
Plaintiff’s motion. (10/14/24 Minute Order p. 3.)
On
September 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for sanctions against Defendant
Sami’s Auto Body Inc. Defendant Sami’s Auto Body Inc. filed no opposition.

LEGAL STANDARD
 
“Every
pleading, petition, written notice of motion, or other similar paper shall be
signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's individual name,
or, if the party is not represented by an attorney, shall be signed by the
party.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
128.7(a).) “By
presenting to the court, whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later
advocating, a pleading, petition, written notice of motion, or other similar
paper, an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the
person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable
under the circumstances . . . 
 
(1)  
It is not being
presented primarily for an improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause
unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.
 
(2)  
The claims, defenses,
and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a
nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing
law or the establishment of new law.
 
(3)  
The allegations and
other factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so
identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable
opportunity for further investigation or discovery.
 
(4)  
The denials of factual
contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified,
are reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.
 
 (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7(b).) 
 
“Code of Civil
Procedure section 128.7 . . . authorizes trial courts to impose sanctions to check abuses
in the filing of pleadings, petitions, written notices of motions or similar
papers.” (Musaelian v. Adams (2009) 45 Cal.4th 512, 514.)
 
“A party seeking
sanctions under section 128.7 follows a two-step procedure. [Citation] First,
the moving party serves notice of the motion for sanctions on the offending
party. [Citation] Service of the motion starts a safe harbor period during
which the motion cannot be filed with the court. [Citation] If the challenged
paper, claim, defense, contention, allegation or denial is not withdrawn or
corrected within a prescribed number of days, the second step is to file or
present the motion for sanctions to the court.” (Primo Hospitality Group,
Inc. v. Haney (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 165, 173-174.) The notice requirements
set forth in section 128.7 are mandatory and “failure to comply with section
128.7’s safe harbor provisions precludes an award of sanctions.” (Martorana
v. Marlin & Saltzman (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 685, 700.) 
 
“If, after notice and a reasonable
opportunity to respond, the court determines that subdivision (b) has been
violated, the court may, subject to the conditions stated below, impose an
appropriate sanction upon the attorneys, law firms, or parties that have
violated subdivision (b) or are responsible for the violation. In determining
what sanctions, if any, should be ordered, the court shall consider whether a
party seeking sanctions has exercised due diligence.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7(c.)
 
II.            
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff argues
Defendant Sami’s Auto Body Inc.’s answer, filed July 30, 2024, was filed for an
improper purpose because Defendant Sami’s Auto Body Inc. filed a declaration in
support of automatic extension on June 20, 2024, that contained false
representations, and ignored Plaintiff’s meet and confer efforts to stipulate
to withdraw Defendant Sami’s Auto Body Inc/s pro per answer. (Motion for
Sanctions p. 7.) 
 
 “[A] party is not entitled to sanctions
pursuant to section 128.7 unless the target of the motion has had a full 21 days to withdraw
the allegedly offending paper, claim, defense, contention, allegation, or
denial.” (Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Structured Asset Sales, LLC (2022) 75
Cal.App.5th 596, 599.)  “[A] moving party
cannot file a motion for sanctions until the 22nd day after the motion was
served.” (Id.) 
 
Plaintiff
submits an exhibit showing Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendant Sami’s Auto
Body Inc. a meet and confer letter requesting a stipulation to withdraw the
answer on July 30, 2024. (Ex. 1.) Plaintiff did not serve Defendant with the
motion for terminating sanctions in that email. (Ex. 1; Javaheri Declaration ¶ 3.) Thus, the July 30,
2024, letter did not start the twenty-one day safe harbor period.
 
Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration states counsel served
Defendant Sami’s Auto Body Inc. with the Safe Harbor Letter and Motion. (Javheri Declaration ¶ 4; Motion for Sanctions p. 9.) The submitted Safe Harbor Letter
is dated September 18, 2024. (Ex. 2; Motion for Sanctions p. 9.) Plaintiff also
filed the motion for terminating sanctions on September 18, 2024.
 
In Martorana
v. Marlin & Saltzman, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at p. 699, a party filed
and served its request for section 128.7 sanctions on the same day, as part of
the demurrer to the complaint. The Court of Appeal reversed the trial court’s
sanctions award, stating the party “failed to satisfy the statutory requirements of section 128.7, subdivision
(c)(1) because it did
not make its request for sanctions separately from other motions and did not
serve its request at least 21 days before filing it with the trial court.” (Id.)
 
Likewise,
here, Plaintiff filed the motion for terminating sanctions with this court the
same day it sent Defendant the safe harbor letter. (Ex. 2.) Under section 128.7,
Plaintiff was not permitted to file the motion for sanctions with this court
until the twenty-second day after serving the motion on Defendant. (Broadcast
Music Inc. v. Structured Asset Sales, LLC, supra, 75 Cal.App.5th at p.
599.) Accordingly, Plaintiff’s failure to comply with section 128.7’s safe
harbor provision precludes awarding sanctions. (See Martorana v. Marlin
& Saltzman, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at p. 700.)
 
III.           
CONCLUSION For the foregoing
reasons, Plaintiff’s motion for
sanctions is denied.
