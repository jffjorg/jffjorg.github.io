  Case Number:  22STCV09201    Hearing Date:   January 15, 2025    Dept:  52 Plaintiff  T-A Fashion (USA), LLC’s Motion for an Order to Tax Costs Plaintiff  T-A Fashion (USA), LLC moves to tax the memorandum of costs after judgment  filed by defendant Megna T Shirt Manufacturing Company, Inc.  Interest             Plaintiff contends defendant  miscalculated the interest accrued.  Defendant’s  memorandum of costs claims $11,952.47 in interest.  That amount is correct for the reasons stated  in defendant’s opposition.   Defendant’s  interest calculation is based on the incorrect principal amount because  defendant omitted the $938.50 in expenses (other than attorney fees) claimed  via memorandum of costs filed on September 26, 2022.   Defendant’s  calculation also starts from the date of the attorney fee award, November 9,  2022, instead of the date of the judgment, September 22, 2022.  “Interest at the rate of ten percent per  annum accrues on the unpaid principal amount of the judgment (§ 685.010),  including the amount of the cost award and attorney fees award (§ 680.300), as  of the date of judgment entry (§ 685.020, subd. (a)).  Therefore, interest ordinarily begins to  accrue on the prejudgment cost and attorney fees portion of the judgment as of  the same time it begins to accrue on all other monetary portions of the  judgment—upon entry of judgment.”  (Lucky  United Properties Investment, Inc. v. Lee (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 125,  137–138.)   Defendant’s  calculation is correct: $56,365 principal x 774 days x (0.1 annual rate / 365  days) = $11,952.47.    Lodestar             Plaintiff also argues defendant’s  postjudgment attorney fees of $5,600 are excessive.  The court finds both the hourly rates and  number of hours in defendant’s lodestar are reasonable. Disposition             Plaintiff T-A Fashion (USA), LLC’s  motion to tax costs is denied.   Defendant Megna T Shirt Manufacturing Company, Inc. shall recover the  $11,952.47 in postjudgment costs claimed in the memorandum of costs after  judgment filed on November 4, 2024.
