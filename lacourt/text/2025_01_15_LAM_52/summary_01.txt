The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to tax costs. The plaintiff, T-A Fashion (USA), LLC, is seeking to reduce the defendant's postjudgment costs, which total $11,952.47. The defendant, Megna T Shirt Manufacturing Company, Inc., has claimed that this amount is correct and has provided a detailed calculation to support its claim. The court has reviewed the calculation and has found it to be correct. The defendant's interest calculation is based on the correct principal amount, which includes the expenses claimed in the memorandum of costs filed on September 26, 2022. The court has also reviewed the defendant's postjudgment attorney fees, which total $5,600, and has found them to be reasonable.

As a result, the court has denied the plaintiff's motion to tax costs and has ordered that the defendant be allowed to recover the postjudgment costs claimed in the memorandum of costs filed on November 4, 2024.
