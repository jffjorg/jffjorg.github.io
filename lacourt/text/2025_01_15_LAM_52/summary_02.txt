Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendant, ABF Freight System, Inc., to compel further discovery responses from the plaintiff, Harold J. Wright. The motion seeks to compel responses to requests for production, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories.

The judge finds that the plaintiff's responses to these requests are inadequate and evasive. The plaintiff's objections to these requests are overruled, and the plaintiff is ordered to serve further verified responses without objections.

The judge also notes that the plaintiff's responses include lengthy, irrelevant copied sections of the complaint, and that the plaintiff must supplement his responses again.

The judge does not award monetary sanctions to the defendant, as the plaintiff acted in good faith and with substantial justification.

The defendant's motion to compel further discovery responses is granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to serve further responses within 30 days.
