Background
 
On October 30, 2023,
Jessica Marrow (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Open Stage Inc. and
Bernard Alimi (collectively “Defendants”) for late payment of wages and waiting
time penalties (Lab. Code, § 203). 
 
On January 29, 2024,
Defendants filed an Answer. 
 
On July 24, 2024,
Defense counsel moved to be relieved as counsel for the Defendants. On August
28, 2024, the court granted Defense counsel’s motion. 
 
Plaintiff now moves to
strike Open Stage Inc.’s Answer as it is a self-represented corporation. 
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Any party, within the time allowed
to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part thereof. (CCP, § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court
may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it deems
proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in
any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (CCP, § 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767,
782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;
probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or
disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
“Where the defect raised by a
motion to strike or by demurrer is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend
is routinely and liberally granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the
defect in question.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004)
120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.) The burden is on the complainant to show the Court
that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Discussion
 
Plaintiff presents
evidence that since August 28, 2024, Defendant Open Stage Inc. has been a
registered California corporation that is unrepresented by counsel. (Hall
Decl., ¶¶ 3, 6, Exs. C, D.) 
 
“[U]nder a long-standing
common law rule of procedure, a corporation, unlike a natural person, cannot
represent itself before courts of record in propria persona, nor can it
represent itself through a corporate officer, director or other employee who is
not an attorney. It must be represented by licensed counsel in proceedings
before courts of record.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon
(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145.) The rationale for this rule is that “a
corporation, as an artificial entity created by law, can only act in its
affairs through its natural person agents and representatives. If the corporate
agent who would likely appear on behalf of the corporation in court
proceedings, e.g., an officer or director, is not an attorney, that person
would be engaged in the unlicensed practice of law.” (Id. at p. 1146.)
For this reason, a corporation cannot file a pleading in propria
persona.¿¿ 
 
When a corporation seeks to appear without the benefit of
counsel in other than small claims cases, it is the duty of the trial court to
advise the representative¿of the corporation of the necessity to be represented
by a licensed lawyer. If no such licensed representative is present, appearing
for the corporation, the court may:¿ 
¿ 
(1) hear a motion for continuance; or¿ 
(2) enter the corporation's default for nonappearance at
trial. 
 
(Van Gundy v. Camelot
Resorts, Inc. (1983) 152 Cal.App.3d Supp. 29, 31–32.) 
¿ 
For the reasons stated
above, Plaintiff’s motion to strike Open Stage Inc.’s Answer is granted. “[I]t
is more appropriate and just to treat a corporation's failure to be represented
by an attorney as a defect that may be corrected, on such terms as are just in
the sound discretion of the court” and for this reason, the court grants the
motion with leave to amend. (CLD Construction, Inc., supra, 120
Cal.App.4th at p. 1149.) “[T]he court retains authority to dismiss an action if
an unrepresented corporation does not obtain counsel within reasonable time. (Id.
at p. 1150.)  
 
The court gives
Defendant Open Stage Inc. 30 days leave to seek representation from licensed
counsel, otherwise, the court will enter default against Defendant Open Stage
Inc. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Strike Open Stage Inc. ’s Answer is granted with leave to amend. 
Defendant
Open Stage Inc. is given 30 days to find licensed counsel.  The court sets the OSC 
RE: Answer or Default for
January 30, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. Plaintiff to give
notice.
