And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the Motion to Enforce Settlement is granted. The Settlement Agreement, reached on May 19, 2024, requires Plaintiffs Bryan Tamoria-Bowen and Luzmila Villalobos to file a Request for Dismissal of the Complaint within three business days of full execution of the agreement. However, Defendant PR2020, LLC claims that Plaintiffs' counsel failed to file the Request for Dismissal, despite multiple reminders. The judge finds that enforcement of the settlement is warranted under Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6 and grants the motion.

The judge orders the SAC to be dismissed with prejudice as to Plaintiffs Bryan Tamoria-Bowen and Luzmila Villalobos. Defendant PR2020, LLC is ordered to give notice to the parties. The judge also awards Defendant $2,535.00 in attorneys' fees for preparing the motion and attending the hearing on the motion.
