(Schultz Decl. ¶ 2.) Defendant served responses to Plaintiff’s RFAs on June 13,  2023. (Id., ¶ 3.)             Finding these responses deficient,  Plaintiff filed a Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses, without  Objections, to RFAs on September 8, 2023. On June 12, 2024, this Court granted  Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses and ordered Defendant to provide  further responses within thirty days. (Minute Order, 6/12/2024.) By mutual  agreement of the parties, the parties’ deadline to serve compliant responses to  each party’s outstanding discovery was extended to August 15, 2024. (Schultz  Decl., ¶ 5; Khachatryan Decl., ¶ 3.)             On August 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed  the instant motion to deem RFAs admitted.             On September 30, 2024, Defendant  filed an opposition.             On __________, 2024, Plaintiff filed  a reply.   DISCUSSION Applicable  Law             A party to whom a request for  admissions has been made must respond within 30 days of service of the request  absent a court order to the contrary. (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2033.250(a).) “On  receipt of a response to a party’s request for admission, the party requesting  admissions may move for an order compelling further response if that party  deems that either or both of the following apply: (1) [a]n answer to a  particular request is evasive or incomplete[,] [or] (2) [a]n objection to a  particular request is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2033.290(a).)  “If a party then fails to obey an order compelling further response to requests  for admission, the court may order that the matters involved in the requests be  deemed admitted. In lieu of, or in addition to, this order, the court may  impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 ….” (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2033.290(e).) According to well-established case law,  there are two factual prerequisites to the imposition of non-monetary sanctions  for violation of court ordered discovery, including an order deeming requests  for admissions admitted: (1) a failure to comply with a court order, and (2)  such failure must be willful. (See Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004)  124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v.  LcL Administrators, Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1102, citing Vallbona  v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545; Deyo v. Kilbourne  (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 787-88 (“Lack of diligence may be deemed willful in  the sense that the party understood his obligation, had the ability to comply,  and failed to comply. [Citation.] … A conscious or intentional failure to act,  as distinguished from accidental or involuntary non-compliance, is sufficient  to invoke a penalty.”) (internal citations omitted).)  Further, “[e]ven where nonmonetary  sanctions are called for, they should be appropriate to the dereliction…. The  sanctions the court may impose are such as are suitable and necessary to enable  the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks,  but the court may not impose sanctions which are designed not to accomplish the  objects of discovery but to impose punishment.” (Biles, supra, at 1327  (cleaned up) (internal citations and quotations omitted); see also Do  it Urself Moving & Storage, Inc. v. Brown, Leifer, Slatkin & Berns (1992)  7 Cal.App.4th 27, 35, superseded by statute on another ground as stated in Union  Bank v. Sup. Ct. (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 582-83; St. Mary v. Superior  Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 783-84.) The St. Mary Court forcefully  explained the trial court’s duty in determining whether to impose non-monetary  sanctions for lack of compliance with a Court order as follows: “The  RFA device is not intended to provide a windfall to litigants. Nor is the RFA  procedure a ‘gotcha’ device in which an overly aggressive propounding party—who  rejects facially reasonable requests for a short discovery extension and  thereafter files [a] discovery motion after service of a slightly tardy  proposed RFA response that is substantially code-compliant—may obtain a  substantive victory in the case by having material issues deemed admitted. RFAs  are not to be deemed admitted unless the party to whom RFAs are propounded … is  recalcitrant and violates a court order compelling further responses that are  deficient.”  (Id.  at 783-84; see also Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 979 (in  fashioning remedies for violations of discovery requests, courts should seek to  “eliminate[] … undeserved windfalls and the resulting subversion of the policy  favoring the resolution of lawsuits on the merits.”))   Application  to Facts             Plaintiff contends that Defendant’s  failure to provide timely and complete responses to Plaintiff’s RFAs is in  direct contravention of this Court’s prior order and warrants the Court deeming  Plaintiff’s RFAs admitted as to Defendant. Plaintiff cites to legal authority  to support the proposition that failure to strictly comply with a Court’s order  to comply with discovery obligations warrants the imposition of non-monetary  sanctions, including deeming RFAs admitted, to preserve the integrity of the  judicial process. (See Mot., p. 4:24-5:20.) However, Plaintiff improperly cites  to numerous legal authority that either does not exist, or does not support the  proposition he contends.  For example, Plaintiff cites to Wilcox  v. Birtwhistle. (Supra, 21 Cal.4th 973.) Although the California Supreme Court recognized the feature of the discovery process Plaintiff cites, (Id.  at 982) the primary crux of the Wilcox Court’s holding is that the  primary scope of the Court’s holding was that Code of Civil Procedure §  2033(m), as it was then enacted, not only permitted a party to seek withdrawal  of admissions contained in an actual response, but also an admission deemed  admitted based on a failure to respond. (Id. at 979.) Further, as  discussed above, the Court’s reasoning centers around avoiding gamesmanship and  windfalls in the discovery process. (Id. at 983.) The rest of the cases  Plaintiff cites are either more fully clarified in the legal standard section,  above, or do not exist. (See Mot., p. 5:12-15.) Here, the Court agrees with Defendant’s  argument that deeming Plaintiff’s RFAs admitted is not warranted based on the  trial court’s duty to limit the discretionary imposition of discovery sanctions  only to remediate actual harm suffered by the propounding party. (See Kahn  v. Kahn (1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 372, 381; see also Doppes v. Bentley  Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992 (trial courts should “attempt  to tailor the sanction to the harm caused by the withheld discovery.”)) The facts in evidence that Defendant  alleges are sufficient to warrant the finding that Defendant diligently, and in  good faith, attempted to comply with the Court’s order, and did not violate the  Court’s order voluntarily. (See Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at 787-88.)  First, Defendant establishes that on August 15, 2024, Defendant attempted to  call Plaintiff and advise him that he had been unable to work due to a family  emergency related to his grandfather’s health. (Khachatryan Decl., ¶ 4.)  Further, although Plaintiff was not available on the 15th, the Parties agreed  to a meet and confer call on August 19, 2024, where Defendant would have  supplied Plaintiff with fully compliant responses. (Id., ¶ 7.) However,  instead, Plaintiff submitted the instant motion prior to business hours on  August 19, 2024 and rejected Defendant’s calls. (Id., ¶¶ 8, 10, 11.)  Within the same day, Defendant served on Plaintiff his fully verified and code  compliant discovery responses, without any objections. (Id., ¶ 10.) The  facts evidenced by Defendant’s declaration, with penalty of perjury, establish  that Defendant diligently and in good faith attempted to provide Plaintiff with  compliant responses, despite substantial emotional distress caused by a family  health emergency. (See Khachatryan Decl., ¶¶ 4, 5, 8, 10.) And, despite  Plaintiff’s assumed knowledge of these facts, or blatant attempts to disregard  such facts, Plaintiff instead chose to attempt to game the mutual discovery  process in hopes of acquiring a windfall that he would not have otherwise  received. (See St. Mary, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 783-84; Wilcox,  supra, 21 Cal.4th at p. 983; Wilson v. Jefferson (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d  952, 958 (The discretionary imposition of a sanction “should not operate in  such a fashion as to put the prevailing party in a better position than he  would have had if he had obtained the discovery sought and it had been  completely favorable to his cause.”) (internal citations and quotations  omitted).)   Accordingly, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s  Motion to Deem Requests for Admissions Admitted. CONCLUSION             Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Requests  for Admissions Granted is DENIED.             Plaintiff to give notice.            If counsel do not submit on the  tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than  in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.____________________________________________________________________________________________________________Tentative Ruling

DISCUSSION

Applicable
Law

            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
§ 2023.030(b), “[t]he court may impose an issue sanction ordering that
designated facts shall be taken as established in the action in accordance with
the claim of the party adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery
process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by an order prohibiting
any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from supporting or
opposing designated claims or defenses.” “Misuses of the discovery process
include, but are not limited to, the following: … (g) [d]isobeying a court
order to provide discovery.”

            When a party violates a court’s
“order … concern[ing] discovery, the trial court may impose sanctions that
“‘are suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to
obtain the objects of the discovery he or she seeks but the court may not
impose sanctions which are designed not to accomplish the objects of the
discovery but to impose punishment’ (Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203
Cal.App.3d 57, 64, 249 Cal.Rptr. 708, quoting Petersen v. City of Vallejo (1968)
259 Cal.App.2d 757, 782, 66 Cal.Rptr. 776, italics added.)” (Rail Services
of America v. State Comp. Ins. Fund (2003) 110.Cal.App.4th 323, 331-32
(cleaned up); see also Welgoss v. End (1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 982, 992.) 

“The rule that a [discovery] sanction
order cannot go further than is necessary to accomplish the purpose of
discovery is some 35 years old in California, and is rooted in constitutional
due process.” (Newland v. Sup. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613,
citing Caryl Richard, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (1961) 188 Cal.App.2d 300; see
also Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992,
quoting Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d
481, 488, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutcheon (1997) 16
Cal.4th 469, 478, fn. 4, (“Sanctions should be appropriate to the dereliction,
and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the
party entitled to but denied discovery.”); Lopez v. Watchtower Bible &
Tract Society of new York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604) (cleaned
up) (Heightened sanctions “should generally not be imposed until the court has
attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the
record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective [Citation.].”)
(internal citations omitted).)

            Courts generally recognize two
factual prerequisites to the imposition of non-monetary sanctions for violation
of court ordered discovery, including issue or evidence sanctions: (1) a
failure to comply with a court order, and (2) such failure must be willful.
(See R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th
486, 496; Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315,
1327;
Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. LcL Administrators, Inc. (2008) 163
Cal.App.4th 1093, 1102, citing Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43
Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545; Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771,
787-88 (“Lack of diligence may be deemed willful in the sense that the party
understood his obligation, had the ability to comply, and failed to comply.
[Citation.] … A conscious or intentional failure to act, as distinguished from
accidental or involuntary non-compliance, is sufficient to invoke a penalty.”)
(internal citations omitted).)

            Further,
“[e]ven
where nonmonetary sanctions are called for, they should be appropriate to the
dereliction…. The sanctions the court may impose are such as are suitable and
necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the
discovery he seeks, but the court may not impose sanctions which are designed
not to accomplish the objects of discovery but to impose punishment.” (Biles,
supra, at 1327 (cleaned up) (internal citations and quotations omitted); see
also Do
it Urself Moving & Storage, Inc. v. Brown, Leifer, Slatkin & Berns (1992)
7 Cal.App.4th 27, 35, superseded by statute on another ground as stated in Union
Bank v. Sup. Ct. (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 582-83; St. Mary v. Superior
Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 783-84.)

The St. Mary Court forcefully
explained the trial court’s duty in determining whether to impose non-monetary
sanctions for lack of compliance with a Court order as follows:

“The
RFA device is not intended to provide a windfall to litigants. Nor is the RFA
procedure a ‘gotcha’ device in which an overly aggressive propounding party—who
rejects facially reasonable requests for a short discovery extension and
thereafter files [a] discovery motion after service of a slightly tardy
proposed RFA response that is substantially code-compliant—may obtain a
substantive victory in the case by having material issues deemed admitted. RFAs
are not to be deemed admitted unless the party to whom RFAs are propounded … is
recalcitrant and violates a court order compelling further responses that are
deficient.” 

(Id.
at 783-84; see also Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 979 (in
fashioning remedies for violations of discovery requests, courts should seek to
“eliminate[] … undeserved windfalls and the resulting subversion of the policy
favoring the resolution of lawsuits on the merits.”))

 

 

Application
to Facts

            Here, Plaintiff contends that
Defendant has willfully failed to comply with this Court’s discovery order to
provide further responses to Plaintiff’s RFPDs, and that such non-compliance necessitates
the imposition of issue sanctions. Plaintiff contends that Defendant’s
non-compliance has prejudiced Plaintiff’s ability to prepare for trial because
the information sought in the RFPDs directly pertains to material issues in
Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint, specifically those outlined in Paragraphs
12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, and 33. Plaintiff cites to legal authority to
support his proposition “that when a party’s misconduct obstructs the discovery
process and harms the opposing party’s case, issue sanctions are not only
appropriate but necessary to ensure a fair trial.” (Mot., p. 7:8-10.) However,
the legal authority Plaintiff cites to either does not exist, or does not
support the proposition in the manner he contends.

For example, Plaintiff cites to Wilcox
v. Birtwhistle. (Supra, 21 Cal.4th 973.) In Wilcox, the California
Supreme Court recognized that, once a party has failed to respond to a
discovery request “before the hearing on the motion … [t]he nonresponding party
also faces the likely imposition of more sanctions at the discretion of the
trial court.” (Id. at 982.) However, this was merely a sidenote to the
Court’s primary holding that the primary scope of the Court’s holding was that
Code of Civil Procedure § 2033(m), as it was then enacted, not only permitted a
party to seek withdrawal of admissions contained in an actual response, but
also an admission deemed admitted based on a failure to respond. (Id. at
979.) Further, as discussed above, the Court’s reasoning centers around
avoiding gamesmanship and windfalls in the discovery process. (Id. at
983.)

Although Collisson & Kaplan v.
Hartunian, (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, deals with the imposition of
non-monetary sanctions, it did not deal with the imposition of issue sanctions,
as Plaintiff improperly contends. (Mot. p. 6:20-25.) In Collisson, the
Court held that a trial court did not abuse its discretion in issuing
terminating sanctions because of “defendants’ persistent refusal to share with
plaintiff the facts underlying their denial of liability and their purported
affirmative defendants.” (Id. at 1619.) These facts are entirely
distinguishable from those available to the Court, here. The rest of the cases
Plaintiff cites are either more fully clarified in the legal standard section,
above, or do not exist. (See Mot., p. 6:9-19; 6:25-7:3.)

The facts in evidence that Defendant
alleges are sufficient to warrant the finding that Defendant diligently, and in
good faith, attempted to comply with both the Court’s order and Plaintiff’s
discovery requests. (See Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at 787-88.) First,
Defendant establishes, through counsel’s verified declaration under penalty of
perjury, the expenditure of substantial time and resources to fully comply with
Plaintiff’s requests. (See Khachatryan Decl., ¶¶ 2-5.) Defendant properly
establishes the complexity of properly and responding to Plaintiff’s requests,
pursuant to its obligation to reasonably investigate and furnish any
information sought that is under its control. (Regency Health Services, Inc.
v. Sup. Ct. of Los Angeles Cnty. (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1496, 1504.)

Further, the additional facts in
Defendant’s counsel’s declaration establish that there is no evidence
Defendant willfully or intentionally violated the Court’s order. As established
by Defendant’s counsel’s verified statement, on August 15, 2024, Defendant
attempted to call Plaintiff and advise him that he had been unable to work due
to a family emergency related to his grandfather’s health. (Khachatryan Decl.,
¶ 6.) Further, although Plaintiff was not available on the 15th, the Parties
agreed to a meet and confer call on August 19, 2024. (Id., ¶ 8.) Although
Defendant’s counsel was prepared to meet and confer, Plaintiff did not respond
to Defendant’s calls on August 19, 2024. (Id., ¶ 10.) Plaintiff’s
refusal to meet and confer is even more troublesome, given Defendant’s
counsel’s ongoing family emergency, and his good faith attempts to informally
resolve any outstanding disputes. (Id. ¶¶ 9, 13.) On August 27, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the instant motion. On September 26, 2024, Defendant’s counsel
served all responsive information to comply with the Court’s order, including
over 40,000 individual emails, totaling over 100,000 pages of documents. (Id.
¶¶ 4, 13.)

The
facts evidenced by Defendant’s declaration, with penalty of perjury, establish
that Defendant diligently and in good faith attempted to provide Plaintiff with
compliant responses, despite substantial emotional distress caused by a family
health emergency. (See Khachatryan Decl., ¶¶ 2-5, 7, 9-10.) And, despite
Plaintiff’s assumed knowledge of these facts, or blatant attempts to disregard
such facts, Plaintiff instead chose to attempt to game the mutual discovery
process in hopes of acquiring a windfall that he would not have otherwise
received. (See St. Mary, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 783-84; Wilcox,
supra, 21 Cal.4th at p. 983; Wilson v. Jefferson (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d
952, 958 (The discretionary imposition of a sanction “should not operate in
such a fashion as to put the prevailing party in a better position than he
would have had if he had obtained the discovery sought and it had been
completely favorable to his cause.”) (internal citations and quotations
omitted).)

Accordingly,
the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion for Issue Sanctions in its entirety,
including Plaintiff’s requests for alternative relief.

            

CONCLUSION

            Plaintiff’s Motion for Issue
Sanctions is DENIED.

            Plaintiff to give notice.

            If counsel do not submit on the
tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than
in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
