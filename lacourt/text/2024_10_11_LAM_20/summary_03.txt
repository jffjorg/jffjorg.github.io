And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Motion to Strike filed by Defendant Alissa DeVogel, which seeks to strike certain allegations from the Second Amended Complaint. The Court finds that the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint are not in conformity with the Court's order sustaining the demurrers with leave to amend, and therefore, the Court has granted the motion without leave to amend. The Second Amended Complaint is dismissed with prejudice as to Defendant DeVogel. The Court also notes that Plaintiff has failed to file a Third Amended Complaint despite being granted leave to do so, and therefore, the dismissal with prejudice is warranted in this instance.
