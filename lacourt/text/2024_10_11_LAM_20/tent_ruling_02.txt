The FAC alleges Plaintiffs all had commercial leases for office spaces located in the building at 22015-22019 Vanowen St., Canoga Park, CA 91303 (“Property”), which Defendant acquired ownership of in or about 2020 and served 60-day notice of termination under Section 6.2(g) of the Leases on Plaintiffs regarding aa Hazardous Substance Condition. (FAC ¶¶13-29.) Plaintiffs allege Defendant knew about the Hazardous Substance Condition prior to taking ownership of the Property and such conditions existed prior to Plaintiffs entrance into their Leases, thus Defendant’s right to terminate under the Leases are not applicable to Plaintiffs. (Id. at ¶¶30-32.)            On February 6, 2023, Defendant filed a Demurrer to FAC. The Court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend on May 1, 2023.            On May 2, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) adding a cause of action for breach of Contract and removing the cause of action for declaratory relief.            On June 20, 2023, Defendant filed an Answer and Cross-Complaint against Keang Krouch dba Royal Donuts, Tieng Uch dba Royal Donuts, Abdul Azin Salvoory, Abdul Saboory, Omar Mangal, Zehour Dourghalli dba Liquor Land, Emad Sukkar dba Liquor Land, Bryan Tamoria-Bowen dba Farmers Insurance Agency, Luzmila Villalobos dba Farmers Insurance Company, Jeffrey Alan Marduce, Robert Gooch dba Gooch Training Academy, Jeremy Warburton dba Gooch Training Academy (“Cross-Defendants”) and ROES 1 to 20 for six causes of action for Breach of Lease.            On August 17, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a General Denial to Cross-Complaint.            On December 1, 2023, Defendant filed a Motion for Sanctions related to Plaintiff Krouch’s failure to participate in discovery and comply with the Court’s discovery orders. The Court granted the motion and entered a terminating sanctions against Plaintiff Krouch by striking his SAC, his Answer to Cross-Complaint, and entering default.            On January 10, 20204, default was entered against Cross-Defendant Zehour Dourghalli.            On May 3, 2024, Cross-Defendant Emad Sukkar was dismissed from the Cross-Complaint.            ON MAY 10, 2024, Defendant filed a Motion for Sanctions related to Plaintiff Robert Gooch’s failure to participate in discovery and comply with the Court’s discovery orders. The Court granted the motion and entered a terminating sanctions against Plaintiff Gooch by striking his SAC, his Answer to Cross-Complaint, and entering default.            On August 12, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Enforce Settlement. The motion is unopposed. DISCUSSIONApplicable Law            Pursuant the Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”¿¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6 (emphasis added).)“Because of its summary nature, strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement agreement.” (Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37;Critzer v. Enos (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1262.) In ruling on a motion under Section 664.6, the trial judge may receive oral testimony, or may determine the motion upon declarations alone. (Corkland v. Boscoe (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 989, 994.) Where the agreement was reached at a court hearing, the court can resolve the dispute on the basis of its own notes or recollection of what was agreed to (as well as any transcripts of the proceedings). (Richardson v. Richardson (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 91, 97.)¿¿Generally, courts lose subject matter jurisdiction when an action is voluntarily dismissed. (Hagan Engineering, Inc. v. Mills (2003) 115 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1009.) Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6 provides the authority for the Court the retention of personal jurisdiction to enforce the settlement “if requested by the parties.” The stipulation as to jurisdiction must conform to the same requirements necessary for enforcement of the settlement agreement. (Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 440.) It is not enough simply to provide for a retention of jurisdiction in the settlement agreement. (Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913, 918.) Instead, the request to retain jurisdiction must be filed with the court: “the parties could have easily invoked section 664.6 by filing a stipulation and proposed order either attaching a copy of the settlement agreement and requesting that the trial court retain jurisdiction under section 664.6 or a stipulation and proposed order signed by the parties noting the settlement and requesting that the trial court retain jurisdiction under section 664.6. The process need not be complex. But strict compliance demands that the process be followed.” (Ibid.; see Sayta v. Chu (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 960, 966-968 [no subject matter jurisdiction to enforce settlement per CCP § 664.6 because parties failed to ask court to retain jurisdiction before case dismissed].)¿¿ Application to Facts            Defendant PR2020, LLC (hereinafter “Defendant”) moves for an order enforcing a Settlement Agreement reached between Defendant, Plaintiff Bowen, and Plaintiff Villalobos on May 19, 2024. (Zakariaie Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.) Section 20 of the Settlement Agreement expressly retained the Court’s jurisdiction to enforce it pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6. (Id. at ¶4.)            Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Paragraph 1 states “In exchange for the Parties entering into this Agreement, the Parties agree that within three (3) business days of full execution of this Agreement, BOWEN/VILLALOBOS and Defendant shall cause the filing of a Request for Dismissal, with prejudice, in the Action, wherein BOWEN/VILLALOBOS dismisses their Operative Complaint against Defendant and Defendant dismisses the Cross-Complaint against BOWEN/VILLALOBOS. Plaintiffs shall cause a conformed copy of the dismissal to be delivered to Defendant's counsel within five (5) business days after the full execution of this Agreement.” (Id. at ¶5.) Defendant contends Plaintiffs Bowen and Villalobos breached the Settlement Agreement because their counsel of record failed to file the Request for Dismissal. In fact, Defendant asserts its counsel sent the fully executed Agreement to Plaintiffs Bowen and Villalobos’ counsel Drew Sherman on May 30, 2024, and expressly stated for him to file the Request for Dismissal within 3 business days as required by the Settlement Agreement and then Defense counsel would file his Request for Dismissal as to the Cross-Complaint. (Zakariaie Decl., ¶6, Ex. B.) Mr. Zakariaie sent a follow-up email to Mr. Sherman on June 7, 2024 and June 10, 2024, reminding him of the obligation to file a Request for Dismissal of the Complaint to avoid the present motion. (Id. at ¶¶7-8.) Mr. Sherman informed Mr. Zakariaie he had a minor heart attack and needed more time to file the dismissal. Mr. Zakariaie sent another email on July 1, 2024 regarding the status of the dismissal and received no response. (Id. at ¶9.)            The Court finds that enforcement is warranted under Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6. First, each of the parties subject to the Settlement Agreement signed it. (Id. at ¶3.) Next, there is no indication from the court records that a Request for Dismissal of the Complaint as to Plaintiffs Bowen and Villalobos has been filed in this action. Likewise, Plaintiffs Bowen and Villalobos have not filed an opposition to the instant motion indicating otherwise or attesting to any circumstances giving rise to their inability to effectuate such dismissal as required by the Settlement Agreement. Moreover, Mr. Sherman appears to have filed a Motion to be Relieved as Counsel set for hearing on October 14, 2024, however it is not in regards to being counsel for Plaintiffs Bowen and Villalobos.In the event of breach, Defendant asserts Section 19 of the Settlement Agreement provides for the recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees by the prevailing party in any proceeding brought to enforce the Settlement Agreement. (Zakariaie Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.) As such, Defendant requests $3,525,00 in attorneys’ fees for preparing the instant motion, reviewing the opposition, preparing the reply and attending the hearing on the motion to be paid by Plaintiffs Bowen and Villalobos. (Id. at ¶11-12.) The Court will reduce the reasonable attorneys’ fees awarded due to the motion being unopposed. Thus, Defendant will only be awarded 5.0 hours for preparing the motion and attending the hearing on the motion at an hourly rate of $495.00 plus filing fee of $60.00 for a total of $2,535.00.                      CONCLUSION            The Motion to Enforce Settlement is GRANTED. The SAC is dismissed with prejudice as to Plaintiffs Bryan Tamoria-Bowen and Luzmila Villalobos.            Defendant PR2020, LLC to give notice.            If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear in person.
