And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to deem requests for admissions admitted. The plaintiff had requested that the court deem its requests for admissions admitted because the defendant had failed to provide timely and complete responses to the requests. However, the court found that the defendant had diligently and in good faith attempted to comply with the court's order, but was unable to do so due to a family emergency. The court also found that the plaintiff had refused to meet and confer to resolve outstanding disputes, and that the plaintiff's attempts to game the mutual discovery process were improper. As a result, the court denied the plaintiff's motion and ordered that the parties continue to engage in discovery.
