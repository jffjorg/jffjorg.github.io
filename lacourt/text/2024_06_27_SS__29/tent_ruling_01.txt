  Case Number:  20STCV49195    Hearing Date:   June 27, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Seal filed
by Plaintiff Lynn Steinberg.
Tentative
The motion is granted in part and denied in
part.
Background
On December 24, 2020, Plaintiff Lynn Steinberg (“Plaintiff”) filed
a complaint for negligence against Defendants Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber”),
Chris Hwang (“Hwang”), and Does 1 through 10, arising from an accident that
occurred on January 31, 2019.  Hwang filed his answer on December 21,
2021.  Uber filed its answer on January 4, 2022.
On September 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement of
entire case.  The Court set an OSC re Dismissal for December 11,
2023.
On November 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to seal certain of
her medical records.  The motion was set for hearing on March 6,
2024.
In the interim, the OSC re Dismissal came before the Court on
December 11.  Plaintiff did not appear.  The Court issued
an order dismissing the entire case without prejudice.  This had the
effect of vacating the hearing date on Plaintiff’s motion to seal.
On May 24, 2024, The Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to set aside
the dismissal for the limited purpose of allowing her motion to seal to be
heard.  
On May 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion
to seal her medical records of Plaintiff. 
Legal Standard
“[T]he First Amendment provides a right
of [public] access to ordinary civil trials and proceedings.”  (NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Super.
Ct. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1212.) “[C]onstitutional standards governing
closure of trial proceedings apply in the civil setting.”  (Ibid.)  Those standards are embodied in California
Rules of Court, rules 2.550 and 2.551.
“Unless confidentiality is required by
law, court records are presumed to be open.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(c). 
“A record must not be filed under seal without a court order.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(a).)  “The court must not permit a record to be
filed under seal based solely on the agreement or stipulation of the
parties.”  (Ibid.)
California Rules of Court, rule
2.550(d) sets forth the basic standard for an order permitting the filing of
documents under seal:
“The court may order that a record be
filed under seal only if it expressly finds facts that establish:  
(1) There exists an overriding interest
that overcomes the right of public access to the record;  
(2) The overriding interest supports
sealing the record;  
(3) A substantial probability exists
that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not
sealed;  
(4) The proposed sealing is narrowly
tailored; and  
(5) No less restrictive means exist to
achieve the overriding interest.”   
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d).)  
“An order sealing the record must: (A)
Specifically state the facts that support the findings; and (B) Direct the
sealing of only those documents and pages, or, if reasonably practicable,
portions of those documents and pages, that contain the material that needs to
be placed under seal.  All other portions
of each document or page must be included in the public file.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(e)(1).
A motion or application to file under
seal must be accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration containing facts
sufficient to justify the sealing. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.551(b)(1).)  “A request to seal a document must be filed publicly and
separately from the object of the request.  It must be supported by a
factual declaration or affidavit explaining the particular needs of the case.”
(In re Marriage of Lechowick (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1406, 1416.) “[A]t a
minimum that the party seeking to seal documents, or maintain them under seal,
must come forward with a specific enumeration of the facts sought to be
withheld and specific reasons for withholding them.”  (H.B. Fuller Co.
v. Doe (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 879, 894.) 
Discussion
Plaintiff
requests that her medical records and information about her medical condition be
sealed.  Plaintiff has a substantial
privacy interest in these materials.  California’s Constitutional right to privacy
protects against the unwarranted disclosure of various private or sensitive
information regarding one’s personal life, including private medical
information.¿ (Britt v. Super. Ct. (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 855-856; see
also, e.g., Civ. Code § 56.)¿¿In addition, Plaintiff is a high profile marriage, family, and child therapist
who often appears as an expert witness in cases, specifically those which involve
the treatment of adults abused as children, sexual abuse, false accusation of
sexual abuse, and parental alienation in children’s family, civil, and criminal
courts. (Chaisson Decl., ¶¶ 2, 6.)  Public
information about Plaintiff’s medical information could be misused in these
matters and deter her from being able to carry out her professional
duties.  (Id., ¶ 9.)  Moreover, any limited legitimate public
interest in this information is even more attenuated, as the parties have
resolved all of Plaintiff’s claims through a private settlement.  (Id., ¶ 5.)

following documents be sealed:
(1) (1)Motion to Continue Trial filed March
18, 2022, Uber’s memorandum of points and authorities;

Items Nos. 1-18
The Court has reviewed each of the proposed
redactions in these 18 documents.  In
each instance, the redacted material relates to Plaintiff’s personal medical records
and information.  The Court finds that Plaintiff
has an overriding interest in maintaining the privacy of her medical
information that overcomes the right of public access to the records.  The Court finds that Plaintiff’s privacy
interest supports sealing of the records. 
The Court finds that there is a substantial probability that Plaintiff’s
privacy interest will be prejudiced if these records are not sealed.  The Court finds that the proposed redactions
are narrowly tailored and will result in the sealing only of the private
medical information of the Plaintiff, and not other information.  And the Court finds that no less restrictive
means exist to achieve the interest in maintaining the privacy of Plaintiff’s
medical information.
Accordingly, this portion of the motion to
seal is GRANTED as to Items Nos. 1-18, SUBJECT TO the following CONDITION:
Plaintiff submitted the redacted versions of
the 18 documents in one large electronic file. 
In order to effect the sealing order, Plaintiff must resubmit the redacted
versions as 18 separate documents.  This
may be done electronically, or the hard copies may be delivered to Department
29 of the Spring Street Courthouse.  The
order will not be effected until after the Court has received the redacted
versions as 18 separate documents.
Item No. 19
Plaintiff seeks to seal all court rulings in
this matter, apparently in their entirety. 
(No redacted versions have been received.)  This portion of the motion to seal is DENIED.  Plaintiff has not made a sufficient showing
to support the findings necessary to grant this aspect of the motion to seal.
Item No. 20
Plaintiff seeks to seal all filings
pertaining to this motion to seal, apparently in their entirety.  (No redacted versions have been
received.)  This portion of the motion to
seal is DENIED.  Plaintiff has not made a
sufficient showing to support the findings necessary to grant this aspect of
the motion to seal.  As a general matter,
a motion to seal is filed as a public document and is available to the public
for inspection.  (See
Marriage of Lechowick, supra, 65 Cal.App.4th at p. 1416.)
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS
the motion to seal as to Items Nos. 1-18, SUBJECT TO THE CONDITION THAT Plaintiff
resubmit the redacted/public versions of the documents as 18 separate documents.
The Court DENIES the motion to seal as to
Items Nos. 19 and 20.
The Court SETS a non-appearance case review
for July ____, 2024, regarding submission of the redacted/public versions of
