And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by the Judge on a motion to continue trial filed by Defendant Deanna Newton. The motion is DENIED. The Judge finds that the defendant has not shown good cause for the requested 90-day continuance, as there is no evidence of diligent efforts to obtain necessary discovery. The defendant appeared in the case in May 2023, and the current trial date was set in August 2023, with no evidence that the defendant took action to schedule independent medical examinations until the middle of May 2024. The Judge also notes that the plaintiffs recently requested a 10-day continuance to provide supplemental discovery responses, but this is not good cause for a 90-day continuance.
