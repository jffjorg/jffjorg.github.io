Summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to seal certain medical records and information of Plaintiff Lynn Steinberg, but denies the motion to seal all court rulings and filings pertaining to the case. The court finds that Plaintiff has an overriding interest in maintaining the privacy of her medical information, which outweighs the right of public access to the records. The court also finds that the proposed redactions are narrowly tailored and will result in the sealing only of the private medical information of the Plaintiff.
