Motion for Determination of Good Faith Settlement filed by
Defendant Tacos El Unico, Inc.
 
Tentative
The
motion is denied without prejudice.
Background 
On May 26, 2020, Plaintiff
Renee Agnew (“Plaintiff”) filed the complaint in this action against Defendants
Jensen Enterprises, Inc., Jensen Precast, and Does 1 through 50, asserting
causes of action for premises liability and negligence arising out of injuries
Plaintiff allegedly sustained after tripping and falling on June 6, 2018, on
Defendants’ premises at or near 1375 West Adams in Los Angeles.
On January 3, 2022, Jensen
Enterprises, Inc. dba Jensen Precast (erroneously sued as separate entities)
(“Jensen”) filed an answer to the complaint.
On various dates running
from May 2022 through March 2024, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name Little
Shell LLC as Doe 1; Victor Sanchez as Doe 2; Manuel Sanchez as Doe 3; Baskin-Robbins
Franchising LLC as Doe 4; Metamoros LLC as Doe 5; L.A. Grease Solutions, Inc.
as Doe 6; Dolce BG, Inc. dba Baskin Robbins (“Dolce”) as Doe 7; and Tacos El
Unico, Inc. as Doe 8.
On various dates running
from January through May 2023, Manuel Sanchez, Victor Sanchez, Matamoros LLC
(erroneously sued as Metamoros LLC), and Baskin-Robbins Franchising LLC filed
answers to the complaint.
On November 7, 2023, the
Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”).  Plaintiff did not file the FAC
until March 6, 2024, but Jensen nonetheless filed an answer to the FAC on
December 15, 2023.  On March 11, 2024,
Dolce filed an answer to the FAC.
On February 9, 2024, Manuel
Sanchez, Victor Sanchez, and Matamoros LLC filed a cross-complaint against Tacos
El Unico, Inc. and L.A. Grease Solutions, Inc.  On March 8, 2024, Tacos El Unico was dismissed
from the cross-complaint.  On April 8,
2024, a First Amended Cross-Complaint was filed.
Plaintiff filed requests to
dismiss Baskin-Robbins Franchising LLC (Doe 4) and Jensen in February and April
2024.
On June 13, 2024, Tacos El
Unico filed a cross-complaint against Jensen, Manuel Sanchez, Victor Sanches,
and Matamoros, LLC.  On September 19,
2024, Tacos El Unico filed a request to dismiss the causes of action in its
cross-complaint against Jensen.
Relating to the matter set
for hearing on November 19, 2024, Tacos El Unico reached a settlement agreement
with Plaintiff.  (Tafarella Decl., ¶
5.).  Tacos El Unico filed a motion for a
determination of good faith settlement on October 21, 2024.
LA Grease Solutions filed an
opposition to the motion on November 7. 
Tacos El Unico filed a reply on November 12.
Legal
Standard
In a case involving two or more alleged
joint tortfeasors, a party may seek a court order under Code of Civil Procedure
section 877.6 determining that a settlement between the plaintiff and one or
more of the alleged tortfeasors is in good faith. A judicial determination of
good faith “bar[s] any other joint tortfeasor … from any further claims against
the settling tortfeasor … for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or
comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 877.6(c).)
In evaluating whether a settlement has been
made in good faith, courts consider the following factors, as set forth by the
California Supreme Court in the landmark case Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d
488: 
               1) “a rough approximation of
plaintiffs’ total recovery”;
               2) “the settlor’s proportionate
liability”;
               3)
“the amount paid in settlement”;
     
        4) “the allocation of the
settlement proceeds among plaintiffs”;
5)
“a recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than he would if he
were found liable after a trial”;
               6) the settling party's “financial
conditions and insurance policy limits”;
7)
any evidence of “collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the
interests of nonsettling defendants.”
(Id. at 499.) “Practical
considerations obviously require that the evaluation be made on the basis of
information available at the time of settlement.” (Ibid.)
The “good faith” concept in Code of Civil
Procedure section 877.6 is a flexible principle imposing on reviewing courts
the obligation to guard against the numerous ways in which the interests of
nonsettling defendants may be unfairly prejudiced. (Rankin v. Curtis
(1986) 183 Cal. App. 3d 939, 945.) Accordingly, under Tech-Bilt, the party asserting the lack of “good faith” may meet
this burden by demonstrating that the settlement is so far "out of the
ballpark" as to be inconsistent with the equitable objectives of the
statute. (Tech-Bilt, supra, 38 Cal.3d at 499-500.) Such a demonstration
would establish that the proposed settlement was not a “settlement made in good
faith” within the terms of section 877.6. (Ibid.) 
The Supreme Court explained that Code of
Civil Procedure section 877.6 is designed to further two equitable policies: 
1) encouragement of
settlements; and 
2) equitable allocation of
costs among joint tortfeasors.  
(Ibid.)  
Those policies would not be served by an
approach which emphasizes one to the virtual exclusion of the other. (Ibid.)
Accordingly, a settlement will not be found in good faith unless the amount is
reasonable in light of the settling tortfeasor's proportionate share of
liability. (Std. Pac. of San Diego v. A. A. Baxter Corp. (1986) 176 Cal.
App. 3d 577, 589.) Or, as the California Supreme Court has stated, a
“defendant’s settlement figure must not be grossly disproportionate to what a
reasonable person, at the time of the settlement, would estimate the settling
defendant’s liability to be.” (Tech-Bilt, supra, 38 Cal.3d at 499.)
When a motion seeking a determination under
Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 is not opposed, the burden on the moving
parties to show that the settlement was made in good faith is slight. (City
of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261
[holding that a “barebones motion” including a declaration setting forth “a
brief background of the case is sufficient”].) 
When a good faith motion is contested,
however, the moving parties have the initial burden of producing evidence in
support of the requested good faith determination. (Id. at pp. 1261-1262.)
“Section 877.6 and Tech-Bilt require an evidentiary showing, through expert
declarations or other means, that the proposed settlement is within the
reasonable range permitted by the criterion of good faith.” (Mattco Forge v.
Arthur Young & Co. (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1351.) “Substantial
evidence” is required. (Id. at p. 1352.) A declaration from a settling
defendant’s attorney that states, in conclusory fashion, that the client has little,
or no share of the liability may not be sufficient. (Greshko v. County of
Los Angeles (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 822, 834-35; see also 3 Weil & Brown,
California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (2024) ¶¶ 12:774,
12:872-873.)  
The
ultimate burden of persuasion is on the party opposing the good faith
determination.  The “party asserting a
lack of good faith shall have the burden of proof on that issue.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 877.6(d); see also 3 Weil
& Brown, supra, at ¶ 12:875.) 
Discussion
Plaintiff alleges
in the FAC she was injured when she tripped and fell on a manhole lid “that was
negligently left uneven, or was not properly closed, leaving a portion of the
lid lifted above the flat ground.” (FAC, at p. 4.)  Plaintiff’s injuries include a torn meniscus
in both knees and injuries to her ribs; chest; lower back left shoulder, arm, elbow,
and hand; and right elbow and hand. (Tafarella Decl., ¶ 3.)
Plaintiff has
settled with Defendant Tacos El Unico. 
(Id., ¶ 5.)  The settling
defendant moves for an order that the settlement is in good faith under Code of
Civil Procedure section 877.6.  
Defendant LA
Grease Solutions opposes the motion.  
As a threshold
matter, the Court notes that the opposition filed by the opposing party was not
timely.  Nonetheless, the Court exercises
its discretion to consider the opposition.
The Court now turns to an analysis of the settlement under the Tech-Bilt
factors:
(1) Rough approximation of Plaintiff’s
total recovery. 
The Court has received no evidence regarding
Plaintiff’s total recovery, other than a passing statement on “information and
belief” (which may be evidence of the declarant’s state of mind but is not
evidence of the underlying facts).  (See
Tafarella Decl., ¶ 8.)  Moving party
states that Plaintiff claims extensive injuries (id., ¶ 3), but there is no evidence
provided regarding, for example, the amounts claimed by Plaintiff in discovery
responses or other documents regarding medical special damages or other damages.
(2) The settlor’s proportionate liability. 
Moving party provides no information regarding
its proportionate share of the liability. 
Moving party simply states that the settlement amount is “very reasonable.”  (Tafarella Decl., ¶ 6.)
The Court must conduct its Tech-Bilt
analysis based on the facts, not unsupported allegations. (Mattco Forge v.
Arthur Young & Co. (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1351-1352.), And the
analysis must be based on the “information available at the time of settlement.”  (Tech-Bilt,
supra, 38 Cal.3d at p. 499.)
(3)
The amount paid in settlement. 
Moving
party reports that the settlement involves a payment of $175,000 plus the assignment
to Plaintiff of certain rights against other parties that moving party states
(without analysis or explanation) are “believed to be valued” or “has been
valued” at $200,000. (Tafarella Decl., ¶¶ 5, 9-11.)  Moving party asserts that the total value of
the settlement is $375,000.  (Id., ¶
5. )
(4) The allocation of the settlement
proceeds among plaintiffs. 
There is only one Plaintiff, and so this is
not a factor. 
(5) A recognition that a settlor should
pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial.

This factor supports the request for a good
faith determination. 
(6) The settling party’s financial
conditions and insurance policy limits. 
The settling defendant is covered by an insurance
policy with a $1 million policy limit. 
(Tafarella Decl., ¶ 5.)
(7) Any evidence of collusion, fraud, or
tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of nonsettling defendants. 
The settling defendant asserts that the
settlement was reached after arms’ length negotiations.  (Tafarella Decl., ¶ 14.)
The Court has carefully reviewed all of the
evidence in the record.  The Court finds
that Defendant Tacos El Unico has not met its initial burden, as the moving
party, of producing evidence sufficient to support the requested good faith
determination.  (See (Mattco Forge,
supra, 38 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1351-1352; City of Grand Terrace, supra, 192
Cal.App.3d at pp. 1261-1262.) 
Accordingly, the
motion is denied without prejudice. 
Moving party may file a subsequent motion seeking a good faith
determination, supported by sufficient evidence to meet its initial burden of
production under the case law.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES
WITHOUT PREJUDICE the motion of Defendant Tacos El Unico for a good faith
settlement determination under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6.
Moving party to give notice.
