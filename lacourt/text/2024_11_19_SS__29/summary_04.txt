And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for relief from the waiver of objections in their responses to discovery requests. The defendants argued that their failure to serve timely responses was due to mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect, but they did not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim. The judge found that the defendants did not meet their burden of showing that their failure to serve timely responses was excusable. As a result, the defendants' motion is denied. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5.
