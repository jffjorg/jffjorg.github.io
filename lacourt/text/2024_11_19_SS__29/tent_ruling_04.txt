 Case Number:  23STCV03415    Hearing Date:   November 19, 2024    Dept:  29 Rodriguez v. Access Services
23STCV03415
Defendants’ Motion for Relief from Waiver of Objections
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
Two actions, now consolidated, were filed arising out of
a vehicle accident on May 26, 2022.
 
In the first filed and lead action, on February 16, 2023,
Juan Manuel Valles Rodriguez filed a complaint against Access Services
(“Access”), California Transit Inc. (“Transit”), Doe Driver (Doe 1), and Does 2
through 100, asserting causes of faction for negligence, statutory liability,
and respondeat superior.
 
On May 10, 2023, Access and Transit filed an answer and
cross-complaint against Francisco Elizarraras Ortiz (“Ortiz”) and Roes 1
through 50.
 
In the second filed action (Case No. 23STCV06684), on March
24, 2023, (“Ortiz”) filed a complaint against Access, County of Los Angeles, Ivan
Sherel Flores Soledad (“Soledad”), and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action
for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence. 
 
On December 20, 2023, Access and Soledad filed an answer
to Ortiz’s complaint.
 
The two cases were related on June 4, 2024, and
consolidated on July 29, 2024.
 
As it relates to the matter set for
hearing on November 19, Ortiz propounded discovery to Access and Soledad on
December 7, 2023.  (Correia Decl., ¶
3.)  The responses were due on January 10,
2024.  (Ibid.)
 
Access and Soledad requested
extensions of time to respond, but the requests were after the response were
due.  (Id., ¶ 4 & Exh.
A.)  Ortiz agreed, but stated that all
objections were waived.  (Id., ¶
4.)
 
Access and Soledad served verified
substantive responses, with objections, to the discovery on May 21 and 22,
2024.  (Id., ¶¶ 5-6 & Exhs. B-C.)  On June 5, 2024, the Court (Kim, J.) granted
Ortiz’s motion to compel Access and Soledad to provide responses without objections.
 
On October 22, 2024, Access and
Soledad (collectively “Defendants”) filed this motion for an order granting
relief from waiver of objections in their responses to Ortiz’s form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for production, and requests
for admission.  
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition on November
5.  Defendants filed a reply on November
12.
 
Legal Standard
 
A party to whom
interrogatories are propounded waives the right to object to the requests if they
fail to serve a timely response. However, a party may be relieved of that
waiver if “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in
substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. (2) The plaintiff’s failure to serve a timely response was the result
of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., section
2030.290.)¿There are substantially similar sections pertaining to relief from
waiver of objections for requests for admission and requests for production.
(Code Civ. Proc., sections 2033.280, 2031.300.)¿¿ 
 
The statutory language
“mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect” in the discovery statute should
be interpreted using the same general principles developed in application of
the identical language in section 473, subdivision (b). (Scottsdale Ins. Co.
v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 263, 275.) Although the party
moving for relief under section 473 has the burden to show that the mistake,
inadvertence, or neglect was excusable, any doubts as to that showing must be
resolved in favor of the moving party. (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1420.)¿¿ 
 
The courts have ruled that
substantial compliance is dependent on the meaning and purpose of the statute.
(Freeman v. Vista de Santa Barbara Associates LP (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th
791, 793.) For example, a proposed response to requests for admission are
substantially compliant where the responses were verified, contained responses
to a majority of responses, and were served before the hearing on a motion to
compel. (St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 782.)
Such responses may not have complied with all statutory requirements, but
constituted facially good-faith efforts to respond to the requests for
admissions that were substantially code compliant. (Ibid.)
 
Discussion
 
Defendants seek an order
granting relief from the waiver of objections in their responses to form interrogatories,
special interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission. Defendants
argue the failure to serve timely responses was due to mistake, inadvertence,
and excusable neglect. (Opening Mem., at p. 5.)
 
Defendants, as the moving
parties, have the initial burden of producing evidence to support the requested
relief.  In this context, that means that
they have the burden of producing evidence to show that the failure to serve
timely responses was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
 
Defendants have not done so.  Nothing in their moving papers addresses or explains
why they missed the deadline to respond to Ortiz’s discovery.  This is required for Defendants to obtain the
relief they request.
 
Accordingly, Defendants’
motion is denied.
 
The request of Ortiz for
sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5 is also denied.  Ortiz satisfies neither the procedural nor
the substantive requirements for such sanctions.
 
Conclusion
The
Court DENIES Defendants’ motion for waiver of objections.
Moving
party is ORDERED to give notice.
