The Court grants the petitions for approval of minor's compromises for Amado Ruiz, Annaleia Huertas, and Annarae Huertas, each of whom are children who were injured in a drowning incident. The Court finds that the proposed settlements and fees are fair and reasonable. The Court also approves the establishment of Special Needs Trusts for each minor plaintiff, which will be used to receive the settlement funds and ensure that the children do not lose benefits eligibility for Medi-Cal and other benefits.
