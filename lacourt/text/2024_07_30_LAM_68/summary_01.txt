And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories filed by defendant Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (Kaiser). The motion is based on the defendant's claim that the plaintiff's responses are incomplete or evasive. The plaintiff argues that the original responses were complete and non-evasive, and that the defendant's request for further responses is unnecessary or excessive. The court is unsure whether the amended responses provided by the plaintiff have been verified, and therefore declines to rule on the motion until the issue is resolved. The court will either continue the hearing to one of the two new scheduled hearing dates or take the matter under submission depending on which position the plaintiff elects to proceed with.
