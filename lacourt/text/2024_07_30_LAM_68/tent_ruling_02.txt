The court consolidates the three motions into a single ruling.Satila America Corporation served the subject discovery on January 18, 2024. [Declaration of William Adams, ¶ 2, Ex. A.] According to Rexel USA, Inc., at the time of the filing of the motion, no responses were received. [Id., ¶ 3.] Rexel USA, Inc. in opposition maintains responses were served following a two-week extension [Declaration of Rea Stelmach, Ex. B.], and the motion is otherwise “procedurally improper” due to a failure to meet and confer prior to filing. Satila America Corporation in reply maintains the extension was solely based on a waiver of any objections. Regardless, Rexel USA, Inc. only served unverified objections, thereby necessitating the motion for verified, objection free responses. Satila America Corporation also denies any obligation to meet and confer prior to filing a motion to compel responses.The court cannot determine from the motion, opposition and reply if Rexel USA, Inc. in fact ever served verified responses. The attached exhibits to the opposition lack any verification. Satila America Corporation in reply appears to state that only unverified responses were provided on March 8, 2024, thereby necessitating the filing of the motions on March 19, 2024.Unverified responses constitute non-responses. (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) The motion is therefore entirely proper. No meet and confer requirementexists for a motion to compel initial responses to discovery, even following service of unverified responses. The court otherwise declines to further consider the impact of the unverified responses, as the court finds no evidence of verified responses thereby allowing substantive consideration of any responses. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 408–409.)Rexel USA, Inc. is ordered to serve verified responses to Form Interrogatories (set one), Special Interrogatories (set one), and Request for Production of Documents (set one), without objections, within ten days. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a-b), 2031.300, subd. (a-b).)Sanctions in the amount of $1,500, which includes the $1,000 statutory minimum required for request for production of documents, plus $250 for special interrogatories and $250 for form interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.050, subd. (a), 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c)) Sanctions payable in 30 days and imposed jointly against responding party and counsel.Plaintiff to give notice.
