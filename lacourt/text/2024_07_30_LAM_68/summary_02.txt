And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel responses to discovery filed by Satila America Corporation against Rexel USA, Inc. The ruling grants the motions and orders Rexel USA, Inc. to serve verified responses to the discovery requests within ten days. The court finds that Rexel USA, Inc. failed to respond to the discovery requests and served unverified responses, which constitutes non-responses. The court also imposes sanctions of $1,500 on Rexel USA, Inc. and its counsel for failing to comply with the discovery requests. The court declines to consider the impact of the unverified responses and instead focuses on the failure to serve verified responses. The ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, 2031.300, and 2023.050, as well as case law.
