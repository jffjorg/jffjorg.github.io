And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of counsel, Patrick Gangitano, to withdraw as counsel of record for defendant Greenline Restoration, Inc. The motion was filed on the grounds that the client has breached and repudiated the agreement regarding expenses and fees, the client's conduct renders it unreasonably difficult for counsel to carry on employment, the client has failed to heed counsel's advice, and the client has failed to execute a Substitution of Attorney. The judge notes that the determination of whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. The judge also notes that counsel must take reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the client's rights before terminating representation. The judge further notes that the motion lacks a filed and served copy of the proposed order and that the attorney seeking withdrawal as counsel of record must comply with all procedural requirements under Code Civil Procedure section 284 and California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. The judge orders counsel to provide notice and allows for a trial continuance.
