And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Uber Technologies, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration and stay the court proceedings. The judge finds that an enforceable arbitration agreement exists between Uber and Karamali Pashmforoosh, the plaintiff, although Pashmforoosh did not directly agree to the terms. The judge determines that Pashmforoosh's daughter, Sara Pashmforoosh, registered for an Uber account and agreed to Uber's Terms of Use, including an arbitration agreement, and that Pashmforoosh benefited from this agreement as a third-party beneficiary. The judge also finds that Pashmforoosh was estopped from avoiding arbitration because he knowingly sought the benefits of his daughter's agreement with Uber. As a result, the judge orders that the court proceedings be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration.
