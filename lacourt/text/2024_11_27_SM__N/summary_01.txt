Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling sustains Defendant Tucker Carlson's demurrer to the amended complaint without leave to amend. The court holds that the claims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata and collateral estoppel, as the same issues were previously litigated and decided against the plaintiff in favor of a party in privity with the defendant. The court also finds that the claims fail to state a cause of action for breach of contract and unfair competition, and that the claims are preempted by federal law. The defendant is ordered to prepare, serve, and submit a proposed judgment as per statute.
