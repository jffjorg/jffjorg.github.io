COURT’S
  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
  Motion for Summary Judgment 
 
                        



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]:  Granted

 
Defendant Norms
Restaurants, LLC moves for summary judgment. This court grants the motion.  
 
I.               
BACKGROUND 
 
On or about October 25,
2021, Plaintiff Harris Davis (“Plaintiff”) sustained injuries after he slipped
and fell on Defendant’s property located at or near 13636 Sherman Way, Van
Nuys, CA 91405 (the “Subject Property”). (Complaint ¶¶ 7, 11.) On
July 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Norms, Norms
Restaurants, LLC, and Does 1-100, alleging a single cause of action for
premises liability – negligence.
 
On May 28, 2024, Defendant Norms Restaurants, LLC
(“Defendant”) filed a motion to deem its Requests for Admission (“RFAs”), Set
One, admitted. (Motion to Deem RFAs Admitted p. 7.) On July 16, 2024, this
court granted Defendant’s motion. (07/16/24 Minute Order.)
 
On August 13, 2024, Defenant filed a motion for
summary judgment (the “Motion”). Plaintiff filed no opposition.
 
II.

requests for judicial notice.
 
III.           
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
A.    Summary Judgment 
 
“A party may move for
summary judgment in¿an¿action or proceeding if it is contended that the action
has no merit or that there is no defense to the action or proceeding.” (Code
Civ. Proc. §¿437c(a)(1).) The function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication
is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party can show
evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and, if not, to enable an order of
summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield
Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure §¿437c,
subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
a judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992)
7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)¿”There is a triable issue of material fact if, and
only if, the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the
underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with
the applicable standard of proof.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.,
supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 843.)
¿¿¿ 
As to each claim as
framed by the complaint, the moving party must satisfy the initial burden of
proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element or to establish a
defense. (Code Civ. Proc, § 437c(p)(2).) “A cause of action ‘cannot be
established’ if the undisputed facts presented by the defendant prove the
contrary of the plaintiff's allegations¿as a matter of law.” (Brantley v.
Pisaro (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1591, 1597.) Courts “liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide,
Inc.¿(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) Once the moving party has met that
burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party to show that a triable issue of
one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense
thereto. (Code Civ. Proc, § 437c(p)(2).) To establish a triable issue of
material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
162-163.)
 
B.   
Requests for Admission
 
“A deemed admitted order establishes, by judicial
fiat, that a nonresponding party has responded to the requests by admitting the
truth of all matters contained therein.” (Inzunza v. Naranjo (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th
736, 742.) “Any matter deemed to have been admitted ‘is conclusively
established against the party making the admission’ but ‘is binding only on the
party’ that made the admission.” (Id.) A “court’s order deeming the
requested admissions to be admitted is . . . conclusive and may not be
‘contested through contradictory evidence.” (People v. $2,709 United States
Currency (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1278, 1286.)
 
C.   
Premises Liability
 
A cause of action for premises liability
requires showing: (1) duty; (2) breach; (3) causation; and (4) damages. (Ortega
v. Kmart Corp. (“Ortega”) (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1200, 1205.)
 
IV.           
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant argues
summary judgment should be granted in its favor because this court granted its
motion to deem its RFAs admitted as to Plaintiff. (Motion p. 4.)  And, therefore, “Plaintiff admitted that
there was no dangerous condition on the premises on October 25, 2021, when the
incident occurred and that Norms was not negligent with respect to the subject
incident” and “Plaintiff admitted he was not paying attention when he tripped
at the premises, and that the mat he allegedly tripped over . . . did not
create a tripping hazard. (Motion p. 7.)
 
A.   
Dangerous Condition
 
A cause of action for premises liability requires
showing a dangerous condition existed and that the defendant had actual or
constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition. (See
Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1206; Caloroso v. Hathaway (2004)
122 Cal.App.922, 926-927.)
 
Defendant submits its
RFA No. 1, which states: “Admit that there was no dangerous
condition at the PREMISES on October 25, 2021, when the INCIDENT occurred. (For
purposes of these requests, the term “INCIDENT” includes the circumstances and
events surrounding the alleged accident, injury, or other occurrence giving
rise to this action or lawsuit; the term “PREMISES” refers to the location of
the INCIDENT – Norms Restaurant located at 13636 Sherman Way, Van Nuys, CA
91405.)” (Ex. B p. 2.) RFA No. 1 was deemed admitted as to Plaintiff by this
court’s order. (07/16/24 Minute Order; Defendant’s Motion to Deem RFA’s
Admitted p. 7, Ex. A p. 2.) Accordingly, Defendant has met its burden of
showing there was no dangerous condition at the Subject Property when the incident
occurred.
 
Plaintiff submits no evidence supporting his burden of
showing a dangerous condition existed at the Subject Property. Moreover, a “court’s order deeming the requested admissions to be
admitted is . . . conclusive and may not be ‘contested through contradictory
evidence.” (People v. $2,709 United States Currency, supra, 231
Cal.App.4th at p. 1286.)
 
Accordingly, there is
no triable issue of material fact as to whether a dangerous condition existed
on the Subject Property when the incident occurred.
 
B.   
Negligence
 
“It is well established
in California that although a store owner is not an insurer of the safety of
its patrons, the owner does owe them a duty to exercise reasonable care in
keeping the premises reasonably safe.” (Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p.
1205.) “In order to establish liability on a negligence theory, a plaintiff
must prove duty, breach, causation and damages.” (Id.)
 
Defendant submits its RFA
No. 2, which states: “Admit that NORMS RESTAURUANT, LLC was not negligent with
respect to the subject INCIDENT.” (Ex. B. p. 2.) RFA No. 2 was deemed admitted
as to Plaintiff by this court’s order. (07/16/24 Minute Order; Defendant’s
Motion to Deem RFA’s Admitted p. 7, Ex. A p. 2.) Accordingly, Defendant has met
its burden of showing Defendant was not negligent with respect to the incident.

 
Plaintiff submits no evidence supporting his burden of
showing Defendant was negligent. Moreover, a “court’s
order deeming the requested admissions to be admitted is . . . conclusive and
may not be ‘contested through contradictory evidence.” (People v. $2,709
United States Currency, supra, 231 Cal.App.4th at p. 1286.) 
 
Accordingly, there is no triable issue of material
fact as to whether Defendant was negligent.
