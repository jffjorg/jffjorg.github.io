And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Tesla Motors Inc.'s unopposed motion to compel arbitration. The case arises from warranty and repair obligations related to a 2023 Tesla Model Y, which the plaintiff alleges has widespread defects. The judge finds that the defendant has identified a valid arbitration provision in the Retail Installment Sales Contract, which requires arbitration of the plaintiff's claims. The burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that the arbitration clause should not be enforced, but the plaintiff failed to meet this burden by filing no written opposition to the motion. As a result, the court action is ordered stayed pending completion of arbitration.
