The Court grants Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories (Set One) and orders Defendant to comply with Plaintiff's requests within 30 days. The Court finds that Defendant's omission of a supplemental response to Special Interrogatory No. 1 is inconsistent with its initial response, and that Plaintiff is entitled to supplemental responses 45 days after receipt of the provided responses. The Court also finds that Defendant did not respond to the May 29, 2024, meet and confer email delivered by Plaintiff's counsel. The Court reminds the parties that civil discovery is intended to be a self-executing system with minimal judicial intervention.
