And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint (SAC) by plaintiff Tohid Naeem. The SAC adds a new cause of action for violation of civil rights (LGBTQ+) and an eleventh cause of action for violation of veteran protections, as well as a new defendant, Reina Reynolds. The court notes that there is a hearing scheduled for January 7, 2025, on the demurrer to the first amended complaint (FAC), and instead of mootting the demurrer, the court will consider the motion for leave to amend after the demurrer hearing. The motion is continued to January 21, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. The court's discretion in granting leave to amend is guided by California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(a)(1) and California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324.
