MOTION:                  Motion
for Summary Judgment/Adjudication
HEARING DATE:   1/7/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
A party may move for summary judgment in any action or
proceeding if it is contended the action has no merit or that there is no
defense to the action or proceeding. (CCP, § 437c(a).) “The purpose of the law
of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the
parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations,
trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  
 
“A party may move for summary adjudication as to one or
more causes of action within an action, one or more affirmative defenses, one
or more claims for damages, or one or more issues of duty, if the party
contends that the cause of action has no merit, that there is no affirmative
defense to the cause of action, that there is no merit to an affirmative
defense as to any cause of action, that there is no merit to a claim for
damages, as specified in¿Section 3294 of the Civil Code, or that one or more
defendants either owed or did not owe a duty to the plaintiff or
plaintiffs.”¿(CCP,¿§ 437c(f)(1).)¿If a party seeks summary adjudication as an
alternative to a request for summary judgment, the request must be clearly made
in the notice of the motion. (Gonzales v. Superior Court¿(1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 1542, 1544.)¿ “[A] party may move for summary adjudication of a
legal issue or a claim for damages other than punitive damages that does not
completely dispose of a cause of action, affirmative defense, or issue of
duty pursuant to” subdivision (t). (CCP,¿§ 437c(t).)¿ 
 
To prevail, the evidence submitted must show there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.¿(CCP, §¿437c(c).)¿The motion cannot succeed unless
the evidence leaves no room for conflicting inferences as to material facts;
the court has no power to weigh one inference against another or against other
evidence. (Murillo v. Rite Stuff Food Inc. (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th
833, 841.) In determining whether the facts give rise to a triable issue of
material fact, “[a]ll doubts as to whether any material, triable, issues of
fact exist are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment…”
(Gold v. Weissman (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1195, 1198-99.) “In other
words, the facts alleged in the evidence of the party opposing summary judgment
and the reasonable inferences there from must be accepted as true.” (Jackson
v. County of Los Angeles (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 171, 179.) However, if
adjudication is otherwise proper the motion “may not be denied on grounds of
credibility,” except when¿a material fact is the witness’s¿state of mind and
“that fact is sought to be established solely by the [witness’s] affirmation
thereof.” (CCP, § 437c(e).)¿ 
 
Once the moving party has met their burden, the burden
shifts to the opposing party “to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP §
437c(p)(1).) “[T]here¿is no
obligation on the opposing party... to establish anything by affidavit unless
and until the moving party has by affidavit stated facts establishing every
element... necessary to sustain a judgment in his favor.”¿(Consumer Cause,
Inc. v.¿SmileCare¿(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454, 468.)¿ 
¿ 
“The pleadings play a key role in a summary judgment
motion. The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to
delimit the scope of the issues and to¿frame¿the outer measure of materiality
in a summary judgment proceeding.” (Hutton v. Fidelity National Title Co.¿(2013)
213 Cal.App.4th 486, 493, quotations and citations omitted.) “Accordingly, the
burden of a defendant moving for summary judgment only requires that he or she
negate plaintiff's theories of liability¿as alleged in the complaint;
that is, a moving party need not refute liability on some theoretical
possibility not included in the pleadings.” (Ibid.)¿ 
 
EVIDENTIARY ISSUES
 
Plaintiff’s objections to the Yakobi declaration are
SUSTAINED as to nos. 1 [legal conclusion], 2 [relevance], 3 [legal conclusion,
foundation], and 4 [legal conclusion].
 
Plaintiff’s objections to the Zadeh declaration are
OVERRULED. (The statements are relevant to a continuance request.)
 
LASD’s request for judicial notice is GRANTED. Yakobi’s
request for judicial notice is GRANTED. (See Evans v. California Trailer
Court, Inc. (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 540, 549 [“The court may take judicial
notice of recorded deeds”].) 
 
REQUEST FOR A CONTINUANCE
 
Defendant asserts that there has
not been discovery in this action and requests a continuance to secure certain
discovery. To justify a continuance under Code of Civil Procedure § 473c(h),
the party opposing summary judgment must show: (1) the facts to be obtained are
essential to opposing the motion, (2) there is reason to believe such facts may
exist, and (3) the reasons why additional time is needed to obtain these facts,
(Desaigoudar v. Meyercord, (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 173.)
 
Defendant notes that his answer was
not filed until September 16, 2024. (Zadeh Decl., ¶ 2.) Plaintiff timely filed the
motion for summary judgment on September 25, 2024, before any meaningful
discovery had commenced. (Id.) Defendant served discovery requests on Plaintiff
on November 6, 2024, with responses originally due December 11, 2024. (Id., ¶¶
3-4.) Pursuant to Plaintiff’s counsel’s request, responses were extended to
December 19, 2024. (Id.) As a result, no discovery responses have been provided
to Defendant prior to the filing of their opposition. (Id. at ¶ 4.) Defendant
does not explain what discovery would be obtained from Plaintiff through the
served discovery.
 
Defendant desires discovery of the
applicable CC&Rs, which they contend might determine the priority interests
in this case. Defendant contends that it is possible that the HOA’s judgment
lien “relates back” to the CC&Rs, potentially making it a senior priority
interest. This request alone would not justify a continuance. Defendant does
not explain why he could not obtain a copy of the CC&Rs – a publicly
available recorded document accessible to the parties since the inception of
the case (and before) – and perform his analysis in the 83 days between the
filing of the MSJ and the Opposition. In any event, Plaintiff persuasively
shows why any “relation back” to the CC&Rs would fail to create a dispute
of material fact precluding summary judgment. (Diamond Heights Village Assn.,
Inc. v. Financial Freedom Senior Funding Corp. (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 290,
301-302 [holding hat a Deed of Trust recorded after the HOA’s assessment liens
had priority because the HOA had already foreclosed upon those assessment liens
when it reduced them to judgment].) Diamond Heights explained:
 
Once a judgment is obtained, the
judgment creditor may create a judgment lien by recording an abstract of
judgment or may choose to levy execution, thereby creating an execution lien.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 674, 697.710; Kahn v. Berman (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 1499,
1507, fn. 7, 244 Cal.Rptr. 575.) An execution lien does not arise when a writ
of execution is issued by the court, but rather when the levying officer levies
the property (constructively seizes it) by recording a copy of the writ of
execution and notice of levy. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 697.710, 700.010, 700.015,
subd. (a); Kahn, supra, at p. 1508, 244 Cal.Rptr. 575; see generally 8 Witkin,
Cal. Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Enforcement of Judgment § 99, p. 143.) The record
here does not show that a levy ever occurred to create an execution lien, and
the Association makes no claim to having an execution lien. The Association
relies exclusively upon its assessment liens, despite having already foreclosed
those liens in a 2002 judgment. The claim is unavailing. Those liens were
foreclosed and the debts they secured were merged into the judgment. The
Association's remedy was to record the judgment [prior to the Financial Freedom
mortgage], in which case the judgment lien would have given the Association
priority over Financial Freedom. (Code Civ. Proc., § 697.310 et seq.)
 
Defendant also requested discovery
on the foreclosure process, including proofs of service the notices were sent
in accordance with nonjudicial foreclosure procedures. Defendant also wants to
subpoena Leslie Vinson, the original owner, to confirm that she received the
nonjudicial foreclosure notices. Again, Defendant has not shown any reasonable or
diligent efforts to secure such evidence before the hearing on this matter.
 
Analysis
 

Plaintiff Robert Box (“Plaintiff”)
moves for summary judgment, or alternatively, summary adjudication as to each
cause of action, against Defendants David Yakobi, Los Angeles Sheriff’s
Department, Casa Palmero Homeowners Association, and All Persons Unknown
Claiming Any Legal or Equitable Right, Title, Estate, Lien, or Interest in the
Property Described in the Complaint Adverse to Plaintiff’s Title, or Any Cloud
Upon Plaintiff’s Title Thereto. The complaint alleges four causes of action for
1) set aside sheriff’s sale; 2) quiet title; 3) cancellation of instrument; and
4) declaratory relief.
 
To prevail in an action to quiet
title, the plaintiff must prove title superior to that of defendants. (Gerhard
v. Stephens (1968) 68 Cal.2d 864, 918.) “An action to quiet title is akin
to an action for declaratory relief in that the plaintiff seeks a judgment
declaring his rights in relation to a piece of property.” (Ciara v. Offner
(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 12, 24.) The California quiet title statutes
obligate a court hearing a quiet title claim to examine “evidence of
plaintiff’s title” along with “such evidence as may be offered respecting the
claims of any of the defendants,” in order to determine whether title should be
quieted in the plaintiff’s favor. (Code Civ. Proc., § 764.010.)
 
Elements of a claim for
cancellation are: (1) reasonable apprehension that the instrument left standing
might cause serious injury to the plaintiff; (2) the instrument is valid on its
face; (3) the instrument is void or voidable; (4) the instrument was in
existence or under the defendant’s possession and control when the action was
filed; and (5) if the interest is voidable rather than void, that the plaintiff
acted promptly to rescind. (Civ. Code §§ 3412, 3413; Hironymous v. Hiatt
(1921) 52 Cal.App. 727, 731.)
 
CCP section 1060 provides that a
person may bring an action for declaratory relief if he or she “desires a
declaration of his or her rights or duties with respect to another, or in
respect to, in, over or upon property . . ..” 
 
Verified Allegations
 
The Verified Complaint alleges that
the real property that is the subject of this lawsuit is commonly known as 1750
Casa Palmero, #232, Los Angeles, CA 90046 (“Subject Property”). (Compl., ¶ 3.)
On June 1, 2007, Vinson executed a deed of trust, subsequently recorded in the
official records of Los Angeles County on June 7, 2007, as Document Number
20071381098 (“DOT”). (¶ 15.) On May 7, 2012, an assignment of the DOT was
recorded in the official records of Los Angeles County on June 7, 2007, as
Document Number 20121478972 memorializing the assignment of the beneficial
interest in the DOT to Citibank, N.A., as Trustee for Structured Asset Mortgage
Investments II Trust 2007-AR6 Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates Series
2007-AR6. (¶ 16.) On May 9, 2023, a substitution of trustee was recorded in the
official records of Los Angeles County as Document Number 20230300006, duly substituting
the trustee under the DOT as Idea Law Group, LLC. (¶ 17.)
 
On August 2, 2023, a Notice of Levy
was recorded in the official records of Los Angeles County as Document Number
20230511290 based on a purported judgment obtained by the HOA in the estimated
amount of $7,000.00. (¶ 18.) On March 14, 2024, the Subject Property was sold
to Plaintiff through a duly noticed nonjudicial foreclosure sale, thereafter
recorded on April 1, 2024, as Document Number 20240209582. (¶ 19.) 
 
On April 17, 2024, the Subject
Property was sold at a sheriff’s sale performed by the Sheriff to satisfy the
HOA’s purported and then-extinguished judgment lien. (¶ 21.) The Sheriff issued
a Sheriff’s Deed to Yakobi on May 20, 2024, which was thereafter recorded on
May 30, 2024. (Id.)
 
Plaintiff alleges that the
foreclosure sale of the DOT extinguished all junior encumbrances, as well as
Vinson’s former title, which would include any purported judgment lien of the
HOA, as a matter of law. (¶20.) Due to the foreclosure of the DOT that
extinguished the purported judgment lien of the HOA, if any, the resulting
sheriff’s sale performed by the
Sheriff was void and of no effect. (¶ 23.) Since the
foreclosure of the DOT, Plaintiff has been the sole legal titleholder of the
Subject Property by way of its trustee’s deed upon sale. (¶ 24.) The sheriff’s
sale conducted by the Sheriff was without authority and voiddue to the
extinguishment of any purported judgment lien and that Vinson no longer owned the
Subject Property. (¶ 25.) Based on the foreclosure of the senior DOT, the HOA’s
purported judgment lien was extinguished, and thus, the resulting sheriff’s
sale and sheriff’s deed issued by the Sheriff to Yakobi are void and should be
set aside. (¶¶ 26-30.)
 
Plaintiff’s Undisputed Material Facts
 
            Plaintiff
provides additional evidence consistent with the verified allegations. 
On August 31, 2023, the Foreclosure Trustee caused a Notice
of Default and Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust (the “NOD”) to be recorded
in the Official Records of Los Angeles County as Instrument Number 20230581376.
(UMF 4.) The NOD provided that, as of August 29, 2023, the Borrower was in
default in the amount of $40,048.24. (Ibid.) On February 13, 2024, the
Foreclosure Trustee recorded a Notice of Trustee’s Sale indicating that the
nonjudicial foreclosure sale of the Property would be held on March 14, 2024.
(UMF 5.) The nonjudicial foreclosure sale of the Property was held on March 14,
2024. (UMF 6.) At the time of sale, the amount of unpaid debt was $425,000.
(UMF 7.) Plaintiff purchased the Property at the nonjudicial foreclosure sale
for $425,001, and the Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale (“TDUS”) perfecting Plaintiff’s
title to the Property was recorded on April 1, 2024. (UMF Nos. 7-8.) As such,
Plaintiff became the record owner of the Property on April 1, 2024, after the
properly conducted non-judicial foreclosure sale. (UMF 6-8.)
 
Parallel with this nonjudicial
foreclosure process, Defendants sought their own Sheriff’s sale. On January 23,
2023, Defendant Casa Palmero Homeowners Association (“HOA”), filed a limited
civil action (the “HOA Action”) against the Borrower to collect delinquent
homeowners’ association fees owed to the HOA. (UMF 9.) Subsequently, on March
28, 2023, the HOA recorded a Notice of Delinquent Assessment and Claim of Lien
against the Property. (UMF
10.) On June 9, 2023, the Court in the HOA Action entered
judgment in favor of the
HOA. (UMF 11.) On June 13, 2023, the Court in the HOA Action
issued a notice of
levy under writ of execution (money judgment). (UMF 12.) On
August 2, 2023, the Sheriff
recorded the Notice of Levy in the Official Records of Los
Angeles County as Instrument
No. 20230511290. (UMF 13.) The Property was sold at the
Sheriff’s Sale on April 17, 2024, to satisfy the HOA’s purported lien recorded
on August 2, 2023. (UMF 14.) On May 20, 2024, the Sheriff issued a Sheriff’s
Deed to Yakobi. (UMF 15. ) On May 30, 2024, the Sheriff’s Deed was recorded in
the Official Records of Los Angeles County as Document No. 20240351121. (UMF
16.) 
 
Plaintiff explains that the HOA’s
Execution Lien attached to the Property on August 2,
2023, did not impair or prevent the enforcement of the
security interest against the Property. The beneficiary of the DOT had the
right to enforce its security interest through power of sale notwithstanding the
existence of the execution lien or levy. CCP section 701.040(a) states:
 
(a) Except as otherwise ordered by
the court upon a determination that the judgment creditor's lien has priority
over the security interest, if property levied upon is subject to a security
interest that attached prior to levy, the property or obligation is subject to
enforcement of the security interest without regard to the levy unless the
property is in the custody of the levying officer; but, if the execution
lien has priority over the security interest, the secured party is liable to
the judgment creditor for any proceeds received by the secured party from the
property to the extent of the execution lien.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
As such, a court must determine that
a judgment creditor’s lien has priority over a security interest that attached
prior to levy, or the security interest will have priority over the lien. The
parties do not cite any evidence on the record which would show such court
determination. Therefore, the trustee of the DOT had the right to enforce the
security interest without regard to Defendants’ levy. 
 
Thus, the undisputed facts demonstrate
that the DOT security interest had priority, since it was noticed in 2007 and Defendants’
interest was noticed in 2023. (See Thaler v. Household Finance Corp.
(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1099 [“California follows the ‘first in time, first
in right’ system of lien priorities.”].) As such, when Plaintiff purchased the Property
at the nonjudicial foreclosure sale on March 14, 2024, the HOA’s Execution Lien
– a junior security interest – was extinguished. Plaintiff demonstrates that the
sheriff’s sale was void because the officer had no authority to sell on the
extinguished lien, and could not pass title to Defendant. (See Ram v.
OneWest Bank, FSB (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 1, 11 [“Similarly, a sale is
rendered void when the foreclosure sale is conducted by an entity that lacks
authority to do so.”]; see Van Bogaert v. Avery (1969) 271 Cal.App.2d
492, 496 [noting that an unauthorized judicial sale is “wholly void because the
officer had no authority to sell”].)
 
In opposition, Defendants cite no
disputes of material fact. The LASD disclaims any interest and submits no
evidence which disputes the above material facts. Yakobi only submits legal
contentions which do not amount to disputes of material fact. For instance,
Yakobi contends that Plaintiff has failed to meet its initial burden because
Plaintiff does not address the assessment lien's “priority” in relation to the
Property’s CC&Rs. As discussed above, Plaintiff’s priority over the
CC&Rs would be irrelevant. Moreover, Plaintiff has met his initial burden
on summary judgment. Plaintiff does not need to prove that the nonjudicial
foreclosure complied with statutory notice procedures (Civ. Code § 2924b.)
Indeed, Defendants submit no evidence to dispute of fact which could contest
the presumption that a foreclosure sale has been conducted regularly and
fairly. (Bank of America v. La Jolla Group II (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th
706, 713.) Otherwise, Defendants only attack the immaterial fact that
the Sheriffs caused the Sheriff’s deed to be recorded, as opposed to Yakobi.
(UMF 16.)
 
Lastly, Defendants contend that the
sale is “absolute” under CCP section 701.680(a). Far from absolute, section
701.680(a) states “Except as provided in paragraph (1) of subdivision (c),
a sale of property pursuant to this article is absolute and shall not be set
aside for any reason.” (Emphasis added.) Subsections (b)-(d) discusses the
process by which Sheriffs sales may be set aside under appropriate
circumstances, including if “the sale was improper because of irregularities in
the proceedings, because the property sold was not subject to execution, or for
any other reason”. A void interest would certainly be a reason to set
aside a sheriff’s sale pursuant to section 701.680. 
 
Plaintiff has shown entitlement to
judgment as to each cause of action. Defendants, in turn, do not raise any
disputes of material fact. Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
