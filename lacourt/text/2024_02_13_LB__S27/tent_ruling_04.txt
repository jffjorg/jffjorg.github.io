Prior OSCs Re: Proof
     of Service

The Court held an OSC re: proof of
service on 9/26/23.  Plaintiff appeared
at the OSC.  The Court noted the lack of
proof of service, and continued the hearing to 12/11/23.  On 12/11/23, Plaintiff again appeared at the
OSC.  The Court again noted a lack of
service.  The Court continued the OSC to
2/13/24 and indicated there would be no further continuance for proof of
service.  
 

Applications for
     Writ of Possession

To date, Plaintiff has not filed
proof of service.  The applications for
writ of possession are therefore taken off calendar due to failure to serve
Defendants.  
 

OSC re: Proof of
     Service

The continued OSC re: proof of
service is on calendar today.  Unless
otherwise provided by statute, the complaint in a civil action must be served
on all named defendants, and proof of service filed, within 60 days after
filing of the complaint.  CRC 3.110(b).  Violation of this rule may lead to monetary
sanctions against the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney (see CRC 2.30(b).
But violation of this rule does not justify dismissal of the action for delay
of less than 2 years.  Hawks v. Hawks
(2006) 141 CA4th 1435, 1437.  Pursuant to
CCP §583.420(a)(1), the Court has discretion to dismiss the action if proof of
service is not filed within two years after the action is commenced.
 
The Court sets an OSC re: monetary sanctions
for failure to file proof of service in one month, on Wednesday, 3/13/24 at 8:30
a.m. in Department S27.
