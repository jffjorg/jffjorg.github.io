And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Defendant, Dr. Mehrdad Saliminejad, M.D., has moved for summary judgment in this medical malpractice case, alleging that he complied with the standard of care at all times and did not cause or contribute to the wrongful death of Jose Gallegos. The Judge has reviewed the evidence and finds that the Defendant has met his burden of showing that his care and treatment of the Decedent complied with the standard of care. The burden now shifts to the Plaintiffs to raise a triable issue of material fact. Since the Plaintiffs have failed to meet this burden, the motion for summary judgment is granted. The Defendant is ordered to give notice, and parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court as directed.
