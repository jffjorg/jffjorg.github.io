And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories filed by the defendants. The motion was previously scheduled for hearing on October 17, 2023, but was continued to December 14, 2023, and then again to February 13, 2024. Despite the Court's orders, the parties failed to file a joint statement of items in dispute, and the motion is now taken off calendar. The Court notes that the parties have another hearing scheduled for May 14, 2024, and orders the plaintiff to give notice. The Court also requests that the parties work together to resolve any outstanding discovery issues prior to the scheduled trial date of April 15, 2024.
