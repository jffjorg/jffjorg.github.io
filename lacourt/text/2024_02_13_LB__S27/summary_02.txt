And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant Daniel Huerta, which challenges the Plaintiff's failure to comply with pre-filing IDR requirements. The judge previously ruled on a similar demurrer filed by co-defendants, sustaining the demurrer and denying leave to amend. The judge finds that the Plaintiff's complaint fails to allege compliance with the pre-filing IDR requirements, as it only alleges that the Plaintiff made ADR efforts after filing the complaint. The judge sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, and orders the Plaintiff to pursue IDR in good faith and re-file any claims if IDR is not successful.

The judge also grants the Defendant's motion to compel discovery, ordering the Plaintiff to serve verified responses to outstanding discovery requests within 10 days. The judge grants the Defendant's motion to deem certain requests for admissions (RFAs) admitted, as the Plaintiff has failed to respond to them.

Finally, the judge orders the Defendant to give notice of the ruling, and advises the parties to submit on the tentative or make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing.
