And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motions to compel discovery responses from the defendants, Lucia Lopez and Yoel Lopez. The defendants failed to respond to the plaintiff's discovery requests, which were served on July 31, 2023. The judge has ordered each defendant to serve verified responses, without objection, to the plaintiff's Form Interrogatories and Demands For Production of Documents within 30 days.

The judge has also granted the plaintiff's motions to deem requests for admissions admitted against the defendants. The defendants failed to respond to the plaintiff's requests for admissions, which were served on July 31, 2023. The judge has ordered that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.

Additionally, the judge has granted the plaintiff's requests for monetary sanctions against each defendant. The plaintiff has requested $1,161.50 in monetary sanctions against each defendant, for a total of $3,484.50. The judge has found that a reasonable total sanction against each defendant is $1,710.00, and has ordered each defendant to pay this amount to the plaintiff within 30 days.
