[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR SANCTIONS
  
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 17, 2023



 
On May 26, 2023, Plaintiff Bahram
Rasizadeh filed this action against Defendant Schuster Land Corporation.
On
August 30, 2022, Plaintiff served Form Interrogatories, Set One and Request for
Production, Set One on Defendant.  Defendant
never served responses, so Plaintiff filed two motions to compel on December 5,
2022.
At
the May 8, 2023 hearing, Defendant did not appear, but Plaintiff’s counsel represented
that some late discovery responses were received.  The Court ordered Defendant to provide complete
responses, without objections, to Form Interrogatories 4.1(e) and 12.1 within 20
days. All other discovery disputes were rendered moot by the Defendant’s late responses.
The
first amended complaint, filed on May 9, 2023, alleges that Plaintiff was a tenant
in one of Defendant’s property’s uninhabitable rental units.  On May 10, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel met and conferred
with Defendant’s counsel about Form Interrogatory 12.1 and Plaintiff’s request for
information about all tenants since May 26, 2018.  (Naudi Decl. ¶ 3.)
On
May 17, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel reminded Defendant’s counsel about the Court’s
order to provide responses to Form Interrogatory 12.1.  (Naudi Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. B.)  Defendant did not provide timely responses.  (Naudi Decl. ¶ 5.)
On
June 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for an order to show cause re: contempt.  Thereafter, on July 25, 2023, Defendant provided
incomplete supplemental responses.  (Naudi
Decl. ¶ 6 & C.)  The Court later denied
the motion for contempt, repeating its June 2, 2023 advisement, “If the disputed
discovery is the subject of a Court order, and the Court order has been violated,
there should be a motion for evidentiary exclusion or issue preclusion sanctions
first, or for terminating sanctions if the first two approaches will not work, and
only after those three approaches fail, for contempt. . . . The Plaintiff should
seek appropriate sanctions for violation of that [May 8, 2023] order as discussed
above at or before the Final Status Conference.”
On
September 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion for evidentiary sanctions.  Plaintiff seeks an order prohibiting Defendant
from introducing witnesses regarding the condition of the property, the cause of
the conditions of the property, the citations, or any attempts to abate the conditions
at the property.
A
court may impose an issue sanction prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (b).)
Form
Interrogatory 12.1 asks for the name, address, and telephone number of each individual
who witnessed the incident or related events, made any statement at the scene of
the incident, heard any statements made about the incident by someone at the scene,
and who the responding party claims has knowledge of the incident.  Defendant’s July 25, 2023 response identified
thirteen tenants other than Plaintiff, with only their unit numbers.  (Naudi Decl., Ex. C.)  Defendant further responded that it “has made
a diligent and reasonable effort to obtain current addresses for tenants who no
longer reside at the property but such information has never been within Responding
Party’s possession, custody or control.  Discovery
and investigation are continuing.”
Defendant
has had many opportunities to comply with the May 8, 2023 discovery order, and it
failed to fully respond.  Trial is scheduled
for December 11, 2023, with a discovery deadline of November 11, 2023.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020.)  The parties should be preparing for this trial
date, and Plaintiff cannot do so without Defendant’s complete discovery responses
and potential witnesses to the conditions of the property.
Accordingly,
the unopposed motion for sanctions is GRANTED. 
Defendant is prohibited from introducing witnesses regarding the condition
of the property, the cause of the conditions of the property, the citations, or
any attempts to abate the conditions at the property.
Defendant
is also ordered to pay sanctions of $3,000.00 to Plaintiff within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
