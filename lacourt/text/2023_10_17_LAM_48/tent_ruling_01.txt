On February 19, 2020, Plaintiff
Clarence Harrell filed this action against Defendant City of Pasadena.  The parties have been heavily litigating their
discovery disputes.
DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR
PROTECTIVE ORDER
On
August 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed an ex parte application to continue the September
5, 2023 trial date and all related dates, including discovery.
On
August 3, 2023, the Court granted in part Plaintiff’s ex parte application.  The Court advanced and continued to September
5, 2023 jury trial to May 20, 2024.  The Court
also ordered:  “Discovery deadlines are reset
based on new Trial date only for discovery noticed on or before August 4, 2023.  All other discovery deadlines remain unchanged.  [¶]  All
motion deadlines for discovery noticed on or before August 4, 2023 and for Summary
Judgment are reset based on the new Trial date. 
All other motion deadlines remain unchanged.”
On
August 4, 2023, Plaintiff served twenty-six Special Interrogatories, thirty-four
Requests for Admissions, Employment Form Interrogatory No. 217.1, fourteen Requests
for Production, a Supplemental Interrogatory and Request for Production, and sixteen
deposition notices.  (Motion, Price Decl.
¶¶ 6-7.)
On
September 6, 2023, Defendant filed an ex parte application for a protective order.  On September 7, 2023, the Court set a hearing
and ordered briefing.
Defendant
filed its full motion for protective order on September 20, 2023.
As
the Court observed at the August 3 hearing, the parties were then just a few days
away from the thirty-day deadline for completing discovery based on the September
5, 2023 trial date, so Plaintiff should have already propounded everything he needed.  (Motion, Ex. E at pp. 8-9.)  In his ex parte application, Plaintiff argued
that the interests of justice were best served by a continuance because “presently
Plaintiff is unable to finish taking all necessary depositions due to Defendant’s
counsel not being available due to a family emergency.  Additional depositions are still to be taken and
review of documents produced.”  (08/02/2023
Ex Parte Application at pp. 11-12.)  There
was no showing of necessity for a continuance for any written discovery.
Moreover,
the focus of the hearing was on Plaintiff’s need for additional time for depositions
only.  Defendant’s counsel stated that Defendant
did not oppose a continuance “for the limited purpose of conducting depositions
that could not go forward in the last week and a half or so due to my—my personal
family emergency which necessitated taking them off calendar.  However, Defendant would oppose what’s essentially
a discovery do-over.”  (Motion, Ex. E at p.
4.)  When the Court proposed setting new discovery
deadlines for discovery noticed on or before August 4, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel
stated, “Again, Your Honor, I will say that there are multiple depositions that
we need to take.”  (Motion, Ex. E at p. 9.)  Near the end of the hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel
stated, “Your Honor, I think that your—the solution that you crafted is workable
by Plaintiff.  We can get the depositions
noticed by August 4th, and then that will be it.  I think that we could live with that.”  (Motion, Ex. E at p. 19.)
Plaintiff’s
August 2, 2023 ex parte application sought to continue trial and related dates so
Plaintiff could take the depositions of certain witnesses: Greg Helstley (Vol. II);
Jaime Arellano (Vol. II); Joe Armstrong; Varrojan Avedian; Susanne Stone; Susana
Castro; Paul Bahn; Eric Klinkner; Jeff Barber; Mark Jomsky; Jose Trujillo; Sharon
Moody; James Lohse; Gurchuran Bawa; and Richard Nadelman.  (08/02/2023 Ex Parte Application at p. 6.)
Defendant
states that only seven depositions remain in dispute: Suzanne Stone; Susana Castro;
Salvador Delgadillo (Vol. II); Jose Trujillo; Jeff Barber; Paul Bahn; and the PMK
regarding compensation.  (Price Suppl. Decl.
¶ 4.)  Of these, Salvador Delgadillo (Vol.
II) and the PMK regarding compensation were not part of Plaintiff’s ex parte application.  For Suzanne Stone, Susana Castro, Jose Trujillo,
Jeff Barber, and Paul Bahn, Defendant does not show good cause to prevent these
depositions.
The
motion for protective order is DENIED as to the depositions of Suzanne Stone, Susana
Castro, Jose Trujillo, Jeff Barber, and Paul Bahn.  These depositions may go forward.
The
motion for protective order is GRANTED in all other respects, including for all
written discovery served on August 4, 2023.
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES
On
May 5, 2023, Plaintiff electronically served on Defendant an Amended Notice of Deposition
and Request for Production of Documents for non-party Andy Ly, noticing a deposition
on May 12, 2023.  (Anglin Decl., Ex. 2.)  The Amended Notice was untimely served.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.270, subd. (a) [“An oral
deposition shall be scheduled for a date at least 10 days after service of the deposition
notice.”].)
Defendant
served objections on May 10, 2023, and it served responses on May 12, 2023.  (Anglin Decl. ¶¶ 5-6; Price Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.)  Although these objections and responses were not
served three calendar days before the May 12 deposition date (see Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.410, subd. (a)), they were reasonably served in light of the untimely service
of the Amended Notice of Deposition.
After
attempting to meet and confer (Anglin Decl. ¶ 7), Plaintiff filed a motion to compel
further responses on July 10, 2023.
If
a party or an officer, director, managing agent, employee of a party, or person
designated as the person most qualified to testify fails to appear for examination
or produce documents, the demanding party may move to compel attendance, testimony,
and production.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (a).)
For
RFP Nos. 1-4, 8, 13, 16, 19, 20, 22, 23, after objections, the responses state,
“There are no additional responsive documents.” 
This is not a code-compliant response. 
(See Code Civ Proc., § 2031.230.) 
The motion is GRANTED for RFP Nos. 1-4, 8, 13, 16, 19, 20, 22, 23.  Mr. Ly is ordered to provide further code-compliant
responses within 30 days.
For
RFP Nos. 5-7, 9-12, 15, 17, 18, 21, 24-36, only objections were provided.
Plaintiff
noticed Mr. Ly’s deposition in his individual capacity.  (Anglin Decl., Ex. 2.)  However, the Amended Notice of Deposition requested
that “the Defendant City of Pasadena shall produce the following documents and/or
things.”  (Anglin Decl., Ex. 2 at p. 5.)  The requests for production of documents define
“YOU” or “YOUR” as including and referring to “City of Pasadena, as well as . .
. employees (including the deponent, Andy Ly) . . . .”  (Anglin Decl., Ex. 2 at p. 4.)  In the Joint Statement’s arguments, Plaintiff
refers only to Defendant, not Mr. Ly.  The
Court therefore agrees with Defendant that “[m]any Requests for Production are totally
vague, ambiguous, and unintelligible; specifically, but not only, Plaintiff’s incoherent
use of the terms ‘YOU’ and ‘YOUR.’  Indeed,
Plaintiff’s requests were drafted as if Mr. Ly were the City of Pasadena or held
a management position within the City giving him access to certain records.  This simply is not true, and Plaintiff knows this.  Plaintiff’s crafting of its requests was careless
and failed to consider the deponent, Mr. Ly. 
Many of the Requests for Production were difficult to interpret as it was
difficult to determine what was being requested and to who the request was being
made.”  (Price Decl. ¶ 9.)  Furthermore, Plaintiff has not shown good cause
for the discovery sought.  The objections
are sustained.
Additionally,
some of Plaintiff’s requests directed at Mr. Ly are the same as what he directed
at Defendant.  For example, RFP No. 5 here
seeks the same documents as RFP No. 115 directed at Defendant.  RFP No. 6 here seeks the same documents as RFP
No. 116.  RFP No. 7 here seeks the same documents
as RFP No. 117.  RFP No. 9 here seeks the
same documents as RFP No. 140.  Defendant
provided responses on September 1, 2020 and October 25, 2021, and Plaintiff did
not move to compel Defendant’s further responses to those RFPs.  (See Price Decl. ¶¶ 10-12 & Exs. 1-2.)  The Court agrees with Defendant that the duplicate
requests directed at Mr. Ly is Plaintiff’s “attempt[] to do an end-run around the
45 day motion to compel deadline to raise issues that Plaintiff should have raised
two years ago.”  (Price Decl. ¶ 12.)
The
motion is DENIED for RFP Nos. 5-7, 9-12, 15, 17, 18, 21, 24-36.
For
RFP No. 14, the response states, “After a reasonable search and diligent inquiry,
Defendant is not in possession of any documents responsive to this request because
such documents either never existed or have been lost, misplaced, or destroyed.”  This is a code-compliant response.  The motion is DENIED for RFP No. 14.
The
motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART as set forth above.
The
request for sanctions is denied.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
