And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants in part and denies in part the defendant's motion for a protective order and grants in part and denies in part the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses. The plaintiff seeks to take additional depositions, while the defendant seeks to limit discovery. The judge finds that some of the discovery requests are untimely or vague, and that the plaintiff has not shown good cause for the discovery sought. The judge also finds that some of the requests for production are repetitive and seek the same documents that were previously sought from the defendant. The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses for some of the requests for production, but grants the motion for others. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions.
