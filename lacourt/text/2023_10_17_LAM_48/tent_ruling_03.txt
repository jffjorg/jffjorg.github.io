(4) a motion compel Yoel Lopez’s responses to Demands For Production of Documents;

MOTIONS TO COMPEL RESPONSES
When
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make
an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve timely responses
waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection
of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
Sanctions shall be imposed against the party who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
Plaintiff
served discovery on Defendants on July 31, 2023.  Defendants did not serve responses to Plaintiff’s
discovery and filed no oppositions to these motions.  Accordingly, the motions to compel are GRANTED.
Lucia
Lopez is ordered to serve verified responses, without objection, to Plaintiff’s
Form Interrogatories and Demands For Production of Documents within 30 days.
Yoel
Lopez is ordered to serve verified responses, without objection, to Plaintiff’s
Form Interrogatories and Demands For Production of Documents within 30 days.
The
requests for monetary sanctions are discussed separately below.
MOTIONS TO DEEM ADMITTED
When
a party fails to timely respond to a request for admission, the propounding party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections
to the demand, unless the court grants them relief from the waiver, upon a showing
that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and
(2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence,
or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court shall
grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is
in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Plaintiff
served discovery on July 31, 2023.  Neither
Lucia Lopez nor Yoel Lopez served responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission.  They did not file any oppositions to the motions.  Accordingly, the motions to deem Requests for
Admission admitted are GRANTED.
The
requests for monetary sanctions are discussed separately below.

total of $3,484.50 against each Defendant.

Lucia
Lopez is ordered to pay sanctions of $1,710.00 to Plaintiff within 30 days.
Yoel
Lopez is ordered to pay sanctions of $1,710.00 to Plaintiff within 30 days.
