And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Nicholas Holt v. Law Offices of Jon Udewitz, PC, et al. The plaintiff, Nicholas Holt, has filed a demurrer to the defendants' answer, arguing that certain affirmative defenses are insufficient. The judge has reviewed the pleadings and has made the following rulings: the demurrer to the first affirmative defense of "failure to state a claim" is overruled; the demurrer to the 21st and 22nd affirmative defenses for speculative damages and no punitive damages is sustained; and the demurrer to the 2nd through 20th affirmative defenses is overruled. The judge has also noted that the defendants' affirmative defenses contain allegations not present in the complaint and that the plaintiff's burden of proof remains the same regardless of whether these defenses are stated in the answer.
