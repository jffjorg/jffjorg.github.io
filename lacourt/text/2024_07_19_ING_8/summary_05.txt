Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion to deem requests for admission as admitted, the demurrer to the complaint, and the request for monetary sanctions. The judge sustains the demurrer to the complaint, finding that the plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to state causes of action. The judge also grants the motion to deem requests for admission as admitted, as the plaintiff failed to respond to the requests. However, the judge denies the request for monetary sanctions, finding that the amount requested is excessive. The judge suggests that the plaintiff may be able to serve code-compliant and verified responses to the requests for admission, and that if he does, the court may be inclined to order the payment of a small amount of monetary sanctions.
