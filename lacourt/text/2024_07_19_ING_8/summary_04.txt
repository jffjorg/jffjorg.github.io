And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Pablo Sierra's motion to intervene in the action brought by Sedgwick Claims Management, Inc. against the City of Los Angeles. The motion is granted because Pablo Sierra has an unconditional right to intervene under Labor Code section 3853, which allows an employer or employee who has an unconditional right to intervene to do so at any time prior to trial on the facts. The court also notes that Sedgwick Claims Management, Inc. filed its complaint within the one-year statute of limitations period, and therefore Pablo Sierra's intervention does not exceed the statute of limitations. The court concludes that Pablo Sierra's motion is granted, and orders Intervenor to give notice to parties who have appeared in the action.
