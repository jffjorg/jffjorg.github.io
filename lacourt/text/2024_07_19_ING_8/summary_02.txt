And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is in the case of Jorge Garcia v. US Best Ingredients, Inc., et al. The Plaintiff, Jorge Garcia, filed a Complaint on November 3, 2023, alleging that the Defendant failed to pay minimum wages, overtime, and provide lawful meal periods, among other claims. The Defendant filed a stipulation for final approval of settlement, which includes a modification to the settlement agreement to reflect that $10,000 of the Total Settlement Payment will be paid to the Plaintiff as his individual settlement payment/service award.

The Court has broad powers to determine whether a proposed settlement is fair and has granted the motion for stipulation of final approval of settlement, pending discussion on whether notice has already been received by the class members that did not include the subtraction of the $10,000 to Plaintiff, and if so, whether the parties intend to inform the class members of the amendment.
