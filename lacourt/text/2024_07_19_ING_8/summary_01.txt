Significant Statements:
  - "The function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial." (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843)
  - "The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings." (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67)

Summary:
The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on four causes of action, including breach of contract, account stated, open book account, and reasonable value of services rendered. The court finds that there are triable issues of fact, including the reasonableness of fees, the quality of representation, and the defendant's failure to provide documents. The defendant's ex parte application to continue the trial date is also tentatively denied, but would be granted for a short period of time to allow the defense counsel to review the remaining documents.
