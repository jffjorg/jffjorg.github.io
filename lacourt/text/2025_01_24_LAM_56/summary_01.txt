And here is the summary of the "Tentative Ruling" in English text:

The Court has considered the motion for reconsideration filed by Plaintiff Tohid Naeem, which seeks to reconsider a prior settlement agreement and vacate the settlement agreement, schedule a bench trial, impose sanctions, hold Defendant Nidal A. Barakat in contempt, refer the case to the District Attorney, refer Defendant to licensing agencies, award punitive damages, report violations to federal and state agencies, and award damages. The motion is unopposed.

The Court notes that a motion for reconsideration is used to ask the court to modify an earlier order on a prior motion to the court because of new circumstances or law. However, the settlement agreement between the parties is not a court order, and therefore, the Court is unable to grant the motion.

The Court finds that Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration is based on the same facts and circumstances that were presented earlier, and therefore, does not meet the requirements for a motion for reconsideration.

Accordingly, the Court denies the motion for reconsideration. The moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
