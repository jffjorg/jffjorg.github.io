MOVING PARTY:  Plaintiff Tohid Naeem (“Plaintiff’)
RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
            The Court has considered the moving
papers. No opposition has been filed. 
 
BACKGROUND
             On May 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative
complaint (“Complaint”) against Defendant Nidal A. Barakat (“Defendant”) for
Violations of Tenant Anti-Harassment Ordinance.     
 
            On
October 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for reconsideration (the
“Motion”). The Motion is unopposed. 
 
DISCUSSION
A motion for reconsideration is used to
ask the court to modify, amend, or revoke its earlier order on a prior motion
to the court because of new or different facts, circumstances, or law. (Code
Civil Procedure (“CCP”), § 1008, subd. (a).) Such an order may involve an
interim or final order (CCP, § 1008, subds. (e), (h)), where an interim order
is an intermediate ruling of some kind that requires further proceedings before
the suit can be resolved, and where a final order is an order that finally
disposes of the suit (see People v. DeLouize (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1223,
1231 [differentiating between interim and final orders]).  
 
            A party may move for reconsideration
based on: (1) new or different facts, (CCP, § 1008, subd. (a); see e.g., In
re Marriage of LaMoure (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1473 [reconsideration
motion granted on new evidence]); (2) new or different circumstances, (CCP, §
1008, subd. (a)); and (3) new or different law, (CCP, § 1008, subd. (a); Baldwin
v. Home Sav. of Am. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1196.) However, a party
cannot move reconsideration based on the court’s erroneous order, i.e., the
court’s misinterpretation of facts or law. (See Jones v. P.S. Dev. Co.
(2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 707, 724, disapproved on other grounds by Reid v.
Google, Inc. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 512, 531-532, 532 n. 4.) 
 
A court acts in excess of jurisdiction
when it grants a motion to reconsider that is not based upon “new or different
facts, circumstances or law.”  (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32
Cal.App.4th 1494, 1499.)  Motions for reconsideration are restricted to
circumstances where a party offers the Court some fact or circumstance not
previously considered, and some valid reason for not offering it earlier. (Id.) 
 
Moreover, there is a strict requirement of
diligence, which means the moving party must present a satisfactory explanation
for failing to provide the evidence or different facts
earlier. (Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 674, 690.) The burden under Section
1008 is comparable to that of a party seeking a new trial on the ground of
newly discovered evidence: the information must be such that the moving party
could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced it at
trial.  (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-213.)   
 
Plaintiff moves the Court for an order
reconsidering the prior settlement agreement, vacating the settlement agreement
and scheduling a bench trial, imposing sanctions, holding Defendant in
contempt, referring the case to the District Attorney, referring Defendant to
licensing agencies, awarding punitive damages, reporting violations to federal
and state agencies and awarding damages. (Mot. pp. 2-3.) 
 
A motion for reconsideration is used to
ask the court to modify an earlier order on a prior motion to the court because
of new circumstances or law. (CCP, § 1008, subd. (a).) As none of Plaintiff’s
requests seek modification of a court order, the Court is unable to grant the
Motion. The Court notes that the settlement agreement between the parties is
not a court order. To the extent Plaintiff asserts that Defendant has violated
or not complied with the terms of the agreement, the proper recourse would be
for Plaintiff to file a motion to enforce the settlement agreement pursuant to CCP
section 664.6. 
 
            Plaintiff’s Motion for
Reconsideration is DENIED.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative
must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the
instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
