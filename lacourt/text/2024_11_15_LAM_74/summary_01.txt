Now, here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint. The plaintiff has alleged eight causes of action, including fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, and breach of oral contract, related to two properties, the Wheatland Property and the Nichols Property.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action against the defendants Aline Shomof, Aline Shomof as Trustee, Jonathan Shomof, Jimmy Shomof, Sara Shomof, Shadow Hills Homes, LLC, and Grand Pacific 7-28, LLC, with leave to amend. The judge has found that the plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action against these defendants, as they were not parties to the contracts alleged in the complaint.

The judge has granted leave to amend, allowing the plaintiff to refile the complaint and allege the necessary facts to state a cause of action against the defendants.
