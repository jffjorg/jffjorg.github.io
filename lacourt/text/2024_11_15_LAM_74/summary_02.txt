And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Enriquetta Quiroz's motion to strike the habitability complaint filed by Plaintiffs Jorge Venegas and Vanessa Palacios. The court has denied the motion to strike, finding that Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support claims of malice and oppression by Defendant. The court has concluded that Defendant's conduct, including the failure to address known habitability issues and the alleged conscious disregard for the legal and equitable rights of Plaintiffs, constitutes malicious and oppressive behavior. The court has ruled that the allegations of the complaint, including the presence of cockroaches, toxic mold, and other habitability issues, as well as the failure of Defendant to address these issues, are sufficient to support a claim of malice and oppression. The court has ordered Defendant to give notice of the ruling.
