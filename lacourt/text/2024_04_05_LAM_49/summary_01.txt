And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment in its entirety, dismissing the plaintiff's claims against the defendant. The plaintiff had alleged that the defendant breached a settlement agreement and failed to make payments under the agreement. The defendant argued that it had the right to foreclose on the plaintiff's assets under a secured loan agreement and that the transfer of assets from the plaintiff to the defendant was not fraudulent. The judge found that the defendant had made a prima facie showing that it had the right to foreclose on the plaintiff's assets and that the transfer was not fraudulent. As a result, the plaintiff's claims failed, and the defendant's motion was granted. The judge ordered the defendant to give notice of the ruling.
