Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Yvette Espiritu v. TPX Communications, et al. (Case No. 22STCV18966). The case involves a motion for a protective order filed by the plaintiff, Yvette Espiritu, to limit the defendant, TPX Communications, from propounding additional special interrogatories. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the defendant has provided adequate justification for the additional interrogatories.

The judge notes that the defendant's declaration in support of the additional interrogatories did not comply with the requirements of the California Code of Civil Procedure, but that the defendant's opposition briefing and meet and confer correspondence provided sufficient justification for the additional interrogatories.

The judge also finds that the defendant's request for monetary sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel is not warranted, as the defendant precipitated the dispute by serving a facially deficient declaration in support of the additional interrogatories and refusing to compromise or cure the defect when the plaintiff exercised her statutory right to object.

The case is set for a hearing on December 14, 2023, and any party may submit written comments on the tentative ruling by email to the courtroom by 4:00 p.m. the day before the hearing.
