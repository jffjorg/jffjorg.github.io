The judge has concluded that the plaintiff's claims are based on an invalid legal theory and that the deed of trust is valid. The judge has also found that the elder abuse claim is predicated on the same invalid legal theory as the rest of the pleadings.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint, finding that the allegations in the complaint are incapable of amendment. The judge has also denied the defendant's motion to strike portions of the second amended complaint as moot.
