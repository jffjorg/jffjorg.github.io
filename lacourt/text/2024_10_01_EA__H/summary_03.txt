And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court's tentative ruling grants Huang's motion to set aside the default and file an answer and cross-complaint. The court finds that Huang's counsel's mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect was sufficient to warrant relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). The court also awards Huang's counsel, Raymond Zakari, reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or Plaintiffs, but reduces the amount from $2,000.00 to $300.00. The court orders that the fees and costs be paid by Liddle & Liddle to Plaintiffs within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling.
