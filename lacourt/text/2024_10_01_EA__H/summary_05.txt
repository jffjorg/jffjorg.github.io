And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to continue the hearing on the plaintiff's motion for entry of judgment to November 15, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. The case involves a negligence and strict liability action filed by the plaintiff, Kyle Olsen, against several defendants, including Valmont Industries, Inc. and the State of California. The plaintiff alleges that he sustained injuries in a 2017 accident involving a guardrail end terminal on the I-10 freeway. The parties entered into a settlement agreement and release on March 26, 2024, which provides for the payment of $2,000,000.00 to the plaintiff. However, the payment has not been made, and the plaintiff is seeking an order enforcing the settlement agreement.

The judge notes that the settlement agreement is silent on the time for payment, and that the law implies that the contract should be performed within a reasonable time. The judge is inclined to continue the hearing for approximately 45 days to allow CalTrans to comply with the settlement agreement despite procedural constraints. The judge requests that counsel for CalTrans file a status report regarding the settlement payment no later than five court days prior to the continued hearing date.
