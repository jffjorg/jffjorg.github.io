MOVING PARTY: Defendant Life Steps Foundation,
Inc. (“Defendant”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Thatcharnok
Pichitchartee (“Plaintiff”)
 
The Court has considered the moving, opposition
and reply papers.
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises
out of an employment relationship.  The
currently operative second amended complaint (the “SAC”) alleges: (1)
discrimination in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”);
(2) failure to prevent discrimination under FEHA; (3) Labor Code section
1102.5; and (4) Labor Code section 98.6. 
 
In relevant part, the SAC alleges: Plaintiff was
employed in Defendant’s accounting department. 
(SAC ¶ 6.)  Throughout his
employment, Plaintiff was over 40 years old. 
(SAC ¶ 9.)  After Plaintiff refused
to conduct unlawful accounting practices, Defendant subjected Plaintiff to
various retaliatory actions that culminated in his termination.  (See SAC ¶¶ 11-21.)  Defendant subjected Plaintiff to these
employment actions with knowledge of his age. 
(See SAC ¶¶ 15-17, 23-24.) 
Plaintiff filed an administrative complaint and received a right-to-sue
letter on August 25, 2023.  (SAC ¶¶ 27-28;
Exh. A.)
 
Defendant filed a demurrer on the grounds that
the SAC fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and is
uncertain.  Specifically, Defendant
contends that Plaintiff’s pleadings remain defective and ambiguous as to the
nature of the alleged protected activity engaged in by Plaintiff, and Plaintiff
failed to comply with the Court’s order to attach both of the alleged
right-to-sue letters.
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
            Defendant
requests judicial notice of the complaint and order of dismissal in Los Angeles
Superior Court, Case No. 21STCV16861, filed by Plaintiff Thatchamok
Pitchitchartee against Life Steps Foundation, LLC (the “2021 Lawsuit”). 
 
Defendant’s Request
for Judicial Notice is GRANTED as to the existence of the documents, but not to
the truth of the matters stated therein. 
(Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 97, 113.)   
 


 
DISCUSSION
Meet and Confer
The meet and confer requirement has been met.
 
Legal Standard
A demurrer tests
the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law.  (Durell
v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)  The court accepts as true all material
factual allegations and affords them a liberal construction, but it does not
consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions, speculation, or allegations
contrary to law or judicially noticed facts. 
(Shea Homes Limited Partnership v.
County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246, 1254.)  With respect to a demurrer, the complaint
must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts
pleaded.  (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 517.)  A demurrer will be sustained without leave to
amend if there exists no reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  
 
Demurrers for
uncertainty are disfavored.  (Chen v.
Berenjian (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 811, 822.) 
A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint
is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under
modern discovery procedures.  (Id.)
 
 
Statute of Limitations
Under FEHA, plaintiffs have one year to file a
civil complaint after receiving a right-to-sue letter.  (See Gov. Code § 12965, subd.
(c)(1)(C).) 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s FEHA claims (first
and second causes of action) expired because Plaintiff filed a lawsuit in 2021
that arises out of the same conduct.  “Plaintiff’s
allegation in the original complaint that she obtained a Right to Sue letter in
2021 constitutes a judicial admission and bars the first two causes of action
as untimely.”  (Dem., 3:13-15.)  The SAC alleges that “On August 25, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a charge stating the aforementioned claims with the Cal Civil
Rights Agency and received a right-to-sue letter on August 25, 2023.”  (SAC ¶ 27.)  Plaintiff attached a copy of the right-to-sue
letter as Exhibit A.  Meanwhile, the
complaint in the 2021 Lawsuit, which is based upon the same claims as the
instant lawsuit, alleges that Plaintiff had been wrongfully discharged by
Defendant and that “Plaintiff has received a Right to Sue letter”.  (Complaint in the 2021 Lawsuit, Third Cause of
Action.)  Based upon this pleading, the
Court ordered Plaintiff to provide copies of both the pre-2021 Lawsuit right-to-sue
letter and the 2023 letter.  (2/16/24
Minute Order.)  However, Plaintiff only
provided the 2023 letter. 
 
As a result, Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s
FEHA claims are time-barred by the one-year statute of limitations following
issuance of the original right-to-sue letter.  The fact that Plaintiff obtained successive
right-to-sue letters does not extend the statute of limitations absent
continuing violation on behalf of the employer, which there is none here.  (See Acuna v. San Diego Gas & Electric
Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 1402, 1417, noting that a plaintiff
cannot revive expired claims by filing a new DFEH complaint many years after
the alleged discrimination took place, and that the continuing violation
doctrine is inapplicable absent allegation of continuing discrimination.) 
 
In his opposition, Plaintiff contends, based on
Civ. Code § 12960(e), that the applicable statute of limitations is three
years, not one year. Plaintiff’s argument overlooks the fact that there are two
statutes of limitations an employee must comply with: the statute for the
prerequisite of filing an administrative complaint (Civ. Code § 12960), and the
statute for filing a civil action (Civ. Code § 12965, subd. (c)).  Section 12960 refers to filing a complaint
“with the department.”  It is a
limitations period for filing a charge of discrimination with the Department of
Fair Employment & Housing, it is not a statute of limitations for filing a
civil action in the Superior Court.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs first and second causes
of action for discrimination and failure to prevent discrimination under FEHA
are time-barred.  The Court therefore
SUSTAINS the Demurrer to the first and second causes of action WITHOUT leave to
amend. 
 
Third Cause of Action
Labor Code §
1102.5 prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee for
disclosing information, or because the employer believes that the employee
disclosed or may disclose information, to a government or law enforcement
agency, to a person with authority over the employee or another employee who
has the authority to investigate, discover, or correct the violation or
noncompliance, or for providing information to, or testifying before, any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry, if the employee
has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of
local, state or federal law. (Lab. Code § 1102.5, subd. (b).)  Subdivision
(c) provides that an employer shall not retaliate against an employee for
refusing to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of
local, state or federal law.  (Lab. Code
§ 1102.5, subd. (c).)  
To establish a prima facie case of
retaliation, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he engaged in protected activity;
(2) he was thereafter subjected to adverse employment action by his employer;
and (3) there was a causal link between the two.  (Morgan v. Regents of University of Cal. (2000)
88 Cal.App.4th 52, 69.)  Statutory causes of action must be alleged
with particularity. (Lopez v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. (1985)
40 Cal.3d 780, 795.)  
 
            The SAC
alleges the following. Plaintiff’s supervisor asked Plaintiff to perform
unlawful acts, including not reporting $200,000 in income and withholding
material information from auditors.  (SAC
¶ 11.)   Plaintiff believed these
commands to be illegal, refused to comply, and complained about the requests to
his supervisor directly.  (SAC ¶¶ 12-14.)
 Immediately thereafter, Plaintiff’s
supervisor threatened to terminate his employment and removed Plaintiff from
several work assignments.  (SAC ¶ 15.)  Plaintiff was terminated two months later.  (SAC ¶ 20.)  The elements of protected activity, adverse
employment action, and causal link are sufficiently pled.  The Court therefore OVERRULES the Demurrer to
the third cause of action.  
 
Fourth Cause of Action
            Labor Code § 98.6(a) makes it
unlawful for an employer to discharge or discriminate against an employee
because the employee has, among other things, filed a bona fide complaint or
claim related to any rights under the jurisdiction of the Labor Commissioner or
brought a civil action against the employer.  
 
            Just like the FAC, the SAC does not
sufficiently allege the basis for the Labor Code section 98.6 claim.  Having failed to demonstrate an ability to
plead a valid claim under section 98.6, the Court therefore SUSTAINS the
Demurrer to the fourth cause of action WITHOUT leave to amend.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative
must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the
instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
