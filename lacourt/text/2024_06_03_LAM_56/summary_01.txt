Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer filed by the defendant, Life Steps Foundation, Inc., and has made the following rulings:

* The court sustains the demurrer to the first and second causes of action, which are based on the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), because the plaintiff, Thatcharnok Pichitchartee, failed to file the administrative complaint within the one-year statute of limitations.
* The court overrules the demurrer to the third cause of action, which is based on Labor Code ยง 1102.5, because the plaintiff has sufficiently pled the elements of protected activity, adverse employment action, and causal link.
* The court sustains the demurrer to the fourth cause of action, which is based on Labor Code ยง 98.6, because the plaintiff failed to plead a valid claim under this statute.

The court also granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of the complaint and order of dismissal in Los Angeles Superior Court, Case No. 21STCV16861.
