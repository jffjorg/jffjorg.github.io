Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:
Petitioner Writers Guild of America, West, Inc. (“Petitioner”)
RESPONDING PARTY:
None.  
 
            The Court has considered the moving paper. No opposition
or reply papers were filed as of May 30, 2024. 
 
BACKGROUND
            On February 21, 2024, Petitioner filed its petition to confirm
arbitration award as to Respondents The Men Productions, Inc. and Khiow Hui Lim
(the “Petition”). 
 
            On
April 12, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant motion to remove incorrectly filed
documents. Petitioner requests an order be granted to remove the Petition from
the docket on the grounds that a portion of the document was incorrectly filed
publicly. The motion is unopposed as of May 30, 2024.
 
DISCUSSION
Code of Civil Procedure section 128(a)(8) provides the court
with power “[t]o amend and control its process and orders so as to make them
conform to law and justice.”  
 
Here,
Petitioner provides that the Petition filed on February 21, 2024, inadvertently
failed to redact certain confidential personally identifiable information that
was intended to be, and should have been, redacted at the time of filing. Petitioner
also provides that it will file a corrected version shortly. The Court finds the
removal of the Petition appropriate based on the foregoing and because the
motion is unopposed.  
 
            The Court therefore GRANTS Petitioner’s motion.  
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the hearing,
the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
         
Dated this 3rd day of June 2024
