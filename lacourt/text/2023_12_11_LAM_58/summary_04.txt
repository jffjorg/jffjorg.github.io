And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to be relieved as counsel by Steffanie Stelnick, attorney for the defendants. The motion was filed without opposition, and the Judge has granted the motion based on the attorney's compliance with the rules of court. The Judge notes that the attorney has provided an adequate explanation for the breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, and that the motion does not prejudice the plaintiff. The Judge will hear further from counsel regarding the verification of the clients' addresses, but has tentatively granted the motion assuming that the verification was reasonably likely to ensure notice. The next hearing is scheduled for a Case Management Conference on January 25, 2024.
