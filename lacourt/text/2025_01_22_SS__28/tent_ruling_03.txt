On
June 6, 2023, Plaintiffs Christopher Spencer and Brooklyn Clift (“Plaintiff”)
filed this action against Defendants Reginald Becton (“Defendant”), Lynette
Becton, and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
September 12, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
December 26, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to compel Plaintiff to provide responses
to demand for production of documents, set two, and for sanctions.  The motion was set for hearing on January 22,
2025.  On January 8, 2025, Plaintiff
filed an opposition.  On January 13,
2025, Defendant filed a reply. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for March 26, 2025. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Defendant
asks the Court to compel Plaintiff to serve responses to demand for production
of documents, set two, and to award sanctions. 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides in part: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subds. (a), (b), (c).) 
DISCUSSION 
Defendant
asserts that, on September 24, 2024, he served demand for production of
documents, set two, on Plaintiff.  According
to Defendant, Plaintiff did not serve timely responses or objections and had
not served responses or objections by the time Defendant served this motion. 
Plaintiff
denies that her counsel received the demand for production of documents on
September 24, 2024.  However, Defendant
has submitted an email from Defendant’s counsel to Plaintiffs’ counsel dated
September 24, 2024 which states: “Dear Counsel, Please find attached DEMAND FOR
PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET TWO propounded [on] [Plaintiffs].”  Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s counsel sent
the email “via a group e-mail addressed to all the attorneys in the case,
rather than sending it specifically to Plaintiff’s counsel.”  (Opposition p. 2.)  The Court has reviewed the September 24, 2024
email and finds that Defendant properly served demand for production of
documents, set two, on Plaintiff’s counsel on September 24, 2024. 
Plaintiff
also asserts that she served objection-free responses “on or about December 29,
2024” and later provided supplemental responses.  (Opposition p. 3.) Plaintiff asks the Court
to deny Defendant’s sanctions request. 
Defendant
does not contest the adequacy of Plaintiff’s responses but argues that
sanctions are appropriate because of Plaintiff’s “deception” and “bad faith.”  (Reply p. 2.) 
When
the propounding party proceeds with a motion to compel discovery responses
despite the service of untimely responses, the trial court “has discretion to
rule on the motion.”  (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 409.)  Among the court’s
options, the court may “deny the motion to compel responses as essentially
unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose sanctions . . . .”  (Ibid.) 
The
Court denies as moot Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to
demand for production of documents, set two. 
Defendant
requests $790.00 in sanctions.  According
to Defendant, this amount “represent[s] the reasonable expenses and attorney’s
fees incurred in connection with this proceeding, as authorized under
California Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300(c).”  (Moreton dec. ¶ 7.)  However, Defendant has not provided evidence
of the amount of attorney time billed, counsel’s billable rate, or other information
that would allow the Court to determine the reasonableness of the requested
sanctions.  The Court denies the
sanctions request. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES Defendant Reginald Becton’s motion to compel Plaintiff
Brooklyn Clift’s responses to demand for production of documents, set two, and
request for sanctions. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
