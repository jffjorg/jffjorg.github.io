And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motions, oppositions, and replies in this case and has made the following ruling. The plaintiff, Christopher Spencer and Brooklyn Clift, filed an action against the defendant, Reginald Becton, and Lynette Becton, for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. The defendant filed an answer and later a motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to a demand for production of documents. The plaintiff did not serve timely responses or objections, but later served objection-free responses.

The judge finds that the defendant properly served the demand for production of documents on the plaintiff's counsel on September 24, 2024. However, the judge denies the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to the demand for production of documents, set two, as moot.

The defendant also requested sanctions in the amount of $790.00, but the judge denies this request as the defendant has not provided evidence of the reasonableness of the requested sanctions. The judge concludes that the defendant's motion is denied, and the plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
