And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add two new causes of action to the complaint, alleging that the defendants refused to provide reasonable accommodations for the plaintiff's disability. The judge finds that the motion is untimely and that there is prejudice to the defendants. The judge notes that the motion was filed almost 18 months after the case was originally filed and that trial is set for October 15, 2024, less than three and a half months away. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has had over a year to bring these additional claims and that the proposed amendment would require delaying the trial, resulting in added costs of preparation and increased discovery burdens. Therefore, the judge denies the motion and orders the defendants to give notice.
