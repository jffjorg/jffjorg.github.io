  Case Number:  23AHCV00064    Hearing Date:   July 3, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT1. Background
Facts
This case arises from alleged uninhabitable
housing conditions at 2841 W. Main St., Alhambra, California 91801 (the
“Premises”).  On December 29, 2022, Plaintiff
Martin Tokich (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Andrew M. Dang
(“Dang”) and Northstar Real Estate Group, Inc. (“Northstar”, together
“Defendants”). The complaint alleged the following nine causes of action: (1) breach
of warranty of habitability under CCP §1941.1 and (2) CCP §1942.4, (3) breach
of warranty of habitability under CCP §17920.3, (4) negligence – premises
liability, (5) nuisance, (6) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (7)
breach of contract, (8) unfair business practices under B&P Code § 17200 et
seq., and (9) fraudulent concealment. 
On July 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”). 
Before the court is Plaintiff’s Motion for
Leave to file a Second Amended Complaint, filed on May 13, 2024.  Plaintiff also filed a proposed order and supporting
declaration of Luiza Patrikyan, Esq. (“Patrikyan Decl.”).
Plaintiff seeks to amend the FAC to
include attorney’s fees and add two causes of action for 1) Violation of
Government Code §§ 12921 and 12927 and (2) Civil Code §§ 51 & 52, based Plaintiff’s
April 10, 2024 deposition, in which Plaintiff stated that Defendants refused to
provide Plaintiff with reasonable accommodations for Plaintiff’s disability.
(Patrikyan Decl, ¶¶ 2, 13.)
On June 20, 2024, Defendants filed an
opposition to Plaintiff’s motion.
As of July 1, 2024, no reply has been
filed by Plaintiff.
The hearing for the instant matter is set
for July 3, 2024.
Trial is scheduled for October 15, 2024.

Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint 
CCP § 473(a)(1) provides, in relevant
part:  “The court may, in furtherance of
justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading
or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting
a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may,
upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer.  The court may likewise, in its discretion,
after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an
amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like
terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this code.” 
“This discretion should be exercised
liberally in favor of amendments, for judicial policy favors resolution of all
disputed matters in the same lawsuit.”  (Kittredge
Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.)  Ordinarily, the court will not consider the
validity of the proposed amended pleading in ruling on a motion for leave since
grounds for a demurrer or motion to strike are premature.  The court, however, does have discretion to
deny leave to amend where a proposed amendment fails to state a valid cause of
action as a matter of law and the defect cannot be cured by further
amendment.  (See California Casualty
General Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 281,
overruled on other grounds by Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines Ins.
Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390.)
Under CRC Rule 3.1324(a), a motion to
amend a pleading shall (1) include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended
pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from previous
pleadings or amendments; (2) state what allegations in the previous pleading
are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph and line
number, the deleted allegations are located; and (3) state what allegations are
proposed to be added to the previous pleading, if any, and where, by page,
paragraph, and line number, the additional allegations are located. 
Under CRC Rule 3.1324(b), a separate
declaration must accompany the motion and must specify (1) the effect of the
amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts
giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why
the request for amendment was not made earlier. 
Even if a good amendment is proposed in
proper form, a long, unwarranted, and unexcused delay in presenting it may be a
good reason for denial.  In most cases,
the factors for timeliness are: (1) lack of diligence in discovering the facts
or in offering the amendment after knowledge of them; and (2) the effect of the
delay on the adverse party.  If the party
seeking the amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced the
opposing party, the judge has discretion to deny leave to amend.  (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118
Cal.App.3d 486, 490.)  Prejudice exists
where the amendment would require delaying the trial, resulting in loss of
critical evidence, or added costs of preparation such as an increased burden of
discovery.  (Magpali v. Farmers Group,
Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488.)
Here, Per CRC Rule 3.1324(b), a separate
declaration has been filed with the motion, explaining (1) the effect of the
amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts
giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why
the request for amendment was not made earlier.
Plaintiff’s motion to amend the complaint
includes a copy of the amended pleading, properly labeled as [Proposed Second
Amended Complaint] where Plaintiff adds a tenth cause of action for a violation
of CCP §51. (Motion, Exh. A.)  However,
Plaintiff does not state that the 9th cause of action for fraudulent
concealment in the FAC is to be deleted and replaced with the proposed cause of
action for violation of Government Code §§ 12921 and 12927. CRC Rule 3.1324(a)
requires Plaintiff to state if
any previously pled allegations are to be deleted by indicating where, by page,
paragraph, and line number. Here, Plaintiff fails to do so and only indicates
what allegations are proposed to be added, not those to be deleted. Therefore,
CRC Rule 3.1324(a) is not fulfilled by the filed FAC.  This alone is sufficient basis to deny the
motion. 
However, even if Plaintiff had included the
proposed deletions to the SAC, the Court is not inclined to grant this motion
because the motion is untimely and there is prejudice to Defendant. The motion
was filed on June 24, 2024 almost 18 months after the case was originally filed
in December 2022.  Trial is set for
October 15, 2024, less than three and a half months away. Plaintiff claims that
the new evidence leading to the filing of this motion was discovered during Plaintiff’s
April 10, 2024 deposition.  (Motion, pp.
7-9.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff was aware of the facts giving rise to the
new causes of action long before the April 10 deposition.  
The Court notes that the motion to file
the second amended complaint was not filed until over a month after the April
10 deposition.  “The law is well settled
that a long-deferred presentation of the proposed amendment without a showing
of excuse for the delay is itself a significant factor to uphold the trial
court's denial of the amendment.'"]; Estate of Murphy (1978) 82
Cal.App.3d 304, 311, ["Where inexcusable delay and probable prejudice to
the opposing  party is indicated, the
trial court's exercise of discretion in denying a proposed amendment should not
be disturbed."] Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001)
89 Cal.App.4th 603, 613.) 
Plaintiff’s argument relies on the liberal
policy of amending complaints even during trial. (Motion p. 6.) Plaintiff argues
that a grant of the instant motion would not prejudice Defendants because the
proposed causes of action arise from the same set of facts and are within the
statute of limitations. (Motion, p. 5.) Plaintiff also states that “There is no
statute of limitations problem since the violation allegations can still be
timely filed in a separate action.” (Id.) 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff has had
over a year to bring these additional claims and hastily filed the instant
motion to preemptively defeat Defendants’ motion for Summary Judgment. (Opp’n.,
p. 1; Declaration of Rachel Donnelly (“Donnelly Decl.”), ¶¶ 12-13; Ex. G.) Defendants
argue that Plaintiff’s delayed attorney’s fees request is unreasonable since Defendants
produced a copy of the underlying lease agreement to Plaintiff in June 2023 and
Plaintiff has waited mere months before trial to amend the FAC to include this
demand. (Opp’n. p. 2.)
If the court were to grant Plaintiff’s
motion, Defendants would face prejudicial circumstances. If granted, Plaintiff’s
motion would interfere with Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, as
Defendants would have no opportunity to address the new causes of action.
(Opp’n., p. 6.)  Granting the motion
would likely require a continuance of the summary judgment motion and the trial
date to permit additional discovery, including written discovery and retaking
of depositions to address the issues surrounding Plaintiff’s alleged disability
and whether Defendants discriminated against Plaintiff because of that
disability. In the meantime, both parties will suffer the prejudice of additional
costs incurred in proving and defending against the newly proposed causes of
action. "Prejudice exists where the proposed amendment would
require delaying the trial, resulting in added costs of preparation and
increased discovery burdens." (Miles v. City of LA. (2020) 56
Cal.App.5th 728, 739.) 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion for leave to
amend is denied.  
Defendants are ordered to give notice.
