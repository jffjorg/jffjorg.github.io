```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the County's motion for summary judgment or adjudication in this case. The Plaintiff, Ross, alleged three negligence-related claims and two FEHA violations against the County, claiming that the County was liable for not switching her retirement plan from Plan E to Plan D. However, the Judge found that the Plaintiff did not establish that the County owed a duty to help her select her retirement plan or complete her paperwork to switch plans. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff did not identify an adverse employment action to support her FEHA retaliation and failure to prevent retaliation claims. As a result, the Judge granted summary adjudication for the County on the Plaintiff's state law negligence claims and FEHA claims. The County is entitled to summary judgment, and the Judge has ordered the County to prepare, file, and serve a proposed judgment.
