And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to Anthem Blue Cross Life and Health Insurance Company's motion to seal portions of its evidence in support of its motion for summary judgment. Anthem is seeking to seal confidential and proprietary financial information and personally identifying information of non-parties. The Judge finds that Anthem has filed a proper motion and declaration, and that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest. The Judge grants Anthem's motion to seal, requiring notice to be given.
