And here is the English summary:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's unopposed motion to compel further responses from the defendant to discovery requests, specifically Request No. 17, which seeks documents concerning Doe Defendant 1. The plaintiff alleges childhood sexual assault, abuse, and harassment by Doe Defendant 1, and the defendant seeks declaratory relief and indemnity. The court finds that the defendant's objections to the request are without merit, and that the request is relevant to the plaintiff's claims. The court also finds that the defendant's privacy objections are without merit, and that the plaintiff's need for the requested information outweighs the defendant's privacy interests. The court grants the plaintiff's motion and orders the defendant to provide further code-compliant responses to the request within 30 days.
