On August 11, 2023, plaintiff Nora D.
Giralt (“Plaintiff”) filed this action asserting causes of action for fraud,
conversion, and breach of contract against defendants Norma Perez (“Defendant”)
and Maria Gabriela Posadas. Plaintiff alleges that she gave $36,880 to
Defendant after Defendant promised she would “invest the money and would then
return the money to [Plaintiff] with 100% interest.” (See, e.g., Compl.,
¶¶ 7, 17, 27, 36.) 
On November 27, 2023, Defendant filed a
responsive pleading with title “Answer to complaint AND COUNTERCLAIMS.DENIALS
AND OBJECTIONS TO PLEADINGS CCP SECTION § 430.50.” 
On December 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
motion to strike Defendant’s counterclaims on the grounds: (1) that
counterclaims have been abolished in California and that any cross-claims must
be asserted in a separate cross-complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 428.80 and (2) Defendant’s attempt to bring cross-claims on behalf of
co-defendant Gabriela Posadas and Does 1 through 10 constitutes the
unauthorized practice of law because Defendant is self-represented and not an
attorney. 
On December 29, 2023, Defendant filed
an amended responsive pleading entitled “First Amendment -Answer to
Complaint-DENIALS AND OBJECTIONS TO PLEADINGS CCP SECTION § 430.50” (referred
to herein as the “First Amended Answer”). 
Defendant’s First Amended Answer
renders Plaintiff’s motion to strike moot. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 472(a), “[a] party may amend its pleading once without leave of the
court at any time . . . after a . . . motion to strike is filed but before the .
. . motion to strike is heard if the amended pleading is filed and served no
later than the date for filing an opposition to the . . . motion to strike.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 472, subd. (a).) 
Here, the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion
to strike was scheduled for January 31,2024. 
Therefore, any opposition brief had to be filed by January 18, 2024.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b) [opposition brief to motion due 9 court
days before hearing date].) Accordingly, Defendant’s First Amended Answer is
timely and Plaintiff’s motion to strike is taken off calendar as moot. 
 
Dated
this 31st
day of January, 2024
