Layla
 Toma seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for defendant
 Atlantic Restaurant, Inc. (“Defendant”) on grounds that there has
 been an irreparable breakdown of the working relationship between counsel and
 client. Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request
for withdrawal should be granted. (People v. Prince (1968) 268
Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
Counsel’s Motion complies with
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. The Court notes that trial in this
matter is not yet set and no prejudice will result from granting this motion.
Accordingly, this unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon
filing a proof of service showing service of this Order on Defendant
and all parties who have appeared.
Moving party to give notice.
 
Dated
this 31st
day of January 2024
