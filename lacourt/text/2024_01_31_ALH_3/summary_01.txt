Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in response to a motion to quash a deposition subpoena issued by Gosdom, Inc. to East West Bank. The subpoena seeks documents relating to the bank accounts of Keqing Deng, a defendant in the case, from January 2019 to the present. The plaintiff, DL Trucking, Inc., and Keqing Deng (collectively, "Moving Parties") argue that the subpoena is defective because Keqing Deng does not live at the address listed on the notice to consumer, and that the subpoena violates their right to privacy. The court finds that the notice to consumer was defective and that the subpoena is overbroad. The court grants the motion to quash the subpoena and orders that only records from May 2020 to the present and records reflecting transactions between Keqing Deng, Gosdom, Inc., and the parties to the case be produced. The court notes that the subpoena was not properly served on Keqing Deng and that the records sought are not relevant to the case.
