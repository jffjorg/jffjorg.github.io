The motion was filed on the grounds of an irreparable breakdown of the working relationship between counsel and client. The Court found that granting the motion will not result in prejudice, as trial in this matter has not yet been set. The Court cited People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406, which states that an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted absent a showing of resulting prejudice. The Court also noted that the motion complies with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. The motion is granted and will become effective upon filing a proof of service showing service of the Order on the defendant and all parties who have appeared.
