Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Nora D. Giralt's motion to strike Defendant Norma Perez and Maria Gabriela Posadas' counterclaims. The motion was filed on December 26, 2023, and the hearing was scheduled for January 31, 2024. However, Defendant filed an amended responsive pleading on December 29, 2023, which renders the motion to strike moot. The judge finds that the amended pleading was timely filed, and therefore, the motion to strike is taken off calendar as moot.
