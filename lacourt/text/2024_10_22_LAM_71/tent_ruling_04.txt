 Hearing Date:  October 22, 2024



 
The Court denies Plaintiff’s default judgment
packet.  
The Court sets a hearing on an order to show
cause why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or Plaintiff’s counsel
sanctioned $250 for failing to enter default judgment (California Rule of
Court, rule 3.110(h)) on November 22, 2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at
Stanley Mosk Courthouse for the following reasons:

1.    
No summary of the case.
 
2.    
No exhibits in support of Plaintiff’s
declaration to support damages.
 
3.    
Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees
is not calculated according to Local Rule of the Court, rule 3.214(a), which
provides: 
 
When a
promissory note, contract, or statute provides for the recovery of reasonable
attorneys’ fees, the following schedule will apply to the amount of the new
judgement unless otherwise determined by the court.
 
$0.01 to $1,000,
15% with a minimum of $75.00;
$1,000.01 to
$10,000, $150 plus 6% of the excess over $1,000;
$10,000.01 to
$50,000, $690 plus 3% of the excess over $10,000;
$50,000.01 to
$100,000, $1,890 plus 2% of the excess over $50,000;
Over $100,000,
$2,890 plus 1% of the excess over $100,000.
 
The Court
calculates attorneys’ fees as follows: $690 + ($6,000 x .03) = $870.00
