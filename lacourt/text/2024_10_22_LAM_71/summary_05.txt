And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's claims and has stayed the action pending arbitration. The motion was brought by defendants Aric Entwistle, Maya Entwistle, and Sheldon Draimin, who alleged that the arbitration clause in the contract with the plaintiff is enforceable. The plaintiff had argued that the defendants waived their right to arbitration, but the Judge found that the plaintiff failed to meet its burden of proving waiver.

The Judge also denied the defendants' request for sanctions against the plaintiff, as the notice of motion did not specify the statute under which the sanctions were requested.

The case is stayed pending arbitration, and the parties are directed to submit a joint statement five calendar days in advance, apprising the Court of the status of the arbitration. A non-appearance case review is set for October 22, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.
