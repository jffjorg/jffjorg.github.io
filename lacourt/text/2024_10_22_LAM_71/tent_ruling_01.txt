Request for Judicial Notice

Background
This is a lemon law action
brought under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“SBA”).  Plaintiff accepted Defendant’s C.C.P. §998
offer of compromise (“998 Offer”) on October 19, 2023,
in the amount of $50,000.00 plus attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses by
motion.  (Decl. of Castro ¶47, Exh. 2.)  
On
April 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for attorneys’ fees.  On October 9, 2024, Defendant filed its
opposition.  On October 15, 2024,
Plaintiff filed his reply.
 
Discussion
Civil Code §1794(d) provides that a
buyer who prevails in an action under that section, “shall be allowed by the
court to recover as a part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount
of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and the prosecution of such action.” 
C.C.P. §998(c)(1) provides as follows:
“If an offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff fails to
obtain a more favorable judgment or
award, the plaintiff shall not recover his or her post offer costs and shall pay the defendant’s costs from the time of the
offer.”  (C.C.P. §998(c)(1).) 
“In determining whether the plaintiff obtains a more
favorable judgment, the court . . . shall exclude the post offer costs.”  (C.C.P. §998(c)(2)(A).)  “If an offer made by a defendant is not
accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award,
the costs under this section, from the time of the offer, shall be deducted
from any damages awarded in favor of the plaintiff.”  (C.C.P. §998(e).)
Section 998’s plain language only
penalizes plaintiffs who “fail[] to obtain a more favorable judgment or award”
than a §998 offer by cutting off their post-offer costs and requiring them to
pay “defendant’s [post-offer] costs” out of any “damages awarded.”  (C.C.P. §§998(c)(1), (e).) 
A party who settles cannot “fail” to
obtain a more favorable “judgment or award.” “Fail[ure]” connotes defeat,
abandonment, or “[i]nvoluntarily” falling short of one’s purpose.  (Madrigal v. Hyundai Motor America (2023)
90 Cal.App.5th 385, 413-414, citing Burton’s Legal Thesaurus (3d ed. 1998) p.
228, col. 1, Black’s Law Dict. (rev. 4th ed. 1968) at pg. 711, col. 1; accord
Cambridge Dict. Online (2023) [“fail” means “to not succeed in what you are
trying to achieve”].)  Section 998(d) is
explicit: A “judgment or award entered pursuant to this section shall be deemed
to be a compromise settlement.” 
(C.C.P. §998(d).) 
Here, Plaintiff is the prevailing party
and is entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to the 998 Offer.  (See Decl. of Castro ¶47, Exh. 2 at ¶5.)  Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion is proper.
 
Civil Code §1794(d)
Civil Code §1794(d) provides, “[i]f the
buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by
the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate
amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time
expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer
in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.”
 
Reasonable
Fees
To calculate
a lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by the Plaintiff’s counsel. The Supreme Court of California
has concluded that a reasonable hourly lodestar rate is the prevailing rate for
private attorneys “conducting non-contingent litigation of the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1133, emphasis added.)
Plaintiff’s
Counsel declares the following hourly rates: (1) Olivia Avelino at $595 per
hour; (2) Angel M. Baker at $595 per hour; (3) Joey DeLeon at $575 per hour;
(4) Tionna Carvalho at $570 per hour; (5) Mark Gibson at $495 per hour; (6) Elizabeth
Larocque at $595 per hour in 2022, and $595 in 2024; (7) Daniel Law at $440 per
hour; (8) Jami Littles at $595 per hour; (9) Rebecca Neubauer at $435 per hour
in 2022, and $495 in 2023; (10) Steve Rangel (law clerk) at $285 per hour; (11)
Ezra Ryu at $400 per hour; (12) Nino Sanaia at $38 per hour in 2022 and $425
per hour in 2023; (13) Tyson Smith at $460 per hour in 2022 and $475 per hour
in 2023; (14) Rabiya Tirmizi at $360 per hour in 2022 and $375 per hour in 2023;
(15) Sanam Vaziri at $610 per hour; and (16) Steven Whang at $475 per hour.  (Decl. of Shahian ¶¶44-75, Exh. 20 at pg. 4.)  Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated his
counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable in their community of practice in their
specialized area of law.  (Decl. of Shahian
¶¶44-75, Exh. 20 at pg. 4.)  
Defendant’s
opposition objects to the reasonableness of Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rates.  The Court finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s rates
to be reasonable and do not warrant a reduction.  
 
Billed
Hours
The party
seeking fees and costs bears the burden to show “the fees incurred were
allowable, were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.”  (Nightingale
v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) 
In this
case, the declarations and billing records provided by Plaintiff’s counsel are
sufficient to meet the burden of proving the reasonableness of the claimed fees
in terms of amounts and tasks. To satisfy this burden, evidence and
descriptions of billable tasks must be presented in sufficient detail, enabling
the court to evaluate whether the case was overstaffed, the time attorneys
spent on specific claims, and the reasonableness of the hours expended.  (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)
Plaintiff’s
fee recovery is based on 125.6 hours Plaintiff’s counsel spent litigating this
case through the instant motion.  (See Decl. of Shahian,
Exh. 20 at pg. 3.)[1]  The fees incurred are reasonable, as captured
in the billing records submitted to this Court. 
(Decl. of Shahian, Exh. 20.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel’s billing records reflect the actual time and clear
descriptions of services performed in connection with litigating this
case.  Although the submission of such
detailed time records is not necessary under California law, if submitted, such
records “are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the
records are erroneous.”  (Horsford v.
Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 396.)
Defendant
objects to several of Plaintiff’s requested fees on the basis they were not
reasonably incurred.
First,
Defendant objects to 24.9 hours billed ($275.00) to draft a motion to compel
further responses.  (Opposition, pg. 8.)  Defendant’s objection is not well taken;
Defendant merely concludes, “it does not make sense for Plaintiff’s Counsel to
spend more than a handful of hours, including the time to perform legal
research; however, that was evidently not necessary here as the paragraphs
pertaining to Plaintiff’s legal analysis is identical to SLP’s other motions
used in previous cases.”  General
arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not
suffice.  (Premier Medical
Management Systems, Inc. v. California Insurance Guarantee Association (2008) 163
Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)  Therefore,
Defendant fails to meet its burden to challenge this fee.
Second,
Defendant objects to 2.9 hours ($1,230.50) billed drafting discovery requests
on the basis Plaintiff’s responses were templated.  (See Opposition, pg. 9.)  Defendant’s objection is not well taken;
Defendant does not cite any authority stating discovery responses that are
presumed to be templated should be reduced. 
Therefore, Defendant fails to meet its burden to challenge this fee.
Third,
Defendant objects to 3.1 hours ($1,844.50) billed for work related to reviewing
Defendant’s discovery responses and drafting a meet and confer letter.  (Opposition, pg. 9.)  For the same reasons stated with respect to
the second objection, Defendant fails to meet its burden to challenge this fee.
Fourth,
Defendant objects to 3.0 hours ($1,425.00) billed to analyze Defendant’s
supplemental responses and document production and draft and meet and confer correspondence.  (Opposition, pgs. 9-10.)  For the same reasons stated with respect to
the second objection, Defendant fails to meet its burden to challenge this fee.
Fifth,
Defendant objects to 5.1 hours ($3,034.50) to begin to draft a fee motion and
its supporting documents.  (Opposition,
pg. 10.)  Defendant’s objection is not
well taken; Defendant does not cite any authority stating that a brief presumed
to be templated should be reduced. 
Therefore, Defendant fails to meet its burden to challenge this fee.
Sixth,
Defendant objects to 2.2 hours ($1,309.00) to continue drafting the fee motion
and supporting documents.  (Opposition,
pg. 10.)  Defendant objects on the basis
that “[c]ontinued preparation” for this Motion is vague and should constitute a
fraction of a billable hour, if anything, and that the supporting declarations
are largely copy-paste, with little to no tailoring to this specific case.  (Id.) 
Defendant’s objection is not well taken because the billing entry is not
too vague.  Therefore, Defendant fails to
meet its burden to challenge these fees.
Seventh,
Defendant objects to “numerous block-billed entries.”  (Opposition, pg. 10.)  General arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.  (Premier Medical Management Systems,
Inc. v. California Insurance Guarantee Association (2008) 163
Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)  Therefore,
Defendant fails to meet its burden to challenge these unspecified fees. 
Finally,
Defendant objects to any fees incurred after it offered Plaintiff $10,000.00 in
attorneys’ fees in its C.C.P. §998 offer on October 11, 2023.  (Opposition, pg. 12.)  Defendant does not provide any case law in
support of the proposition that “Plaintiff’s Counsel was offered more than they
had reasonably incurred, [but] . . . refused AHM’s offer and instead insisted
that fees and costs be determined by motion.  Plaintiff’s Counsel should not be rewarded for
refusing a reasonable offer and proceeding to filing a motion for fees/costs.” (Opposition,
pg. 12.)  If Defendant only wished to
offer attorneys’ fees for a fixed sum in its §998 Offer, then it was fully in
control of the substance of its offer. 
Therefore, Defendant fails to meet its burden to challenge these
unspecified fees.
Plaintiff
also requests an additional $3,500.00 to review Defendant’s opposition to this
motion, draft the reply, and attend this hearing.  Defendant does not specifically object to
these fees.
Accordingly,
the Court grants Plaintiff’s requested attorneys’ fees in the total amount of $69,739.50.
 
Final
Lodestar Determination
The Court
denies Plaintiffs’ request for a 1.35 lodestar multiplier.  Given the routine work done in this case and
the results obtained in this lemon law area, a multiplier is not appropriate.
Any contingency risk factor is already accounted for in the hourly rates, which
the Court has found to be reasonable.
 
Costs
Plaintiff
requests a total of $9,463.41 in costs and expenses.  (Motion, pg. 14.)  Defendant does not challenge Plaintiff’s
request for costs.  
Accordingly,
the Court grants Plaintiff’s request for costs and expenses in the amount of
$9,463.41.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion for
attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses is granted in the reduced total amount of
$79,202.91, consisting of $69,739.50
in attorneys’ fees and $9,463.41 in costs and expenses.
