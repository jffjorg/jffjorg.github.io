And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees and costs in the reduced total amount of $79,202.91. The Plaintiff, Edgar J. Morales, had requested a total of $102,386.74 in attorneys' fees and costs from Defendant American Honda Motor Co. However, the Court found that the Plaintiff's counsel's hourly rates were reasonable and that the fees incurred by Plaintiff's counsel were reasonable and necessary to the conduct of the litigation.

The Court denied Plaintiff's request for a 1.35 lodestar multiplier, finding that the routine work done in this case and the results obtained in this lemon law area did not justify a multiplier. The Court also denied Defendant's objections to various fees claimed by Plaintiff's counsel, finding that Defendant failed to meet its burden to challenge these fees.

The Court granted Plaintiff's request for costs and expenses in the amount of $9,463.41. The Court also granted Plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees in the amount of $69,739.50.
