 Case No.: 
  24STCV12725
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  October 22, 2024



 
Defendants Aric Entwistle’s and Maya
Entwistle’s motion to compel arbitration of Plaintiff Jayco/Lawson General
Engineering, Inc.’s claims in this action is granted. This case is stayed
pending arbitration and mediation.
The Court sets a non-appearance case review for October 22, 2025, at 8:30
a.m.  The parties are directed to submit
a joint statement five calendar days in advance, apprising the Court of the
status of the arbitration.
Defendant Sheldon
Draimin’s motion is denied on the basis default was entered against him on
August 19, 2024.
Defendants’
request for sanctions is denied.
 
Defendants Aric Entwistle (“Aric”), Maya Entwistle (“Maya”), and
Sheldon Draimin (“Draimin”) (collectively, “Defendants”) move for an order
compelling arbitration of all claims asserted by Plaintiff Jayco/Lawson General
Engineering, Inc. (“Jayco”) (“Plaintiff”) and to stay the action pending
arbitration and mediation before the Contractors State License Board (“CSLPB”).  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 2-3; C.C.P. §§1281.2,
1281.4.)  Defendants also request
sanctions against Plaintiff and its counsel, The Green Firm, PC, in the amount
of $5,000.00.  (Notice of Motion, pgs.
2-3.)
 
Background
On May 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed its operative complaint
(“Complaint”) against Defendants alleging six causes of action: (1) breach of
contract; (2) work, labor, and materials furnished/agreed price; (3) open-book
account; (4) account stated; (5) reasonable value/work, labor, and services
(quantum meruit); and (6) foreclosure of Mechanics Lien.  
Plaintiff entered default against Defendant Draimin on August 19,
2024. 
Defendants filed the instant motion on August 20, 2024.  Plaintiff filed its opposition on October 9,
2024.  Defendants filed their reply on
October 15, 2024.
 
Motion to Compel Arbitration
          As a preliminary
matter, the instant motion can only be made by Maya and Aric because default
has been entered against Draimin on August 19, 2024.  (8/19/24 Request for Entry of Default.)
          Once a default is
entered against a defendant, they generally cannot file a response or
participate in the case until the default is set aside.  (See Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault,
Inc.  (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381.)
          Here, Draimin has
not moved to set aside the default; therefore, Draimin cannot move with
Defendants on the instant motion.
 
A.  Arbitration Agreement
1.    
The Arbitration
Agreements are enforceable
Federal
law provides for enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. The Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1, et seq. (“FAA”), establishes a strong
federal policy in favor of arbitration of disputes where a written arbitration
agreement exists. Section 2 of the FAA provides, in pertinent part that “[a]
written provision . . . to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter
arising out of such contract . . .  shall
be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable.”  (9 U.S.C. §2.) 
The purpose of the FAA is to “reverse the longstanding judicial
hostility to arbitration agreements.” (Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane
Corp. (1991) 500 U.S. 20, 24.)  The
FAA places arbitration agreements “on an equal footing with other contracts and
[requires courts] to enforce them according to their terms.”  (AT&T Mobility, LLC v. Concepcion (2011)
563 U.S. 333, 339; see also Rent-A-Center West, Inc. v. Jackson (2010)
561 U.S. 63, 67 [“The FAA reflects the fundamental principle that arbitration
is a matter of contract.”].)  The FAA
will preempt not only a state law that “discriminat[es] on its face against
arbitration,” but also a state law that “covertly accomplishes the same
objective by disfavoring contracts that (oh so coincidentally) have the
defining features of arbitration agreements.”  (Kindred Nursing Centers Limited
Partnership v. Clark (2017) 137 S.Ct. 1421, 1426.)
The
FAA restricts a court’s inquiry related to compelling arbitration to two
threshold questions: (1) whether there was an agreement to arbitrate between
the parties; and (2) whether the agreement covers the dispute.  (Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. (2002)
537 U.S. 79, 84.)  Here, both criteria
are satisfied. First, Plaintiff agreed to arbitration when is agent, contractor
Jason Twedell (“Twedell”), entered into the home improvement contract
(“Contract”) with Maya, on behalf of Defendants, on February 23, 2024, which
contained an arbitration clause (“Arbitration
Clause”).  (Decl. of Maya ¶3, Exh. A at pgs. 7-8.)  Second, the Arbitration Clause expressly covers “[a]ny controversy or claim
arising out of or relating to this contract, or breach thereof” between Plaintiff
and Defendants.  (Decl. of Maya ¶3, Exh.
A at pgs. 7-8.)  
California
law also favors arbitration for dispute resolution. The California Arbitration
Act (“CAA”), codified at C.C.P. §1281 et seq., provides, “A written
agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy
thereafter arising is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such
grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.”  (C.C.P. §1281; see also Grafton Partners
L.P. v. Superior Court (2005) 36 Cal.4th 944, 955 [“[U]nlike predispute
jury waivers, predispute arbitration agreements are specifically authorized by
statute.”].)  
“California
law, like federal law, favors enforcement of valid arbitration agreements.”  (Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare
Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 97, 99.)  The public policy in favor of arbitration is
so strong that California courts have held that an employee is “bound by the
provisions of the [arbitration] agreement regardless of whether [he] read it or
[was] aware of the arbitration clause when [he] signed the document.”  (Brookwood v. Bank of America (1996)
45 Cal.App.4th 1667, citing Macaulay v. Norlander (1992) 12 Cal.App.4th
1.)  The only prerequisite for a court to
order arbitration is a determination that the parties have entered into an
agreement to arbitrate the dispute.  (United
Transportation Union v. Southern California Rapid Transit District (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 804, 808.)  Thus, arbitration
must be ordered “unless the agreement clearly does not apply to the dispute in
question.”  (Vianna v. Doctors’
Management Co. (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1186, 1189.)
Defendants
proved the existence of an arbitration agreement with Plaintiff.  Defendants submitted evidence that on February
23, 2024, Plaintiff executed the Contract containing the Arbitration Clause.  (Decl.
of Maya ¶3, Exh. A.)
Plaintiff
argues in opposition that Draimin and Aric are not signatories to the Contract
and therefore cannot be considered parties to the provisions of the Arbitration
Clause.  Plaintiff’s argument is
unavailing.  Plaintiff’s Complaint
explicitly alleges:
On or about February 23,
2024, Plaintiff, by and through Jason Twedell, and Defendant SHELDON
DRAIMIN, an individual (“DRAIMIN”), Defendant ARIC ENTWISTLE (“ARIC”), an
individual, and Defendant MAYA ENTWISTLE (“MAYA”), and DOES 1 through 50
(hereafter, “Defendants”) by and through Defendants DRAIMIN and MAYA, entered
into a written agreement (the “Agreement”) under which Plaintiff agreed to and
did provide work, labor, services, equipment, and materials for Defendants’
real property located at 3123 Johnston Street, Los Angeles, CA 90031
(hereinafter the “Subject Property”), and for which Defendants agreed to pay
Plaintiff for their services in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. A
true and correct copy of the Agreement is included herewith and incorporated by
reference as Exhibit “1.”
 
(Complaint ¶12,
emphasis added.)  
California
law holds that broadly worded arbitration clauses using the phrases “arising
out of” or related to,” cover the widest possible range of disputes, including extracontractual
disputes such as (but not limited to) tort claims.  (See, e.g., Howard v. Goldbloom (2018)
30 Cal.App.5th 659, 663-664; Khalatian v. Prime Time Shuttle, Inc. (2015)
237 Cal.App.4th 651, 660.)  “Doubts as to
whether an arbitration clause applies to a particular dispute are to be
resolved in favor of sending the parties to arbitration. The court should order
them to arbitrate unless it is clear that the arbitration clause cannot be interpreted
to cover the dispute.”  (United
Transportation Union v. Southern California Rapid Transit District (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 804, 808.)
Here,
the Contract states that Plaintiff submitted its “proposal for material and
labors to be supplied at the sole request and order of . . . Sheldon Draimin
[,] . . .  Aric@h2odesignllc.com[, and]
Maya Entwistle.”  (Decl. of Maya ¶3, Exh.
A at pg. 1.)  A plain reading of the
Contract demonstrates that Aric and Draimin are intended to be parties to the
Contract.  
Moreover,
Plaintiff’s own Complaint alleges Maya, Aric, and Draimin entered into the
Contract.  (Complaint ¶12.)  Pleadings set forth “the formal allegations
by the parties of their respective claims and defenses.”  (Myers v. Trendwest Resorts, Inc.
(2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 735, 746, quoting C.C.P. §420.)  When the pleadings contain allegations of
fact in support of a claim, the opposing party may rely on the statements as judicial
admissions.  (Id., citing St.
Paul Mercury Insurance Co. v. Frontier Pacific Insurance Co. (2003) 111
Cal.App.4th 1234, 1248.)  “[A] pleader
cannot blow hot and cold as to the facts positively stated.”  (Brown v. City of Fremont (1978) 75
Cal.App.3d 141, 146.)  Plaintiff cannot
allege that Maya, Aric, and Draimin entered into the Contract, and then argue
on this motion that they cannot be considered parties to the Arbitration Clause
in the Contract.
Defendants
also submitted evidence that Draimin and Aric authorized Maya to execute the
Contract on their behalf, and that they were advised that the Contract included
an arbitration clause.  (See Decl.
of Aric ¶¶4-6; Decl. of Draimin ¶¶4-5.)
Finally,
Plaintiff’s argument that Defendants waived their right to arbitration is
unavailing.  To establish waiver under
generally applicable contract law, the party opposing enforcement of a
contractual agreement must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the
waiving party knew of the contractual right and intentionally relinquished or
abandoned it.  (Lynch v. California
Coastal Commission (2017) 3 Cal.5th 470, 475; see Waller v. Truck
Insurance Exchange, Inc. (1995) 11 Cal.4th 1, 31, [burden is on party
claiming waiver “to prove it by clear and convincing evidence”].)  Under the clear and convincing evidence
standard, the proponent of a fact must show that it is “highly probable” the
fact is true.  (Conservatorship of
O.B. (2020) 9 Cal.5th 989, 995.)  The
waiving party’s knowledge of the right may be “actual or constructive.”  (Outboard Marine Corp. v. Superior Court
(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 30, 41.)  Its
intentional relinquishment or abandonment of the right may be proved by
evidence of words expressing an intent to relinquish the right or of conduct
that is so inconsistent with an intent to enforce the contractual right as to
lead a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the party had abandoned it.  (Lynch, 3 Cal.5th at pg. 475.)
Here,
Plaintiff has not met its burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that
Defendants knew of their contractual right to arbitrate and intentionally
relinquished or abandoned it. 
Participation in a Case Management Conference and filing a Case
Management Conference Statement is not so inconsistent with an intent to
enforce a contractual right to arbitration.[1]
Based
on the foregoing, Defendants proved the existence of a valid Arbitration Clause
that is enforceable by Defendants. 
 
2.    
Covered Claims
The
Arbitration Clause states that “[a]ny
controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or breach
thereof, shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the
construction industry arbitration rules of the American Arbitration
Association, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.”  (Decl. of Maya ¶3, Exh. A at pgs. 7-8.)  Plaintiff’s claims arise out of the Contract
for home improvement services.  (See
Complaint ¶12, Exh. 1.)  Plaintiff’s argument
in opposition that equitable estoppel cannot be applied to require Plaintiff to
arbitrate its 5th and 6th Causes of Action for Quantum Meruit and Foreclosure
of a Mechanic’s Lien, respectively, against Draimin or Aric is unavailing given
the broadly worded claims stated in the Arbitration Clause.  (Howard, 30 Cal.App.5th 663-664; Khalatian,
237 Cal.App.4th at pg. 660.)  Plaintiff’s
Sixth Cause of Action for foreclosure of mechanics lien alleges: 
Defendants[] entered
into the Agreement with Plaintiff to perform and provide certain
construction work, labor, services, equipment, and materials in and upon the
Subject Property. Based upon this Agreement, Plaintiff provided work,
labor, services, equipment, and materials for an agreed-upon price as herein
stated to the Defendants, which is also the reasonable value of services
provided by Plaintiff and used in said work of improvement.  
 
(Complaint
¶25, emphasis added.)
          Plaintiff’s own pleading states that
its causes of action arise out of
or relate to the Contract.
Based
on the foregoing, Defendants met their burden of establishing the Arbitration Clause
covers the causes of action asserted in Plaintiff’s Complaint.
 
C.   
Stay of Current
Action
Pursuant
to C.C.P. §1281.4, if an application has been made to a court involving order
to arbitrate a controversy and such application is undetermined, the court
where the application is pending shall, upon motion of a party to the action,
stay the action until the application for an order to arbitrate is determined.  (C.C.P. §1281.4.)
Accordingly,
this case is stayed pending arbitration.
 
D.  
Sanctions
Defendants’
request for sanctions against Plaintiff does not specify in the notice of
motion the statute under which issuance of sanctions is requested.  Therefore, Plaintiff is not provided adequate
notice regarding the sanctions. 
Accordingly, Defendants’ request for sanctions is denied.
 
E.   
Conclusion
Defendants’
motion to compel arbitration is granted. 

The case is
stayed pending arbitration. The Court sets a non-appearance case review for October
22, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.  The parties are
directed to submit a joint statement five calendar days in advance, apprising
the Court of the status of the arbitration.
Defendants’
request for sanctions is denied.
Moving Party to
give notice.
