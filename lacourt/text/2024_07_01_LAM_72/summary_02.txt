The judge has granted the motion to strike, finding that the plaintiff has failed to adequately plead facts that would support a claim for punitive damages. The judge notes that the plaintiff's allegations are conclusory and lack specificity, and that the plaintiff has failed to identify any facts that would support a claim for punitive damages. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has failed to identify any evidence of malice, oppression, or fraud by the defendant.
