And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Neal S. Salisman and Tyler E. Sanchez, attorneys for Defendant Rideshare Car Rentals LLC. The attorneys' declarations state that the client did not voluntarily consent to their request to be relieved, which is why they filed the motion. The court cites People v. Prince (1968) and Merco Constr. Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978) to support its decision, stating that absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted. The court also notes that corporations may not represent themselves, so Defendant Rideshare Car Rentals LLC should immediately find new counsel.
