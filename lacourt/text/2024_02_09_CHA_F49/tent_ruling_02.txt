Defendant Rideshare Car Rentals LLC, seek to be relieved as counsel for that
party.¿Counsel filed a motion with the required Forms MC-051, MC-052, and
MC-053. Counsel’s declarations states that the client did not voluntarily
consent to counsel’s request to be relieved, which is why they filed this
motion. 
 
Absent a
showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.¿(People v. Prince¿(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)¿There is no
showing of prejudice, and counsel’s motion complies with California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362 and meets its requirements.

noting that corporations may not represent themselves. (Merco Constr.
Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724.) Defendant
Rideshare Car Rentals LLC should immediately find new counsel.
