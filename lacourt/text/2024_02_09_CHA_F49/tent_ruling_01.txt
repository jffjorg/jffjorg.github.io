RELIEF
REQUESTED
Plaintiff Rick
Hamm Construction, Inc (Plaintiff) is requesting attorney fees in the amount of
$34,545.50, plus $2,250 for an additional 5 hours of attorney time related to
this motion, from Defendant Avex Builders, Inc. (Defendant)
 
SUMMARY OF
ACTION
 
In this case,
the parties settled in Plaintiff’s favor. As the prevailing party on contracts
containing provisions for attorney fees, Plaintiff is entitled to attorney
fees. Plaintiffs filed this motion pursuant to Civ. Code § 1717, which allows
for the recovery of attorney fees when a contract contains a fees provision.
Both the contracts between the parties and the settlement agreement allowed for
the recovery of attorney fees for the prevailing party.
 
Plaintiff is
requesting $36,795.50 in attorney fees from Defendant ($34,545.50 for the work
prior to this motion, plus an expected $2,250 related to this motion).
Plaintiff argues that the attorney fees that it has requested were reasonable
and necessary. Plaintiff’s attorney’s hourly rate has been $280, $335, and $450
an hour over the course of this case. (Lozano Decl., ¶ 27.)
 
Plaintiff has
also requested costs in the amount $2,254.69. However, costs are awarded
pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700. If Plaintiff wishes to
request costs, Plaintiff should file a memorandum of costs at the appropriate
time.
 
RULING: Motion
for attorney fees is granted. No costs will be awarded at this time.
 
A prevailing
party is entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees when authorized by contract,
statute, or law. (See CCP § 1033.5(a)(10); Cal. Civ. Code § 1717(a).) “A
successful party means a prevailing party, and [a party] may be considered
prevailing parties for attorney’s fees purposes if they succeed on any
significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties
sought in bringing suit.” (Bowman v. City of Berkeley (2005) 131
Cal.App.4th 173, 178.)
 
Plaintiff is
the prevailing party by virtue of the fact that the parties settled in
Plaintiff’s favor. Plaintiff has requested a total of $36,795.50 in attorney
fees.
 
Given the
nature of the case, the Court finds that the amount of attorney fees requested
by Plaintiff is reasonable. Additionally, the Court does not find that
Plaintiff’s hourly rates were unreasonable. The Court will not adjust the
amount of attorney fees requested by Plaintiff. 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion for attorney fees is granted in the amount of $36,795.50. Costs should
be requested in a memorandum of costs.
