And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment or adjudication on the plaintiff's claims for employment discrimination and retaliation. The defendant, Air-Sea Forwarders, Inc., argues that it terminated the plaintiff, Beena Raman, as part of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory staff reduction measure. The plaintiff claims that the termination was discriminatory because of her gender and national origin. The judge finds that the defendant has presented sufficient evidence to support its claim that the termination was legitimate and nondiscriminatory. The judge also finds that the plaintiff failed to establish a triable issue of fact on her claims, and therefore grants the defendant's motion.
