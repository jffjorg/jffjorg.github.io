And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented before today's hearing. The Plaintiff claims she was the "acting Office Manager" at the Defendant's company, but the Judge finds that this claim is based on her performance of job duties, which were later fulfilled by John Cohn in his capacity as Office Manager. The Plaintiff never actually held the position of Office Manager herself and never supervised another employee while employed with the Defendant. In contrast, John Cohn's appointment as Office Manager required him to supervise other employees. The Judge is skeptical of the Plaintiff's claim and finds that it is based on a misunderstanding of her role at the company.
