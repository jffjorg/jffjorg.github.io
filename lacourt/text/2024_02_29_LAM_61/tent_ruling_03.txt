[1]
Plaintiff contends she was the “acting Office Manager,” a position she contends
was later usurped by John Cohn. (PUMF No. 1.) But Plaintiff’s testimony on this
point is based on her performance of job duties, including ordering office
supplies and recording TSA compliance, which were later fulfilled by Cohn in
his capacity as Office Manager. (Opposition Exh. L at pp. 67–68; 85.) Plaintiff
never held the position of office manager herself, however. (Opposition Exh. N
at p. 65.)  


[2] Plaintiff
acknowledged in deposition that she never supervised another employee while
employed with Defendant..(Motion Exh. A at p. 81.) Plaintiff’s dispute of this
fact is based on her performance of non-supervisory duties later performed by
Cohn. Cohn’s office manager position, meanwhile, required supervising other
employees. (Motion Exh. B at p. 61.)
