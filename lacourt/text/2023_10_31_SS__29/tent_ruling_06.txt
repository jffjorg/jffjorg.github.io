 Case Number:  21STCV40687    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
The motions
to compel are GRANTED.
The requests
for sanctions are GRANTED in part.
Background
This
case arises out of an alleged vehicle accident on November 5, 2019. On November
4, 2021, Plaintiff Damien Allen (“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint asserting a
single cause of action for negligence against Defendants Francisca Irheta, Jose
Alvarado (“Defendants”), and Does 1 through 50. Defendants filed their answer
on May 22, 2023. 
Also on
May 22, Defendants served Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special
Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production of Documents (Set One)
on Plaintiff. (Webb Decls., ¶ 2 & Exh. A.) Plaintiff has not responded
to these discovery requests. (Id., ¶¶ 2-4.)  
Defendants
filed the three motions to compel that are currently before the Court on August
28, 2023. Plaintiff has not filed any opposition.
On October
10, 2023, the Court granted the motion of Plaintiff’s counsel to be relieved as
counsel.
Discussion
A
party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).) In addition, a party who fails to provide a timely
response generally waives all objections. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A
party must respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests
for production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 411.)
Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).) In addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally
waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.” Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
 
On May
22, 2034, Defendants served Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special
Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production of Documents (Set One)
on Plaintiff. (Webb Decls., ¶ 2 & Exh. A.) Plaintiff has not responded
to these discovery requests. (Id., ¶¶ 2-4.)  
Defendants need show nothing more. Their motions to
compel are GRANTED.
Defendants’ requests for sanctions are also GRANTED
in part. Given the relatively straightforward nature of a motion to compel
initial responses to discovery, and the economies of scale associated with preparing
multiple parallel motions, the Court sets sanctions on each motion in the
amount of $335.21, calculated as 1.25 hours of attorney time, multiplied by
counsel’s billing rate of $160.17 per hour; plus one hour of legal assistant
time, multiplied by the billing rate of $75 per hour; plus a $60 filing fee. (See
id., ¶ 6.)  
Conclusion
The
Court GRANTS Defendants’ three motions to compel.
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff to serve verified, written, code-compliant responses,
without objection, to Defendants’ Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special
Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) within
30 days of notice of this order.
The
Court GRANTS in part Defendants’ requests for sanctions.
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act
in the total amount of $1,005.63 ($335.21 per motion, multiplied by three
motions) to Defendants within 30 days of notice of this order.
Moving
parties to give notice.
