 Case Number:  23STCV13023    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
 
Defendant 1353 N. Avenue, LLC’s demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
Background
 
On June 7, 2023, Plaintiff Jennifer
Carrillo (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against 1353 N. Western Avenue, LLC (“Defendant”)
and DOES 1 through 50, asserting causes of action for (1) general
negligence and (2) premises liability. In her Complaint, Plaintiff alleged that
on or about July 13, 2021, Plaintiff was riding her electric scooter on a
sidewalk adjacent to Defendant’s premises, encountered a broken stretch of
sidewalk, struck it, fell off the scooter, and sustained injury. 
 
On September 5, 2023, the Court sustained
Defendant’s demurrer to the Complaint, with leave to amend. Plaintiff filed her
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on September 18, 2023.  
 
Defendant demurred to the FAC on October 4.
Plaintiff filed her opposition on October 18, and Defendant filed its reply on
October 20.
 
Legal Standard
 
A general
demurrer may be made on the grounds that the pleading does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).) In ruling on a demurrer, a court must read the allegations liberally and
in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power¿(2006) 144
Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) The court “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,
but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Berkley v. Dowds¿(2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) Moreover, a “demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the
evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects
appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v.
Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 [citations omitted]; see
also, e.g., Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) The only issue that the court may consider is whether
the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters (other than
judicially noticeable matters), states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)¿ 
¿ 
The
general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not
evidentiary facts.¿ (Doe v. City of Los Angeles¿(2007) 42 Cal.4th
531, 550.)¿ “All
that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter of pleading … is that his
complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable precision
and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the nature,
source and extent of his cause of action.”¿ (Rannard¿v. Lockheed Aircraft
Corp. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)¿¿Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of causes of
action, where some valid claim is alleged, but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.”¿ (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.¿(2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)¿¿
 
When a demurrer is sustained, courts generally must grant leave to amend “if there is any
reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.”¿ (Goodman v. Kennedy¿(1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 349.)
 
Meet and Confer
 
The demurrer is accompanied by the declaration of counsel that satisfies
the meet and confer requirements. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)
 
Discussion
 
First Cause of
Action for General Negligence
 
“To state a cause of action for negligence, a plaintiff must allege (1)
the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care, (2) the defendant breached
that duty, and (3) the breach proximately caused the plaintiff’s damages or
injuries.” (Lueras v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (2013) 221
Cal.App.4th 49, 62.)
 
Those who own, possess, or
control property generally have a duty to exercise ordinary care in managing
the property to avoid exposing others to an unreasonable risk of harm. (Annocki
v. Peterson Enterprises, LLC (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32, 37.) But “[a]
defendant cannot be held liable for the defective or dangerous condition of
property which it did not own, possess, or control. (Isaacs v. Huntington
Memorial Hospital (1985) 38 Cal.3d 112, 134.)
 
“Under the common law, a landowner
does not have any duty to repair abutting sidewalks along a public street, and
does not owe any duty to pedestrians injured as a result of a defect in the
sidewalks.” (Jordan v. City of Sacramento (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1487,
1490 (citing Schaefer v. Lenahan (1944) 63 Cal.App.2d 324, 325).) Under
Streets and Highways Code section 5610, abutting property owners do bear the
duty to repair defects in the sidewalk, regardless of whether they created the
defects. (Id.; see also Jones v. Deeter (1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 798, 803.)
Nonetheless, under the so-called “Sidewalk Accident Doctrine,” abutting
property owners have no duty to members of the public in tort law, and are not liable
to members of the public, unless the property owner created the defect or
exercised dominion or control over the abutting sidewalk. (Lopez v. City of
Los Angeles (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 244, 255; Jordan, supra,
148 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1490-91 [Section 5610 “imposes a duty of repair on the
abutting property owners for defects in sidewalks, regardless of who created
the defects, but does not of itself create tort liability to injured
pedestrians or a duty to indemnify municipalities, except where a property
owner created the defect or exercised dominion or control over the abutting
sidewalk”]; see also Contreras v. Anderson (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 188,
196; Jones, supra, 152 Cal.App.3d at pp. 802-803.)
 
In the original Complaint, Plaintiff alleged that the accident occurred
not on property owned, maintained, managed, operated, or controlled by
Defendant but “on the sidewalk adjacent to” Defendant’s property. (Complaint, ¶
GN-1, PL-2, at p. 4 & ¶ Prem.L-1 at p. 5.) Accordingly, under the Sidewalk
Accident Doctrine, Plaintiff’s claims were not sufficient to state a cause of
action against Defendant. (See, e.g., Lopez, supra, 55 Cal.App.5th at
pp. 256-261.)
 
In the FAC, Plaintiff now alleges that Defendant “owned, maintained,
controlled, managed, and operated the premises and abutting sidewalk located at
1353 N. Western Avenue” and that the accident occurred on property that Defendant
“owned, maintained, controlled, managed, and operated.” (FAC, ¶¶ GN-1, PL-1 to
-2, at p. 4 & Prem.L-1, at p. 5.) Although Defendant dismisses this change
as a “minor adjustment” (Dem. at 1), it is anything but. In the Complaint,
Plaintiff alleged that the accident occurred on property abutting Defendant’s,
but there was no allegation that Defendant exercised any control over that site
of the accident. Now, in the FAC, in contrast, Plaintiff alleges that the site
of the accident was on property that Defendant owned, maintained, controlled,
managed, and operated. Ownership or control of property is an ultimate fact
that may be pleaded in general terms; detailed evidentiary pleading is not
required.
 
In sum, Plaintiff has cured the defect in her Complaint. Defendant’s
demurrer to the negligence cause of action in the FAC is OVERRULED. 
 
(Defendant’s argument regarding illegal use of a scooter involves matters
outside of the four corners of the FAC and so cannot be reached on demurrer.)
 
Second Cause of
Action for Premises Liability
 
“The elements of a cause of action for premises liability are the same as
those for negligence.” (Jones v. Awad (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 1200, 1207.)
Just as the allegations in the FAC are sufficient to support the cause of
action for general negligence, the allegations are sufficient to support a
cause of action against Defendant for premises liability. 
 
For that reason, Defendant’s demurrer to the second cause of action is
also OVERRULED.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s
demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
Defendant is
ordered to file a responsive pleading within 30 days.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
