And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Defendant's employees and PMQ witness without prejudice. The plaintiff had been attempting to schedule depositions of the employees and PMQ witness for several months, but Defendant had failed to produce the witnesses for deposition. The judge found that the plaintiff had not met the statutory requirements for an order compelling a deposition, as he had not presented evidence that the deposition was properly noticed and the deponent failed to appear and produce. The judge noted that Defendant must comply with its obligations under the Civil Discovery Act to produce its employees and PMQ witness for deposition, but the plaintiff may not obtain an order compelling a deposition without meeting the statutory requirements. The judge also declined to rule on a dispute about the topics included in the deposition notice, as there was not a procedurally proper motion to compel before the court.
