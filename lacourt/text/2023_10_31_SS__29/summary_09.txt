And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge grants the motion to continue trial in part. The lawsuit was filed on March 21, 2022, and alleges that the defendant, Six Flags Magic Mountain, was negligent in training, retention, and supervision, and that the physical altercation that occurred on June 29, 2021, was a result of their negligence. The defendant has requested a continuance, citing the need to complete discovery and to accommodate the scheduling of trial counsel. The Court finds good cause for a shorter continuance, but notes that the mere reservation of a hearing date for a potential motion for summary judgment is not sufficient grounds for a continuance. The trial is continued to mid-June 2024, and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
