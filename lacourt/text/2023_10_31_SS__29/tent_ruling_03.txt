 Case Number:  20STCV49186    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE:
 
The Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant
and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference
call. 
 
The Court has reviewed the Petition to
 Approve Compromise of Pending Action of a Minor (Alyvia Lopez, Age 9).
The Court is prepared to approve the following distribution:
 
            Attorney’s
Fees (40%) $46,000.00
            Medical
Expenses $6,189.62
            Costs
$7,830.43
            
            Total
Fees and Costs $60,020.05
 
            Total
Settlement $115,000.00
            Less
Credits -$60,020.05
            Net
Settlement $54,979.95
 
However, the Court finds that the
following deficiencies preclude granting the petition at this time: 
 
1.      Item
15 of the petition lists the net balance of proceeds for the claimant
$49,202.95 and Item 16(e) lists the total fees paid from proceeds of settlement
or judgment $64,947.30. However, calculations of the Item 16 section, i.e., the
requested attorney’s fees, medical expenses, and costs indicate that the net
balance of proceeds for the claimant should be $49,229.95 and total fees paid
from proceeds of settlement or judgment should be $65,770.05. This
inconsistency must be remedied;
 
2.      Item
18(b)(2) the amount of the settlement proceeds to be deposited in the insured
blocked account is left blank; 
 
3.      Petitioner
did not provide a declaration in support of the attorney’s fees requested
pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court (CRC), Rule 7.955(c). Further, the retainer
agreement only supports a fee of 40% for minors gross settlement amount, the
amount requested is 45% of the gross settlement proceeds. In addition, it is
unclear whether the guardian ad litem signed or approved the retainer agreement;

 
4.      Petitioner
did not submit a proposed order approving the petition on form MC-351;
 
5.      Petitioner
did not submit a proposed order for deposit of funds in compliance with CRC,
Rule 7.953. 
 
Accordingly,
the Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of a Minor (Bradley
Ramirez, Age 16) is CONTINUED to allow Counsel time to address the
above-identified issues. 
 
Counsel
is ordered to file a new updated petition, proposed order approving the
petition, proposed order for deposit of funds, declaration in support of the
attorney’s fees as outlined above. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
