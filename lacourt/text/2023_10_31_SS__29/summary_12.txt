And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is overruled. The plaintiff, Jennifer Carrillo, alleges that she was injured while riding her electric scooter on a sidewalk adjacent to the defendant's property, and that the defendant is liable for her injuries. The defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff's allegations were insufficient to state a cause of action. However, the judge has determined that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action for both general negligence and premises liability. The judge has also determined that the defendant's argument regarding the plaintiff's use of an illegal scooter is not relevant to the issues in the case and cannot be reached on demurrer. As a result, the defendant is ordered to file a responsive pleading within 30 days.
