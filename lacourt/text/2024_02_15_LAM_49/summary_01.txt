And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to vacate the voluntary dismissal of non-party defendants. The motion was opposed by the non-party defendants, who argued that the motion was not the correct procedural motion to bring the defendants back into the lawsuit. The judge agreed with this argument, stating that the parties should honor their agreement in good faith and stipulate bringing the defendants back into the lawsuit. The judge also suggested that the plaintiffs could file a request for leave to amend the complaint to add the dismissed defendants, or that a motion to enforce a settlement may be appropriate. The judge expressed doubts as to why the plaintiffs need the defendants back in the case at this time and questioned the practical necessity of the motion.
