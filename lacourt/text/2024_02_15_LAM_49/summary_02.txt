And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorney's Fees and Defendants' Motion to Strike or Tax Costs. The judge has granted Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorney's Fees in part, awarding them $22,000.00 in attorney's fees. The judge has also granted Defendants' Motion to Strike or Tax Item 16 for "Other" costs, striking or taxing a total of $369.89 from the cost memorandum. The judge has denied Defendants' Motion to Tax as to all other portions of Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Costs.

The judge found that the rates charged by Plaintiffs' attorneys were reasonable, and that the number of hours billed by Plaintiffs' counsel was reasonable. However, the judge reduced the amount of attorney's fees awarded to Plaintiffs due to excess staffing and inefficiencies in the litigation.

The judge also found that some of the costs sought by Plaintiffs were reasonable and necessary, but that others were not. The judge struck or taxed a total of $369.89 from the cost memorandum, including fees for court reporter services, electronic filing fees, and unnecessary copying and printing charges.
