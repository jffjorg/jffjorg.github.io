And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the motion of LA Century Law and their attorneys of record to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion was filed on November 14, 2023, and continued to February 21, 2024, with the requirement that counsel serve the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on Plaintiffs and Andrade, and file a proper proof of service prior to the continued hearing. However, counsel has not filed proofs of service of the proposed order on Plaintiffs or a proof of service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on Andrade. The Judge emphasizes the importance of compliance with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and orders counsel to give notice of this ruling and file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
