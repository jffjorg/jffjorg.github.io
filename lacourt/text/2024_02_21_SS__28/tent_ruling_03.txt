 Case Number:  21STCV16611    Hearing Date:   February 21, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On  May 3, 2021, Plaintiffs Mamdouh Hannalla ("Mamdouh Hannalla"), Nancy Kheila, and Veronica  Hannalla ("Veronica Hannalla"), a minor, by and through her guardian ad litem Mamdouh Hannalla, filed  this action against Defendants Mark Ryan Adams and Does 1-15 for motor vehicle  tort and general negligence.  On November  5, 2021, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to include Defendant Greg Vincent Adams  as Doe 6.  On  June 3, 2021, the Court appointed Mamdouh Hannalla to serve as  guardian ad litem for Veronica Hannalla.  On  December 8, 2021, Defendants Mark Ryan Adams and Greg Vincent Adams filed an  answer.  On  April 14, 2023, Mamdouh Hannalla filed a notice of settlement.  On  January 26, 2024, Petitioner Mamdouh  Hannalla (“Petitioner”) submitted a petition to approve minor’s compromise to  be heard on February 21, 2024.  PETITIONER’S REQUEST  Petitioner  Mamdouh Hannalla asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action  of Veronica Hannalla (“Claimant”).  DISCUSSION  Section  12 of the petition states that Claimant’s total medical expenses were $1,568.00  and this amount was reduced by $156.21 as the result of negotiated, statutory,  or contractual reductions.  This should  mean that the remaining $1,411.79 will be paid or reimbursed from the  settlement proceeds.  However, Section  12a(4) states that only $469.79 will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement  proceeds.  This leaves $942.00 in medical  expenses unaccounted for.  The  Court cannot approve the petition unless it shows that the minor’s compromise  will reimburse all of Claimant’s medical expenses that have not been reduced or  waived.  CONCLUSION  The  Court CONTINUES the hearing on the petition to approve the compromise of  Plaintiff Veronica Hannalla’s claims filed by Petitioner Mamdouh Hannalla to March 18, 2024 at 1:30 p.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse.  Petitioner  is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Petitioner  is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within  five days.
