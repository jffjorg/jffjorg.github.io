On October 12, 2022, the Court dismissed  Apollo without prejudice at Plaintiffs’ request.  On July 27, 2022, Defendant Smart & Final Stores  LLC (erroneously sued as Smart and Final Stores, Inc.)

The court, on motion, may relieve  that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,  2031.240, and 2031.280.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party making the demand may move for an order  compelling response to the demand.  “(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court  shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order  compelling a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including  the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in  addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter  7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  “(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent exceptional  circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or any attorney  of a party for failure to provide electronically stored information that has  been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of the routine, good  faith operation of an electronic information system.  “(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter  any obligation to preserve discoverable information.”  (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.)  B.   Interrogatories  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides:  “If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails  to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are  directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under  Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including  one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4  (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that  party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and  2030.240.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may  move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.  “(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any  party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to  compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject  to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other  circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails  to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those orders that are  just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a  terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In  lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).”  (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.)    DISCUSSION  On November  28, 2023, Defendant served (1) request for production of documents, set two,  (2) special interrogatories, set two, and (3) form interrogatories, set two, on  Juan Jimenez.  Juan  Jimenez did not provide timely responses.   Defendant filed motions to compel responses on January 22, 2024 and  January 23, 2024.  On January  23, 2024, Juan Jimenez’s counsel served responses to Defendant’s special  interrogatories, set two.  Defendant  asserts that the responses are “defective, non-responsive, and riddled with  inconsistencies.”  The attached verification  states that it was “Executed this Friday ___ of JANUARY 2023 at Lancaster, CA,”  even though Defendant served the special interrogatories in November 2023.  The Court finds that, as the result of the  defective verification, Juan Jimenez’s response is the equivalent of no  response.  The Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel  responses to the request for production of documents, set two, and orders Juan  Jimenez to provide verified code-compliant responses and to produce the  documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested  without objections by March 4, 2024.  The Court grants Defendant’s  motion to compel responses to special interrogatories, set two, and orders Juan  Jimenez to provide verified code-compliant responses without objections by  March 4, 2024.  The Court grants Defendant’s  motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, set two, and orders Juan  Jimenez to provide verified code-compliant responses without objections by  March 4, 2024.  The Court denies Defendant’s requests for sanctions.  Sanctions are available against “any party,  person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a  response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing” (Code Civ. Proc., §  2031.300, subd. (c)) and “any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully  makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories” (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c)).  Juan Jimenez  did not make or oppose a motion to compel.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS Defendant Smart and Final Stores LLC’s  motion to compel Plaintiff Juan Galvan Jimenez’s responses to request for production of documents,  set two, and orders Plaintiff Juan Galvan Jimenez to provide verified  code-compliant responses and to produce the documents, electronically stored  information, and/or other things requested without objections by March 4,  2024.  The Court GRANTS Defendant Smart and Final Stores LLC’s  motion to compel Plaintiff Juan Galvan Jimenez’s responses to special  interrogatories, set two, and orders Plaintiff Juan Galvan Jimenez to provide  verified code-compliant responses to the special interrogatories without  objections by March 4, 2024.  The Court GRANTS Defendant Smart and Final Stores LLC’s  motion to compel Plaintiff Juan Galvan Jimenez’s responses to form  interrogatories, set two, and orders Plaintiff Juan Galvan Jimenez to provide  verified code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without  objections by March 4, 2024.  The Court DENIES Defendant Smart and Final Stores LLC’s  requests for sanctions.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
