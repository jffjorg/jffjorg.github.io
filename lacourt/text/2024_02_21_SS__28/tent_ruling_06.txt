BACKGROUND 
On March

Defendants Sunworld Dynasty US Holdings, LLC, dba SLS
Hotel (“Sunworld”), Marriott International Inc., SBE Entertainment Group LLC, and
Does 1-100 for general negligence and premises liability. 
On August 18, 2023, Sunworld filed an answer. 
On December 18, 2023, Sunworld filed a motion to
compel Plaintiff’s responses to requests for production of documents, set one,
and for sanctions, to be heard on January 18, 2024.  The Court continued the hearing to February

opposition. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for September 25, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Sunworld
asks the Court to compel Plaintiff’s responses to requests for production of
documents, set one, and award sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order
compelling a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including
the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter
7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent exceptional
circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or any attorney
of a party for failure to provide electronically stored information that has
been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of the routine, good
faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.)   
DISCUSSION 
On August
18, 2023, Sunworld served requests for production of documents, set one, on
Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff
did not provide timely responses and had not provided responses by the time Sunworld
filed this motion. 
The Court grants the motion to compel responses to the
requests for production of documents, set one, and orders Plaintiff to provide
verified code-compliant responses and to produce the documents, electronically
stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by March 20,
2024. 
The Court denies Sunworld’s requests for sanctions.  Sanctions are available against “any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)  Plaintiff did not make or oppose a motion to
compel. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Defendant Sunworld Dynasty US
Holdings, LLC, dba SLS Hotel’s motion to compel Plaintiff Ilya
Zhekharev’s responses
to requests for production of documents, set one, and orders Plaintiff Ilya
Zhekharev to provide verified code-compliant responses and to produce the
documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested
without objections by March 20, 2024. 
The Court DENIES Defendant Sunworld
Dynasty US Holdings, LLC, dba SLS Hotel’s request for sanctions.
