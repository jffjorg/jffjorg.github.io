  Case Number:  19STCV22033    Hearing Date:   February 21, 2024    Dept:  28 On  January 5, 2024, the Court made findings in connection with Petitioner Jose Castillo’s petition to approve the  compromise of the pending action of Plaintiff Jesus A. Castillo.  The Court also identified several issues for Petitioner to address and continued the hearing to February 21,  2024.  (See January 5, 2024 minute order.) On  February 2, 2024, Petitioner filed an Amended Proposed Special Needs Trust. On February 21, 2024, Petitioner's counsel and the Court discussed the issues raised in the Court's January 5, 2024 minute order.  Counsel confirmed that Petitioner understands that upon the trust beneficiary's death, 25% of the trust assets shall be paid to the non-profit that administers the pooled special needs trust and this provision is part of the terms of the trust instrument via the Joinder Agreement. Counsel also confirmed that within 7 court days of his receipt of the settlement proceeds in his client trust account, he will submit a trustee's bond of $181,000.00 to the Court. Counsel will submit a revised version of the proposed order and the Judicial Council order form incorporating the information specified in Section F of the January 5, 2024 minute order. The Court finds that Petitioner has addressed all of the issues raised in the Court's January 5, 2024 minute order.  The Court therefore grants the petition subject to receipt of the revised order. Petitioner  is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Petitioner  is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within  five days.
