 Case Number:  22STCV20019    Hearing Date:   February 21, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving, opposing and reply papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On  June 20, 2022, Plaintiff Amanda Montano (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against  Defendants Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority  (“Defendant”) and Does 1-100 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence.  On  July 27, 2022, Defendant filed an answer.  On  January 17, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s subsequent deposition  to be heard on February 21, 2024.  On  February 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.  On February 13, 2024, Defendant filed a  reply.  Trial  is currently scheduled for May 20, 2024.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Defendant  asks the Court for leave to take Plaintiff's subsequent deposition.  Plaintiff  asks the Court to deny the motion or limit the deposition.  LEGAL STANDARD  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2025.610 provides in part:  “(a) Once any party has taken the deposition of any  natural person, including that of a party to the action, neither the party who  gave, nor any other party who has been served with a deposition notice pursuant  to Section 2025.240 may take a subsequent deposition of that deponent.  “(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), for good cause  shown, the court may grant leave to take a subsequent deposition, and the  parties, with the consent of any deponent who is not a party, may stipulate  that a subsequent deposition be taken.  “(c) This section does not preclude taking one  subsequent deposition of a natural person who has previously been examined  under either or both of the following circumstances:  “(1) The person was examined as a result of that  person’s designation to testify on behalf of an organization under Section  2025.230.  “(2) The person was examined pursuant to a court order  under Section 485.230, for the limited purpose of discovering pursuant to  Section 485.230 the identity, location, and value of property in which the  deponent has an interest.  “(d) This section does not authorize the taking of  more than one subsequent deposition for the limited purpose of Section 485.230.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.610.)  DISCUSSION  Defendant  asks for leave to take Plaintiff’s subsequent deposition because, after  Plaintiff’s initial deposition on March 9, 2023, Plaintiff asserted on October  4, 2023 that she required a cervical surgery and, on October 6, 2023, Plaintiff  had the surgery.  In  opposition, Plaintiff points to an entry in her doctor’s September 19, 2022 report, produced to Defendant, stating: "Indicated surgery C5-C6, C6-C7 ACDF [anterior cervical  discectomy and fusion] with interbody reconstruction/fusion. Postoperative  rigid collar immobilization, three months. No nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory  medications, aspirin based product, three weeks before surgery and three months  after surgery.... In the absence of surgical intervention, progression of her  myelopathy is well supported in the peer reviewed spine literature."   The  doctor’s reference in September 2022 to an indicated surgery does not prevent  the Court from finding good cause to grant Defendant leave to take Plaintiff's subsequent  deposition.  Defendant was not required  to assume that Plaintiff intended to proceed with the recommended surgery when  she did not state such an intention at the March 9, 2023 deposition.  The  Court construes Defendant’s motion as a request for leave to take Plaintiff’s  subsequent deposition.  The Court finds  good cause and grants the request.  The subsequent  deposition may not exceed two hours and Defendant may not repeat any questions  asked at the March 9, 2023 deposition.  CONCLUSION  The  Court GRANTS Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's motion for leave to take a subsequent deposition of Plaintiff Amanda Montano.  The subsequent deposition may not exceed two  hours and Defendant may not repeat any questions asked at the March 9, 2023 deposition.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
