And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motions, oppositions, and replies submitted by the parties and has made a tentative ruling. The case involves a motor vehicle tort and general negligence claim by Plaintiff Amanda Montano against Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The Defendant has filed a motion to compel Plaintiff's subsequent deposition, which the Plaintiff opposes. The Court has reviewed Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.610, which provides that a party may not take a subsequent deposition of a natural person who has previously been examined unless good cause is shown. The Court finds that good cause has been shown in this case, as Plaintiff's doctor recommended surgery in September 2022, and Plaintiff did not state an intention to proceed with the recommended surgery at her initial deposition in March 2023. Therefore, the Court grants the Defendant's motion for leave to take a subsequent deposition of Plaintiff, with certain limitations. The subsequent deposition may not exceed two hours, and the Defendant may not repeat any questions asked at the March 9, 2023 deposition. The moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service with the Court within five days.
