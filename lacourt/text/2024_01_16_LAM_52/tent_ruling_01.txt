  Case Number:  BC583713    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendant Shara Koplowitz’s Motions (1) for Attorney
Fees; (2) to Strike or Tax Costs; (3) for Sanctions Under CCP § 128.5
Plaintiff 7219-7225 West Sunset LLC’s
Motions (1) for Attorney Fees; (2) to Strike or Tax Costs
Motions for Attorney Fees and Motions to Tax Costs
            Both
parties move for attorney fees and move to tax one another’s memoranda of
costs.  The four motions all turn on the
same question: who was the prevailing party? 
Defendant/cross-complainant Shara Koplowitz is the prevailing party for
two reasons. 
First, the arbitrator already decided
Koplowitz is the prevailing party.  Plaintiff
7219-7225 West Sunset LLC’s argument that it prevailed constitutes an improper
collateral attack on the arbitration award and on this court’s order confirming
the award.  In the arbitration
proceeding, plaintiff moved for attorney fees. 
The arbitrator denied both motions. 
(Shtofman Decl. 5/2/23, Ex. 2, Arb. Order [describing ACMO Nos. 9 &
12].)  Courts have limited authority to
vacate an arbitration award.  “A court’s
power to correct or vacate an erroneous arbitration award is closely
circumscribed.” (Heimlich v. Shivji (2019) 7 Cal.5th 350, 367.)  Plaintiff moved to vacate the arbitration
award.  The court denied that
motion.  The court instead granted
defendant’s motion to confirm the arbitration award.  Even if the arbitrator’s decision was
incorrect, plaintiff failed to show a basis for vacating the award.  The arbitrator’s decision that plaintiff was
not the prevailing party stands.  
Second, defendant is the prevailing party
under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1032(a)(4) and 1293.2.  Plaintiff 7219-7225 West Sunset LLC argues it
is the prevailing party under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032(a)(4) as “a defendant
in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor
defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who
do not recover any relief against that defendant.”  That portion of subdivision (a)(4) does not
apply because both parties cannot be the prevailing party. 
Under these circumstances, the applicable
provision is that “in situations other than as specified, the ‘prevailing
party’ shall be as determined by the court, and by the court, and under those
circumstances, the court, in its discretion, may allow costs or not.”  (CCP § 1032(a)(4).)  When a case “falls within the ‘in situations
other than as specified’ prong” of the statute, the court must “ ‘ “exercise
its discretion both in determining the prevailing party and in allowing,
denying, or apportioning costs.” ’ ”  (Friends
of Spring Street v. Nevada City (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 1092, 1104.)  “[T]he trial court determines whether the
party succeeded at a practical level by realizing its litigation objectives
[citation] and the action yielded the primary relief sought in the case.”  (Ibid.)
Here, defendant succeeded at a practical
level because she successfully moved to confirm the arbitration award,
including an award to her of over $150,000 in attorney fees.  The parties arbitrated their substantive
disputes against one another.  The
remaining proceedings in this court were the parties’ competing motions to
confirm or vacate the arbitration award under Code of Civil Procedure section
1285.  The California Arbitration Act
provides, “The court shall award costs upon any judicial proceeding under this
title as provided in” Code of Civil Procedure section section 1021, et
seq.  (CCP § 1293.2.)  
Even if there were no prevailing party in
the underlying arbitration or the substantive dispute, defendant achieved a
complete victory in the postarbitration proceedings in this court.  “Postarbitration proceedings are distinct
from arbitration proceedings, and it may be that the prevailing party in the
arbitration is not the prevailing party in postarbitration proceedings.”  (Cohen v. TNP 2008 Participating Notes
Program, LLC (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 840, 878 (Cohen).)  In postarbitration proceedings, parties who
“successfully defeated the petition to vacate the award and successfully
confirmed the monetary awards” in their favor are “were the prevailing
parties.”  (Id. at p. 879.)  Defendant successfully moved to confirm the
arbitration award and successfully opposed plaintiff’s motion to vacate the
award.  
Defendant is the prevailing party.  Plaintiff is not entitled to attorney fees or
other costs.  The court therefore will
(1) deny plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees and (2) grant defendant’s motion
to strike plaintiff’s memorandum of costs.
Amount of Defendant’s Attorney Fees
Defendant moves for $39,325 in attorney fees.  Defendant is the prevailing party and is
entitled to recover attorney fees pursuant to the parties’ contract.  Plaintiff argues defendant seeks to recover
attorney fees this court already denied when ruling on prior motions for
sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5.  Such sanctions are discretionary.  “A trial court may order a party … to
pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by another
party as a result of actions or tactics, made in bad faith.”  (CCP § 128.5(a).)  “If warranted, the court may award
to the party prevailing on the motion the reasonable expenses and attorney’s
fees incurred in presenting or opposing the motion.”  (Id., subd. (f)(1)(C).)  
In contrast, defendant now moves for
attorney fees under a contract that provides for the prevailing party’s
recovery of attorney fees.  As discussed
above, defendant prevailed in these proceedings, including those under the
California Arbitration Act.  “The award
of costs pursuant to [Code of Civil Procedure section] section 1293.2,
including attorney fees when authorized by contract, is mandatory.”  (Cohen, supra, 31 Cal.App.5th at p.
878.)  Courts are “required to award [a
party], as the party prevailing on the contract, reasonable attorney fees and
costs for post-arbitration judicial proceedings, pursuant to the statutory
scheme governing arbitration.”  (Carole
Ring & Associates v. Nicastro (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 253, 260.)  The court therefore will award attorney fees based on defendant’s lodestar, “the number of
hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.)
Plaintiff argues this motion is an improper
motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008.  It is not. 
Defendant has not previously sought these fees as the prevailing party
in this proceeding. 
Plaintiff also challenges several billing
entries.  The court finds all claimed
attorney fees were reasonably incurred. 
Defendant’s counsel Robert Gentino’s hourly rate of $650 reflects the
reasonable market value of his services. 
The court will therefore grant defendant’s motion for attorney fees in
its entirety. 
Amount of Defendant’s Other Costs
Defendant’s memorandum of costs claimed a
total of $362.75, comprising $339.75 in filing and motion fees and $23 in other
costs.  Plaintiff argues defendant failed
to justify those expenses.  A “verified memorandum of costs is prima
facie evidence of their propriety, and the burden is on the party seeking to
tax costs to show they were not reasonable or necessary.”  (612 South LLC v. Laconic Limited
Partnership (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1285.)  These nominal costs are presumptively proper.  Plaintiff does not meet its burden of showing
the costs were not reasonable or necessary. 

Assuming
plaintiff met its initial burden of doing so, defendant establishes these costs
were proper.  Defendant’s opposition
authenticated copies of receipts substantiating all costs.  (Gentino Decl., ¶¶ 1-2, Exs. 1-2.)  The court will therefore deny plaintiff’s
motion to strike or tax defendant’s memorandum of costs.
Defendant’s Motion for Sanctions
            Defendant moves for $3,062.82 in sanctions against
plaintiff and its counsel under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5.  CCP § 128.5 applies to “ ‘actions or tactics’
which are both frivolous and in ‘bad-faith.’
”  (Summers v. City of Cathedral City (1990)
225 Cal.App.3d 1047, 1070.)  “[A] showing that a party’s action or tactic
is totally and completely without merit does not settle the issue of whether
that action or tactic was in bad faith. 
…  [T]he trial court may not be
willing to draw that inference if it is convinced that, despite the complete
lack of merit, the party was acting in the good faith (albeit erroneous and
even unreasonable) belief that the action was meritorious.”  (Id. at p. 1073.)  Sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure
section 128.5 “requir[e] subjective bad
faith” (In re Marriage of Sahafzadeh-Taeb & Taeb (2019) 39
Cal.App.5th 124, 128), meaning they were “committed with an improper motive,
such as to harass or manipulate opposing counsel or the court” (id. at
p. 141).
Defendant moves for sanctions for plaintiff’s
action or tactic of filing a memorandum of costs on August 14, 2023.  Filing that memorandum of costs was
frivolous.  The parties already litigated
the issue of whether plaintiff was the prevailing party—several times.  Plaintiff lost each time.  Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs was “totally
and completely without merit.”  (CCP §
128.5(b)(2).)  The court, however, does
not find sufficient evidence of plaintiff’s counsel’s subjective bad faith.  The court will therefore not impose sanctions
under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5.
