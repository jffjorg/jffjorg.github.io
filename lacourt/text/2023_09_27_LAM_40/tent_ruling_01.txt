Background
Plaintiff Javier Alarcon Munoz sues
Defendants Juvenal Alejandro Farias (Farias), Bargain Rent-a-Car dba Lexus of
Cerritos (Cerritos Lexus), Schoolsfirst Insurance Services, LLC (Schoolsfirst), Ivonne Maria Guerrero
(Guerrero), Mercury Insurance Company (Mercury Ins. Co.), Mercury General
Corporation (dismissed with prejudice on May 26, 2023), and Does 5-50 pursuant
to an October 12, 2022 Fourth Amended Complaint alleging claims of (1)
Revocation of Acceptance of Goods, (2) Rescission, (3) Breach of Oral Contract,
(4) Breach of Implied-in-Fact Contract, (5) Breach of Written Contract, (6) Fraud,
(7) Violations of Consumer Legal Remedies Act, (8) Violation of Unfair Business
Practices Act/Unfair Competition, (9) Violation of Penal Code Section 496, (10)
Common Counts (Money Had and Received), (11) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (12)
Negligence, (13) Negligent Misrepresentation, and (14) Reformation / Revision.
The claims arise from allegations
that, among other things, these Defendants provided Plaintiff with an
automobile insurance policy that did not provide full / comprehensive coverage
for a vehicle that Plaintiff purchased from Cerritos Lexus through Juvenal
Farias, which Farias represented to be a 2015 Lexus model number “RC F” with
“[n]o issues, no problems,” only for Plaintiff to later discover that the
vehicle was salvage-titled, carried an invalid VIN number, was not marketable,
and may have had other problems.
On September 16, 2022, Plaintiff’s
counsel served discovery on counsel for Defendants Schoolsfirst and Guerrero,
including Form Interrogatories, Set 1 (FROGs, Set One), and Request for Production
of Documents, Sets 1 (RPDs, Set One).
Counsel for Schoolsfirst and
Guerrero did not request an extension to provide responses to this discovery.
By February 8, 2023, Plaintiff had
not received responses to FROGs, Set One, and RPDs, Set One, from Schoolsfirst
or Guerrero.
That same day, Plaintiff filed motions
to compel responses to FROGs, Set One, and RPDs, Set One, from Schoolsfirst and
Guerrero. The motions also sought monetary sanctions. (See CRS# 6234 and 1916.)
On September 13, 2023, Schoolsfirst
and Guerrero opposed Plaintiff’s motions in a combined opposition. A
declaration by counsel attached to the opposition represents that these
Defendants failed to timely respond based on a failure to calendar the response
date for the discovery. Counsel also represents that Defendants will provide
responses and/or production relating to FROGs, Set One, and RPDs, Set One, prior
to this hearing, thus indicating that as of September 13, 2023, Schoolsfirst
and Guerrero had not served responses to these discovery requests.
On September 14, 2023, Plaintiff
replied to Schoolsfirst and Guerrero’s opposition. The reply represents that as
of that date, Schoolsfirst and Guerrero had failed to serve responses and/or
production to FROGs, Set One, and RPDs, Set One.
On September 25, 2023, the Court
held a hearing on a different motion involving the same parties, at which time counsel
for Schoolsfirst and Guerrero represented that Schoolsfirst and Guerrero have
since served responses and/or production to FROGs, Set One, and RPDs, Set One.
Plaintiff’s motions to compel are
now before the Court.
 
Motion to Compel Responses to Interrogatories and Production
Legal
Standard
A
motion to compel an initial response can be made on the ground that a party did
not serve a timely response to interrogatories or a demand to produce. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (a)
[demand to produce]; see Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404 (Sinaiko).) To establish
this ground, a movant must show:
(1)
Proper service (see Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.080, subd. (a) [interrogatories],
2031.040 [demand to produce]);
(2)
Expiration of the deadline for the initial response 30 days after service or on
date agreed to by parties (see Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subds. (a), (b)
[interrogatories], 2031.260, subds. (a), (b) [demand to produce]); and
(3)
No timely response (see Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290 [interrogatories],
2031.300 [demand to produce]).
A
court must deny a motion to compel initial discovery where the discovery sought
is outside the scope of discovery. (See CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19; see also Code. Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 [scope of
discovery].) 
Order Compelling Initial Responses: MOOT.
Plaintiff provides evidence showing his
service of FROGs, Set One, and RPDs, Set One, on Schoolsfirst and Guerrero.
(Motions, Ex. 1, Proof of Service [two separate FROGs, Set One, and RPDs, Set
One, shown in Exhibit 1, one directed at Schoolsfirst and another directed at
Guerrero].)
Plaintiff provides evidence showing that
Schoolsfirst’s and Guerrero’s deadline to respond to FROGs, Set One, and RPDs,
Set One—per Plaintiff, October 18, 2022—has expired. (Motions, Vardapour Decl.,
¶ 4.)
Plaintiff provides evidence showing that as
of October 18, 2022, Schoolsfirst and Guerrero had failed to respond to FROGs,
Set One, and RPDs, Set One. (Motions, Vardapour Decl., ¶ 5; Replies, Vardapour
Decl., ¶ 3.)
The Court’s review of FROGs, Set One, and
RPDs, Set One, shows that they are within the scope of discovery. (See Motions,
Vardapour Decl., Ex. 1.)
However, the Court notes that Plaintiff’s
motions are MOOT because prior to this hearing, Schoolsfirst and Guerrero
served responses to FROGs, Set One, and RPDs, Set One. (Supplemental Dec. of
Mark Worthge in support of combined Opposition to Motions to Compel, filed September
25, 2023.)
Sanctions: GRANTED.
The Court must impose monetary sanctions
against anyone—party, nonparty, or attorney—who unsuccessfully makes or opposes
the motion, unless it finds that the person to be sanctioned acted withs
substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of the
sanctions unjust. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c)
[interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand to produce]; see Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants, supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at p. 404 [interrogatories and demand to produce].)
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)

The
Court must also impose a $250.00 monetary sanction on any party, person, or
attorney who does not respond in good faith to a request for the production of
documents. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.050, subd. (a)(1).) This sanction is in
addition to any other sanction imposed pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2023.010 to 2023.040. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.050, subd. (a).)
The
Court finds that sanctions are merited here even if discovery has been produced
by Defendants Schoolsfirst and Guerrero. Even if a calendaring mistake
initially caused these Defendants’ failure to timely respond to FROGs, Set One,
and RPDs, Set One, Schoolsfirst and Guerrero became aware of the need for
initial responses to this discovery no later than February 8, 2023, when the
motions before the Court were filed. (Combined Opp’n, Worthge Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.)
Yet, these Defendants failed to produce the relevant discovery for more than
seven months (Replies, Vardapour Decl., ¶ 3), only making their production less
than a week before this hearing. Imposing monetary sanctions on Schoolsfirst
and Guerrero for such delay is neither without substantial justification nor
unjust.
In
relation to FROGs, Set One, sanctions are GRANTED in the amount of $2,252.34,
comprised of (1) three hours expended drafting the motions at a rate of $350
per hour, (2) three hours to be expended replying to the opposition and
attending this hearing at a rate of $350 per hour, and (3) $152.34 in hearing
and e-filing costs. (See Motions, Vardapour Decl., ¶¶ 6-6(b).) Schoolsfirst and
Guerrero are individually liable for $1,126.17 in sanctions related to FROGs,
Set One. 
In
relation to RPDs, Set One, sanctions are GRANTED in the amount of $2,285,
comprised of (1) 2.1 hours expended drafting the motions at a rate of $350 per
hour, (2) three hours to be expended replying to the opposition and attending
this hearing at a rate of $350 per hour, (3) $152.34 in hearing and e-filing costs,
(4) $250 in sanctions against Schoolsfirst pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
2023.050, subdivision (a)(1), and (5) $250 in sanctions against Guerrero
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 2023.050, subdivision (a)(1). (See Motions,
Vardapour Decl., ¶¶ 6-6(b); Replies, Vardapour Decl., ¶ 7.) Schoolsfirst and
Guerrero are individually liable for $1,142.50 in sanctions related to RPDs,
Set One.
As
requested in the motions, Counsel Mark W. Worthge, Andrew K. Aaronian, and
Litchfield Cavo LLP are jointly and severally liable along with the Defendants for
all the above sanctions.
