The court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Javier Alarcon Munoz's motions to compel responses to discovery requests and impose sanctions for failure to respond. The Plaintiff had served discovery requests on Defendants Schoolsfirst Insurance Services, LLC and Ivonne Maria Guerrero, but they failed to respond despite the expiration of the deadline. The Plaintiff filed motions to compel responses and sought monetary sanctions.

The court finds that the motions are now moot since the Defendants have produced the requested discovery responses. However, the court sanctions the Defendants and their counsel for the delay in producing the discovery responses. The court orders the Defendants to pay the Plaintiff $2,252.34 and $2,285 in sanctions for failing to respond to the discovery requests.

The court also finds that the Defendants and their counsel acted without substantial justification and unjustly delayed producing the discovery responses, justifying the imposition of sanctions. The court orders the Defendants to pay the Plaintiff $1,126.17 and $1,142.50 in sanctions for failing to respond to the discovery requests.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is related to a case where the plaintiff, Javier Alarcon Munoz, is suing several defendants, including Juvenal Alejandro Farias, Bargain Rent-a-Car (dba Lexus of Cerritos), Schoolsfirst Insurance Services, LLC, and Ivonne Maria Guerrero, for various claims arising from the purchase of a vehicle. The plaintiff served discovery requests on Schoolsfirst and Guerrero, but they failed to respond in a timely manner. The plaintiff then filed motions to compel responses to the discovery requests and sought monetary sanctions.

The court found that the plaintiff's motions to compel are moot because Schoolsfirst and Guerrero had served responses to the discovery requests prior to the hearing. However, the court granted the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,252.34 for the failure to respond to the Form Interrogatories (FROGs, Set One) and $2,285 for the failure to respond to the Requests for Production (RPDs, Set One).

The court ordered Schoolsfirst and Guerrero to pay the sanctions, with Schoolsfirst and Guerrero being individually liable for $1,126.17 and $1,142.50, respectively. The court also ordered counsel Mark W. Worthge, Andrew K. Aaronian, and Litchfield Cavo LLP to pay the sanctions jointly and severally with the defendants.

The court's decision is based on the fact that Schoolsfirst and Guerrero failed to respond to the discovery requests in a timely manner, despite being aware of the need to do so. The court found that imposing monetary sanctions on Schoolsfirst and Guerrero for the delay is neither without substantial justification nor unjust.
