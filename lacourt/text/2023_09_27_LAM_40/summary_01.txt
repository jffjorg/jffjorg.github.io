And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Javier Alarcon Munoz's motions to compel responses to discovery requests and impose sanctions for failure to respond. The Plaintiff had served discovery requests on Defendants Schoolsfirst Insurance Services, LLC and Ivonne Maria Guerrero, but they failed to respond despite the expiration of the deadline. The Plaintiff filed motions to compel responses and sought monetary sanctions.

The court finds that the motions are now moot since the Defendants have produced the requested discovery responses. However, the court sanctions the Defendants and their counsel for the delay in producing the discovery responses. The court orders the Defendants to pay the Plaintiff $2,252.34 and $2,285 in sanctions for failing to respond to the discovery requests.

The court also finds that the Defendants and their counsel acted without substantial justification and unjustly delayed producing the discovery responses, justifying the imposition of sanctions. The court orders the Defendants to pay the Plaintiff $1,126.17 and $1,142.50 in sanctions for failing to respond to the discovery requests.
