  Case Number:  19STCV46989    Hearing Date:   January 2, 2025    Dept:  53 Sanchez v. Kia Motors
America  19STCV46989 
Ex
Parte Application 1/2/25
The
court finds that defendant has not satisfied the requirement of California Rules
of Court, rule 3.1202, subdivision (c), that an applicant for an ex parte order
must make an affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing competent
testimony based on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or
other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte.  The court therefore denies defendant’s ex parte
application for an order to exclude testimony of plaintiff’s expert witness
Anthony Micale or, in the alternative, limit his testimony to his deposition
given on December 19, 2024.
The
court makes the following orders to resolve the dispute addressed in defendant’s
ex parte application and plaintiff’s opposition.  
The
court orders plaintiff to produce all materials called for by defendant’s
deposition notice for plaintiff’s expert witness, Anthony Micale, pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.415, no later than January 2, 2025.
The
court orders plaintiff to produce plaintiff’s expert witness, Anthony Micale, for
completion of his deposition no later than January 16, 2025. 
The
court orders the parties’ counsel to meet and confer no later than January 3,
2025, to schedule a date for the completion of the deposition of plaintiff’s expert
witness, Anthony Micale.
The
court orders that trial is continued from 1/8/25 to 2/5/25, at 11:00 a.m.
The
court orders that the Final Status Conference is continued from 1/8/25 to 1/24/25,
at 8:30 a.m.
The
court orders the parties and their counsel to hold a meeting, conference call,
or videoconference to discuss and try to settle all issues in the case no later
than January 23, 2025.  If the parties
hold a mediation with a private mediator, the mediation will comply with this
order.  
The court
orders defendant to give notice of this order.
