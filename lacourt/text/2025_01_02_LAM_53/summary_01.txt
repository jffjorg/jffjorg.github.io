And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Sanchez and Kia Motors America. The defendant's ex parte application to exclude or limit the testimony of plaintiff's expert witness, Anthony Micale, has been denied. The court finds that the defendant failed to satisfy the requirement of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1202, subdivision (c), which requires an applicant for an ex parte order to make an affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing competent testimony based on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte.

Instead, the court has ordered the plaintiff to produce all materials called for by the defendant's deposition notice for Anthony Micale's testimony, as well as to produce Anthony Micale for completion of his deposition. The parties' counsel are ordered to meet and confer to schedule the completion of the deposition.

The court has also continued the trial from January 8, 2025, to February 5, 2025, and the Final Status Conference from January 8, 2025, to January 24, 2025. The parties are ordered to hold a meeting, conference call, or videoconference to discuss and try to settle all issues in the case no later than January 23, 2025.
