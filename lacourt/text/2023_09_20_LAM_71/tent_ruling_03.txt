[1] Defendant demurs on the basis of uncertainty, citing
C.C.P. §430.10(b).  However, a
demurrer on the basis of uncertain pleadings is made pursuant to C.C.P. §430.10(f). 
C.C.P. §430.10(b) is an objection on the basis that the person who filed
the pleading does not have the legal capacity to sue.
