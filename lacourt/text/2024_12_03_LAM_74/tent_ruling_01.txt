  Case Number:  20STCV40604    Hearing Date:   December 3, 2024    Dept:  74 Sermeno v.
Law Offices of Ramin R. Younessi et al. 
Defendant Amir Pasha Vafaei’s Motion
to Deem Admitted 
 
BACKGROUND  
            This
case arises from a workplace harassment and discrimination claim.
            Plaintiff
Laura Sermeno (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Defendants Law Offices of
Ramin R. Younessi and Amir Pasha Vafaei (Defendant) (collectively Defendants).
            The
case was stayed on October 6, 2023, pending an appeal.
            On
October 3, 2024, the stay was lifted. 
            On
October 31, 2024, defendant Vafaei filed a motion to deem admitted Plaintiff’s
Request for Admission, Set One. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails
to serve a timely response . . . . (b) The requesting party may move for an
order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with section 2023.010).”¿(Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.)¿The court “shall” grant the motion to deem requests for admission
admitted “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission
have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed
response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with
Section 2033.220.”¿¿(Id., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)¿ A responding party may
respond by answering or objecting to a request for admission. (Id., § 2033.210,
subd. (b).)¿ An answer either admits, denies or claims inability to admit or
deny. (Id., § 2033.220, subd. (b).). Responses are due within 30 days from the
date the request for admission was served. (Id., § 2033.250.) ¿¿¿¿ 
 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
served unverified responses on October 5, 2023. 
The case was stayed three day later on October 6, 2023. Almost a year
later on October 3, 2024, the stay was lifted. On October 31, 2024, Defendant
filed this motion.  Defendant did not
attempt to meet and confer about the missing verifications after the stay was
lifted.  (Iarusso Decl., ¶ 7; Vance
Decl., ¶ 8-9.) Plaintiff nonetheless served verifications on November 6, 2024, making
Defendant’s motion moot.  (Iarusso Decl.,
¶ 8.)
But
the issue of sanctions remains. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 409.) The court finds
in this case that Defendant’s failure to meet and confer in a good faith
attempt to resolve the dispute after the stay was listed but before filing this
motion precludes Defendant’s recovery of sanctions. (Code of Civ. Proc. §
2023.010(i).)  
 
CONCLUSION                                          
The
Court finds Defendant’s motion to deem matters admitted moot. 
The
court denies sanctions against either party.
Defendant to give
notice.
