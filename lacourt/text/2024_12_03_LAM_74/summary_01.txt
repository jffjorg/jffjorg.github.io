And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the defendant, Amir Pasha Vafaei, to deem admitted certain requests for admission made by the plaintiff, Laura Sermeno. The motion was filed on October 31, 2024, after the stay of the case was lifted on October 3, 2024. The judge finds that the motion is moot because the plaintiff served verifications on November 6, 2024, making the requests for admission moot.

The judge also notes that the defendant did not attempt to meet and confer with the plaintiff to resolve the dispute after the stay was lifted, which precludes the defendant's recovery of sanctions. Therefore, the judge denies sanctions against either party.

The judge orders the defendant to give notice of the ruling and denies the motion to deem admitted.
