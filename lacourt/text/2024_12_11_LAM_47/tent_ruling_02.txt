CASE:                         Juana Ramirez v. Nissan North America,
Inc.
 
CASE NO.:                 23STCV11757            
 
MOTION
FOR SANCTIONS PURSUANT TO CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 128.5

 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Juana Ramirez
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): Defendant Nissan
North America, Inc. 
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a lemon law action filed May 24, 2023. Plaintiff purchased a 2019
Nissan Murano that had serious defects in its transmission system. 
 
Plaintiff moves for monetary
sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5.
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff moves for monetary
sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5. Code of Civil
Procedure section 128.5 empowers the Court to order “a party, the party’s
attorney, or both, to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by another party as a result of actions or tactics, made in bad faith,
that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 128.5(a).) 
 
Plaintiff contends that the parties
entered into a settlement agreement on August 1, 2024, pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 998, whereby Defendant agreed to repurchase the subject
vehicle from Plaintiff and pay Plaintiff’s reasonable attorney’s fees and costs
in exchange for dismissal of the action and the return of the subject vehicle.
(Declaration of David N. Barry ISO Mot. Exh. 1.) According to Plaintiff’s
counsel, Defendant has failed to comply with its obligations under the
settlement. (Id. ¶ 4.) Although Plaintiff asserts that Defendant’s
failure is “frivolous” or solely intended to cause delay, Plaintiff offers no
evidence of that contention. In opposition, Defendant demonstrates its
processing of the parties settlement over several months and a delay occasioned
by the need for an updated registration, which took Plaintiff several weeks to
provide.  (May Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. A.)  Based on this record, the Court cannot find
Defendant’s actions were utterly frivolous or in bad faith.  Plaintiff has therefore failed to demonstrate
that sanctions are warranted. 
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion for Sanctions is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
