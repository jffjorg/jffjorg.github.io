And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions, striking the defendant's answer, and entering default against the defendant. The defendant has failed to comply with multiple court orders, producing incomplete and evasive responses to discovery requests. The defendant's conduct is deemed willful and contemptuous, and the judge concludes that the ultimate sanction of termination is warranted. The court sets a hearing on an order to show cause regarding entry of default judgment for February 7, 2025.
