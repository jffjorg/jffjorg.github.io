And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for monetary sanctions against the defendant. The plaintiff had claimed that the defendant failed to comply with a settlement agreement entered into on August 1, 2024, and that the defendant's actions were frivolous or in bad faith. However, the court found that the defendant had provided evidence of its processing of the settlement and a delay caused by the need for an updated registration, which took several weeks to obtain from the plaintiff. Based on this record, the court could not find that the defendant's actions were frivolous or in bad faith. The court therefore denied the plaintiff's motion for sanctions.
