DISCUSSION:
 
            Defendants
move for judgment on the pleadings. 
 
Legal Standard
 
A motion for judgment on the
pleadings is the functional equivalent to a general demurrer.  (Lance Camper Mfg. Corp. v. Republic
Indemnity Co. of Am. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198).  Like demurrers, motions for judgment on the
pleadings challenge the legal sufficiency of the allegations, not their
veracity.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994). Any defects must either appear on the
face of the pleading, or else be taken by judicial notice.  (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 316, 321-22).  The parties’
ability to prove their respective claims is of no concern.  (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp.
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 99.)  Though
the Court must accept the allegations of the complaint and answer as true (Gerawan
Farming, Inc. v. Lyons (2000) 24 Cal.4th 468, 515), it will not do so for
“conclusions of law or fact, opinions, speculation, or allegations contrary to
law or [judicially noticed] facts…” (Stevenson Real Estate Servs., Inc. v.
CB Richard Ellis Real Estate Servs., Inc. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1215,
1219-20).
 
Meet and Confer
 
Before filing a motion for judgment
on the pleadings, the moving party shall meet and confer in person or by
telephone with the party who has filed the pleading subject to the motion for
judgment on the pleadings and file a declaration detailing their meet and
confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 439(a).) However, an insufficient
meet and confer process is not grounds to grant or deny a motion for
judgment on the pleadings. (Code Civ. Proc., § 439(a)(4).)
 
            Defendants
filed a form Declaration on June 11, 2024 stating that Plaintiff failed to
respond to the requests to meet and confer or otherwise failed to meet and
confer in good faith. (Declaration of Moving Party Regarding Meet and Confer ¶
2b.) Defendants have therefore satisfied their statutory meet and confer
obligations. 
 
Requests for Judicial Notice
 
Defendants request that the Court
take judicial notice of (1) the Complaint in the action entitled Marina
Ivanoff v. Rushmore Loan Management Services, LLC, Case No. 22STCV12119
(the “Prior Action”); (2) the Notice of Entry of Judgment filed August 30, 2022
in the Prior Action; (3): the Court of Appeal’s July 27, 2023 order affirming
the judgment; and (4) the California Supreme Court’s November 15, 2023 order
denying the petition for review of the Court of Appeal’s decision. These
requests are GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(d) (court records.)
Defendants also request that the Court take notice of a Declaration in
Opposition to an application for a Temporary Restraining Order (Exh. 10) and a
Notice of Ex Parte Order to Show Cause re: Temporary Restraining Order (Exh.
16) in the prior action. As these materials are not relevant to the Court’s
ruling, these requests are DENIED. (Gbur v. Cohen
(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 296, 301 (“[J]udicial notice . . . is always confined to
those matters which are relevant to the issue at hand.”].) 
 
            Defendants further
request that the Court take judicial notice of (5) the November 26, 2007 deed
of trust with Instrument No. 20072597064; (6) a Substitution of Trustee
recorded July 28, 2016 with Instrument No. 20160888081; (7) a July 28, 2016
Notice of Default with Instrument No. 20160888082; (8) a Notice of Trustee’s
Sale recorded October 26, 2016 with Instrument No. 20161316151; (9) a Notice of
Trustee’s Sale recorded September 25, 2018 with Instrument No. 20180981237; (11)
a March 4, 2020 Substitution of Trustee with Instrument No. 20200254506; (12) a
Notice of Recission of Notice of Default recorded March 4, 2020 with Instrument
No. 20200254507; (13) an August 26, 2020 Corporate Assignment of Ded of Trust
with Instrument No. 20201005551; (14) a June 28, 2021 Substitution of Trustee
with Instrument No. 20210857507; (15) a June 9, 2021 Notice of Default with
Instrument No. 20210910427; and (17) a Notice of Recission recorded February 1,
2022 with Instrument No. 20220127680. These requests are GRANTED pursuant to
Evidence Code section 452(c) (official acts.) 
 
First Cause of Action
 
            Defendants
move for judgment on the pleadings on the first cause of action for injunctive
relief on the grounds that Plaintiff’s claim is barred by claim and issue
preclusion and fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

 
            In DKN
Holdings LLC v. Faerber (2015) 61 Cal.4th 813, the California Supreme Court
clarified the distinctions between “claim preclusion” and “issue preclusion”
thus:
 
We have frequently
used “res judicata” as an umbrella term encompassing both claim preclusion and
issue preclusion, which we described as two separate “aspects” of an
overarching doctrine. (E.g., Boeken, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 797, 108
Cal.Rptr.3d 806, 230 P.3d 342; Teitelbaum Furs, Inc. v. Dominion (1962)
58 Cal.2d 601, 604, 25 Cal.Rptr. 559, 375 P.2d 439 (Teitelbaum Furs).)
Claim preclusion, the “‘“primary aspect”’” of res judicata, acts to bar
claims that were, or should have been, advanced in a previous suit involving
the same parties. (Boeken, at p. 797, 108 Cal.Rptr.3d 806, 230 P.3d
342.) Issue preclusion, the “‘“secondary aspect”’” historically called
collateral estoppel, describes the bar on relitigating issues that were argued
and decided in the first suit. (Ibid.)
 
We have sometimes
described “res judicata” as synonymous with claim preclusion, while reserving
the term “collateral estoppel” for issue preclusion. (See Mycogen Corp. v.
Monsanto Co. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 888, 896, 123 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 51 P.3d 297 (Mycogen).)
On occasion, however, we have used the term “res judicata” more broadly, even
in a case involving only issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel. (See Bernhard
v. Bank of America (1942) 19 Cal.2d 807, 813, 122 P.2d 892.) We are not the
only court to sometimes use the term “res judicata” with imprecision. (See,
e.g., Migra v. Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Ed. (1984) 465 U.S.
75, 77, fn. 1, 104 S.Ct. 892, 79 L.Ed.2d 56.) To avoid future confusion, we
will follow the example of other courts and use the terms “claim preclusion” to
describe the primary aspect of the res judicata doctrine and “issue preclusion”
to encompass the notion of collateral estoppel. (See ibid.) It
is important to distinguish these two types of preclusion because they have
different requirements.
 
Claim preclusion
“prevents relitigation of the same cause of action in a second suit between
the same parties or parties in privity with them.” (Mycogen, supra, 28
Cal.4th at p. 896, 123 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 51 P.3d 297.) Claim preclusion
arises if a second suit involves: (1) the same cause of action (2) between the
same parties (3) after a final judgment on the merits in the first suit. (Ibid.,
In re Crow (1971) 4 Cal.3d 613, 622, 94 Cal.Rptr. 254, 483 P.2d 1206; Teitelbaum
Furs, supra, 58 Cal.2d at p. 604, 25 Cal.Rptr. 559, 375 P.2d 439.) If
claim preclusion is established, it operates to bar relitigation of the
claim altogether.
 
Issue preclusion prohibits
the relitigation of issues argued and decided in a previous case, even if the
second suit raises different causes of action. (Mycogen, supra, 28
Cal.4th at p. 896, 123 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 51 P.3d 297.) Under issue preclusion,
the prior judgment conclusively resolves an issue actually litigated and
determined in the first action. (Boeken, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 797,
108 Cal.Rptr.3d 806, 230 P.3d 342.) There is a limit to the reach of issue
preclusion, however. In accordance with due process, it can be asserted only
against a party to the first lawsuit, or one in privity with a party. (Bernhard
v. Bank of America, supra, 19 Cal.2d at p. 812, 122 P.2d 892.)
 
Issue preclusion
differs from claim preclusion in two ways. First, issue preclusion does not bar
entire causes of action. Instead, it prevents relitigation of previously
decided issues. Second, unlike claim preclusion, issue preclusion can be raised
by one who was not a party or privy in the first suit. (Vandenberg v.
Superior Court (1999) 21 Cal.4th 815, 828, 88 Cal.Rptr.2d 366,
982 P.2d 229.) “Only the party against whom the doctrine is invoked must
be bound by the prior proceeding. [Citations.]” (Ibid.) In summary, issue
preclusion applies: (1) after final adjudication (2) of an identical issue (3)
actually litigated and necessarily decided in the first suit and (4) asserted
against one who was a party in the first suit or one in privity with
that party. (Lucido v. Superior Court (1990) 51 Cal.3d 335, 341, 272
Cal.Rptr. 767, 795 P.2d 1223; Vandenberg, at p. 828, 88 Cal.Rptr.2d 366,
982 P.2d 229; Teitelbaum Furs, supra, 58 Cal.2d at p. 604, 25 Cal.Rptr.
559, 375 P.2d 439.)
 
(DKN Holdings, LLC v. Faerber (2015) 61 Cal.4th 813,
823-25 [bold emphasis added, italics in original].)
 
            Defendants
contend that Plaintiff seeks to relitigate identical claims and issues under
the first cause of action as in a prior complaint filed in April 2022. In the
Prior Action, as in this case, Plaintiff alleged that she obtained a loan
modification from Defendant Rushmore on her mortgage which called for excessive
mortgage payments using an improper appraisal figure for the subject property.
(Complaint ¶¶ 20, 24, 32-33; RJN Exh. 1 ¶¶ 16, 19-20.) Plaintiff’s 2022
Complaint asserted five causes of action, including one for injunctive relief
precluding Rushmore from foreclosing on Plaintiff’s property. (RJN Exh. 1 ¶¶
43-47; compare Complaint ¶¶ 22-29.) Rushmore’s Demurrer to the 2022 Complaint
was sustained on August 30, 2022 without leave to amend, and the action
dismissed with prejudice. (RJN Exh. 2.) That decision was affirmed on appeal,
with review denied by our Supreme Court. (RJN Exhs. 3-4.) A dismissal with
prejudice is a final judgment on the merits. (Serv. Employees Int’t. Union
v. Hollywood Park, Inc. (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 745, 756.) Thus, the
undisputed record establishes that an identical claim by Plaintiff against
Defendant Rushmore was litigated to final judgment on the merits, such that
claim preclusion should bar Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant Rushmore. 
 
            As to
Defendant UMB Bank, Defendants concede that UMB was not named as a party to the
Prior Action. (See RJN Exh. 1.) Nonetheless, Defendants argue that UMB stands
in privity with Rushmore such that they are entitled to the same result. As the
parties asserting preclusion, Defendants bear the burden of establishing that
they were in privity in that they shared “an identity or community of interest,
with adequate representation of that interest in the first suit, and
circumstances such that the nonparty ‘should reasonably have expected to be
bound’ by the first suit. (Grande v. Eisenhower Med. Ctr. (2022) 13
Cal.5th 313, 326 [internal quotations omitted].) Defendants state that, at the
time of the conduct complained of in 2021, UMB was the actual owner and
beneficiary of the loan. (Complaint ¶ 20; RJN Exh. 13 [Assignment of Deed of
Trust dated August 26, 2020].) Defendants thus contend that UMB Bank shares a
community of interest with Rushmore, as loan beneficiary and servicer, but do
not apply the elements of privity under California law. Rather, Defendants cite
federal authorities, which do not apply California precedent in this respect
and do not use an identical test for determination of privity. (See, e.g., Ghalehtak
v. Fay Servicing, LLC (N.D. Cal. 2018) 304 F.Supp.3d 877, 885.) Defendant
UMB Bank has therefore failed to demonstrate privity for the purpose of claim
preclusion. 
 
            That said, under
the doctrine of issue preclusion, UMB Bank need not show that it is in
privity with Rushmore, only that (1) there was a final adjudication (2) of an
identical issue (3) actually litigated and necessarily decided in the first
suit and (4) that Defendants are asserting preclusion against one who was a
party in the first suit or one in privity with that party. (DKN Holdings,
LLC v. Faerber, supra, 61 Cal.4th at 825.) As stated above, the same
Plaintiff asserted an identical cause of action premised on identical factual
issues, which was actually litigated on the merits and therefore necessarily
decided adversely to Plaintiff. Consequently, issue preclusion bars Plaintiff
from relitigating those issues, whether against Rushmore or against UMB Bank. 
 
            Accordingly,
Defendants are entitled to judgment on the pleadings of the first cause of
action.
 
Second Cause of Action: Rescission
 
            Defendants
move for judgment on the pleadings of the second cause of action for recission
of the Loan Modification Agreement on the grounds that Plaintiff’s claims are
barred by claim and issue preclusion and fail to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. 
 
            Defendants
contend that the second cause of action is premised on the same facts and
issues as the first cause of action, and therefore commands an identical
result. The Court concurs. Although Plaintiff did not assert a specific claim
for equitable recission in her 2022 Complaint, she asserted identical
contentions regarding the unconscionability of the loan modification and demanded
a new modification of the Loan Agreement, as she does here. (Complaint ¶¶ 20,
30-36; RJN Exh. 1. ¶ 16, Prayer No. 5.) Plaintiff thus appears to be raising
identical issues which were finally and necessarily determined against her in a
prior action. This cause of action is therefore barred by the doctrine of issue
preclusion.
 
            Accordingly,
Defendants are entitled to judgment on the pleadings of the second cause of
action.
 
Third Cause of Action: Violation of Homeowners’ Bill of
Rights
 
Defendants move for judgment on the
pleadings of the third cause of action for violation of the Homeowners’ Bill of
Rights on the grounds that Plaintiff’s claim fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. 
 
Defendants argue that the third
cause of action is defective because it does not specify what code provisions
Defendants have allegedly violated. Statutory violations must be pled with
specificity. (Covenant Care, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th
771, 790.) Here, Plaintiff’s Complaint is devoid of any statutory citations,
and thus has failed to apprise Defendants of what portions of the HBOR they alleged
to have breached. (Complaint ¶ 39.) Defendants are therefore entitled to
judgment on the pleadings as to the third cause of action.
 
Leave to Amend
 
            When a
demurrer is sustained, the Court determines whether there is a reasonable
possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment. (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318).  When a plaintiff “has pleaded the
general set of facts upon which his cause of action is based,” the court should
give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff
should not “be deprived of his right to maintain his action on the ground that
his pleadings were defective for lack of particulars.” (Reed v. Norman
(1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 892, 900.) Accordingly, California law imposes the
burden on the plaintiffs to demonstrate the manner in which they can amend
their pleadings to state their claims against a defendant.  (Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) “Denial of leave to amend
constitutes an abuse of discretion unless the complaint shows on its face it is
incapable of amendment.  [Citation.]  Liberality in permitting
amendment is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been
given." (Angie M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217,
1227.)
 
Although Plaintiff requests leave
to amend, she has not demonstrated how the Complaint might be amended to
correct the deficiencies raised by Defendants. Moreover, the first and second
causes of action are not curable as they are precluded by the August 2022
judgment. Leave to amend is therefore not proper as to those causes of action. On
the other hand, as the third cause of action fails for lack of detail, rather
than because the Court’s ruling on the merits precludes amendment, the Court is
obligated to permit leave to amend as to that claim. (Angie M. v. Superior
Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.)
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendants’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiff
shall have 30 days leave to amend as to the third cause of action only. 
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
