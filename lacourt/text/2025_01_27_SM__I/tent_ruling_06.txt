 Case Number:  24SMCV02455    Hearing Date:   January 27, 2025    Dept:  I The motion to establish jurisdiction is DENIED.  Jurisdiction is proper.  Judge Mandel’s order was proper when made, as
this court has already determined.  Plaintiff
is a proper plaintiff because plaintiff is asserting rights as an assignee, not
a third party beneficiary.  
 
The application for a writ of possession is GRANTED.  The prior order gave the receiver certain
rights and it appears that the writ is required to allow the receiver to
fulfill the court-appointed function.
 
The court will sign the proposed order.
