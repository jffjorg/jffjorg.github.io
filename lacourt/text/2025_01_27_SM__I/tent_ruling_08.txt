 Case Number:  SC128659    Hearing Date:   January 27, 2025    Dept:  I Well, we are where we were. 
The court believes Buckley has, at this point, waived any objections he
has to Pomerantz’s jury instructions.  The
court assumes that the objections to exhibits have been sent out by Buckley to
Pomerantz and that Pomerantz’s objections (if any) as to authenticity have been
sent to Buckley and that both are in the trial binders.  The court assumes that the various trial
binders are here and ready to go. 
 
With regard to Buckley’s brief regarding his 170.3 motion,
Buckley’s legal analysis is in error for the reasons set forth in the court’s
order striking the challenge. 
 
The court is aware of Buckley’s request for a court reporter
based on his fee waiver.   The court will
discuss that at the hearing.  Inasmuch as
the request was filed the court day before the trial, the court is not sure
that the request is timely.  Nor is the
court sure that Buckley’s prior fee waiver request is up to date.
