And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is uncertain why the case, which has been ongoing since 2016, is still not ready for trial. The parties had attempted to settle, but discovery was delayed. The Judge is concerned that the case may be delayed further due to disputes over the availability of a key expert witness. The Judge suggests that instead of forcing the issue, the parties should work together to resolve the problem. If the Judge is forced to take action, it may impose preclusion orders or delay the trial until September 2026, which could be beyond the mandatory dismissal date. The Judge warns the parties that if they do not cooperate, they may be held responsible for the delay.
