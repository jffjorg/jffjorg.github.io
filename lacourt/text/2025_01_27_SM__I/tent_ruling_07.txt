 Case Number:  SC126473    Hearing Date:   January 27, 2025    Dept:  I This case has been around since 2016—it is over 8 years
old.  Defendant wants to either advance
the hearings on the discovery motions or continue the trial.  The court will inquire further.  The court is, frankly, unsure why it is that
the case is still not ready for trial. 
The court understands that discovery was put off by the parties while
they tried to settle, but this case is very, very old.  The court agrees that it is a problem if what
the defense says is true—that plaintiff will not make its busy expert available
for deposition.  But there are other ways
to deal with that problem rather than delay an already over-long case or force
the court to hear no less than eight discovery motions.  For example, the court would be open to
striking plaintiff’s expert.  After all,
one presumes that the expert declaration stated, under oath, that the expert
would be available for deposition. 
 
The parties would be very well advised not to force this
issue.  They need to get together and
deal with the problem.  If the court is
forced to find the bad actor here, it will do so.  If it is plaintiff, preclusion orders might
ensue or the trial might be put off until the next available trial slot—which
is September 2026, which could put it beyond the mandatory dismissal date.  If it is defendant, defendant will have to
fly blind at trial.
