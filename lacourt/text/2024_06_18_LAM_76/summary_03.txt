Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is issued by the court regarding the demurrer to the complaint. The defendant, ADLI Law Group, P.C., demurred to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff's claims for legal malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract are not adequately pled.

The court sustains the demurrer to the first cause of action for legal malpractice because the plaintiff has not alleged that the defendants were negligent in providing legal advice or representation. The court also sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty because the plaintiff has not alleged a breach of the duty of loyalty.

The court overrules the demurrer to the third cause of action for breach of contract because the plaintiff has sufficiently pled that performing the contract consistent with fiduciary principles was an implied term of the contract.

The court gives the plaintiff 30 days' leave to amend where indicated. The court does not desire oral argument on the motion and requires notice of intention to appear.
