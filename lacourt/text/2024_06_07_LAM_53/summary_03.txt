"The court has granted Defendant General Motors LLC's motion for relief from waiver of discovery objections, finding that Defendant has met the statutory conditions for relief. The court has also denied Plaintiff Kimberly Lucero's motion to compel responses to demands for inspection, finding that the motion is moot since Defendant has since served responsive discovery requests. The court has ordered Defendant to pay monetary sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $911.65. The court finds that Defendant's failure to serve timely responses was due to mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect, and that Defendant's counsel made calendaring errors."
