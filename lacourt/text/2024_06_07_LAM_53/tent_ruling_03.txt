No reply papers were filed in connection with that motion. 
MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM WAIVER OF
OBJECTIONS
Defendant General Motors LLC
(“Defendant”) moves the court for an order relieving it from waiver of its
discovery objections in connection with the Requests for Production of
Documents served on it by plaintiff Kimberly Lucero (“Plaintiff”). 
If a party to whom a demand
for inspection is directed fails to serve a timely response, the party to whom
the demand for inspection is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or the protection for work production.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(a).)  “The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: [¶] (1) The party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280.  [¶]  (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely
response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
First, the court finds that
Defendant has met its burden to show that it has since served responses that
are in substantial compliance with sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280.[1]  (Valencia Decl. in Opposition to Pl. Mot. to
Compel, Ex. A [Defendant’s responses to Requests for Production of Documents].)

Second, the court finds that
Defendant has met its burden to show that its failure to serve timely responses
was due to the mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect of Defendant’s
counsel in (1) failing to ensure that counsel’s staff properly processed
Plaintiff’s discovery requests, and (2) making calendaring errors.  (Valencia Decl., ¶¶ 4, 8.)
Thus, the court finds that
Defendant has satisfied both statutory conditions for relief from its waiver of
objections and therefore grants Defendant’s motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
 
 
MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO DEMANDS
FOR INSPECTION
Plaintiff moves the court for
an order (1) compelling Defendant to serve, without objections, verified
responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and (2)
awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the
amount of $2,004.15.
If a party to whom a demand
for inspection is directed fails to serve a timely response, the party making
the demand may move for an order compelling responses to the demand.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) 
Plaintiff presented evidence
establishing that she served on Defendant her Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One, on March 8, 2023. 
(Yashar Decl., Ex. 1.)  Defendant
did not serve timely responses and had not served responses as of the date that
Plaintiff filed this motion.  (Yashar
Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.)  In Defendant’s
opposition to this motion, Defendant has presented evidence establishing that
it served, on August 9, 2023, responses to this discovery.  (Valencia Decl., Ex. A.)  Moreover, as set forth above, the court has
granted Defendant’s motion seeking relief from its waiver of discovery
objections. 
Thus, the court denies
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One, as moot. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s
request for monetary sanctions.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)  The
court finds that $911.65 ((2 hours x $425 hourly rate) + $61.65 filing fee) is
a reasonable amount of sanctions to impose against Defendant in connection with
this motion.  (Yashar Decl., ¶¶ 7-8.)
ORDER
            The court grants defendant General
Motors LLC’s motion for relief from waiver of discovery objections. 
            The court orders that defendant
General Motors LLC is relieved from its waiver of objections to plaintiff
Kimberly Lucero’s Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One. 
            The court denies plaintiff Kimberly
Lucero’s motion to compel responses to demands for inspection. 
            The court grants plaintiff Kimberly
Lucero’s request for monetary sanctions. 
            The court orders defendant General
Motors LLC to pay monetary sanctions to plaintiff Kimberly Lucero in the amount
of $911.65 within 30 days of the date of service of this order. 
            The court orders defendant General
Motors LLC to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  June 7, 2024
