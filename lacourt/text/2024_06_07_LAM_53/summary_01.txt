And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Robert B. Broadbelt III regarding a petition for approval of a compromise of claim on behalf of minor claimant Nancy Del Socorro Martinez. The petition seeks court approval of a settlement made on behalf of the minor claimant. The settlement is for 75% of the total settlement amount, with a confidential amount paid for medical expenses and a confidential amount paid to counsel for legal expenses. The net recovery will be split between a special needs trust and a trustee.

The court has reviewed the petition and finds the settlement to be fair and reasonable. However, the court exercises its discretion to continue the hearing to give the petitioner an opportunity to file an amended Attachment 18b(4) that complies with the requirements of Local Rule 4.115, subdivision (b). The court also orders the petitioner to comply with Local Rule 4.115, subdivision (b) regarding the payment of settlement funds to a special needs trust.

The court also issues orders regarding an ex parte application to file confidential records under seal. The application seeks an order placing certain documents under seal to avoid disclosure of the settlement terms. The court exercises its discretion to continue the hearing on the ex parte application to be heard on the same day as the hearing on the petition.
