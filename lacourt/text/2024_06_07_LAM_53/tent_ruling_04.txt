[1] Defendant
did not attach its responses to this discovery in the papers filed in
connection with its motion for relief from waiver.  However, the court has considered the
evidence filed in support of its opposition to Plaintiff’s motion to compel
since Defendant referenced its opposition in support of this motion.  (Valencia Decl., ¶ 7.)
