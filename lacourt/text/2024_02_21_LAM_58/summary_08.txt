And here is the summary in English-text:

This tentative ruling is based on the information presented to the Judge before the Court Hearing. The Judge notes that the request for sanctions does not comply with the procedural requirements of the statute. The Plaintiff did not attach an Answer to their moving papers, despite Answers already being filed and struck due to a previous motion for terminating sanctions. The Judge cites two case citations to support their ruling: Hernandez v. FCA US LLC (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 329, 337, and Transcon Financial, Inc. v. Reid & Hellyer, APC (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 547, 550. The Judge intends to require compliance with procedural requirements and ensure that all parties follow the law.
