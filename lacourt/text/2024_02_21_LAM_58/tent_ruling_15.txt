constructive trust is a property right. “We conclude that regardless of whether
a constructive trust is viewed as a remedy, cause of action, or doctrine, it
requires a property right. (See Glue-Fold, Inc. v. Slautterback Corp.
(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023, fn. 3 [constructive trust “is not an
independent cause of action but merely a type of remedy”]; Higgins v.
Higgins (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 648, 658, 659, fn. 2 [disagreeing with Glue-Fold;
action for “constructive trust is a suit in equity to compel a person holding
property wrongfully to transfer” it to the rightful owner].) Thus, a
constructive trust cannot establish a property interest.
