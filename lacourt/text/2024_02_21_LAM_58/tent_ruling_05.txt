objections cite pages and pages of depositions testimony making it difficult to
determine the specifically objectionable material based on the objection
asserted; in such cases, the objections are overruled. (Cf. Fibreboard Paper
Products Corporation v. East Bay Union of Machinists, Local 1304, United
Steelworkers of America, AFL–CIO, et al. (1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 675, 712
[“The objection to such exhibit was, however, a general one. An inadmissible
portion of a document, the remainder of which is admissible in evidence, cannot
be reached by a general objection to the admission of the entire document, but
the inadmissible portion must be specified.”].)


[2]           Plaintiff
Villanueva did not contend that any of the alleged inappropriate conduct
identified in the September 2017 Complaint was directed at him. (DSS 15.)


[3]           In fact,
on May 30, 2018, Plaintiff Villanueva signed a release agreement in connection
with his promotion to Asset Protection Director, which provided a full release
for any claims that may have arisen prior to this date. (DSS 26.) Nonetheless, Plaintiffs’
opposition then goes on to specifically cite conduct that pre-dates this time
period. Specifically, Plaintiffs argue “in January 2018, Quintero was asked to
sign a timekeeping and attendance policy that targeted Jehovah’s Witnesses and
seemed designed to prevent them from having lunch together.” (Opp., 20:9-11.)
