Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment. The defendant failed to file an answer and default was entered, and the plaintiff subsequently entered a default judgment. The defendant moved to set aside the default judgment, claiming that it did not receive service of the complaint and summons and that its president only learned of the default judgment on August 1, 2023. However, the court found that the motion was untimely, having been filed seven months and 23 days after default was entered against the defendant. The court also noted that the six-month time limitation for seeking relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) is jurisdictional and cannot be extended.
