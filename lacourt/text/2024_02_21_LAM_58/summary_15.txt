Here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling concluding that a constructive trust cannot establish a property interest. The ruling is based on the judge's analysis of two California appellate court cases, Glue-Fold, Inc. v. Slautterback Corp. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1018 and Higgins v. Higgins (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 648. The judge finds that a constructive trust is not an independent cause of action, but rather a type of remedy that requires a property right. The ruling suggests that a constructive trust cannot be used to establish a property interest, and instead must be based on an existing property right.
