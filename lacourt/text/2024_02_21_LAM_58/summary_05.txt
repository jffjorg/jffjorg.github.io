And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the objections raised by the defendants regarding the evidence presented. The judge notes that the objections are general and do not specify the objectionable material, and therefore overrules them. The judge also reviews the allegations of inappropriate conduct made by the plaintiff, Villanueva, and notes that Villanueva did not contest these allegations in his original complaint. Furthermore, Villanueva signed a release agreement on May 30, 2018, which provided a full release for any claims that may have arisen prior to that date. The opposition then goes on to cite conduct that pre-dates this time period, specifically an allegedly inappropriate timekeeping and attendance policy.
