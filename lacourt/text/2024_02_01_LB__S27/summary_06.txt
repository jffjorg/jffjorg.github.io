And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for appointment of a receiver and a preliminary injunction in a case involving a loan default. The plaintiff, Nano Banc, alleges that the defendant, Global Premier Regency Palms, LP and Global Premier Development, Inc., is in breach of the parties' agreement and seeks appointment of a receiver to manage the property. The defendant concedes default on the loan and related agreements, but opposes appointment of a receiver.

The judge notes that CCP ยง564(b)(11) permits appointment of a receiver in certain circumstances, including when a secured lender seeks specific performance of an assignment of rents provision in a deed of trust. The judge also references the Rutter Guide on Civil Procedure Before Trial, which discusses the appointment of receivers and the cost of receiverships.

The judge is concerned about the cost of receivership and wishes to hear argument on this issue at the hearing. The judge also notes that the defendant has proposed a pay-off amount of $17,500,000, but this is not a sufficient amount to pay off the full $22 million debt.

The judge is inclined to appoint a receiver if the parties demonstrate that there is sufficient money in the debtor's estate to pay all expenses on the property and also pay for the receiver. If the court is not satisfied, it will not appoint a receiver.

The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction, which will preclude the defendant from interfering with the receiver's duties. The judge requests that counsel make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on the motion for appointment of a receiver and a preliminary injunction.
