Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to compel arbitration filed by Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC. The motion was based on a theory that the dealership's arbitration agreement could be enforced under a third-party beneficiary theory and an estoppel theory. However, the judge found that the Court of Appeals decision in Ochoa v. Ford Motor Company (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, which holds that a manufacturer cannot enforce a dealership's arbitration agreement under such theories, is indistinguishable from this case. The judge agrees with the analysis in Ochoa and will follow it pending any contrary ruling from the California Supreme Court. The motion is therefore denied.
