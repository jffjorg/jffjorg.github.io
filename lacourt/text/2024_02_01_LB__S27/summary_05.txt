And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike in the case of Marilyn Dwellingham vs. LB Property Management, Inc. and El Capitan Homeowners Association. The plaintiff, Marilyn Dwellingham, filed a complaint against the defendants for damages arising from a leak in the common areas of her condominium building, which caused her bathroom to be shut down for many months.

The defendants filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint, arguing that the plaintiff has not pled extreme and outrageous conduct to support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. However, the judge found that the facts pled in the complaint are substantially similar to those pled in Stoiber v. Honeychuck and are sufficient to support a claim for IIED.

The defendants also moved to strike the prayer for punitive damages, arguing that the plaintiff has not pled facts sufficient to show malice, fraud, or oppression. However, the judge found that the same facts that adequately support a claim for IIED could lead a reasonable juror to find punitive damages are appropriate.

The judge ruled that the defendants' demurrer is overruled and their motion to strike is denied. The defendants are ordered to file an answer to the First Amended Complaint within ten days.
