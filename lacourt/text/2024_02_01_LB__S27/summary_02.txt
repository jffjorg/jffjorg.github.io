And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for leave to file an untimely third amended complaint. The plaintiff filed the original complaint on January 18, 2022, and has since filed multiple amended complaints. The defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike, which was sustained with leave to amend. The plaintiff's attorney claims that he had the flu and pneumonia during the time period when the third amended complaint should have been drafted and filed, but the defendant argues that the attorney's pattern and practice of failing to timely participate in proceedings is a sufficient excuse for the delay. The judge notes that the plaintiff's attorney continued to litigate the action during the time he was ill, including by attending two depositions, but failed to file the required amended pleading. The judge is concerned about the defendant's evidence showing the plaintiff's attorney's lack of diligence and is inclined to deny the motion for leave to amend.
