 Case Number:  23LBCV00242    Hearing Date:   February 1, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff, David Ragus filed this
action against numerous defendants, many of whom have filed cross-complaints against
one another.  Plaintiff’s complaint
arises out of a trip and fall incident.    
 
At this time Defendants, Courtyard Management, LLC and JWMFE Long
Beach, LP have agreed to settle all claims with Plaintiff for $10,000.  Defendants seek an order from the Court
finding that the settlement is in good faith. 
Defendants filed the request as an application, but on 12/08/23 the Court
set it for hearing as a motion.  
 
Defendant timely and properly
served the moving papers on all other defendants in the action.  Any motion to contest was due within 25 days
(CCP §877.6(a)(2)), and no motion has been filed.  
The burden on a motion for
determination of good faith settlement rests squarely on the party opposing the
finding of good faith.  CCP
§877.6(d).  In light of the lack of any
motion to contest the settlement, no party has met that burden.  The motion/application for determination of
good faith settlement is therefore granted.
 
Moving Defendants are ordered to
give notice.
