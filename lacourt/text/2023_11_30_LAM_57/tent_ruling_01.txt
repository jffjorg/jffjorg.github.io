  Case Number:  21STCV42748    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  57  The Court's tentative decision is to deny the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by Defendant Helen Kim Law, APC.  The Court is denying the motion for two reasons.   First, Defendant's separate statement of undisputed material facts fails to comply with California Rule of Court 3.1350(d) and (h) in that it does not contain discrete headings that match up the purported undisputed material facts with the particular causes of action in Plaintiff's complaint.  Second, and in any event, there are disputed issues of material as to the causes of action.  As to the causes of action that are based on an alleged oral agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant to split the costs of the litigation in which they were co-counsel for a client, there is a disputed issue of material fact as to whether that oral agreement is separate and apart from the written agreements related to the representation of that client.  In reaching this conclusion, the Court has noted that Defendant contends that any oral agreement was unenforceable in light of the written agreements.  The disputed issues of material fact speak to that contention of unenforceability.  As to the fraud-based causes of action, there are disputed issues of material fact as to whether Plaintiff was aware that Defendant could not carry out the purported oral agreement and whether Plaintiff's reliance on Defendant's alleged promise to carry out the agreement was reasonable.
