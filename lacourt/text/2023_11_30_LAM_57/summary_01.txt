The Court's tentative decision is to deny the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by Defendant Helen Kim Law, APC. The Court is denying the motion for two reasons: first, the Defendant's separate statement of undisputed material facts fails to comply with California Rule of Court 3.1350(d) and (h), and second, there are disputed issues of material fact as to the causes of action. The Court notes that the disputed issues of material fact speak to the contention that the oral agreement is unenforceable in light of the written agreements.
