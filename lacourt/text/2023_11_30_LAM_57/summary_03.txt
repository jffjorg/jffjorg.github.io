And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to transfer the venue of the case from Los Angeles County to Riverside County. The defendants, C&J Construction Solutions, LLC and Roberto Milli, argued that the general venue rule of Code of Civil Procedure Section 395(a) applied, but the judge found that FEHA's special venue rule overrides this general rule. The judge also found that the alleged unlawful employment practices occurred in Los Angeles County, where Renteria worked as a delivery driver for C&J Construction Solutions, LLC. Additionally, the judge ruled that venue is proper in Los Angeles County for Renteria's Labor Code claims, which seek penalties for violations of the wage and hour and meal and rest break provisions of the Labor Code. The judge declined to sanction the defendants for filing the motion, finding that no sanctions were warranted in this case.
