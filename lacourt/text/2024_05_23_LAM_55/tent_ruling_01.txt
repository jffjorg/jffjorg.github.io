  Case Number:  20STCV39275    Hearing Date:   May 23, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Motion of Kamyab Law Firm to be Relieved as Counsel-Civil for Defendant.
 
BACKGROUND
JOSE LIRA (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against SILVESTRE
COSIO (Defendant), alleging a breach of contract and fraud committed by
Defendant, after Defendant agreed to produce textile materials in exchange for
money tendered by Plaintiff, but Defendant never delivered.
Now, counsel moves to be relieved as attorney of
record for Defendant by declaring that there has been a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship.
LEGAL STANDARD
“The determination whether to grant or deny an
attorney 's motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.” Lempert v. Sup. Ct.
(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173. 
ANALYSIS
Here, the form notice, declaration, proposed order,
and proof of service sufficiently comply with the requirements for a motion to
be relieved as counsel. See
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 
Furthermore, moving counsel’s declaration shows a
cognizable ground for withdrawal: 

Breakdown
     in the attorney-client relationship (or personality clash). Estate of
     Falco v. Decker (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.

Finally, no opposing document has been filed showing
any prejudice to the client. See Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16, subdiv. (d). 
 
CONCLUSION
Therefore, the motion is granted, and the Court will
sign the proposed order submitted by counsel.
