And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion to withdraw as counsel of record for the plaintiff, EJA Haynespolke, brought by the Law Office of Jacob Partiyeli. The motion is based on a breakdown in client communications, lack of ongoing communication, and noncooperation by the plaintiff, making it impossible for the counsel to effectively represent the plaintiff. The judge finds that this is a sufficient ground for withdrawal under the Rules of Professional Conduct. The judge also notes that no opposing document has been filed showing any prejudice to the client. Therefore, the court grants the motion and will sign the proposed order submitted by counsel.
