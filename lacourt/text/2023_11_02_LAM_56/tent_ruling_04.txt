MOVING PARTY: Defendant
Brookfield DTLA Holdings, LLC (“Moving Defendant”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
Jeffrey Trott Industries, Inc.  
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition, and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff
filed a complaint arising from the alleged breach of an agreement for
construction services as to a property located at HNTB LA Office, 777 S.
Figueroa Street, 22nd and 23rd Floors, Los Angeles, CA 90017 (the “Property”)
alleging causes of action against Defendants for: (1) foreclosure of mechanic’s
lien; (2) breach of written contract; (3) services rendered; (4) account
stated; (5) open book account; (6) reasonable value; and (7) contractor’s
license bond. 
 
Pertinent Allegations of the Complaint 
The complaint alleges that, within
the last four years, Plaintiff and Defendant Howard Building Corporation (“Defendant
Howard”) entered into a written agreement whereby Plaintiff agreed to and did
furnish Defendant Howard with certain cabinet, casework, and millwork and other
related services and supplies and Defendants agreed to pay for such services
and supplies. (Complaint, ¶ 11 and Exhibit A.) Defendant Howard allegedly
failed to pay Plaintiff pursuant to the parties’ agreement. (Id., ¶ 12.)
The complaint alleges that: (1) prior to furnishing Defendants said project
work, Plaintiff served Defendants with a written Preliminary Notice stating
with substantial accuracy a general description of the project work to be
furnished and the name of the party to whom same were furnished (Id., ¶
16 and Exhibit B); and (2) on or about April 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed and
recorded a Mechanic’s Lien, which identifies Moving Defendant as an owner or
reputed owner of the Property. (Id., ¶ 17 and Exhibit C.) The complaint
alleges that Defendants “have or claim to have some estate, lien, right, title
or interest in or upon the premises or some part thereof, which the claim and
claims and all such claims or liens are subject, subsequent and subordinate to
the lien of the Plaintiff.” (Id., ¶ 18.) 
 
Demurrer to the Complaint
            On
September 15, 2023, Moving Defendant filed a demurrer to the first cause of
action in the complaint for foreclosure of mechanic’s lien. Moving Defendant
contends that it is neither a party to the underlying contract nor an owner of
the Property. 
 
            On
October 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed its opposition brief. On October 26, 2023,
Moving Defendant filed its reply brief. 
 
            Initially,
the Court finds that Plaintiff’s counsel, Patricia League (“League”), filed a
declaration in support of Plaintiff’s opposition to Moving Defendant’s request
for judicial notice. If Plaintiff wanted the Court to properly have before it
the exhibits attached to the declaration of League, then Plaintiff should have
filed a request for judicial notice. A declaration submitted in opposition to a
demurrer is a nullity, of no purpose or effect, in a court’s consideration of a
demurrer. (Allred v. Bekins Wide World Van Services (1975) 45 Cal.App.3d
984, 993.) The Court therefore will disregard the declaration of League
submitted to support Plaintiff’s opposition to the demurrer. 
JUDICIAL NOTICE 
            The Court GRANTS Moving
Defendant’s request for judicial notice. (Evid. Code § 452, 453.)
 
MEET AND CONFER 
            The meet and confer requirement has been met.  
 
DEMURRER

             A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.  (Durell
v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) The court gives the
complaint a reasonable interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded.  (Id.)  In testing the sufficiency of the complaint,
the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or
other extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.
App. 3d 902, 905.) Accordingly, “[w]hether the plaintiff will be able to prove
the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.” (Stevens v.
Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609-10.) A general demurrer may
be taken to a complaint where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).) Although
Courts construe pleadings liberally, sufficient facts must be alleged to
support the allegations plead to survive a demurrer. (Rakestraw v.
California Physicians' Serv. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) 
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave
to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d
335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading
can be amended successfully. (Id.) If there is any reasonable
possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to
sustain a demurrer without leave to amend. (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation
Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
 
Issue No.1: First Cause of Action
             A person that provides work authorized for a
work of improvement, including but not limited to a direct contractor,
subcontractor, material supplier, equipment lessor, laborer, and design
profession has a lien right under Cal. Civ. Code § 8400 et seq. (Cal.
Civ. Code § 8400.) A claim of mechanics lien must contain the name of the owner
or reputed owner, if known. (Cal Civ. Code § 8416(a)(2).) A reputed owner is a
person or entity reasonably and in good faith believed to be the owner by those
involved with the work of improvement including the general contractor and
those furnishing labor, service, equipment, or material to be used in the work
of improvement. (Brown Co. v. Appellate Department (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d
891, 900.) 
 
            The
demurrer of Moving Defendant merely cites to Cal. Civ. Code § 8400 in support
of its argument that the first cause of action is insufficient. (Demurrer at
1:23-27.) Neither the moving papers nor reply papers cite any applicable legal
authority setting forth the elements to state a cause of action for foreclosure
of mechanic’s lien. 
 
Moving Defendant contends that the
grant deed for the Property is proof that it is not the owner or reputed owner of
the Property. (Moving Defendant’s RJN at Exhibit 2.) The Court, however, finds
that the grant deed is from 2005 and the fact that Moving Defendant is not
named as an owner therein does not mean that it cannot be the present owner or
reputed owner.[1] (Moving
Defendant’s RJN at Exhibit 2.) The construction work at issue occurred within
the last four years. Moreover, Moving Defendant asserts that because it is not
a party to the construction contract, it cannot be held liable pursuant to the
first cause of action. (Demurrer at 2:13-17; Complaint, ¶ 11 and Exhibit A.)
Moving Defendant, however, provides no citation to any legal authority to
support such contention. Contentions are waived when a party fails to support
them with reasoned argument and citations to legal authority. (Moulton
Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.)
 
Therefore, the Court OVERRULES the
demurrer of Moving Defendant to the first cause of action in the complaint.  
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
