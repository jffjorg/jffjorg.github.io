Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the motion to continue trial filed by Plaintiff Kyle Madison and has granted the motion. The Court finds that there is good cause to continue the trial as Plaintiff has been unable to obtain essential evidence and has not completed discovery before the trial date. The Court notes that Plaintiff has been unable to obtain discovery despite diligent efforts and that the Defendant has not provided requested information. The Court also notes that Plaintiff's counsel has a trial in Department 78 on December 11, 2023, and that the date of the Defendant's uncertificated stock sale has not been set yet, which will affect the Defendant's obligations in this case. The Court has set a new trial date of June 5, 2024, and has ordered that all discovery and motion cut-off dates be based upon the new trial date.
