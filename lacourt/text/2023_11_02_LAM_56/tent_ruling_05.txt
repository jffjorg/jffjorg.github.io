[1] A demurrer is not the appropriate
procedure for determining the truth of disputed facts. (Fremont Indemnity
Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 113-114.) A court
cannot by means of judicial notice convert a demurrer into an incomplete
evidentiary hearing in which the demurring party can present documentary
evidence and the opposing party is bound by what that evidence appears to show.
(Id. at p. 115.)
