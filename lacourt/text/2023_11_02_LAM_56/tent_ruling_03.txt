BACKGROUND
             This is a PAGA action. Plaintiff Teresa R.
Fleming (“Plaintiff”) was employed by Defendant Data Media Visual Services, LLC
(“Defendant”) from September 2021 to December 17, 2021. Defendant allegedly
failed to pay Plaintiff all wages at the applicable minimum wage for all hours
worked and overtime wages for all overtime hours worked.
            On February 10, 2023, the Court
issued an order on joint stipulation to stay case pending the California
Supreme Court’s decision in Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (Stipulation
02/10/2023.)  On July 17, 2023, the
Supreme Court of California issued its decision in Adolph v. Uber
Technologies, Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104. 
 
            On August 31, 2023, Defendant filed
a motion for stay of proceedings. On October 24, 2023, Defendant filed a Notice
of Non-Opposition.
DISCUSSION
            Code of Civil Procedure section
1281.4¿provides:¿ 
“If
a court of competent jurisdiction, whether in this State or not, has ordered
arbitration of a controversy which is an issue involved in an action or
proceeding pending before a court of this State, the court in which such action
or proceeding is pending shall, upon motion of a party to such action or
proceeding, stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration is had in
accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the court
specifies.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.4.)¿ 
 
The
clear language of section 1281.4 compels the conclusion that any party to a
judicial proceeding, whether a party to an arbitration agreement or not, is
entitled to a stay of those proceedings whenever (1) the arbitration of a
controversy has been ordered, and (2) that controversy is also an issue
involved in the pending judicial action. It is irrelevant under the statute
whether the movant is a party to the arbitration agreement.¿ As stated in Cook
v. Superior Court, 240 Cal.App.2d 880, 885, “Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281.4 seems broad enough to vest the court with authority to stay ‘the
action or proceeding’ as to all issues, as to all causes of action, and as to
all parties, until arbitration is concluded . . . .” (Marcus v. Superior
Court (1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 204, 209.)
            Defendant moves for a stay of the
proceedings pending a resolution of the arbitration of Plaintiff’s individual
claims.             Plaintiff argues that
the statutory mandatory stay under Civil Code section 1281.4 applies to the
present action. Plaintiff presents evidence of the Court ordered arbitration of
and a stay of Plaintiff’s individual claims in the related case Fleming v.
Visual Data Media Services, case no. 22STCV19393. (Northrup Decl. ¶ 4, 5,
Ex. C, D.) Plaintiff asserts that the arbitration involves controversies at
issue in the present action. Plaintiff cites Adolph, as support that
staying Plaintiff’s PAGA action pending arbitration of Plaintiff’s individual
claims is proper. Furthermore, Plaintiff argues that the exception to the
mandatory stay under section 1281.4 does not apply because the arbitration of
Plaintiff’s individual claims does not make those claims severable. 
 
            “Nothing in PAGA or any other
relevant statute suggests that arbitrating individual claims effects a
severance.” (Adolph, 14 Cal.5th at 1125.) The California Supreme Court
references section 1281.4 to state that courts should stay actions upon
ordering arbitration of an issue in controversy that is an issue in an action.
(Id.)  Furthermore, the Court’s
decision emphasizes that the arbitration of an issue in controversy is not a
separate action under section 1281.4 but rather remains one action, parts of
which may be stayed pending completion of the arbitration. (Id. at
1125.) Furthermore, “where a
plaintiff has filed a PAGA action comprised of individual and non-individual
claims, an order compelling arbitration of individual claims does not strip the
plaintiff of standing to litigate non-individual claims in court.” (Id.
at 1123.) 
 
In
this case, the representative PAGA claim is severable from Plaintiff’s
individual claims in arbitration. This Court acknowledges that the related case
and this action involve the same allegations of Labor Code violations and thus
involve substantially the same issues. (Northrup Decl., Ex. A, E.) Because the
arbitration of Plaintiff’s individual claims will involve substantially the
same issues, the action is stayed pending arbitration of Plaintiff’s individual
claims. Plaintiff
does not oppose the motion.
 
            Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for
stay of proceedings is GRANTED. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
            
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
