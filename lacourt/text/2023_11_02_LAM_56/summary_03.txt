The Judge, Holly J. Fujie, has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the Defendant, Visual Data Media Services, LLC, to stay the proceedings pending arbitration of the Plaintiff's individual claims. The Plaintiff, Teresa R. Fleming, filed a PAGA action against the Defendant, alleging that the Defendant failed to pay her minimum wage and overtime wages during her employment from September 2021 to December 17, 2021. The Defendant moved for a stay of proceedings pending arbitration of the Plaintiff's individual claims, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.4. The Judge concluded that the statutory mandatory stay under Civil Code section 1281.4 applies to the present action and that the arbitration of the Plaintiff's individual claims will involve substantially the same issues as the PAGA action. The Judge granted the Defendant's motion for stay of proceedings, pending arbitration of the Plaintiff's individual claims.
