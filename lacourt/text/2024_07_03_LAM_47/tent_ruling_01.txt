DISCUSSION:
 
Defendant Grandison’s Demurrer to Complaint
 
            Defendant
Patricia Grandison demurs to the Complaint for failure to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action and for uncertainty. 
 
Legal Standard
 
A demurrer tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and
Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face
of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.) The
ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all
facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged. (Marshall
v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403; see also Shields
v. County of San Diego (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 103, 133 [stating, “[o]n
demurrer, pleadings are read liberally and allegations contained therein are
assumed to be true”].) “This rule of liberal construction means that the
reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the
defendant.” (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th
1228, 1238.) 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Before filing a demurrer, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who has filed the pleading subject to the demurrer and file a declaration
detailing their meet-and-confer efforts. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).) However, an insufficient meet-and-confer process
is not grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.41(a)(4).)
 
The Declaration of Stefon Jones in
support of this demurrer states that counsel for the parties met and conferred via
email on May 17, 2024 and telephonically on May 28, 2024, but were unable to
resolve this dispute. (Declaration of Stefon A. Jones ISO Dem ¶¶2-3.) The Court
therefore finds that Defendant has satisfied the statutory meet-and-confer obligations.

 
Sufficiency of Cause of Action
 
            Defendant
Grandison demurs to Plaintiffs’ sole cause of action for breach of contract for
failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
 
To state a cause of action for
breach of contract, a plaintiff must plead the contract, the plaintiff’s
performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, Defendant’s breach,
and finally the resulting damage. (Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation
Co. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458.) Further, the complaint must indicate
whether the contract is written, oral, or implied by conduct. (Code Civ.Proc. §
430.10(g).) General allegations stating that defendants violated a contract are
insufficient, and plaintiffs must state facts showing a breach. (Levy v.
State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1, 5-6.) For
breach of a written contract, the essential terms must be set out verbatim in
the body of the complaint or a copy of the written instrument must be attached
and incorporated by reference. (Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co.,
supra, 166 Cal.App.3d at 459.)
 
“Where written documents are the
foundation of an action and are attached to the complaint and incorporated
therein by reference, they become a part of the complaint and may be considered
on demurrer.” (Qualcomm, Inc. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London
(2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 184, 191.) “Under the doctrine of truthful pleading, the
courts ‘will not close their eyes to situations where a complaint contains
allegations of fact inconsistent with attached documents, or allegations
contrary to facts that are judicially noticed.’ [Citation.] ‘False allegations
of fact, inconsistent with annexed documentary exhibits [citation] or contrary
to facts judicially noticed [citation], may be disregarded.” (Trinity Park;
L.P. v. City of Sunnyvale (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1014, 1027.)
 
Defendant Grandison contends that
Plaintiffs have failed to state facts sufficient to support a breach of
contract claim against her because the operative purchase agreement, attached
to the Complaint as Exhibit 3, plainly identifies the parties to the purchase
agreement and expressly excludes Defendant as a party. The Commercial Purchase
Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions attached to the Complaint and
identified as the operative contract define the parties as the buyer and seller
of the subject property. (Complaint Exh. 3 § 1.D.) The buyer is identified as
FWA Properties, Inc. (Complaint Exh. 3. §1.A.) The seller is identified as La-Doris
McClaney. (Id. Exh. 3. § 40.D.) While Defendant Grandison is listed in
the agreement as the “Seller’s Agent,” the Agreement also expressly states that
“Brokers and Agents are not Parties” to the agreement. (Complaint Exh. 3. §
1.D.) 
 
Plaintiffs, in opposition, argue
that Defendant Grandison, as a broker agent, owes statutory duties to the buyer
and can be liable for breach of those duties by statute or in tort. These
contentions are irrelevant because Plaintiffs did not assert claims for breach
of statutory duties or tort claims: they asserted a single cause of action for
breach of a contract to which Defendant Grandison is expressly not a party. Under
well-settled precedent, “an agent is ordinarily not liable on the contract when
he acts on behalf of a disclosed principal.” (Stoiber v. Honeychuck (1980)
101 Cal.App.3d 903, 929.) Both standing precedent and the express terms of the
contract foreclose Defendant Grandison’s liability on a breach of contract
claim. 
 
Uncertainty
 
            Defendant
demurs to the Complaint in its entirety on the grounds that it is uncertain.
 
Demurrers¿for uncertainty are disfavored,
because discovery can be used for clarification, and they apply only where
defendants cannot reasonably determine what issues or claims are stated.¿(Chen
v. Berenjian (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 811, 822; Khoury v. Maly's of Cal.,
Inc.¿(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) If the complaint is sufficiently
comprehensible that Defendant can reasonably respond, the complaint is not
uncertain. (Mahan v. Charles W. Chan Ins. Agency, Inc. (2017) 14
Cal.App.5th 841, 848 n.3.)  
 
            Defendant
argues that the Complaint is uncertain because it contains no allegations
specific to her and merely deals with all Defendants other than the Seller in
the aggregate. This is an argument for the failure to allege sufficient facts,
not uncertainty. 
 
Leave to Amend
 
When a demurrer is sustained, the
Court determines whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can
be cured by amendment. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318).  When a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set of facts upon
which his cause of action is based,” the court should give the plaintiff an
opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be deprived of his
right to maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings were defective
for lack of particulars.” (Reed v. Norman (1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 892,
900.) Accordingly, California law imposes the burden on the plaintiffs to
demonstrate the manner in which they can amend their pleadings to state their
claims against a defendant.  (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 349.) “Denial of leave to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion
unless the complaint shows on its face it is incapable of amendment. 
[Citation.]  Liberality in permitting amendment is the rule, if a fair
opportunity to correct any defect has not been given." (Angie M. v.
Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.)
 
            Plaintiffs
have not demonstrated how the Complaint could be amended to cure the
deficiencies identified here. Moreover, as the express language of the contract
states that Defendant Grandison is not a party, Plaintiffs are precluded from
asserting a breach of contract claim against her on these facts. Leave to amend
is therefore not appropriate with respect to a breach of contract claim. In so
ruling, the Court does not address any other theories of liability on the same
facts, as those theories have not been pled and are not at issue. 
 
Conclusion
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant Grandison’s Demurrer to the Complaint is SUSTAINED without
leave to amend as to the assertion of a breach of contract claim. 
 
Defendant Grandison’s Motion to Strike
 
            Defendant
Grandison also moves to strike portions of the Complaint. As the Court has
sustained her demurrer to the Complaint, Defendant Grandison’s Motion to Strike
is MOOT. 
 
Defendant Bass’s Demurrer to Complaint
 
Defendant Bass demurs to the
Complaint for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
and for uncertainty.

Sufficiency of Cause of Action
 
            Defendant
Bass demurs to Plaintiffs’ sole cause of action for breach of contract for
failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
 
To state a cause of action for
breach of contract, a plaintiff must plead the contract, the plaintiff’s
performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, Defendant’s breach,
and finally the resulting damage. (Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation

to facts judicially noticed [citation], may be disregarded.” (Trinity Park;
L.P. v. City of Sunnyvale (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1014, 1027.)
 
Defendant Bass contends that
Plaintiffs have failed to state facts sufficient to support a breach of
contract claim against him because the operative purchase agreement, attached
to the Complaint as Exhibit 3, plainly identifies the parties to the purchase
agreement does not identify Bass as a party. The Commercial Purchase Agreement
and Joint Escrow Instructions attached to the Complaint and identified as the
operative contract define the parties as the buyer and seller of the subject
property. (Complaint Exh. 3 § 1.D.) The buyer is identified as FWA Properties,
Inc. (Complaint Exh. 3. §1.A.) The seller is identified as La-Doris McClaney. (Id.
Exh. 3. § 40.D.) Unlike Defendant Grandison, Defendant Bass is not named
anywhere in the contract.  Further,
according to its own terms, “Brokers and Agents are not Parties” to the
agreement. (Complaint Exh. 3. § 1.D.) 
 
Plaintiffs, in opposition, argue
that Defendant Bass, as a broker agent, owes statutory duties to the buyer and
can be liable for breach of those duties by statute or in tort. These
contentions are irrelevant because Plaintiffs did not assert claims for breach
of statutory duties nor tort claims: they asserted a single cause of action for
breach of a contract. Moreover, the Agreement expressly states that “Brokers
and Agents are not Parties” to the agreement. (Complaint Exh. 3. § 1.D.)
Further, as discussed above, precedent holds that “an agent is ordinarily not
liable on the contract when he acts on behalf of a disclosed principal.” (Stoiber
v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 929.) Both standing precedent and

breach of contract claim.
