[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
MOTION FOR AN
  ORDER THAT THE TRUTH OF MATTERS SPECIFIED IN PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR
  ADMISSIONS BE DEEMED ADMITTED AS AGAINST DEFENDANT BYOUNG LEE
 



Background
Plaintiff National Commercial Recovery,
Inc. dba Blair Smith and Associates (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on July 31,
2023 against a number of defendants, including Byoung Lee aka Byoung D. Lee aka
Byoung Don Lee (“Lee”). The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) common
counts – open book account, (2) common counts – goods sold and delivered, 
(3) account stated, and (4)
money due on dishonored checks. 
Plaintiff now moves for
an order that the truth of the matters specified in Plaintiff’s Request for
Admissions, Set One, be deemed admitted against Lee. Plaintiff also seeks
monetary sanctions against Lee. The motion is unopposed. 
Discussion 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.280, subdivision (a), “[i]f a party to
whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
following rules apply: (a) The party to whom the requests for admission are directed waives
any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010).” Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (b), “[t]he requesting party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010).” Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280,
subdivision (c), “[t]he court shall
make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” 
In his declaration in support of the motion,
Plaintiff’s counsel states that on December 6, 2023, Plaintiff served
Lee with “Plaintiff’s Request for Admission of Facts for Defendant Byoung Don
Lee; Set One,” (herein, the “RFAs”). (Besnyl Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.) Plaintiff’s
counsel states in his declaration that “[o]n January 11, 2024, after the
responses became overdue, I sent a demand letter to defendant BYOUNG LEE
stating that a motion to deem the requests admitted would be brought by
plaintiff unless the responses were received by the following Thursday, January
18, 2024.” (Besnyl Decl., ¶ 3 Ex. B.) Plaintiff’s counsel states that “[t]o
date, I have not received any response to my letter or any responses to
plaintiff’s Request For Admissions.” (Besnyl Decl., ¶ 4.)
On May 28, 2024, an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) was held in
this matter. The Court’s May 28, 2024 minute order provides, inter alia,
that “[t]he matter is called for hearing. There are no appearances by or for
the defendant(s) this date. The plaintiff has fulfilled the Informal Discovery
Conference Requirement re: The Request for Admissions.” 
Lee does not oppose the instant motion and thus does
not provide any evidence that Lee served a response to the subject RFAs.
The Court finds that
the evidence demonstrates that Lee did
not timely serve a response to the RFAs.
Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the matters in
Plaintiff’s RFAs
to Lee admitted.
Plaintiff also
seeks monetary sanctions in connection with the instant motion. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c), “[i]t is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Emphasis
added.)
In his supporting declaration, Plaintiff’s
counsel states that “I will have spent approximately 2.0 hours in
preparing and appearing for this motion. My hourly rate is billed at $275.00
per hour, resulting in a total fees of $550.00. Plaintiff has also incurred
$60.00 in filing costs in bringing this Motion; thus the total attorney’s fees
and costs in bringing this Motion will be $610.00.” (Besnyl Decl., ¶ 5.) The
Court finds that $610.00 in monetary sanctions is reasonable and grants
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in this amount. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion is granted. The Court orders
that the matters in Plaintiff’s Request for Admission of Facts for
Defendant Byoung Don Lee; Set One are
deemed admitted. 
The Court further orders
Lee to pay $610.00 to Plaintiff within 30 days of notice of this Order.
Plaintiff is
ordered to give notice of this Order.
