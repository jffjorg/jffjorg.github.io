  ORDER RE:
 
DEFENDANTS’
  MOTION TO STRIKE PLAINTIFF SRI RAMANATHAN’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
 



 
Background
On August 17, 2022,
Plaintiff Sri Ramanathan (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants G2
Secure Staff LLC and Saeed Bholat (jointly, “Defendants”). On February 22,
2024, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), alleging
eight causes of action. 
Defendants now move to
strike the FAC pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 436. Plaintiff opposes. 

Discussion 
As an initial matter,
the Court notes that Defendants’ counsel’s declaration filed in support of the
motion to strike indicates, inter alia, that “[b]etween February
23, 2024, and March 5, 2024, the parties attempted to meet and confer regarding
Plaintiff’s filing of the First Amended Complaint. Unfortunately, the Parties
were unable to reach an agreement and Defendants were forced to proceed with the
filing of this motion.” (Woods Decl., ¶ 9.) 
The Court notes that Defendants’
counsel’s declaration does not demonstrate that the parties met and
conferred in person, by telephone, or by video
conference, or that Defendants’
counsel attempted to do so. Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a), “[b]efore filing a motion to strike pursuant to
this chapter, the moving party shall meet and confer in person, by
telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading
that is subject to the motion to strike for the purpose of determining if an
agreement can be reached that resolves the objections to be raised in the
motion to strike. If an amended pleading is filed, the responding party shall meet and
confer again with the party who filed the amended pleading before filing a
motion to strike the amended pleading.” (Emphasis added.) Such meeting and conferring must be done in
good faith with an effort to try to resolve the issues subject to the motion to
strike. 
In light of the foregoing,
the hearing on Defendants’
motion to strike is continued to _______________, 2024 at 2 p.m. in Dept.
50. 
Defendants
are¿ordered to meet¿and confer¿with Plaintiff within 10 days of the date of
this order.¿If the parties are unable to resolve the pleading issues¿or if the
parties are otherwise unable to meet and confer in good faith, Defendants are to¿thereafter¿file
and serve¿a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer in
compliance Code
of Civil Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a)(3) within 15 days
of this order.¿
Defendants are ordered to give notice of this order.
