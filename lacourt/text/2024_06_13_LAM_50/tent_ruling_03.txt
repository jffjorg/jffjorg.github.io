2023 minute order further provides that “[a]s set forth above, the Courts
sustains Runway’s demurrer to, inter alia, the sixth and eighth causes of
action of the Complaint. Thus, the Court denies as moot the motion to strike
Plaintiffs’ request for punitive damages in connection with the sixth and
eighth causes of action.” (December 13, 2023 Minute
Order at p. 13.) 


[2]Pursuant to Civil Code section
3294, subdivision (b), “[a]n employer shall not be
liable for damages pursuant to subdivision (a), based upon acts of an employee
of the employer, unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of
the employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights
or safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which
the damages are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or
malice. With respect to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge and
conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud,
or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the
corporation.”
