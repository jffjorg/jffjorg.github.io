And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Peter Sjostrand's motion for reconsideration of an order granting Defendant Bye Bye House, Inc.'s motion to expunge lis pendens. The judge finds that the motion for reconsideration is procedurally deficient because it does not comply with the requirements of CCP § 1008(a) and is not the correct procedural mechanism to appeal an order granting a motion to expunge a lis pendens. Instead, the plaintiff should have filed a petition for review and writ of mandate within 20 days of the order, as required by CCP § 405.39. The judge notes that the plaintiff failed to state what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown in the motion for reconsideration, as required by CCP § 1008(a).
