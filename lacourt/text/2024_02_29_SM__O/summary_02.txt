  - "When a plaintiff reasonably should have discovered facts for purposes of the accrual of a cause of action or application of the delayed discovery rule is generally a question of fact, properly decided as a matter of law only if the evidence ... can support only one reasonable conclusion."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant Katy Haute's demurrer to Plaintiff J. Augustine's First Amended Complaint is OVERRULED. The judge finds that Augustine sufficiently alleges the details of his discovery of the breach on April 4, 2021, and that he was unable to discover the breach earlier despite reasonable diligence. The judge also finds that the statute of limitations started accruing on April 4, 2021, rather than September 2019, as argued by Haute.

The judge has also tentatively ruled that Haute's Motion to Strike will be addressed at the hearing. The judge notes that Haute argues that Augustine used a pseudonym in his complaint and initial complaint, but that Augustine's counsel argues that there is no ground to demonstrate that "J. Augustine" is a pseudonym or fictitious name. The judge advises counsel to confirm the plaintiff's full name is "J. Augustine" and to identify the statutory authority to have filed the complaint using the initial "J" as a pseudonym for the plaintiff's first name.

The judge emphasizes the importance of transparency in litigation and notes that allowing a party to litigate anonymously impacts the First Amendment public access right. The judge will conduct a hearing to determine whether the identification of the plaintiff's name as "J. Augustine" is the plaintiff's true name or if the initial "J" is a pseudonym for the plaintiff's first name.
