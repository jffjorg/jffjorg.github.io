And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Court will not be posting a proposed statement of decision. The Plaintiff's written closing argument did not discuss any cases regarding whether a failure to properly complete construction work or charging for construction work without a contractor's license can constitute "wrongful acquisition or detention of property", support a claim for unjust enrichment, be a basis for an accounting, or support a declaratory relief cause of action. Additionally, the Court notes that the Defendant has filed a notice of motion and motion for order continuing the hearing date due to their ability to now hire counsel. The motion refers to a reserved date of January 24, 2025, but no proof of service has been filed.
