[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE: 
 
JOINT
  STIPULATION REQUESTING APPROVAL OF REPRESENTATIVE PAGA SETTLEMENT



 
Background
On April 27, 2021, Plaintiff Cy Kishiyama, an individual, on
behalf of himself, all other aggrieved employees, and the general public
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Guckenheimer Enterprises
Inc. (“Guckenheimer Enterprises”) and Guckenheimer Services, LLC (“Guckenheimer
Services”). Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint on October
25, 2021, alleging one cause of action for civil penalties under the Private
Attorneys General Act. 
On September 29, 2023, the Court issued an Order of Dismissal in this
action indicating that the action is dismissed without prejudice as to
Guckenheimer Services. 
Plaintiff and Guckenheimer
Enterprises have reached a
settlement, and jointly request Court approval of the representative PAGA
settlement. 
On June 25, 2024, the
Court issued an Order in this action identifying certain defects with
the joint stipulation requesting approval of representative PAGA settlement. The
Court ordered the parties to file supplemental
papers, including declaration(s), to address the identified issues. The parties
have since filed several supplemental papers. 
In addition, on
September 20, 2024, the Court ordered the parties to file additional
supplemental papers by October 1, 2024 to address the issues identified in the
September 20, 2024 Order. On October 1, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a
fourth supplemental declaration. In addition, a third amended proposed order
was submitted on October 1, 2024.   
Discussion
A
superior court must “review and approve any settlement of any civil action
filed pursuant to this part.” (Lab. Code, § 2699,
subd. (l)(2).) 
The
Court notes that though there is no statutory or common law standard for
approval of a PAGA settlement, the standard used for approval of class action
settlements is instructive. “[A] presumption of fairness exists
where: (1) the settlement is reached through arm’s-length bargaining; (2)
investigation and discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and the court to
act intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced in similar litigation; and (4)
the percentage of objectors is small.” (Dunk v. Ford Motor Co. (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 1794, 1802.) The last factor, small percentage of objectors, is
inapplicable to PAGA claims. (See Arias v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 969, 984-985
[rejecting the argument that representative actions under PAGA violate the due
process rights of “nonparty aggrieved employees who are not given notice of,
and an opportunity to be heard”].) Additional factors that are useful to
consider include the strength of a plaintiff’s case, the risk, expense,
complexity and likely duration of further litigation, the amount offered in
settlement, the extent of discovery completed, and the experience and views of
counsel. (See
Kullar v. Foot Locker Retail, Inc. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 116, 128.)
In the June 25, 2024 Order, the Court noted that “it appears that the ‘PAGA Period’ exceeds the one-year
statute of limitations by nineteen days. The statute of limitations for PAGA
claims is one year. (Code Civ. Proc., § 340, subd.
(a).) The Complaint in this action was filed on April 27, 2021. One year
prior to this date is April 27, 2020. After the filing of the LWDA notice, the
statute of limitations is tolled for a maximum of 65 days. (Lab. Code, § 2699.3, subd. (a)(2)(A).) Therefore,
adding an additional 65 days to the limitations period results in a cut-off
date of February 22, 2020. However, the settlement agreement here defines the ‘PAGA
Period’ as ‘the period from February 3, 2020, to the
earlier of the date the settlement is approved by the court, or March 29, 2024.’” (June 25, 2024 Order at p. 2:19-26.) On July 9, 2024, the
parties filed a “Joint Supplemental Filing in Support of Request for Approval
of Representative PAGA Settlement” indicating, inter alia, that “[t]he Court is
correct regarding the temporal scope of the PAGA period. The Parties have no
objection to having the PAGA Period reflect the starting period as February 22,
2020 instead of February 3, 2020 – the date when Plaintiff submitted his PAGA
notice letter to the Labor Workforce & Development Agency (‘LWDA’).” (July
9, 2024 Joint Suppl. Filing at p. 2:7-10.) In the Court’s September 20, 2024
Order, the Court noted that “the parties do not appear to indicate that they
revised the settlement agreement to address the foregoing issue.” (September
20, 2024 Order at p. 3:8-9.) 
In
his fourth supplemental declaration, Plaintiff’s counsel indicates that the
parties entered into a Third Addendum to Settlement Agreement. (Fourth Suppl. Boyamian
Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. 1.) The Third Addendum to Settlement Agreement indicates, inter
alia, that paragraph 1.19 of the original settlement agreement is revised
to provide, “‘PAGA Period’ means the period from February 22, 2020, to the
earlier of the date the settlement is approved by the court, or March 29, 2024.”
(Fourth Suppl. Boyamian Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. 1.) Thus, it appears that Plaintiff has
corrected the issue discussed above pertaining to the
statute of limitations. 
In the September 20, 2024 Order, the Court also noted that “on
September 3, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a third supplemental declaration indicating,
inter alia, that an ‘additional 53,518 pay periods were unaccounted for
during the PAGA period which must be included into the Parties’ Settlement.
This raised the new total pay period count to 143,243. The Parties calculate
that the inclusion of these additional pay periods results in the new Gross
Settlement Amount to be $392,580 for settlement purposes and distribution.’…The
parties executed a Second Addendum to Settlement Agreement to make changes to
the settlement agreement based on the new Gross Settlement Amount.” (September
20, 2024 Order at pp. 4:26-5:6.) 
In
the September 20, 2024 Order, the Court noted that “the Second Addendum to
Settlement Agreement does not revise paragraph 3.1 of the original settlement
agreement, which provides, inter alia, that ‘[e]xcept as otherwise
provided by Paragraph 9 below, Guckenheimer promises to pay $270,000.00
and no more as the Gross Settlement Amount.’ (Boyamian Decl., ¶ 13, Ex.
2, ¶ 3.1, emphasis added.) In addition, in light of the new ‘Gross
Settlement Amount’ of $392,580.00, it appears that the monetary amounts listed
in paragraphs 3.2.4 and 3.2.4.1 of the settlement agreement (payments to the
LWDA and Aggrieved Employees) will need to be revised…” (September 20,
2024 Order at p. 5:7-14.) The parties’ Third Addendum to Settlement Agreement
indicates that paragraph 3.1 of the original settlement agreement is revised to
reference the amount “$392,580.00” in place of $270,000.00. (Fourth Suppl. Boyamian
Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. 1.) In addition, the Third Addendum to Settlement
Agreement appears to correctly revise the monetary amounts listed in paragraphs 3.2.4 and 3.2.4.1
of the original settlement agreement based on the new gross settlement amount of
$392,580.00. (Ibid.) 
In the September 20, 2024 Order, the Court also noted that “the second
amended proposed order references ‘Defendants’ funding of the Gross
Settlement Amount of $392,580…’ (Second Amended Proposed Order, p. 1:23.) The
second amended proposed order refers to Defendants Guckenheimer Enterprises
Inc. and Guckenheimer Services LLC jointly as ‘Defendants.’ (Second Amended
Proposed Order, p. 1:1-2.) However, the settlement agreement provides that “Guckenheimer
promises to pay $270,000.00 and no more as the Gross Settlement Amount.’ (Boyamian
Decl., ¶ 13, Ex. 2, ¶ 3.1, emphasis added.) Paragraph 1.28 of the settlement
agreement provides that ‘Guckenheimer’ means “named Defendant Guckenheimer
Enterprises, Inc.’ (Boyamian Decl., ¶ 13, Ex. 2, ¶ 1.28.).” (September 20, 2024
Order at p. 5:19-27.) The Court notes that the third amended proposed order
corrects this issue.  
The Court also noted in the September 20, 2024 Order that it appeared the
second amended proposed order cited to Labor Code
section 2699, subdivision (i) in error. (See September 20, 2024
Order at p. 6:1-13.) The Court notes that the third amended proposed order
corrects this issue.  
Lastly, the Court notes that the third amended proposed order slightly
revises the release language contained in the second amended proposed order. (See
Fourth Suppl. Boyamian Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. 2, changing “Defendants” to “Defendant”
at line 1:24 of the third amended proposed order.) It is unclear if this
revised release language is consistent with the language of the original
settlement agreement. If so, then the phrase “each of their” in the same line
should be changed to “its.” Also, at line 28, there is a reference to “Guckenheimer”
but it does not appear to be a defined term.
Conclusion
Based
on the foregoing, the Court grants the joint stipulation requesting approval of
the PAGA settlement. 
On
or before __________, 2024, Plaintiff shall file a revised proposed order to
address the remaining issue identified above, with a courtesy copy delivered to
Department 50. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this Order.¿
