And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between the City of Commerce and Carlos Galvan Jr. The City of Commerce filed a complaint against Galvan Jr. on June 2, 2021, alleging causes of action for public nuisance and injunctive relief, municipal code violations, and declaratory relief. The parties entered into a settlement agreement on March 22, 2023, which provided for Galvan Jr. to cure certain code violations or demolish an illegal structure on his property. The agreement also provided for a 195-day deadline for Galvan Jr. to comply with the agreement.

The City of Commerce is now moving to enforce the settlement agreement, alleging that Galvan Jr. has failed to comply with the agreement and that the 195-day deadline has expired. Galvan Jr. opposes the motion, arguing that the deadline was tolled due to his application for a variance permit and that the City of Commerce has not properly responded to his requests for review of his plans.

The court has continued the hearing on the motion to October 24, 2024, and has ordered the parties to file supplemental briefing on the issues raised in the opposition. The court has also ordered the City of Commerce to provide notice of the ruling.
