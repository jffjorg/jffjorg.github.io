MOTION:                     Demurrer and Motion to Strike
the First Amended Complaint
HEARING DATE:   10/23/2024
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the
construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore
Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations
omitted.) 
 
A special demurrer for uncertainty is
disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that
defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what
issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed
against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)  
 
Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole
or any part thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1322(b).)
The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (CCP §§ 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767,
782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;
probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].) 
 
“Liberality in permitting amendment is
the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in
what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.) 
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
Defendant
the County of Los Angeles requests that the Court take judicial notice of the
following facts or exhibits:
 
1. The City
of West Hollywood was officially incorporated as an independent municipality on
November 29, 1984;
2. Prior to
incorporation as an independent municipality, West Hollywood had been an
unincorporated area of Los Angeles County;
3. The
location of the incident alleged in the First Amended Complaint, 8826 Melrose
Ave., West Hollywood, CA 90069, is within the city limits of West Hollywood;
4. The
location of the incident alleged in the First Amended Complaint, 8826 Melrose
Ave., West Hollywood, CA 90069, is private property. Exhibits 9-10;
5. Exhibit
7, the City of West Hollywood’s webpage about West Hollywood;
6. Exhibit
8, Google Map for 8826 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood;
7. Exhibit
9, Assessors Map for 8822 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood;
8. Exhibit
10, Assessors Map for 8900 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood; and
9. Exhibit
11, Index Map for 8826 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood, and abutting properties.
 
The request
for judicial notice is granted as to nos. 1-4 (Evid. Code § 452(g)) and nos.
7-9 (§452(c)). The request is DENIED as to nos. 5-6, which are not subject to
judicial notice. These exhibits are not official acts. (§452(c).) Critically,
they are not capable of immediate and accurate determination by resorting to
sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy. (§ 452(h).) Therefore, such
exhibits are not subject to judicial notice.
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Defendant the County of Los Angeles
demurs to the third cause of action and moves to strike the request for
punitive damages.  The County argues that
the sole cause of action against it for negligence is based on dangerous conditions
of public property. The County observes that judicially noticeable documents
show the subject location was within the city limits of West Hollywood. The
County contends that it does not own the subject sidewalk. 
Government Code section
835 provides that “a public entity is liable for injury caused by a dangerous
condition of its property if the plaintiff establishes that the property was in
a dangerous condition at the time of the injury, that the injury was proximately
caused by the dangerous condition, that the dangerous condition created a
reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred, and that
either: (a) [a] negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the
public entity within the scope of his employment created the dangerous
condition; or (b) [t]he public entity had actual or constructive notice of the
dangerous condition under Section 835.2 a sufficient time prior to the injury
to have taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition.” (Govt.
Code, § 835.) Section 830 provides that “‘dangerous condition’ means a
condition of property that creates a substantial . . . risk of injury when such
property or adjacent property is used with due care in a manner in which it is
reasonably foreseeable that it will be used.” (Id., § 830(a).) “[A]
claim alleging a dangerous condition may not rely on generalized allegations
[citation] but must specify in what manner the condition constituted a
dangerous condition.” (Brenner v. City of El Cajon (2003) 113
Cal.App.4th 434, 439.)  
The
FAC alleges that Plaintiffs dined together at Craig’s Restaurant located at
8826 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood, CA 90069. (FAC ¶¶ 15-16.) At about 11:30
p.m., Plaintiffs left the restaurant and waited in the valet area. (Id.) Three
male assailants were waiting near the valet area. (¶¶ 16-17.) Two assailants attacked
Plaintiffs, stole a necklace and Rolex watch, and held guns to Plaintiffs.
(Id.) The restaurant security guard was distracted by other patrons and made no
effort to intervene. (¶18.) Around that time, there had been a number of
violent armed robberies in West Hollywood within a few miles of Craig’s
restaurant. (¶ 19.) 
The
FAC alleges that the County owned and/or controlled the property where the
subject incident occurred and/or were responsible for providing law enforcement
for this area. (FAC ¶ 48.) The subject property was in a dangerous condition as
there was a) no adequate lighting, b) no publicly maintained security cameras,
and c) no police or security patrol or presence during the incident. (¶ 49.)
These conditions created a reasonably foreseeable risk of harm of a mugging,
such as the subject incident. (¶50.) 
The FAC and the judicially noticeable
facts do not demonstrate that the County did not, in fact, own operate or
control the subject property. Strictly speaking, the fact that Craig’s
Restaurant was within West Hollywood (a city within the County) does not imply that
the County did not own, operate or control the subject premises. While the Court
concurs that the County would not be apparently liable for maintenance of the public
streets, the FAC does not allege an issue with the public streets. Likewise,
the County had no duty to provide police at that location (Gov. Code § 845; Summerfield
v. City of Inglewood (2023) 96 Cal.App.5th 983, 998), but the FAC alleges
dangerous conditions aside from inadequate police protection. The FAC alleges
that the dangerous conditions included inadequate lighting and security
measures such as security cameras. In light of the pled ultimate facts, whether
or not the County, in fact, owned, operated or controlled the subject premises
must be resolved outside the pleading stage.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer
is OVERRULED. 
 
The unopposed motion to strike punitive damages is GRANTED. Punitive
damages cannot be recovered, as a matter of law, against a public entity. (Gov.
Code §§ 818, 825(a).)
