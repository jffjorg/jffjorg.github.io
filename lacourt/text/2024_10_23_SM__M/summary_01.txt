Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for an order determining that the action is moot, that the plaintiff is the prevailing party, and awarding attorneys' fees and costs. The plaintiff, 1239 23rd Street Homeowners Association, sought to enforce its governing documents against Kurtzer to perform necessary termite eradication at the subject property. The parties litigated and resolved the central termite eradication issue, with the plaintiff obtaining injunctive orders that secured the main relief it sought. The defendant, Kurtzer, argued that the dispute did not concern termite eradication itself but the method of termite eradication, but the judge found that the plaintiff's primary litigation goal was to secure any termite extermination for the defendant's unit, and the defendant's unit underwent termite eradication. Therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to attorneys' fees and costs. The judge awarded the plaintiff fees and costs in the amount of $14,080.13.
