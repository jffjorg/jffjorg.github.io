Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a lawsuit filed by Darrell and others against Presus LLC and others. The lawsuit alleges that the County of Los Angeles is liable for a dangerous condition on private property in West Hollywood that led to a mugging. The County demurred to the third cause of action and moved to strike the request for punitive damages. The judge ruled that the County's demurrer is overruled, and the unopposed motion to strike punitive damages is granted. The judge also denied the County's request for judicial notice of certain exhibits. The judge will allow the case to proceed to the next stage, and the County must file an answer within 20 days.
