And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has denied Erin Hughes' motion for reconsideration of the March 27, 2024 order granting Holly Seeler's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1560. Hughes argued that she should not have been awarded sanctions due to her psychological impairment from post-traumatic stress disorder, which was not considered by the Court at the time of the original decision. However, the Judge found that Hughes could have discovered this information before the original motion was filed, and therefore the burden of proof was not met.
