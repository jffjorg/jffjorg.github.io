Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the cross-defendant's demurrer and motion to strike. The HOA's demurrer to the third cause of action for breach of contract is overruled, as the Court cannot conclude that the roof was Schwarcz's responsibility based on the facts in the cross-complaint. The HOA's demurrer to the fifth cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty is also overruled, as the Court finds that the HOA's judgment does not entail a failure to comply with the CC&Rs.

The HOA's motion to strike Schwarcz's request and prayers for punitive damages is granted without leave to amend, as the Court finds that the conduct does not constitute malice, oppression, or fraud. The HOA's motion to strike Schwarcz's request for attorney fees is denied, as the Court finds that the entitlement to fees per statute may be determined at a later juncture.

The parties are directed to file and serve an answer to the cross-complaint within ten days of entry of this order. The HOA is required to give notice of this tentative ruling.
