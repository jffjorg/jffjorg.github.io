And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or new trial filed by the defendant, Miguel Arteaga. The defendant argues that the contract between him and the plaintiff, The Law Firm of Fox and Fox, is unconscionable and that the jury's verdict is contrary to the evidence. The judge rules that the contract is enforceable, and that the jury's verdict is supported by the evidence. The judge also denies the defendant's motion for a new trial, finding that the irregularities in the trial proceedings did not prejudice the defendant.

The case involves a dispute over unpaid attorney fees and costs. The jury awarded the plaintiff $21,187.67, which includes a 10% late fee. The defendant argues that the late fee is unenforceable, but the judge rules that it is a valid part of the contract. The judge also finds that the contract is not unconscionable, and that the jury's verdict is supported by the evidence.
