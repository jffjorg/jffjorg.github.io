[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING AS MOOT MOTIONS
  TO COMPEL; GRANTING REQUESTS FOR SANCTIONS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
September 5, 2024



 
On
November 17, 2023, Plaintiff Luis Abundes and Defendant Antonio Perez stipulated
that Plaintiff would cooperate with Defendant in obtaining records pursuant to a
deposition subpoena for production of business records in the possession of SSA,
SSI, or General Relief Fund.  The Court signed
the order on November 20, 2023.
On
August 7, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to enforce the November 20, 2023 order
and to compel Plaintiff’s compliance.
On
August 9, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Form
Interrogatories (Set 2).
MOTION
TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE
Defendant’s
request for judicial notice is denied as irrelevant.
On
December 11, 2023, Defendant’s counsel sent Plaintiff’s counsel an email inquiring
if she had received any documents from the Social Security Administration or the
General Relief Fund.  (Vaqar Decl. ¶ 9.)  The same day, Plaintiff’s counsel responded that
she had not received any documents yet.  (Vaqar
Decl. ¶ 9.)
On
March 11, 2024 and May 31, 2024, Defendant’s counsel again emailed Plaintiff’s counsel
about not receiving any documents.  (Vaqar
Decl. ¶¶ 10-11.)  Plaintiff did not produce
any documents relating to any Social Security Administration and the General Relief
Fund including executing any documents required for release of the documents.  (Vaqar Decl. ¶ 12.)
On
August 22, 2024, Plaintiff provided the signed form and supplemental responses.  (Tehrani Decl., Ex. C.)
The
motion to compel compliance is DENIED AS MOOT. 
The request for sanctions is GRANTED, as set forth below.
MOTION
TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES
Plaintiff
argues that Defendant failed to meet and confer before filing the motion.  (Opposition at p. 2.)  However, that is not required for a motion to
compel initial, not further, responses.  (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.)
On
December 14, 2023, Defendant served the subject Form Interrogatories (Set 2) on
Plaintiff.  (Vaqar Decl. ¶ 3.)  Plaintiff did not serve responses.  (Vaqar Decl. ¶ 5.)
On
August 22, 2024, Plaintiff provided responses. 
(Tehrani Decl., Ex. A.)
Defendant
argues that the responses are incomplete, evasive, and false.  (Reply at pp. 3-4.)  Those further arguments may be raised in a timely
motion to compel further responses that complies with all procedural requirements.  However, the original motion filed on August 9,
2024 is now moot.
The
motion to compel responses is DENIED AS MOOT. 
The request for sanctions is GRANTED, as set forth below.
SANCTIONS
The
Court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery even where the requested discovery was provided to
the moving party after the motion was filed. 
(California Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)
Despite
Defendant’s multiple attempts to contact Plaintiff about the responses, it was not
until August 21, 2024 that “Plaintiff’s Counsel was able to again get in touch with
Plaintiff.”  (See Tehrani Decls.)  Plaintiff finally provided responses on August
22, 2024—the day that he filed his oppositions. 
Plaintiff’s counsel’s dilatory behavior and service of responses only in
response to Defendant’s motions warrants sanctions.
For
the motion to compel compliance with the stipulation and order, Defendant requests
sanctions of $1,900.00, a reduced amount from the total of attorney fees of $245.00
per hour for 6.5 hours, additional paralegal fees of $140.00 per hour for 3.5 hours,
and a $60.00 filing fee (total of $2,142.50).
For
the motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Defendant requests sanctions
of $1,113.50, consisting of attorney fees of $245.00 per hour for 4.3 hours and
a $60.00 filing fee.
The
Court awards Defendant $1,900.00 and $1,113.50, for a total sanction of $3,013.50.  Plaintiff’s counsel is ordered to pay a total
sanction of $3,013.50 to Defendant within 30 days.  This sanction is imposed only on Plaintiff’s counsel
and not on Plaintiff individually.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
