And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, El Segundo Unified School District, has moved for a stay of proceedings in this case pending a decision by the California Court of Appeals in two other cases. The defendant argues that the decisions in those cases may render the instant action unactionable. However, the court finds that the defendant has not made a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, has not shown irreparable injury absent a stay, and that a stay may substantially injure the plaintiff. The court also notes that the stay requested is indefinite and undefined, and that the public interest lies in providing the prompt and timely completion of civil proceedings. Therefore, the court denies the defendant's motion for stay of proceedings.
