STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a lemon law action filed on June 1, 2022. Plaintiffs purchased a
2019 Honda Pilot which they allege developed defects in the infotainment,
electrical, transmission, and engine systems. 
 
Defendant moves to transfer venue
to Yuba County. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant moves to transfer venue
to Yuba County. 
 
The Court observes that Plaintiffs
filed and served their opposition to this motion on September 9, 2024. Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 1005(b), Plaintiffs’ opposition was due on Wednesday,
September 4. Plaintiffs’ counsel accepts responsibility for the late filing,
stating that he failed to calendar the deadline for the opposition and therefore
failed to secure coverage for this matter before taking time away from the
office. (Declaration of Daniel Law ISO Opp. ¶¶ 3-7.) Although Defendant has
submitted a reply brief, Defendant objects to the untimely opposition.
Moreover, it is apparent from the brevity of the reply papers that Defendant’s
response to the opposition was affected by the late filing. While the Court
would be within its discretion to refuse to consider the late opposition, the
interests of justice are better served by permitting thorough briefing by the
parties on a motion of this nature. To that end, the Court will permit a short
continuance to allow Defendant to prepare, file, and serve a supplemental reply
brief to more fully address the points raised in Plaintiffs’ opposition.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to
Transfer Venue is CONTINUED to Tuesday, October 1, 2024 at 9:00 AM. 
 
Defendant is granted leave to file
and serve a Supplemental Reply to the Motion, not to exceed ten substantive
pages, which shall be due on Monday, September 23, 2024. No further briefing will
be permitted. 
 
            Moving Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
