And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees. The plaintiff had argued that the court's granting of summary judgment in his favor was a significant benefit to the public and therefore entitled him to an award of attorney's fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had not demonstrated that he had conferred a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons. The judge noted that the plaintiff's relief was limited to damages for himself only and did not align with the benefits exemplified in the cases cited by the plaintiff. Therefore, the court concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to an award of attorney's fees.
