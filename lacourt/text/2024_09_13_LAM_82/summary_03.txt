And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between SkyHop Global LLC (Petitioner) and the City of Los Angeles (Respondent). The case concerns the application of the Living Wage Ordinance (LWO) to SkyHop, a ground transportation business that provides services to airlines at LAX. The City has determined that SkyHop is subject to the LWO and has issued a violation letter to SkyHop, but SkyHop disputes this determination and argues that the City's enforcement of the LWO is improper.

The Judge has overruled the City's demurrer (a challenge to the sufficiency of the petition) on two of the three causes of action brought by SkyHop: the petition for writ of mandate and the petition for declaratory relief. The Judge has stayed the first cause of action pending resolution of the third cause of action, which is the petition for writ of mandate.

The Judge has sustained the City's demurrer on the second cause of action, which is the petition for injunctive relief, without leave to amend. This means that SkyHop will not be able to seek an injunction based on this cause of action.

The Judge has set a trial date for the case and has ordered the parties to follow certain procedures for filing briefs and serving notices.
