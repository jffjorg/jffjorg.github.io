ARNO PATRICK KUIGOUA ,
  
        
  vs.
 
THE MATTHEW L. TUCK & ASSOCIATES, et
  al. 
  


 Case
  No.:  24STCV12187 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 14, 2025




 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
 
On 5/13/2024,
in propria persona Plaintiff Arno Patrick Kuigoua (Plaintiff) filed suit
against the Matthew L. Tuck &Associates, PLC dba Appellate Law Firm, Aaron
Myers, and Matthew L. Tuck.
 
            On
12/13/2024, the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer, without leave to amend. 
 
            On
12/19/2024, Plaintiff moved for reconsideration. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a), a motion for
reconsideration must be brought “within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order.”  (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 206, 212.) 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
moves for reconsideration of the Court’s 12/13/2024 ruling sustaining
Defendant’s demurrer, without leave to amend. Plaintiff contends that “[t]he
Court’s decision overlooked critical evidence, legal arguments, and material
misrepresentations by Defendants that undermine the enforceability of the
handwritten notes and the purported MOU.” (Motion, 2: 13-14.) 
 
However, a
motion for reconsideration cannot simply ask the Court to “reevaluate” or
“reanalyze” pre-existing factual and/or legal issues and/or arguments
previously made. (See Crotty v. Trader (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 765, 771.)
The Court considered all submitted moving papers when reaching its ruling.
Accordingly, the Court may not properly reevaluate its substantive decision,
unless there are some new facts or law which would warrant such
reconsideration. Plaintiff has not identified any applicable new facts or law. 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is denied. 
 
It is so ordered.
