Here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is about a motion filed by the plaintiff, Susan Spell, seeking to establish numerous issues and have the defendant's default entered. The defendant, Elliott Weathersby, has failed to respond to discovery requests and has not timely served the amended answer. The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to strike portions of the defendant's answer and has ordered the parties to mediation. The court finds that the defendant's failure to respond to discovery requests is not a significant issue and denies the plaintiff's motion for issue sanctions. However, the court grants the plaintiff's motion for monetary sanctions in the amount of $350, which is the reasonable attorney fees for the motion. The court emphasizes that it expects the parties to comply with the discovery statutes and orders the defendant to pay the sanctions within 45 days of the date of service of notice of the order.
