Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Plaintiff Morris Matloubian's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The judge allows Plaintiff to add a new cause of action for violations of Penal Code, section 496 and to make other changes to the complaint. The judge finds that Plaintiff's delay in filing the section 496 claim was not inexcusable and that the law was not entirely clear on the applicability of section 496 to shareholder distribution claims. The judge grants leave to amend as to Plaintiff's remaining changes, including conforming the complaint to the Court of Appeal's ruling and fixing typographical errors.
