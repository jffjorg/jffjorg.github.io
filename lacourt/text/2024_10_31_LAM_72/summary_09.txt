And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to stay the proceedings in the state court case pending the outcome of the federal action. The two cases involve the same subject matter and have nearly identical claims. The judge finds that the factors in favor of a stay outweigh those against it, and that it is in the interest of justice to stay the proceedings. The judge notes that the cases do not involve the same parties, but that the real party in interest in PAGA claims is the state, not the plaintiff. The judge also notes that the PAGA claim does not replace any other claims an employee may have against their employer, but that it does not provide a rule against judicial stays.
