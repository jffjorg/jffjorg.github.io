And here is a summary of the document in English:

The tentative ruling is about a lawsuit between Maria Elena Grado and Antelope Valley Country Club Improvement Company. Grado seeks terminating, issue, and evidentiary sanctions against Antelope, as well as $17,760.00 in monetary sanctions. The Court denies Grado's motion for terminating sanctions, but grants her motion for evidentiary sanctions in part. The Court also orders Antelope to provide code-compliant supplemental responses within 30 days. Additionally, the Court grants Grado's motion for monetary sanctions in the amount of $17,760.00. The dispute began when Antelope served a notice of non-renewal of agreement on Grado and her company, and Grado alleges that Antelope's responses to discovery requests were deficient and incomplete. The Court finds that Antelope failed to comply with discovery orders and that its counsel, Jeffrey Zinder, experienced health issues and stress that may have contributed to the delay.
