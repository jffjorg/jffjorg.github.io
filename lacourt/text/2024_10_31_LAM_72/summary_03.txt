And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the Rigas Defendants' motion for an award of attorney's fees in the amount of $722,309.50. The litigation has been ongoing for over three years and has involved significant discovery, motions, and expert testimony. The judge finds that the Rigas Defendants are entitled to an award of attorney's fees against the Plaintiffs, including UW and CEH, based on the December Agreements, which contain attorney fee provisions. The judge also finds that the billing records submitted by the Rigas Defendants are reasonable and that the time spent by defense counsel on the motion for summary judgment and preparation for the deposition of Hooper was warranted. The judge reduces the requested fee award by $7,984.00 due to a clerical error.
