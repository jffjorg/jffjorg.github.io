And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants Plaintiff Morris Matloubian's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The Plaintiff seeks to add a new cause of action for violations of Penal Code section 496 and make several other changes to the complaint. The Judge finds that the delay in filing the section 496 claim was not inexcusable, but the Court grants leave to amend to assert the claim.

The Judge also grants leave to amend for the remaining changes requested by Plaintiff, including conforming the complaint to the Court of Appeal's ruling and fixing typographical errors. The Court finds that none of the proposed amendments would prejudice the Defendants.

The Judge's ruling is based on the legal standard that a complainant may obtain leave to amend their pleading beyond the number of amendments allowed under Code of Civil Procedure section 472 by filing a noticed motion. The Court also relies on the policy that leave to amend should be granted liberally.
