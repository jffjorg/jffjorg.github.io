And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied an ex parte application filed by the plaintiff's counsel on July 30, 2024, seeking to shorten the time for hearings on their motions to compel depositions and to prescribe shorter times for filing and serving papers. The judge found that the plaintiff's counsel did not provide sufficient evidence to support their request, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1202, subdivision (c). The judge also denied the request to grant relief ex parte, citing a lack of good cause. Instead, the judge ordered the parties' counsel to meet and confer by August 2, 2024, to informally resolve the issues presented by the motions to compel depositions.
