  Order RE:
 
petition for approval of compromise of claim
  for minor claimant nathan jonathan oliveros
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Petitioner Jeanette Oliveros   
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim for Minor Claimant Nathan
Jonathan Oliveros
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this petition.  No opposition papers were filed.  
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff and petitioner Jeanette Oliveros (“Petitioner”) seeks court
approval of the settlement made on behalf of minor claimant Nathan Jonathan
Oliveros (“Minor Claimant”) in this action. 
The compromise of a minor’s disputed claim for damages is valid only
after it has been approved, upon the filing of a petition, by the court.¿
(Prob. Code, § 3500.)¿ The petition must be verified by the petitioner, must
contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the
reasonableness of the compromise, and must be prepared on Judicial Council form
MC-350.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)¿
Defendants Joseph Heffesse, trustee of the Coldwater Canyon Trust,
Sandra B. Sternberg Heffesse, and LA Properties Heffesse LLC have agreed to pay
a total of $175,000 to settle this action, of which $5,000 will be separately
allocated to Minor Claimant.  (MC-350, ¶¶
10-11.)  Of the $5,000 allocated to Minor
Claimant, $1,250 will be paid to counsel for attorney’s fees and $134.35 will
be paid to counsel for costs.  (MC-350,
¶¶ 13, 16.)  The remaining $3,615.65 will
be paid or delivered to Petitioner, as the parent of Minor Claimant, without
bond, on the terms and under the conditions specified in Probate Code sections
3401-3402.  (MC-350, ¶ 18, subd. (b)(5);
MC-350, Attachment 18b(5), Oliveros Decl., ¶¶ 1, 4, 6; Prob. Code, §§ 3401,
3402.) 
The court has reviewed the petition and finds the settlement to be
fair and reasonable, and in the best interest of Minor Claimant.  The court further finds that the declaration
of Rachel Fishenfeld is sufficient to support the request for attorney’s fees
in the amount of $1,250 (representing 25 percent of the $5,000 settlement).  (MC-350, Attachment 13(a), Fishenfeld Decl.,
¶¶ 2-3, 6-11; Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 7.955.) 
The court therefore grants Petitioner’s petition.
ORDER
            The court grants petitioner Jeanette
Oliveros’s petition for approval of compromise of claim on behalf of minor
claimant Nathan Jonathan Oliveros.
            The court orders that the $3,615.65
settlement on behalf of minor claimant Nathan Jonathan Oliveros may be paid to
plaintiff and petitioner Jeanette Oliveros pursuant to Probate Code sections
3401 and 3402. 
            The court orders petitioner Jeanette
Oliveros to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  July 31, 2024
