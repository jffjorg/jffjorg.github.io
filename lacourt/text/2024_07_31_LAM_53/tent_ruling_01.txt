  Case Number:  20STCV05807    Hearing Date:   July 31, 2024    Dept:  53 Jung v. Turn Around
Communications, Inc.  20STCV05807  
Ex
Parte Application   7/31/24
The
court notes that, as stated in plaintiffs’ ex parte application, “[o]n February
21, 2024, Plaintiff’s Counsel came to this court on an ex parte basis seeking
the same relief requested herein; the ex parte was denied, and the Court
ordered the parties to meet and confer.” 
(Plaintiffs’ ex parte application, memorandum of points and authorities,
filed 7/30/24, p. 1:19-22.)  
The
court rules on plaintiffs’ ex parte application, filed July 30, 2024, and
presented to the court on July 31, 2024, as follows.
The
court finds that plaintiffs have not satisfied the requirement of California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1202, subdivision (c), that an applicant for an ex parte
order must make an affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing
competent testimony based on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate
danger, or other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte.  
The
court does not find good cause to grant plaintiffs’ request for an order
shortening time on the hearings on their motions to compel depositions, filed
February 20, 2024, or to prescribe shorter times for the filing and service of
papers than the times specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 1005,
subdivision (b).  (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1300, subd. (b).)
The
court therefore denies the ex parte application without prejudice to
plaintiffs’ seeking other appropriate relief, including but not limited to,
filing an ex parte application to continue the trial and to advance the
hearings on plaintiffs’ motions to compel depositions.  
The
court orders the parties’ counsel to meet and confer no later than August 2,
2024, to make a reasonable and good faith effort to informally resolve the
issues presented by plaintiffs’ motions to compel depositions.
The court
orders plaintiffs to give notice of this order.
