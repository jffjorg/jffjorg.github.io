English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling grants the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint. The plaintiffs seek to delete references to causes of action and supporting allegations that were sustained by the court in its June 29, 2023 order, as well as to separate the cause of action for negligence into two separate causes of action. The court finds that allowing the amendment is in furtherance of justice and will not cause prejudice to the defendant. The court orders the plaintiffs to file the Fourth Amended Complaint by August 2, 2024, and to give notice of this ruling.
