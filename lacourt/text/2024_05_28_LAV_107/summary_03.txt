  - "In determining whether an arbitration agreement applies to a specific dispute, the court may examine only the agreement itself and the complaint filed by the party refusing arbitration."
  - "The right to arbitration depends upon contract; a petition to compel arbitration is simply a suit in equity seeking specific performance of that contract."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the motion to compel arbitration as to the third cause of action for breach of contract, denies the motion as to the remaining five causes of action, and stays all proceedings on the remaining causes of action pending the outcome of arbitration.
