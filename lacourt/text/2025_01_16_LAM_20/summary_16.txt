And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling to dismiss the lawsuit filed by Shirrell Coleman against CitiBank, N.A. Coleman was previously declared a vexatious litigant and was subject to a prefiling order, which requires her to obtain approval from the presiding judge before filing a lawsuit. Coleman failed to comply with this order and did not file an opposition to the notice issued by CitiBank stating that she had not obtained the necessary approval. As a result, the lawsuit must be dismissed.
