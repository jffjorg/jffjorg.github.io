```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment/Adjudication, finding that there are triable issues of fact on all causes of action. The Plaintiff, Jazmin Luciano, claims that she was subjected to discrimination, retaliation, and failure to provide accommodations when she returned to work as a dental receptionist following maternity leave. The Defendant, Planet Dental, Mehran Javaherian Dental Corporation, and Jeanette Rodriguez, contend that the Plaintiff prematurely ended negotiations and resigned due to personal reasons.

The Judge noted that the evidence presented is mostly oral testimony and that there are factual and credibility issues that are reserved for a jury. The Defendant alleged that the Plaintiff provided inconsistent testimony, but the Judge found that the Plaintiff's deposition testimony is not clear on this point.

The Judge applied the burden-shifting test to analyze the Plaintiff's claims of discrimination, retaliation, and failure to provide accommodations, finding that the Plaintiff has established a prima facie case and that the burden shifts to the Defendant to demonstrate that its actions were based on legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors.

The Judge also noted that the Defendant's comment about taking medication to cease breast milk production, made by supervisor Rodiguez, raises an issue of fact regarding potential discrimination.

Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling is that the Motion for Summary Judgment/Adjudication is denied, and the case will proceed to trial.
