 On February 27, 2019, the court declared Shirrell Coleman to be a vexatious litigant subject to a prefiling order. On September 30, 2024, Shirrell Coleman filed the operative Complaint against Defendant CitiBank, N.A., contending that her bank accounts have been compromised.   On October 24, 2024, CitiBank filed a notice that Coleman did not comply with her prefiling order and that the Court should dismiss this action in 10 days if Coleman does not obtain approval for this suit from the presiding judge. CCP § 391.7(c) states, “The clerk may not file any litigation presented by a vexatious litigant subject to a prefiling order unless the vexatious litigant first obtains an order from the presiding justice or presiding judge permitting the filing. If the clerk mistakenly files the litigation without the order, any party may file with the clerk and serve, or the presiding justice or presiding judge may direct the clerk to file and serve, on the plaintiff and other parties a notice stating that the plaintiff is a vexatious litigant subject to a prefiling order as set forth in subdivision (a). The filing of the notice shall automatically stay the litigation. The litigation shall be automatically dismissed unless the plaintiff within 10 days of the filing of that notice obtains an order from the presiding justice or presiding judge permitting the filing of the litigation as set forth in subdivision (b). If the presiding justice or presiding judge issues an order permitting the filing, the stay of the litigation shall remain in effect, and the defendants need not plead, until 10 days after the defendants are served with a copy of the order.” Coleman did not file an opposition. Coleman is a vexatious litigant and did not apparently obtain approval to file this suit within 10 days of CitiBank’s notice.  Therefore, this action must be dismissed.  The Motion is granted.  The RJN is granted.Moving party to give notice.
