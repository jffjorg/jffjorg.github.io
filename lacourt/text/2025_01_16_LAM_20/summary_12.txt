And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted defendants' motion to file an amended answer to the plaintiff's complaint. The defendants had filed an answer with 30 affirmative defenses, but now seek to verify their answer by filing an amended answer. The judge has discretion to allow the amendment, and California courts generally favor allowing amendments to pleadings. The judge has found that there is no apparent prejudice to the plaintiff if the amended answer is filed, and therefore grants the motion. The amended answer must be filed within 10 days, and the moving party must give notice.
