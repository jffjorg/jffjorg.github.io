And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to compel further responses by the plaintiffs, Jesus Dimas Zuniga and Lilliana Tovar Zuniga, against General Motors LLC. The plaintiffs filed a lemon law claim for a 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and served the defendant with discovery requests on September 29, 2023. The defendant served deficient responses on October 27, 2023, and verified its responses on November 28, 2023. The court finds that the plaintiffs' separate statement is deficient and fails to provide the factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses. Therefore, the motion is denied, along with the request for sanction.
