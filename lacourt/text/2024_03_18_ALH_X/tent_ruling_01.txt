BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiffs Jesus Dimas
Zuniga and Liliana Tovar Zuniga (“Plaintiffs”) lemon law claim for a 2020
Chevrolet Silverado 1500, Vehicle Identification Number 1GCPWBEKXLZ360542
(“Subject Vehicle”). Plaintiffs filed their complaint on March 22, 2023,
alleging one cause of action for violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of
Express Warranty.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Plaintiffs’
motion to compel further responses is DENIED.
 
            Plaintiffs’
request for sanction is denied.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
A
party making a discovery request may move for an order compelling a response if
the party to whom the requests were made fails to serve a timely response,
including for special interrogatories (Code Civ. Proc. section 2030.290, subd.
(b)) and requests for production (Code Civ. Proc. section 2031.300, subd (b)).
A party must serve a response within 30 days after service of a discovery
request. (Code Civ. Proc. sections 2030.260, subd, (a) and 2031.260, subd.(a).)
On
receipt of a response to discovery requests, the party requesting may move for
an order compelling further responses for interrogatories (Code Civ. Proc.
2030.300), requests for admission (Cod. Civ. Proc. section 2033.290), and
request for production (Code Civ. Proc. section 2031.310).
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiffs
moves for an order compelling Defendant to provide further responses to their
requests for the production of documents. Plaintiffs provide they served
Defendant with their first set of requests for the production of documents on
September 29, 2023. (Thomas Decl. ¶
 5.) Plaintiffs provide that Defendant served
deficient responses on October 27, 2023, which included unverified responses. (Id.
¶ 6.)
Plaintiffs provide that Defendant provided verification of its responses on
November 28, 2023. (Id. ¶ 7.)
 
As a
preliminary note, the court address Plaintiffs’ separate statement. California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 requires a separate statement to include “[a]
statement of the factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses,
answers, or production as to each matter in dispute”. While Plaintiffs facially
complies with this requirement by including a “reason why further responses
should be compelled” next to the discovery requests, Plaintiffs merely includes
a block of stock language claiming that Defendant’s objections are meritless
and boilerplate. Much like Defendant’s boilerplate objections are unhelpful to Plaintiffs,
Plaintiffs boilerplate statements of insufficiency are not helpful to this
court to determine whether further responses should be ordered as to the
specific discovery requests. 
 
Plaintiffs’
motion to compel further responses is based on a deficient separate statement.
Therefore, Plaintiffs’ motion to compel further responses is denied. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiffs’
motion to compel further responses is DENIED.
 
            Plaintiffs’
request for sanction is denied.
