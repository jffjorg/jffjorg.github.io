ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff
Pafundi Law Firm (“Cross-Defendant”) filed the instant action for breach of
contract, fraud, promissory estoppel, and conversion against Defendants Vera
Roca, LLC (“Cross-Complainant Vera Roca”) and Pablo Vera (“Cross-Complainant
Vera”) (collectively, “Cross-Complainants”) on August 23, 2022.
Cross-Complainants filed a Cross-Complaint for breach of contract and fraud
against Cross-Defendant on January 20, 2023. On February 3, 2023,
Cross-Complainants filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint.

action in the First Amended Cross-Complaint with leave to amend. (Minute Order,
07/13/23.) Cross-Complainants filed the Corrected Second Amended
Cross-Complaint on August 22, 2023. On October 19, 2023, the Court sustained
Cross-Defendant’s demurrer to the fraud cause of action in the Second Amended
Cross-Complaint without leave to amend, leaving only the cause of action for
breach of contract. (Minute Order, 10/19/23.) Cross-Defendant filed an answer

Discussion
 
Allegations in the Complaint and Corrected Second Amended Cross-Complaint
 
Cross-Defendant alleges this action arises out of an oral agreement
between the parties for Cross-Complainants to completely rebuild
Cross-Defendant’s website and launch the rebuilt website after
Cross-Defendant’s approval, in exchange for $5,000.00, reached on March 2,
2022. (Compl., ¶5.) On March 23, 2022 and March 29, 2022, the parties reached a
further agreement that Cross-Complainants would create a landing page website
while the full website was being rebuilt, in exchange for $1,250.00. (Id.
at ¶6.) 
 
Cross-Complainants allege that on
or about July 5, 2022, the website was about 85 percent completed but
Cross-Defendant materially breached the agreement by refusing to provide the promised
content necessary to complete and launch the website. (SACC, ¶9.)
Cross-Defendant also allegedly failed to pay the $1,250.00 owed for completing
the landing page website. (Ibid.) Cross-Defendant is allegedly estopped
from claiming Cross-Complainants’ failure to complete the website as a defense.
(Ibid.) 
 
On or about March 29, 2022,
Cross-Complainant Vera and Robert Pafundi met in person and Robert Pafundi
promised to pay $1,250.00 for the completed landing page, which he had approved
by text message earlier that day. (Id. at ¶10.) Robert Pafundi’s
representations on March 29, 2022 were intentional and false and he had no
intention of paying for the landing page. (Id. at ¶¶12-13.) In reliance
on the representations, Cross-Complainants entered into the agreement and
expended time, resources, and funding to complete their obligations. (Id.
at ¶14.) Robert Pafundi also knowingly and intentionally interfered with
Cross-Complainants’ ability to complete its obligations under the agreement. (Id.
at ¶15.) As a result of the misrepresentations, Cross-Complainants suffered
damages. (Id. at ¶16.)

Court take judicial notice of (1) Pafundi Law Firm, A Professional Corporation,

Cross-Defendant’s Initial
Burden of Proof
 
As an initial matter, the Court
points out that the Motion is one for summary judgment, although entitled
“Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the alternative, Summary Adjudication.”
This is demonstrated by the notice of Motion itself, which moves “this Court
for an order granting summary judgment in their favor and against
Cross-Complainants . . . .” (Notice, pp. 1:28-2:2.) 
 
An action for breach of contract
must demonstrate the following elements: (1) the existence of the contract, (2)
the plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s
breach; and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff. (D’Arrigo Bros. of
California v. United Farmworkers of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 790,
800.) 
 
Cross-Defendant’s Motion is
brought based on three issues: (1) the breach of contract cause of action fails
because Cross-Defendant never entered into a second contract for the creation
of a landing page; (2) the breach of contract cause of action fails because
Cross-Complainants did not perform their contractual obligations; and (3) the
breach of contract cause of action fails because Cross-Defendant fulfilled all
or substantially all its contractual obligations. (Notice of Motion, p.
1:6-15.) Despite dividing the Motion into these three issues, the moving
separate statement does not correspondingly indicate which facts pertain to
which issues. The Court, therefore, must make its own assessment of what facts
are relevant to what issues. 
 
            Issues
1 and 2: the existence of a second agreement and Cross-Complainants’
performance
 
In late February and early March
2022, the parties entered an enforceable contractual agreement whereby
Cross-Complainants agreed to perform professional services related to
designing, completely rebuilding, and, after approval thereof, launching an
entirely new website for Cross-Defendant (“the Website”). (Motion, Separate
Statement, Fact No. 5; Pafundi Decl., ¶4 and Exh. 10.) Under the agreement,
Cross-Complainants “agreed to design, rebuild, launch, and do all things
necessary and related to the [Website], in exchange for a total payment of
$5,000.00. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 6; Pafundi Decl., ¶5 and Exhs.
5, 12.) Cross-Complainants were to design and create the Website within 30
days, or before the end of March 2022. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No.
10; Pafundi Decl., ¶7.) 
 
Invoice # INV-836 states it
covers 100% of all services to be performed for Cross-Defendant and was the
only invoice ever submitted to Cross-Defendant. (Motion, Separate Statement,
Fact Nos. 24-25; Pafundi Decl., ¶13 and Exh. 5.) In mid-March 2022
Cross-Defendant became concerned that the old website had been pulled down
without a “coming soon” page up, which Cross-Complainant Vera stated was in the
works on March 8, 2022. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 41-42; Pafundi
Decl., ¶27 and Exhs. 15-16.) During a March 17, 2022 meeting between Pafundi
and Cross-Complainant Vera, the latter again stated it was no problem to get
the “coming soon” page done. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 43; Pafundi
Decl., ¶28 and Exh. 9.) Cross-Complainant Vera never mentioned an additional
charge for the “coming soon” language on the already existing landing page and
the “coming soon” page was posted for the public on March 22, 2022. (Motion,
Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 44-45; Pafundi Decl., ¶¶28-29 and Exh. 9.)
 
In late March 2022, Pafundi
became increasingly concerned that Cross-Complainants would not fulfill their
obligation to complete the website within 30 days. (Motion, Separate Statement,
Fact No. 49; Pafundi Decl., ¶32.) On April 13, 2022, Grace Wong informed
Pafundi that Cross-Complainant Vera informed her that he would have a draft
ready for review the week of April 18, 2022 and the Website done by the end of
April 2022. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 51; Wong Decl., ¶8.) On March
29, 2022, Pafundi delivered another check for $1,250.00 to Cross-Complainants
under Invoice # INV-836 despite the lack of any tangible evidence that the
design or creation of the website, or any part thereof, was truly underway or
being accomplished. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 55, 50; Pafundi
Decl., ¶¶38, 40 and Exh. 9.) At no time did Cross-Complainants suggest a second
contract was formed to post a simple landing page, i.e., “coming soon” page.
(Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 58; Pafundi Decl., ¶40.)
 
The parties arranged an in-person
meeting to review all aspects of what was represented as the “virtually
completed” new website for May 21, 2022 for which Cross-Complainants did not
appear. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 60-61; Pafundi Decl., ¶¶46-47
and Exhs. 9, 37.) Cross-Complainants then did not communicate for several
weeks. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 62; Pafundi Decl., ¶48 and Exh.
X.) On July 5, 2022, Cross-Defendant sent Cross-Complainants a demand letter
with an opportunity to cure the breach of contract before a lawsuit would be
filed. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 63-67; Pafundi Decl., Exhs. 24
and 27.) In response, Cross-Complainants accepted the first option to cure the
breach by completing the website to Pafundi’s satisfaction by close of business
on July 22, 2022. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 69-70; Pafundi Decl.,
Exhs. 24 and 27.) Cross-Complainants did not perform by July 22, 2022, nor did
they perform by the later dates promised by Cross-Complainant Vera. (Motion,
Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 71-78; Pafundi Decl., ¶¶56-60 and Exh. 24.) On
August 3, 2022, Pafundi sent Cross-Complainants a Notice of Termination of
Contract. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 79; Exh. 25.) Cross-Defendant
filed this action two-and-a-half weeks later. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact
No. 82 and Exh. 3.) 
 
This evidence carries
Cross-Defendant’s initial burden of proof as to Issues 1 and 2. Specifically,
it shows that the parties only negotiated one contract with respect to the
Website and there was no separate agreement regarding the “coming soon” or landing
page website for which an additional charge was agreed. It also shows that
Cross-Complainants breached the agreement by failing to rebuild and redesign
the Website as agreed.
 
            Issue
3: Cross-Defendant’s performance
 
The parties’ agreement created
rights of the Cross-Defendant and obligations, duties, and responsibilities by
and of Cross-Complainants. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 9; Pafundi
Decl., ¶6.) Cross-Defendant provided Cross-Complainants with all the
information they requested so the Website could be designed, developed, and
launched within 30 days. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 29; Pafundi
Decl., ¶16 and Exh. 8-20.) This included Pafundi’s GoDaddy Admin Details and
credentials, verbal answers to Cross-Complainant Vera’s questions, outlining
what the Website needed to contain, the physical content requested to build the
Website, the Google Drive folder labeled “Pafundi Law Website 2022,” and a
Dropbox folder where Cross-Defendant stored images. (Motion, Separate
Statement, Fact Nos. 30-32; Pafundi Decl., ¶¶17-18 and Exhs. 6, 12-14 and 19.)
This information and content was (1) Cross-Defendant’s professional logos; (2)
recently acquired professional photographs of Robert Pafundi; (3) photographs
taken over time while on TV and film sets or at entertainment industry events
with clients; and (4) old website content which included copy for all of the
key subjects and topics that would be needed on the new website. (Motion,
Separate Statement, Fact No. 33; Pafundi Decl., ¶19.) Pafundi also connected
Cross-Complainant Vera with Laura Anglada Gómez (Marketing/Logo Designer),
Grace Wong (Internet Marketer/Video Production), and Mary Simmons (Social Media
Manager) for the specific purpose of coordinating the website design and
buildout effort. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 34; Pafundi Decl., 20.) 
 
This evidence carries Cross-Defendant’s
initial burden of proof with respect to Issue 3 by demonstrating that it
provided Cross-Complainants with the promised content. 
 
Cross-Complainants’ Burden to
Demonstrate the Existence of a Triable Issue of Material Fact
 
The burden now shifts to
Cross-Complainants to demonstrate the existence of triable issues of material
fact regarding Issues 1, 2, and 3. 
 
            Issue
1: the existence of a second agreement
 
In opposition, Cross-Complainants
dispute that the parties’ agreement required them to “do all things necessary
and related to the [Website].” (Opp., Separate Statement, Fact No. 6; Vera
Decl., ¶¶2-3.) They contend that the parties separately agreed
Cross-Complainants would rebuild and redesign the Website in exchange for
$5,000.00 and would build a coming soon/landing page for $1,250.00. (Opp.,
Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 23-24, 45; Vera Decl., ¶¶2, 9.) This is also
demonstrated by the invoice: INV-836 was issued in the amount of $5,000.00
solely with respect to the Website with no mention of the coming soon/landing
page. (Opp., Separate Statement, Fact No. 24; Vera Decl., ¶2.) This
demonstrates the existence of a triable issue of material fact regarding a
separate agreement for the coming soon/landing page. 
 
            Issues
2 and 3: Cross-Complainants’ performance or excuse for non-performance; Cross-Defendant’s
performance
 
Cross-Complainants argue that
triable issues of material fact exist regarding its non-performance under the
agreements, which is excused by Cross-Defendant’s failure to perform its own
obligations. (Opp., pp. 6:26-7:1.) Cross-Complainants dispute the Motion’s
contention that the agreement only created obligations for Cross-Complainants
and rights for Cross-Defendant by arguing that Cross-Defendant also had
obligations to provide them with the necessary content and to review the
content. (Opp., Separate Statement, Fact No. 9; Vera Decl., ¶4 and Pafundi
Decl., Exh. 16.) The opposition evidence, however, does not demonstrate that
Cross-Defendant had any obligations under the terms of the agreement. Vera’s
declaration states that the first step in drafting the content for the site was
for Pafundi to review a Google doc and make edits but does not state that this
was discussed and agreed upon by the parties. (Opp., Vera Decl., ¶4.) Exhibit
16 also does not demonstrate to what the parties agreed. It only shows Pafundi
and Cross-Complainant discussing what content would be included. (Motion,
Pafundi Decl., Exh. 16 at Bates Nos. PLAINTIFF00110 and PLAINTIFF00111.) 
 
Cross-Complainants also dispute
promising to design and create the Website within 30 days; instead, they argue
that Cross-Complainant Vera informed Pafundi that the average time to build a
website is 30-45 days, depending on how quickly content for the site could be
provided. (Opp., Separate Statement, Fact No. 10; Vera Decl., ¶¶3-5.) Again, Cross-Complainant’s
evidence does not support this purported fact because it does not demonstrate
that this information regarding the deadline to produce the Website was ever
communicated to Cross-Defendant. Instead, Vera declares “if final draft
content, including text, photographs, and/or videos, is provided to me without
delay, then my estimated turnaround time to build a website is 30-40 days.”
(Opp., Vera Decl., ¶5.) Therefore, Cross-Complainants have not demonstrated a
dispute regarding the 30-day deadline to complete the Website under the
agreement. Accordingly, the Court finds that no triable issues of material fact
have been shown with respect to Issues 2 and 3. 
 
However, the dispute regarding
the existence of a separate agreement for payment for the coming soon/landing
page precludes a grant of summary judgment.
 
Conclusion
 
Cross-Defendant Pafundi
Law Firm’s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.
