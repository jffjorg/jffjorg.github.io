 Zazueta v. Reihaneh, et al.MOTION
TO RECOVER NON-ATTORNEY FEES
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Richard R. Zazueta’s Amended Motion to Recover Non-Attorney
Fees is DENIED. 
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Richard Zazueta (“Plaintiff”),
in propria persona, filed the instant action for motor vehicle negligence
against Defendant Sarraf Shirazi Reihaneh (“Defendant”) on January 13, 2021.
Defendant answered the Complaint on March 1, 2022. On June 9, 2022, the Court
granted Defendant’s Motions to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories and
Requests for Production, and Requests for Sanctions against Plaintiff. (Minute Order, 06/09/22.) On November 1,
2022, the Court denied Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions. (Minute
Order, 11/01/22.) 
 
The action came for trial on September 14, 2023, at which time the
parties stipulated that Defendant is liable for damages. (Minute Order,
09/14/23.) Judgment was entered in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in
the amount of $3,792.41. (Ibid.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant
Amended Motion for Non-Attorney Fees on March 15, 2024. An additional
memorandum was filed by Plaintiff on April 29, 2024. No opposition has been
filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The Motion appears to seek
recovery of costs Plaintiff incurred prosecuting this action. 
 
First, the Motion is not
accompanied by a proper proof of service; the proofs of service are not
attested to by the person who served the papers. (Motion, filed 03/15/24, p. 5;
Memo, filed 04/29/24, p. 15.) Failure to give notice of a motion is not only a
violation of the statutory requirements but of the due process owed to
Defendant. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero (1984) 156
Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) 
 
Second, the Motion cite to “Rule #1717.” (Motion, filed 03/15/24, pp. 1-2.) apparently meaning California Civil Code Section 1717, but this does not authorize the specified costs. The
second memorandum cites dozens of statutes but does not explain how any of them
provides for an award of non-attorney fees to Plaintiff in this action. (Memo,
filed 04/29/24, pp. 1-2.) This fails to comply with the requirements for a
memorandum of points and authorities under the California Rules of Court. “The
memorandum must contain a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law,
evidence and arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and
textbooks cited in support of the position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1113(b).)
 
Therefore, Plaintiff has not
demonstrated a basis for an award of non-attorney fees. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Richard R. Zazueta’s Amended Motion to Recover
Non-Attorney Fees is DENIED. 
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
