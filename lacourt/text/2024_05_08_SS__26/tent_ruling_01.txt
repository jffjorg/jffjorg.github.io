ANALYSIS:  
 
On October 8, 2019,
Plaintiff American Contractors Indemnity Company (“Judgment Creditor”) filed a
Complaint against Defendant Jose Luis Guillen Ramirez aka Jose Luis Guillen (“Judgment
Debtor) for breach of contract. On May 6, 2020, this Court entered default
judgment against Judgment Debtor for the total amount of $15,728.96. 
 
On February 27, 2024, Judgment
Creditor filed the instant Motion for Order of Assignment of Payments, for
Order Restraining Judgment Debtor from Assigning or Otherwise Disposing of the
Right to Payment, and for Order Compelling Accounting. No opposition has been
filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure, section 708.510, subdivision
(a), the moving statute, the Court may order the judgment debtor to assign to
the judgment creditor or to an appointed receiver all or part of a right to
payment due or to become due. The types of payments that can be assigned
include wages due from the federal government if not subject to a withholding
order, rents, commissions, royalties, patent or copyright payments, and
insurance policy loan value. (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.510, subd. (a).)
 
Relevant factors the Court may take into consideration when
making an assignment order include the judgment debtor’s reasonable
requirements if they are a natural person, payments the judgment debtor is
required to make to satisfy other judgments and wage assignments, the amount
remaining due on the judgment, and the amount to be received in satisfaction of
the right to payment that may be assigned. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 708.510, subd. (c).) Construing all the
applicable statutes together, the “assignment order” contemplated by Code of
Civil Procedure, section 708.510, et seq.
must include a court order that assigns a right to payment outright (not simply
an order directing the judgment debtor to do so).  
 
Here, Judgment Creditor seeks an order (1) directing
payments made by MGM Drywall, Inc. or out of MGM Drywall, Inc.’s account(s) to Judgment Debtor be assigned
to Judgment Creditor; (2) directing Judgment Debtor to turn over to Judgment
Creditor any payments made by MGM Drywall, Inc. or out MGM Drywall, Inc.’s
account(s); (3) restraining Judgment Debtor or any servant, agent, employee,
attorney, or anyone else acting on his behalf or jointly with him from
assigning or otherwise disposing of the right to payment; and (4) compelling
Judgment Debtor to provide, file, and serve an accounting every other month as
a means of monitoring Judgment Debtor’s activity and to ensure compliance with
the Court’s orders. (Motion, pp. 1:24-2:15.) 
 
On May 6, 2020, judgment was entered in Judgment Creditor’s
favor and against Judgment Debtor in the amount of $15,728.96.
(Motion, Murray Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. 1.) Furthermore, Judgment Creditor has
attempted to enforce its judgment but has only obtained $500.65 through a bank
levy on JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (Id. at ¶ 3, Exh. 2.) Judgment
Creditor also avers that it subpoenaed Judgment Debtor’s bank records from JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. and discovered he still works as an unlicensed contractor for
certain customers, including MGM Drywall, Inc. (Id. at ¶¶4-5, Exhs.
3-4.) Judgment Debtor endorses checks from MGM Drywall, Inc. and deposits them.
(Id. at ¶7 and Exh. 4.) 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Judgment
Creditor’s motion for an order of assignment of payments, restraining Judgment
Debtor from assigning or otherwise disposing of the right to payment, and
compelling accounting is warranted under the law. Judgment Creditor has
provided sufficient evidence to support that Judgment Debtor consistently
receives payments from MGM Drwyall, Inc.
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Judgment Creditor American Contractors Indemnity
Company’s Motion for Order of Assignment of Payments, for Order Restraining
Judgment Debtor from Assigning or Otherwise Disposing of the Right to Payment,
and for Order Compelling Accounting is GRANTED WITH RESPECT TO PAYMENTS MADE TO
JUDGMENT DEBTOR BY MGM DRYWALL, INC. 
 
JUDGMENT DEBTOR IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED ORDER IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THIS RULING WITHIN 20 DAYS.
