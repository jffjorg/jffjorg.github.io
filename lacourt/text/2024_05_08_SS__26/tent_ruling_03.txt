ANALYSIS:
 
On July 19, 2022, Plaintiff Isidro
Humberto Herrera Garcia filed the instant action for motor vehicle negligence
against Defendant Robert D. Prater (“Defendant”). The action came for trial on
January 16, 2024, at which time Plaintiff failed to appear and the Court
dismissed the action without prejudice. (Minute Order, 01/16/24.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to
Vacate Dismissal on March 26, 2024. No opposition to the Motion has been filed
to date.
Nor has proof of service of the
Summons and Complaint been filed.  
 
Discussion
 
The motion is brought
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b). Under this statute, an application for relief must be made
no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the moving
party’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130,
143.) When based on attorney fault with respect to entry of default, default
judgment, or involuntary dismissal, a timely request for relief must be
granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) When brought pursuant to the
provision for discretionary relief based on party fault, the request must have
been filed within a reasonable amount of time. 
 
The motion was timely filed less
than two months after dismissal of the action and is supported by an attorney
affidavit of fault. Plaintiff’s counsel declares that they believed they would
receive a notice of the trial. (Motion, Paley Decl., ¶¶2-3.) Therefore, the
case must be reinstated under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(b).
