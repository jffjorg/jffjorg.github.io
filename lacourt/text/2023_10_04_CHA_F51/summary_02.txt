And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a personal injury action case between Plaintiff Tiniyan Odaibo and Defendant Rosa Anguiano. The Plaintiff has filed a demurrer against the Defendant's entire Answer to the Plaintiff's Complaint, alleging that the Defendant does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense. The Judge has reviewed the pleadings and found that the Defendant's affirmative defenses for Apportionment of fault and Comparative Negligence are directly applicable to the Plaintiff's claims. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff did not meet and confer with the Defendant before filing the demurrer, but finds that the Plaintiff's counsel has satisfied the preliminary meet and confer requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. The Judge overrules the demurrer and orders the parties to comply with the technical requirements for electronic filing set forth in the Court's First Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil.
