## English Summary 

The judge has reviewed a demurrer filed by Plaintiff Tiniyan Odaibo against Defendant Rosa Anguiano in a personal injury case stemming from a car accident on 12/01/2021.  The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of Defendant's Answer, arguing that it does not adequately state defenses against Plaintiff's claims.

The judge found that Plaintiff had properly met with Defendant's counsel to discuss the demurrer, as required by law. The judge also found that Defendant's affirmative defenses, including comparative negligence and failure to mitigate damages, were sufficiently pleaded and directly relevant to the case.  

Therefore, the judge overruled the demurrer, meaning Defendant's Answer will stand.  The case will proceed to discovery and potentially a trial.

The judge has ruled that the defendant's answer to the plaintiff's complaint is sufficient and that the plaintiff's demurrer (a legal challenge to the answer) is overruled. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant was negligent in a motor vehicle accident that caused the plaintiff's injuries, and the defendant has pleaded affirmative defenses, including comparative negligence and apportionment of fault. The judge finds that the defendant's affirmative defenses are directly applicable to the plaintiff's claims and that the demurrer is not supported by the law. As a result, the judge has overruled the demurrer and allows the defendant's answer to stand.

In this tentative ruling, the Judge overrules the Plaintiff's demurrer against the Defendant's entire answer in a personal injury action. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant's negligent driving caused injuries on 2021-12-01. The Defendant filed an answer on 2023-06-20, asserting that the Plaintiff's recovery is barred, diminished, or reduced due to the Plaintiff's failure to conduct herself in a reasonably prudent manner, apportionment of fault, and failure to mitigate damages. The Judge finds that Defendant's comparative negligence and apportionment of fault affirmative defenses are directly applicable to Plaintiff’s claims. The Judge also reminds the Plaintiff to comply with technical requirements when e-filing documents in the future.
