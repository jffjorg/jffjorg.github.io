ANALYSIS
 
I.          Relieved
as Counsel       
A.               
Legal Standard 
The court
may order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or
after judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney
and after notice from one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(2).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.   
 An application to be relieved as counsel must
be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)). The proposed order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the
action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if known.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
Further, the
requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties who have
appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may
delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service
of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) A motion to withdraw will not be granted
where withdrawal would prejudice the client. Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.  
B.        Discussion 
The Court finds that Counsel
has filed the requisite forms pursuant to each of the Motions as required by
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  The Court
has received the Supplemental Declaration in support of the Motions, which indicates
that Mills Sadat Dowlat LLP seeks to withdraw from the representation because
there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, there exist
irreconcilable differences that render continued representation impossible, and
due to issues regarding payment of fees and costs. (Decl. Sadat ¶3) Furthermore,
Declaration in original Motions indicated that Counsel e-mailed Kreation
Juicery, Inc. and Marjan Sarshar, respectively, on February 9, 2024 that
Counsel would no longer be able to represent them in this action and that they
should retain new counsel. 
Accordingly, the Court
grants the Motions to be relieved as counsel. 

II.        Conclusion 
 Based on the foregoing, Counsel Mills Sadat Dowlat LLP’s Motions to be
Relieved as Counsel for Defendants Marjan Sarshar and for Defendant
 Kreation Juicery, Inc. filed by Mills Sadat Dowlat LLP are GRANTED.The Court's Ruling and Attorney's relief as Counsel of
record for client is not effective until Proof of Service of the Order signed
by theCourt upon the client is filed in this action.  Until then, counsel continues to be counsel
of record.  Cal. Rules of Court
3.1362(e). The Court sets a Conference Re:  Status of Corporate Defendant Kreation
Juicery, Inc.’s Legal  Representation is set for 09/16/2024at 9:30
