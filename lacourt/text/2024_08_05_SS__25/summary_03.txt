And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motions filed by Counsel Mills Sadat Dowlat LLP to be relieved as counsel for Defendants Marjan Sarshar and Kreation Juicery, Inc. The judge found that Counsel had filed the required forms and declarations supporting the motions, which indicated a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, irreconcilable differences, and issues regarding payment of fees and costs. The judge noted that the court may delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court. The judge set a conference to discuss the status of Kreation Juicery, Inc.'s legal representation for September 16, 2024.
