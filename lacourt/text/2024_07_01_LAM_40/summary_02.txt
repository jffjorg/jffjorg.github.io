And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. The case involves the Estate of Tat Kwok, who died on April 28, 2019, and his successor in interest, Conail Kwok, who is also a plaintiff. The Plaintiffs allege that Ramon Healthcare Associates, Inc. dba Mission Care Center and other defendants failed to provide adequate care for Tat Kwok, leading to his injuries and death.

The Judge has tentatively granted the motion, finding that the Plaintiffs' proposal for amendment satisfies the legal standard and is not barred by any controlling precedent. The Judge notes that the sufficiency of the proposed amendments is not at issue, and that the delay in seeking amendment is not a good reason for denial. The Judge will seek clarification from counsel as to why amendment has been delayed.

The case involves allegations of Elder Abuse and Neglect, Violation of Resident Rights, and Wrongful Death, and is related to two other cases that were transferred to Department 40. The Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint is tentatively granted, but the Judge will address certain points further during oral argument.
