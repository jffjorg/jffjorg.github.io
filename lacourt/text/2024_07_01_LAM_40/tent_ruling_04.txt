I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Kids Empire Pomona, LLC (Kids Empire) sues Defendants Royal
Oak, L.P., Twin Flower Properties, L.P., Clear Mountain Properties, L.P.,
Skymeadow Properties, L.P., Reliable Properties, and Does 1-10 pursuant to a
January 17, 2024, Complaint alleging claims of (1) Fraud, (2) Rescission
(Mistake), and (3) Declaratory Relief.
The claims arise from the following allegations. In September 2018, Kids
Empire entered a written lease with Defendants Royal Oak, L.P., Twin Flower
Properties, L.P., Clear Mountain Properties, L.P., Skymeadow Properties, L.P., and
Reliable Properties (the Landlord Defendants), with Reliable Properties as
agent of the remaining four Landlord Defendants. The lease involved rental of
commercial premises. The Landlord Defendants—which are also generally agents
and alter egos of one another—knowingly and falsely represented to Kids Empire through
David Gold of Reliable Properties that the rent for the premises would be
$4,795 per month, an amount later reflected in the parties’ lease agreement at
section 18.1, attached to the Complaint as Exhibit 1. Kids Empire commenced its
occupancy of the premises and operations in June 2021. The falsity of the
statements regarding the rent to be paid by Kids Empire was shown when, after
Kids Empire commenced occupancy, the Landlord Defendants claimed that Kids
Empire’s monthly expense obligation was (or would have been, for pre-occupancy
months) $8,096.90 for 2021, $9,236.82 for 2022, and $9,474.20 for 2023. An
employee of Reliable Properties later informed Kids Empire that David Gold, who
had since passed away, was known to underrepresent rent expenses to induce
potential tenants to sign leases.
B. Motion Before the Court
On March 1, 2024, the Landlord Defendants filed a demurrer to the Complaint’s three
causes of action.
On June 17, 2024, Kids Empire filed an opposition, and on June 24, 2024,
the Landlord Defendants filed a reply.
Defendants’ demurrer is now before the Court.
 
II. Demurrer
A. Requests for Judicial Notice
Per Plaintiff’s request, the Court
takes judicial notice of the grant deeds recorded with the Recorder’s Office
for Los Angeles County, California. (Opp’n, RJN, Exs. 1-4; Evid. Code, §§ 452,
subds. (c), (h), 453, subds. (a), (b).)
Per the Landlord Defendants’
request, the Court takes judicial notice of various statements of information
filed by companies with the name ‘Kids Empire’ s filed with the California
Secretary of State. (Reply, RJN, Exs. A-S; Evid. Code, §§ 452, subds. (c), (h),
453, subds. (a), (b).)
The Court notes that documents are generally
only judicially noticeable to show their existence and what orders were made,
but the truth of the facts and findings within the documents are not judicially
noticeable. (Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz &
McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 885.) Judicial notice may be taken as to
existence of document and legal effects deriving therefrom. (Julian
Volunteer Fire Co. Assn. v. Julian-Cuyamaca Fire Protection Dist. (2021) 62
Cal.App.5th 583, 600.)
B. Legal Standard
A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).)
To sufficiently allege a cause of
action, a complaint must allege all the ultimate facts—that is, the facts
needed to establish each element of the cause of action pleaded. (Committee
on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan
Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) “[E]ach evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)
In testing the sufficiency of the
cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
966-67.) Courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v.
City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216,
1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines
Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) A demurrer, however, “does not
admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v.
Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) 
A demurrer may only be used to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The face of the complaint includes
exhibits attached to the complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts appearing in the exhibits contradict those
alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence. (Holland v. Morse Diesel
Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded by statute on
other grounds as stated in White v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th
506, 521.)
C. Analysis
1. Demurrer,
Complaint, Statute of Limitations: OVERRULED.
a. Relevant
Law
Unless a complaint affirmatively
discloses on its face that the statute of limitations has run, the general
demurrer on these grounds must be overruled. (See Lockley v. Law Office of
Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 881
[“It must appear clearly and affirmatively that, upon the face of the
complaint, the right of action is necessarily barred”].) Instead, “[t]he proper
remedy ‘is to ascertain the factual basis of the contention through discovery
and, if necessary, file a motion for summary judgment ….’ [Citation.]” (Roman
v. County of Los Angeles (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 316, 325.)
A statute of limitations starts to
run once the cause of action “accrues,” and although a cause of action
typically accrues when it is complete with all of its elements, a cause of
action will at times be deemed to accrue at a later date, such as when the
plaintiff did not discover and had no occasion to discover the cause of action
until that later date (the discovery rule), when the defendant fraudulently
concealed the existence of a possible claim until that later date, or when the
defendant committed multiple wrongs that ended on that later date (continuing
violations doctrine). (Doe v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles
(2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 953, 961 (Doe).)
b. Court’s
Determination
The Court finds in favor of Kids
Empire.
The statute of limitations for
fraud is three years. (Code Civ. Proc., § 338.) The statute of limitations for
declaratory relief is the one applicable to an ordinary legal or equitable
action based on the same claim, i.e., three years based on the fraud claim. (Abbott
v. City of Los Angeles (1958) 50 Cal.2d 438, 463.)
The Court does not discuss the
rescission ‘claim,’ which fails for reasons discussed in detail below.
The Complaint alleges that at some
undisclosed point in time after Kids Empire commenced its occupancy of the
subject premises in June 2021, the Landlord Defendants informed Kids Empire
that its rent would be substantially higher than that agreed to in the lease. (Complaint,
¶ 14.) Even if the Court were to assume that this communication took place on
June 1, 2021, taken as the date of discovery, three years from June 1, 2021, was
June 1, 2024, well before the Complaint filing date of January 17, 2024.
The Landlord Defendants demurrer
argues that the three-year statute of limitations should not apply here because
as shown in the lease attached to the Complaint, the lease imposes a one-year
statute of limitations for claims arising from the lease. However, this
argument fails because the fraud claim in the Complaint is sufficiently
alleged, as discussed in the following subsection. Fraud in the inducement
voids a contract. (Vai v. Bank of Am. Nat’l Tr. & Sav. Assn (1961)
56 Cal.2d 329; accord Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 289, 294-295.) Thus, the term in the contract establishing a
one-year statute of limitations on claims arising from the lease is, for
pleading purposes, void, and cannot control for the purposes of the statute of
limitations discussion.
To the extent that the reply argues
that the one-year statute of limitations clause can be upheld because it goes
to procedural matters alone such as arbitration agreements (Reply, pp. 2-3),
the Court disagrees. When read liberally and for pleading purposes, the
Complaint alleges sufficient grounds to infer that the inclusion of the
one-year statute of limitations in the lease agreement was part of the
fraudulent scheme that induced Kids Empire to enter the lease in the first instance
and that the one-year clause furthers the benefits of that fraud in favor of
the Landlord Defendants.
The Court thus OVERRULES the
Landlord Defendants’ demurrer insofar as it arises from a global statute of
limitations argument.
2. Demurrer,
Complaint, First Cause of Action, Fraud: OVERRULED.
a. Relevant
Law
“Fraud in the inducement is a
subset of the tort of fraud. It occurs when the promisor knows what he is
signing but his consent is induced by fraud, mutual assent is present and a
contract is formed, which, by reason of the fraud, is voidable.” (Hinesley
v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294-295, quotations and
citations omitted.)
Intentional misrepresentation
involves “(1) a knowingly false representation by the defendant; (2) an intent
to deceive or induce reliance; (3) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and
(4) resulting damages.” (Service by Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co. (1996)
44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816.)
Allegations of fraud “must be pled
with more detail than other causes of action.” (Apollo Capital Fund, LLC v.
Roth Capital Partners, LLC (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 226, 240.) “Every element
of the cause of action for fraud must be alleged … factually and
specifically[,] and the policy of liberal construction of the pleadings … will
not ordinarily be invoked to sustain a pleading defective in any material
respect. [Citations.]” (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General
Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216, superseded by statute as stated in Branick
v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) A plaintiff
pleading fraud must plead facts showing “how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means” the allegedly fraudulent representations were tendered. (Lazar v.
Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) “[G]eneral and conclusory
allegations do not suffice.” (Small v. Fritz Cos., Inc. (2003) 30
Cal.4th 167, 184 [citations omitted].)
However, generally, “less
particularity [of pleading] is required where the defendant may be assumed to
possess knowledge of the facts at least equal, if not superior, to that
possessed by the plaintiff.” (Burks v. Poppy Construction Co. (1962) 57
Cal.2d 463, 474.)
b. Court’s
Determination
The Court finds in favor of Kids
Empire.
The Complaint alleges either
intentional misrepresentation or fraudulent inducement.
Fraudulent misrepresentation is
alleged through:
(1) A knowing misrepresentation
from David Gold regarding the rent for the premises, the falsity of which was
shown through juxtaposition of the promised and charged rents and through the
comment for a Reliable Properties employee regarding David Gold’s common
falsity in inducing tenants to enter leases for one rate only to charge another
(Complaint, ¶¶ 10-16, 17, 18-19);
(2) David Gold’s position as agent
for Reliable Properties, which itself is an agent for the remaining Landlord
Defendants, supporting vicarious liability for David Gold’s actions (Complaint,
¶¶ 9 [general agency and alter ego allegations], 11 [David Gold as agent for
Reliable Properties], Ex. 1, p. 13 [Reliable Properties as agent for Royal Oak,
Twin Flower Properties, Clear Mountain Properties, and Skymeadow Properties]);
(3) An intent to induce reliance as
inferable from the intent to profit from the difference in rent promised and
the rent charged by the Landlord Defendants, i.e., $4,795 versus $8,096.90 for
2021, $9,236.82 for 2022, and $9,474.20 for 2023 (Complaint, ¶¶ 20-21);
(4) Reasonable reliance by Kids
Empire (Complaint, ¶ 22); and
(5) Damages (Complaint, ¶¶ 23-25).
Fraud in the inducement is alleged
through the same allegations.
While the demurrer argues that
fraud is not alleged with particularity as to the “how, when, where, to whom,
and by what means,” here, the misrepresentations were made by David Gold, to
Kids Empire, and on or before the lease was executed in September 2018. The
Court is satisfied that for pleading purposes, this is sufficient particularity
and that additional evidentiary facts can be ascertained in discovery.
The Court thus OVERRULES the
Landlord Defendants’ demurrer as relates to the Complaint’s first cause of
action.
3. Demurrer,
Complaint, Second Cause of Action, Rescission (Mistake): SUSTAINED without
leave to amend.
a. Relevant
Law
Although a breach of contract may
be redressed in various ways, such as by rescission, specific performance,
declaratory relief, the payment of damages, or injunctive relief, the remedy is
not the cause of action, but rather, there is a single cause of cause of action
for breach of contract; otherwise stated, the “‘seeking of different kinds of
relief does not establish different causes of action.’” (Marden v. Bailard
(1954) 124 Cal.App.2d 458, 465.) For the reason, “[r]escission” “is [generally]
not a cause of action; it is a remedy.” (Nakash v. Superior Court (1987)
196 Cal.App.3d 59, 70.)
b. Court’s
Determination
The Court finds in favor of the
Landlord Defendants.
No cause of action for rescission
exists in California, as discussed in the above authorities. This point is not
addressed in Kids Empire’s opposition.
The Court thus SUSTAINS the
Landlord Defendants’ demurrer as relates to the Complaint’s second cause of
action, without leave to amend.
4. Demurrer,
Complaint, Third Cause of Action, Declaratory Relief: OVERRULED.
a. Relevant
Law
Any person interested under a
written instrument, excluding a will or a trust, or under a contract, or who
desires a declaration of his or her rights or duties with respect to another,
or in respect to, in, over or upon property, or with respect to the location of
the natural channel of a watercourse, may, in cases of actual controversy
relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties, bring an
original action or cross-complaint in the superior court for a declaration of his
or her rights and duties in the premises, including a determination of any
question of construction or validity arising under the instrument or contract.
(Code Civ. Proc., §1060.)
The fundamental basis of
declaratory relief is a present and actual controversy between the parties over
a proper subject. (City of Cotati v. Cashman (2002) 29 Cal.4th 69, 80.)
b. Court’s
Determination
The Court finds in favor of Kids
Empire.
The third cause of action is
derivative of the first cause of action and, as discussed above, is timely for
pleading purposes, for which reason the Court relies on its fraud and statute
of limitations discussions to determine that the Complaint’s third cause of
action is sufficiently alleged.
The Court thus OVERRULES the
Landlord Defendants’ demurrer as relates to the Complaint’s third cause of
action.
 
III. Conclusion
Defendants Royal Oak, L.P., Twin
Flower Properties, L.P., Clear Mountain Properties, L.P., Skymeadow Properties,
L.P., and Reliable Properties’ Demurrer to Complaint [Res ID # 7118] is
OVERRULED in part and SUSTAINED in part as follows:
(1) OVERRULED as to the demurrer’s
statute of limitations argument against all three of the Complaint’s alleged causes
of action;
(2) OVERRULED as to the Complaint’s
first and third causes of action; and
(3) SUSTAINED, without leave to
amend, as to the Complaint’s second cause of action.
