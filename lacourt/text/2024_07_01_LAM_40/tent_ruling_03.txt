 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Motion to Be
  Relieved as Counsel [CRS# 8475]; and
Motion to Be

I. Background
On April 11, 2024,
Plaintiffs’ counsel Ledezma, APLC filed motions to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiffs. The April 11th motions attach proof of service showing service of
the motions on Plaintiffs. On April 15, 2024, Ledezma, APLC filed an additional
proof of service showing service of the motions on Defendant Brighton Convalescent,
LLC.
As of this date, Ledezma,
APLC’s motions are unopposed.
Ledezma, APLC’s motions
are now before the Court.
 
II. Motions to Be Relieved as Counsel: GRANTED.
A. Legal Standard
“The question of granting or
denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as counsel ([without client
consent pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section] 284, subd. (2)) is one
which lies within the sound discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind
whether such withdrawal might work an injustice in the handling of the case.’”
(People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations
omitted].)
For an attorney to be relieved as
counsel, the attorney must comply with the requirements of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subdivisions (a) and (c) to (e). These subdivisions require
that an attorney file and show proof of service of (1) a notice and motion to
be relived as counsel on Judicial Council form MC-051, (2) a declaration in
support of the motion to be relived as counsel on Judicial Council form MC-052,
and (3) a proposed order in support of the motion to be relieved as counsel on
Judicial Council form MC-053.
The court should consider whether
the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished without undue prejudice to the
client’s interests.” (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904,
915.) Moreover, the motion should also be denied if it will cause undue delay
in the proceeding or cause injustice. (Mandell v. Superior Court (1977)
67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)
B. Analysis
The Court GRANTS Ledezma,
APLC’s motions.
First, Plaintiffs’ counsel Ledezma,
APLC complied with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. Within 16 court
days of hearing, plus additional days to respond based on manner of service,
Ledezma, APLC filed Judicial Council forms MC-051 to MC-053 with
the Court and served the same on Plaintiffs and Defendant Brighton
Convalescent, LLC. A review of the three Judicial Council forms for each
Plaintiff shows that the forms are complete and properly filled out.
Second, there is a valid reason for
withdrawal: “An irreparable breakdown of attorney-client relationship has
occurred that makes it impossible for attorney to represent this client.”
Third, because there is no trial
date in this action, and because Plaintiffs and Defendant Brighton
Convalescent, LLC have not filed oppositions to this motion, no prejudice or
delay arises sufficient to deny Ledezma, APLC’s motions.
 
III. Conclusion
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel
[CRS# 8475] is GRANTED.
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel
[CRS# 4947] is GRANTED.
