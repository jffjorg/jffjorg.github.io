And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by the Landlord Defendants to the Complaint filed by KIDS EMPIRE POMONA, LLC. The Landlord Defendants seek to dismiss the Complaint's claims of fraud, rescission, and declaratory relief.

The judge finds in favor of KIDS EMPIRE POMONA, LLC on the statute of limitations and fraud claims, but sustains the Landlord Defendants' demurrer as to the rescission claim. The judge rules that the Complaint's first and third causes of action (fraud and declaratory relief) are sufficient, but the Complaint's second cause of action (rescission) fails because rescission is not a cause of action in California.

The judge also rejects the Landlord Defendants' argument that the statute of limitations bars the Complaint's claims, ruling that the Complaint's allegations are sufficient to show that the statute of limitations has not run. The judge also finds that the Complaint's allegations of fraud are sufficient to state a cause of action.
