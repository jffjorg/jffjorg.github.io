 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiffs Estate
  of Tat Kwok and Conail Kwok’s Motion for Leave to File Second Amended
  Complaint [Res ID # 7823].



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
On November 4, 2019,
in LASC No. 20STCV25497 (the Lead Case), Conail Kwok—both as an
individual and as the Successor in Interest of the Estate of Tat Kwok—filed the
operative First Amended Complaint (FAC) suing Defendants Ramon Healthcare
Associates, Inc. (Mission Care Center; originally sued as Riverside Equities,
LLC) and Does 1 through 25.
On November 3, 2023,
Conail Kwok—both as an individual and as the Successor in Interest of the
Estate of Tat Kwok—filed the operative FAC in LASC No. 21STCV15837, The
Estate of Tat Kwok, et al. v. Brighton Convalescent, LLC (the Brighton
Case), which sues Brighton Convalescent, LLC dba Brighton Care Center and Does
1 through 25 as Defendants and Ada Kwok and Melissa Kwok as Nominal Defendants.
The pleading in both
cases alleges claims of (1) Elder Abuse and Neglect pursuant to Welfare &
Institutions Code sections 15600, et seq., (2) Violation of Resident Rights
pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 1430, subdivision (b), and (3)
Wrongful Death.
The pleading in both
cases arises from identical allegations that Mission Care Center or Brighton
Care Center failed to provide adequate care for Tat Kwok and that the failure of
Mission Care Center or Brighton Care Center to prevent a wound from developing
in Tat Kwok’s coccyx—the small triangular bone at the base of the spinal column
in humans—contributed to Tat Kwok’s injuries and subsequent death on April 28,
2019.
On May 28, 2024, the two actions
were related by and transferred (Brighton Case only) to Department 40 at the
Stanley Mosk Courthouse (the Court).
Motions to consolidate the two
actions are pending in the Lead Case and Brighton Case and are set for hearing
on July 12, 2024, as continued from June 20, 2024. A trial setting conference
is also scheduled for July 12, 2024.
B. Motion Before the Court
On March 28, 2024, in the Lead
Case, and prior to the Court’s order relating the Lead Case and the Brighton
Case, Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint
(SAC).
The motion is unopposed by Mission
Care Center, the Defendant in at issue in the pleadings of the Lead
Case.
Plaintiffs’ motion is now before
the Court.
 
II. Motion for Leave to Amend: TENTATIVELY
GRANTED.
A. Legal Standard
California Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (a)(1) provides, in relevant part: “The court may, in
furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to
amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any
party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any
other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or
demurrer. The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the
adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any
pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an
answer to be made after the time limited by this code.”
A motion for leave to amend must
comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324.
Discretion in favor of amendment “should
be exercised liberally in favor of amendments, for judicial policy favors
resolution of all disputed matters in the same lawsuit.” (Kittredge Sports
Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047 (Kittredge Sports).)
California courts will not ordinarily
consider the validity of a proposed amended pleading in ruling on a motion for
leave to amend given that any grounds for a demurrer or a motion to strike will
be premature at that time. (See California Casualty General Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 280-281 (California Casualty),
citations omitted, overruled on other grounds by Kransco v. American Empire
Surplus Lines Ins. Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390, 403-406.)
However, leave to amend may also be
properly denied when “the insufficiency of the proposed amendment is
established by controlling precedent and … [can]not be cured by further
appropriate amendment.” (California Casualty, supra, 173
Cal.App.3d at pp. 280-281; see, e.g., Foxborough v. Van Atta (1994) 26
Cal.App.4th 217, 231 [not an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend when
“proposed amendment would have been futile because it was barred by the statute
of limitations” with no indication of relating back to the original
complaint].) 
Further, if a good amendment is
proposed in proper form, a long, unwarranted and unexcused delay in presenting
it may be a good reason for denial. (Roemer v. Retail Credit Co. (1975)
44 Cal.App.3d 926, 939-940 (Roemer).)
B. Analysis
Plaintiffs’ motion satisfies
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subdivisions (a)(1)-(3). The points and
authorities explain the differences in pleadings—i.e., adding two heirs of Tat
Kwok as Nominal Defendants—and attach a copy of the proposed SAC. (Mot., pp. 4-5,
Ex. A.)
Plaintiffs’ motion tentatively
satisfies California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subdivisions (b)(1)-(4). The
points and authorities rather than counsel’s declaration explain that the
proposed changes are to add heirs that must be joined because they are
indispensable parties to this action brought in relation to Tat Kwok’s injuries
prior to death. (Mot., p. 4.) However, the points and authorities do not
address why Melissa Kwok was a Plaintiff in the initial Complaint, was removed
from the FAC, and now makes a return in the proposed SAC as a Nominal
Defendant, or why Ada Kwok was never included in the initial Complaint or in
the FAC. (Mot., pp. 4, 6.) The Court will address these points further during
oral argument.
The sufficiency of the proposed
SAC’s allegations is not at issue, which makes sense for an amendment relating
to adding necessary—though not indispensable—heirs. (See Ruttenberg v.
Ruttenberg (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 801, 808 [“The latter point applies when
wrongful death plaintiffs fail to join all heirs. The superior court has
jurisdiction to try a wrongful death action even absent joinder of one or more
heirs of the decedent. [Citation.] As defined by section 389, a non-joined heir
is not an ‘indispensable party’ to a wrongful death action. [Citations.] [¶] Omitted
heirs, however, are ‘necessary parties,’ and plaintiff heirs have a mandatory
duty to join all known omitted heirs in the ‘single action’ for wrongful death.
If an heir refuses to participate in the suit as a plaintiff, he or she may be
named as a defendant so that all heirs are before the court in the same action.
An heir named as a defendant in a wrongful death action is, in reality, a
plaintiff. [Citations.]”].) Sufficiency is therefore not an impediment to
amendment.
As for delay in seeking amendment,
the Court again notes that it will seek clarification from counsel as to why
amendment here has been delayed. However, based on lack of opposition from
Mission Health Care, the Court exercises its liberal discretion in tentatively
permitting amendment.
Plaintiffs’ motion is TENTATIVELY
GRANTED.
 
III. Conclusion
Plaintiffs Estate of Tat Kwok and Conail Kwok’s Motion for Leave to File
Second Amended Complaint [Res ID # 7823] is TENTATIVELY GRANTED.
