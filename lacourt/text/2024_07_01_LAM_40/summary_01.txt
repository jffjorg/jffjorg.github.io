Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment or adjudication filed by Defendant Dr. Amarjit Singh Marwah. The motion is based on alleged crimes committed by Plaintiff Nirmal S. Sehmbey, including kidnapping and murder. However, the Court finds that the publications at issue are not true and that Dr. Marwah lacks reasonable grounds for believing the truth of the statements. Additionally, the Court finds that Dr. Marwah's own evidence shows triable issues as to malice. As a result, the motion is DENIED. The case will proceed to trial on August 20, 2024.
