[1]           Defendant
Sharpe Interior Systems, Inc. (Sharpe) sent a proposed release; the release was
sent back and forth between Sharpe and Defendant Mardirossian with revisions
until a final version was agreed upon on May 26, 2022. (DSS 9-12.)


[2]             The
significance of dicta depends on the source. (See Hubbard v. Superior Court (1997) 66 Cal. App. 4th 1163,
1169 [Justice Kaus “gave some sage advice to trial judges…: Generally speaking,
follow dicta from the California Supreme Court”].)
 


[3]           In a related
argument, the opposition suggests the value of the Settlement was different
from the time it was negotiated by Mardirossian to when Plaintiff’s new
counsel, Elliss George, undertook substantial work to reduce Plaintiff’s other
liens. According to the Opposition, Ellis George worked for more than a year to
obtain a recovery for Plaintiff well in excess of $2 million by reducing other
liens, whereas the recovery obtained by Plaintiff at the time Mardirossian
declared victory was in the $300,000 range. However, according to the Reply,
Plaintiff signed the settlement before his current attorneys negotiated a
single lien. Thus, Plaintiff’s claim that Ellis George added substantial value may
be true but does not inform on Plaintiff’s ratification of the Settlement.
(Opp., 24:19-24.)
