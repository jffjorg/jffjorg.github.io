And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Sienna Rae Walker, the plaintiff, in her claim for partition of three properties: two single-family residences and one commercial property. The properties in question are located in Rolling Hills, CA, and Carson, CA. The plaintiff alleges that she and the defendants, Chanel Walker and Richard A. Walker, are each one-half owners of two of the properties and one-third owners of the third property.

The defendants oppose the motion, arguing that the plaintiff's claim for partition is barred by waiver and fraud. However, the judge finds that the defendants have failed to adequately plead these defenses. Additionally, the judge notes that the defendants have also filed a cross-complaint seeking partition of the properties by sale, but have not addressed the plaintiff's claim for partition by sale.

The judge concludes that the plaintiff's claim for partition by sale is well-taken and grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings. The judge also declines to rule on the plaintiff's request for the appointment of a referee to effectuate the partition, as this is a discretionary issue that is not properly before the court at this time.
