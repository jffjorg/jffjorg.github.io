And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the dispute over the value of the Settlement reached between the parties. The Defendant, Sharpe Interior Systems, Inc., and the Plaintiff's new counsel, Elliss George, have different opinions on the value of the Settlement. The Plaintiff claims that Elliss George added substantial value to the Settlement by reducing other liens, resulting in a recovery of more than $2 million. However, the Judge notes that the Plaintiff signed the Settlement before Elliss George's involvement, and therefore, the Plaintiff's ratification of the Settlement is not informed by the value added by Elliss George. The Judge also references a quote from Justice Kaus, stating that dicta from the California Supreme Court should be followed. The Court will consider these arguments at the future hearing.
