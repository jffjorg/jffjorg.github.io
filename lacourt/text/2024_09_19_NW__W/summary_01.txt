Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to transfer the case to the proper venue, the Superior Court of California for the County of Imperial. The defendant, Mervat Kelada, argued that the case should be transferred because she lives in Imperial County and the claims underlying the petition arose and occurred there. The defendant also claimed that the retainer agreement was entered into in Imperial County and that she is a resident of the county. The judge agreed with the defendant, stating that the plaintiff's choice of venue is presumptively correct, but the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that venue is not proper there. The judge found that the defendant had met this burden and that the case should be transferred. The judge also ordered the plaintiff to pay the costs of transfer.
