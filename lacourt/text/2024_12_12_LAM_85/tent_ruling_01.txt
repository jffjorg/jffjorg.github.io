  Case Number:  23STCV27768    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2024    Dept:  85 
Medley
Opportunity Fund II and PhenixFIN Corporation v. POINT.360, 23STCV27768


Tentative decision on applications
for right to attach order: granted




 
 




Plaintiffs Medley Opportunity Fund II (“MOF II” or “Medley”)
and PhenixFIN Corporation (“PFX”) apply for a right to attach order against Defendant
POINT.360 in the amount of $8,513,242.33.
The court has read and considered the moving papers,
opposition, and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Complaint 
Plaintiffs filed the Complaint against Defendant POINT.360
on November 13, 2023, alleging claims for breach of term loan agreement and
promissory notes.  The Complaint alleges
in pertinent part as follows.  
Pursuant to a term loan agreement dated as of July 8, 2015
(the "Term Loan Agreement"), Plaintiffs agreed to extend $6 million
in term loans to Point.360.  
Pursuant to a security agreement dated as of July 8, 2015
(the "Security Agreement"), Point.360 granted a security interest to
Plaintiffs in all of Point.360's assets other than its receivables and real
property (and the direct proceeds thereof) (the “Collateral”).  Plaintiffs perfected their security interests
in the Collateral.  (The Term Loan
Agreement and the Security Agreement are collectively referred to as the “Loan
Documents”.)  
In addition to the Loan Documents, Point.360 executed a
Warrant to Purchase Shares of Common Stock of Point.360 dated as of July 2015,
by and between Point.360 and MCC and a Warrant to Purchase Shares of Common
Stock of Point.360 dated as of July 2015, by and between Point.360 and MOF II
(collectively, the “Warrants”). The Warrants were cancelled pursuant to
Point.360’s Second Amended Chapter 11 Plan as Modified in Point.360’s Chapter
11 bankruptcy proceeding filed as Case No. 2:17-bk-22432 (the “Bankruptcy
Case”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court, Central District of California,
Los Angeles Division, which was confirmed pursuant to a bankruptcy court order
entered on June 11, 2019.  
Under the Term Loan Agreement, Medley provided $6 million in
cash in “Term Loans” to Point.360.  The Term
Loan Agreement provided for a “Closing Date Term Loan” of $1 million and
additional “Delayed Draw Term Loans” of up to $5 million in total.  During the year following the closing of the
Term Loan Agreement, Point.360 borrowed all $5 million of the Delayed Draw Term
Loans in a series of draws.  
The Term Loans matured on July 8, 2020.  Pursuant to Section 16 of the Term Loan
Agreement, Point.360 was obligated to pay to Plaintiffs the principal balance
of the outstanding Term Loans together with any accrued interest.  Point.360 did not repay the Term Loans or any
other amounts owing under the Loan Documents on the maturity date.  
On July 9, 2020, Plaintiffs provided Point.360 with a notice
of default.  Pursuant to the notice of default,
Plaintiffs gave Point.360 notice that it had elected to charge an additional
2.00% interest on all amounts outstanding under the loan documents.  
On August 5, 2022, Plaintiffs provided Point.360 with
another formal demand for payment of the amounts due and owing under the Loan
Documents.  To this date, Point.360 has
never made a payment to Plaintiffs on its obligations under the Loan
Documents.  
As of September 30, 2023, Point.360 owed Plaintiffs
$11,837,464.60.  In addition to principal
and interest owing under the Term Loan Agreement, pursuant to the Term Loan
Agreement Point.360 agreed “to pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
expenses, legal and/or otherwise paid or incurred by Plaintiffs in endeavoring
to collect Point.360’s obligations.  Over
the course of six years of bankruptcy litigation and appellate practice,
Plaintiffs have incurred over $3.1 million in legal fees and expenses. 
As of September 30, 2023, the total amount Point.360 owed to
Plaintiffs under the Loan Documents, inclusive of principal, interest, fees,
and expenses, was in excess of $14,900,000. 

 
2. Course of Proceedings
On November 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the Complaint. 
On February 5, 2024, Defendant filed an Answer.  
 
B. Applicable Law
Attachment is a
prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the defendant’s
assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the outcome of the
trial of the action.  See Whitehouse
v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et seq.)
that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v. Appellate
Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536.  See
Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1108,
1115.  As the attachment statutes are
purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner, (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 879, 882.
A writ of attachment
may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which
is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the
claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred
dollars ($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is “readily ascertainable” where the
amount due may be clearly ascertained from the contract and calculated by
evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated is not determinative.  CIT Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v.
Super DVD, Inc., (“CIT”) (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41
(attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for lease of
commercial equipment).
All property within
California of a corporation, association, or partnership is subject to
attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
The plaintiff may
apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the order and
serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the application,
and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
The notice of the
application and the application may be made on Judicial Council forms (Optional
Forms AT-105, 115).  The application must
be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the facts presented
would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the attachment is
based.  CCP §484.030.  
Where the defendant
is a corporation, a general reference to “all corporate property which is
subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure
Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP
§484.020(e).  Where the defendant is a
partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to “all property
of the partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject to
attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010”
is sufficient.  CCP §484.020(e).  A specific description of property is not
required for corporations and partnerships as they generally have no exempt
property.  Bank of America v. Salinas Nissan,
Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
A defendant who
opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of opposition and
supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not later than five
court days prior to the date set for hearing. 
CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of
opposition may be made on a Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155).  
The plaintiff may
file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for the
hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
At the hearing, the
court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right to attach order
and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is exempt from
attachment.  The defendant may appear the
hearing.  CCP §484.050(h).  The court generally will evaluate the
attachment application based solely on the pleadings and supporting affidavits
without taking additional evidence.  Bank
of America, supra, 207 Cal.App.3d at 273.  A verified complaint may be used in lieu of
or in addition to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts.  CCP §482.040. 
The plaintiff has the burden of proof, and the court is not required to
accept as true any affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See Bank of America, supra, at
271, 273.
The court may issue
a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff shows all of
the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is one on which
an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the plaintiff has established
the probable validity of the claim (CCP §484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is
sought for no purpose other than the recovery on the subject claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be secured by the attachment is greater
than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
A claim has
“probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will
recover on that claim.  CCP §481.190.  In determining this issue, the court must
consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties.  Kemp Bros. Construction, Inc. v. Titan
Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474, 1484.  The court does not determine whether the
claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial and is not
affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
Except in unlawful
detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the sum of (1)
the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff, and (2)
any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and any allowable
attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110. 
CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak Construction, (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must
be reduced by the sum of (1) the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has
in a money judgment against plaintiff, (2) the amount claimed in a
cross-complaint or affirmative defense and shown would be subject to attachment
against the plaintiff, and (3) the value of any security interest held by the
plaintiff in the defendant’s property, together with the amount by which the
acts of the plaintiff (or a prior holder of the security interest) have
decreased that security interest’s value. 
CCP §483.015(b); see also CCP §483.010(b) (“an attachment may not be
issued on a claim which is secured by any interest in real property arising
from agreement, statute, or other rule of law…However, an attachment may be
issued where the claim was originally so secured but, without any act of the
plaintiff or the person to whom the security was given, the security has become
valueless or has decreased in value to less than the amount then owing on the
claim).  A defendant claiming that the
amount to be secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative
defense must make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an
attachment against the plaintiff.
Before the issuance
of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an undertaking to
pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any wrongful
attachment by the plaintiff in the action. 
CCP §489.210.  The undertaking
ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If
the defendant objects, the court may increase the amount of undertaking to the
amount determined as the probable recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP §489.220. 
The court also has inherent authority to increase the amount of the
undertaking sua sponte.  North
Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
 
C. Statement of Facts
1. Plaintiffs’ Evidence[1]

Between July 9, 2015 and April 26, 2016, Plaintiffs provided
Defendant with $6 million in Term Loans, pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement.
Compl., ¶¶12 and 28; admitted as true, Verified Answer, ¶3(b). Pursuant to
Section 16 of the Term Loan Agreement, Point.360 was obligated to “pay to
[Plaintiffs] the principal balance of the outstanding Term Loans together with
any accrued interest and other amounts payable hereunder or under any other
Loan Document on the Maturity Date.”  Compl.,
¶16; admitted as true, Verified Answer, ¶3(b). 
Defendant has never made a payment to Plaintiffs under the
Loan Documents.  Compl., ¶19; admitted as
true Answer, ¶¶3(b). 
On October 10, 2017, Defendant filed a petition for relief
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Case.  Compl., ¶20; admitted as true, Verified
Answer, ¶ 3(b).  Defendant objected to
Plaintiffs’ claims in connection with the Term Loan Agreement by commencing an
adversary proceeding in the Bankruptcy Case (the “Adversary Proceeding”).  On May 1, 2019, Defendant filed its First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) for (1) Mandatory Subordination; (2) Objection to
Claim; and (3) Lien Avoidance whereby Defendant objected to Plaintiffs claims
under the Term Loan Agreement.  Compl.,
¶22; Admitted as true, Verified Answer, ¶3(b). 
On January 26, 2021 Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment
in the Adversary Proceeding. Compl., ¶25; Admitted as true, Verified Answer,
¶3(b).  On July 2, 2021, the bankruptcy court
granted Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and entered its order and
Judgment in favor of Plaintiffs on all claims for relief.  Compl., ¶26, Exs. 15, 16; Admitted as true,
Verified Answer, ¶3(b).  Also on July 2,
2021, the bankruptcy court entered its Findings of Uncontroverted Facts and
Conclusions of Law.  Compl., ¶27, Ex. 17;
Admitted as true, Verified Answer, ¶ 3(b). 
In addition to ruling against each of Defendant’s objections
to Plaintiffs’ claims arising under the Term Loan Agreement, the bankruptcy court
made the following specific findings of uncontroverted facts: 
2.  Under the Term
Loan Agreement, Medley provided $6 million in cash in Term Loans to Point.360. 
16. On June 11, 2019, the bankruptcy court entered the
Confirmation Order confirming the Debtor Plan. 
17. The Debtor Plan provided for the reinstatement of the
Term Loans pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement and related Loan Documents and
that Medley’s liens and secured claims were unimpaired under sections 1124(1)
and (2) of the Bankruptcy Code. 
24. On July 8, 2020, the Term Loans matured. 
25. As of July 9, 2020, the outstanding indebtedness under
the Term Loan Agreement and related Loan Documents was an aggregate principal
amount of $8,501,325.59, plus $11,916.74 in accrued and unpaid interest. 
26. Point.360, to date, has not paid Medley the outstanding
indebtedness under the Term Loan Agreement and related Loan Documents. Compl.,
¶28; admitted as true, Verified Answer, ¶¶3(b). 
Plaintiffs seek an attachment solely for the purpose of
recovering on their claims against Defendant under the Term Loan Agreement.  App. (Item 4); Lorber Decl., ¶5.  
When PFX entered into the Term Loan Agreement and made its
loans to Point.360, it was licensed as a Finance Lender with the California
Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (the “DFPI”).  Lorber Decl., ¶6.  
On April 16, 2021, the DFPI issued an Order Summarily
Revoking Finance Lender and/or Broker License(s) Pursuant to Financial Code section
22715 on account of PFX’s failure to file Annual Reports with the CFPI (the
"CFPI Order").  Lorber Decl.,
¶7.  At the time, PFX had already ceased
to engage in finance lender activities in California.  Lorber Decl., ¶7.  At all times since, PFX has complied with the
CFPI Order.  Lorber Decl., ¶7.  
MOF II has never conducted any activities pursuant  to Financial Code sections 22340 and 22600 in
connection with the Term Loan Agreement to Defendant.  Green Decl., ¶6.  MOF II has never sold any of the promissory
notes evidencing Defendant’s obligation to repay the loans made by MOF II, nor
any portion thereof, to any institutional investors or any other person.  Green Decl., ¶6.  MOF II continues to own 100% of the made to
Defendant.  Green Decl., ¶6.  
 
2. Defendant’s Evidence 
a. MVF Purchase 
On July 9th, 2015, Defendant Point.360 purchased the assets
of Modern VideoFilm, Inc. (“MVF”) from PFX.[2]  Bagerdjian Decl., ¶3.  PFX represented that the MVF assets were
projected to generate annual revenues, and earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), of $22.0 million, and $1.9 million,
respectively.  Bagerdjian Decl., ¶3.  The Loan Agreements were drafted by PFX
without financial forecasts.  Bagerdjian
Decl., ¶3.  The MVF assets grossly
underperformed compared to Medley’s forecast, generating just $16.0 million in
revenue with an EBITDA loss of $5.2 million. 
Bagerdjian Decl., ¶3.  The MVF
assets’ poor performance ultimately forced Point.360 to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy
in November 2017.  Bagerdjian Decl.,
¶3.   
As part of the MVF purchase, PFX provided Point.360 up to
$6.0 million of financing, bearing interest at a rate of approximately 6.28%.  Bagerdjian Decl., ¶4.  Point.360’s previous lender, Summit Financial
Resources, provided capital at a rate of 12.95%.  Bagerdjian Decl., ¶4.  Prior to the MVF purchase, Point.360’s EBITDA
was negative $521,000 and negative $1,267,000 for fiscal years ending 2014, and
2015, respectively.  Bagerdjian Decl.,
¶4.  
During POINT.360’s conversations with James Feeley
(“Feeley”) on behalf of PFX, Feeley reiterated that he needed two board seats
of POINT.360 to appease PFX’s credit committee. 
Bagerdjian Decl., ¶6.  He also
expressed that PFX would be very much involved in the future growth of POINT.360.  Bagerdjian Decl., ¶6.  Feeley reiterated that his credit committee
knew POINT.360 was unable to pay the loan, and therefore they will be very much
involved with Point.360’s management’s decision-making.  Bagerdjian Decl., ¶6.  Furthermore, Feeley asked to change the MVF
deal structure to an asset purchase rather than a share purchase, and to extend
indemnification to POINT.360 in the event lawsuits materialized against it.  Bagerdjian Decl., ¶6.  In addition, concessions were offered to
settle ongoing issues with MVF’s landlord. 
Bagerdjian Decl., ¶6.  But for
these assurances that the debt would be converted into equity, and that PFX would
be partnering with POINT.360 to make the MVF acquisition work, POINT.360 would
not have agreed to the MVF transaction. 
Bagerdjian Decl., ¶6.  
PFX insisted that it be provided two board seats on Point.360’s
Board of Directors, in addition to warrants to purchase Point.360’s stock as a
condition to closing the MVF asset purchase. 
Bagerdjian Decl., ¶7.  
As part of PFX’s inducement to Defendant to purchase the MVF
assets, PFX advocated that Point.360’s publicly traded entity could be utilized
as a vehicle to acquire other assets, and ultimately convert the original $6.0
million of debt to equity with the understanding that the initial loan would
not be repaid.  Bagerdjian Decl.,
¶8.  Point.360 presented to PFX and to its
Board multiple acquisition targets, but a change of management at PFX led to it
deciding to pass on all acquisitions presented by Point.360.  Bagerdjian Decl., ¶8.  Point.360 was unable to acquire other
financing to facilitate the acquisition of other assets.  Bagerdjian Decl., ¶8.  PFX subsequently resigned its two seats on Point.360’s
Board of Directors.  Bagerdjian Decl.,
¶8.  
 
b. The DFPI Order 
On April 19, 2022, the DFPI revoked PFX’s finance lender
and/or broker license(s) pursuant to Financial Code Section 22715.  Landau Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1.  
 
c. Irreparable Harm 
As of November 27th, 2024, Point.360 employs 154 full-time
employees, and dozens of part-time employees and freelancers, that are paid
approximately $1.2 million in wages and benefits.  Bagerdjian Decl., ¶9.  If PFX’s attachment is levied upon Point.360’s
cash flow at any time during a given month, it will necessarily attach to funds
constituting wages and benefits payable to these employees.  Bagerdjian Decl., ¶9.  Point.360’s business will not be sustainable
to the trial date.  Bagerdjian Decl.,
¶9.  Any interruption to payroll will be
devastating to its business and cause immediate closure.  Bagerdjian Decl., ¶9.  
 
D. Analysis
Plaintiffs seeks right to attach orders against Defendant Point.360 in the amount of $8,513,242.33. 
Point.360 opposes.
 
1. Procedural Issues
Defendant Point.360 objects that
Plaintiffs cannot rely on their verified Complaint.  Opp. at 2-3. 
Point.360 is correct.  Pursuant to
CCP section 446, a corporate officer can verify a complaint but it “shall not
otherwise be considered as an affidavit or declaration establishing the facts
therein alleged.”  See Lorber
Industries v. Turbulence, Inc., (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 532, 536
(cross-complaint verified by corporation’s president could not be used as
evidence).  Plaintiffs are saved,
however, by the admissions in Point.360’s Answer.  In other words, the verified Complaint is not
relied on as evidence but rather as allegations, and Point.360’s admissions in
the Answer are the evidence.
Point.360 also objects to the
declaration of Eric Green (“Green”) that is part of Plaintiffs’ application as
well as the declarations of Green and David Lorber (“Lorber”).  Opp. at 3. 
The court has ruled on Point.360’s evidentiary objections.
There is another problem with the declarations.  With the exception of the Green declaration
that is part of the application and the Declaration of Lewis R. Landau, the other
declarations submitted by the parties do not meet the requirements of CCP
section 2015.5 that a declaration be made under penalty of perjury and (a) state
the date and place of execution if executed in California and (b) if executed either
inside or outside California, state the date and that it is made under penalty
of perjury under the laws of California. 
Plaintiffs’ declarations (Green and Lorber) were executed in New York
and do not state they were made under California’s perjury law.  Point.360’s supporting Declaration of Haig S.
Bagerdjian does not state its place of execution and states that it is made
under the perjury laws of the United States, not California.   As neither side objected on these grounds,
any objection is waived.
2. A Claim Based on a Contract and on Which Attachment
May Be Based 
            A writ of attachment may be issued
only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which is based upon a
contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is
a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred dollars
($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  
            Plaintiffs’ claim is a claim for
money based upon a debt arising out of express contract and it exceeds $500.
             
            3. An Amount Due That is Fixed
and Readily Ascertainable  
            A claim is “readily ascertainable”
where the damages may be readily ascertained by reference to the contract and
the basis of the calculation appears to be reasonable and definite.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (“CIT”) (2004)
115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41.  The fact that the damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a
standard by which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by
which the damages can be determined by proof.  Id. (citations
omitted). 
The amount sought for attachment is $8,513,242.33, which consists of the
total amount Point.360 owed to Plaintiffs under the Term Loan Documents,
inclusive of principal, interest, fees and expenses.  Plaintiffs seek a writ of attachment in the
amount owing as of July 9, 2020, of $8,513,242.33 as established by the bankruptcy
court.  The $8,513,242.33 sought is
fixed and readily ascertainable.  
            3. Probability of Success 
            A claim has “probable validity”
where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will recover on that
claim.  CCP §481.190.  In determining this issue, the court must
consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties.  Kemp
Bros. Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th
1474, 1484.  The court does not determine whether the claim is actually
valid; that determination will be made at trial and is not affected by the
decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
Between July 9, 2015 and April 26, 2016, Plaintiffs provided
Defendant with $6 million in Term Loans, pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement.
Compl., ¶¶12 and 28; admitted as true, Verified Answer, ¶3(b). Pursuant to
Section 16 of the Term Loan Agreement, Point.360 was obligated to “pay to
[Plaintiffs] the principal balance of the outstanding Term Loans together with
any accrued interest and other amounts payable hereunder or under any other
Loan Document on the Maturity Date.” 
Compl., ¶16; admitted as true, Verified Answer, ¶3(b). 
Defendant has never made a payment to Plaintiffs under the
Loan Documents.  Compl., ¶19; admitted as
true Answer, ¶¶3(b). 
On October 10, 2017, Defendant filed a petition for relief
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Case. 
Compl., ¶20; admitted as true, Verified Answer, ¶ 3(b).  On January 26, 2021 Plaintiffs filed a motion
for summary judgment in the Adversary Proceeding. Compl., ¶25; Admitted as
true, Verified Answer, ¶3(b).  On July 2,
2021, the bankruptcy court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and
entered its order and Judgment in favor of Plaintiffs on all claims for
relief.  Compl., ¶26, Exs. 15, 16; Admitted
as true, Verified Answer, ¶3(b).  
In addition to ruling against each of Defendant’s objections
to Plaintiffs’ claims arising under the Term Loan Agreement, the bankruptcy
court made the following specific findings of uncontroverted facts: 
2.  Under the Term
Loan Agreement, Medley provided $6 million in cash in Term Loans to Point.360. 
16. On June 11, 2019, the bankruptcy court entered the
Confirmation Order confirming the Debtor Plan. 
17. The Debtor Plan provided for the reinstatement of the
Term Loans pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement and related Loan Documents and
that Medley’s liens and secured claims were unimpaired under sections 1124(1)
and (2) of the Bankruptcy Code. 
24. On July 8, 2020, the Term Loans matured. 
25. As of July 9, 2020, the outstanding indebtedness under
the Term Loan Agreement and related Loan Documents was an aggregate principal
amount of $8,501,325.59, plus $11,916.74 in accrued and unpaid interest. 
26. Point.360, to date, has not paid Medley the outstanding
indebtedness under the Term Loan Agreement and related Loan Documents. Compl.,
¶28; admitted as true, Verified Answer, ¶¶3(b). 
            Plaintiffs
argue that the bankruptcy court’s Judgment and findings establish Plaintiffs’
claims under the Term Loan Agreement and are binding on Point.360.  All of Point.360’s affirmative defenses in
its Answer, except for two, are matters that were or could have been raised in
the Adversary Proceeding.  Verified
Answer, Affirmative Defenses, ¶¶1-20 and 23-24.  Given that Plaintiffs obtained summary
judgment “on all claims for relief” (Compl., ¶26; admitted as true, Verified
Answer, ¶3(b)), they have been disposed of and Point.360 is precluded from
asserting them again in the present action.  Pl. Mem. at 5.
Point.360’s first additional affirmative defense is that the
relief sought in the Complaint is the subject matter of another action pending
between the parties on the same cause of action. Answer, Affirmative Defenses,
¶22.  This is a reference to Point.360’s
appeals of the bankruptcy court’s Judgment to the federal district court and
then the Ninth Circuit.  The Bankruptcy
Case was closed upon the filing of a final decree and order closing case
entered on December 12, 2021. Point.360 never sought a stay of the bankruptcy court’s
Judgment and the Bankruptcy Court’s Judgment always was final for all purposes.
 Moreover, Defendant lost both appeals
and no other actions are presently pending between the parties at this time.  Pl. Mem. at 6.[3]
Point.360 argues that Plaintiffs fail to reduce the amount
to be secured by attachment as required by CCP section 483.015(b).  Plaintiffs claim a security interest in
Point.360’s property.  Compl., ¶9, Exs.
3-8.  Yet, they have failed too offer
evidence of the net unsecured amount due.  
Opp. at 4.
Point.360 misreads CCP section 483.015(b)(4), which provides
that the amount to be secured shall be reduced by the value of any security
interest in the property of the defendant held by the plaintiff to
secure the defendant’s indebtedness”. (emphasis added).  Per the Security Agreement, Plaintiffs’ claim
a security interest in the Collateral, which is in Point.360’s possession and
not held by them.   No reduction under
CCP section 483.015(b)(4) is required.
Point.360 next relies on a fraudulent inducement claim.   It argues that it was fraudulently induced
to enter into the Term Loan Agreement to purchase MVF by PFX’s assurances that
the debt would be converted into equity, and that PFX would be partnering with
POINT.360 to make the MVF acquisition work. 
Bagerdjian Decl., ¶6.  But for
these assurances, POINT.360 would not have agreed to the MVF transaction.  Bagerdjian Decl., ¶6.  
This argument runs afoul of Plaintiffs’ point that any new
issue concerning the validity of the Term Loan Agreement is barred by res
judicata.  Pl. Mem. at 8-9.
Res judicata, also known as claim preclusion, prevents
relitigation of the same cause of action in a second suit between the same
parties or parties in privity with them. 
Mycogen Corp. v. Monsanto Co., (“Mycogen”) (2002) 28
Cal.4th 888, 896.  Res judicata serves to prevent inconsistent rulings, promote
judicial economy by preventing repetitive litigation, and protect against
vexatious litigation.  Federation of
Hillside and Canyon Associations v. City of Los Angeles, (“Federation”)
(2004) 126 Cal.App.4th 1180, 1205.  A
judgment on the merits is res judicata and
is conclusive on all issues that were raised or could have been raised in the
prior proceeding.  Id. at 1205.  Res
judicata applies if (1) the decision in the prior proceeding is final and
on the merits, (2) the present proceeding is on the same cause of action as the
prior proceeding, and (3) the parties in the present proceeding (or parties in
privity with them) were parties to the prior proceeding.  Id. at 1202.  In order to avoid piecemeal litigation, a
judgment is conclusive not only as to the issues actually decided, but those
that might have been raised as well.  Thibodeau
v. Crum, (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 749, 754; Sych v. Insurance Co. of North
America, (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 330.  Res
judicata would appear to bar Point.360’s defense of fraud in the inducement
as it is an issue that could have been raised in the Adversary Proceeding.  Point.36 does not address this issue.
Point.360’s other affirmative defense is that Plaintiffs are
barred from pursuing their claim by the DFPI’s action revoking their
licenses.  Pursuant to the orders of the
DFPI, Plaintiff MOF II was ordered to discontinue all activity conducted
pursuant to Financial Code section 22600 within 60 days of April 19, 2022.  Landau Decl., Ex. 1.  Financial Code section 22600 includes the
“collection of payments or the performance of services with respect to those
notes.” To the extent Plaintiffs are collecting payments on behalf of
institutional investors, the order prohibits their collection of payments on
the alleged notes.  Opp. at 6.
The Lorber and Green declarations do not resolve the issue.
These declarations admit that the Plaintiffs were engaged in finance lender
activities in California at the time the loan was made in 2015.  Thus, the loan to Point.360 was made by a
licensed finance lender.  While Plaintiffs
later discontinued finance lender activities in California, they are still
collecting on the loan to Point.360 that was made when licensed. The DFPI order
directed Plaintiffs to discontinue all activity conducted pursuant to section
22600, including “collection of payments or the performance of services with
respect to those notes.” Plaintiffs are in violation of the DFPI orders by
continuing their collection litigation against Point.360.  Opp. at 6.
The DFPI order revoked Plaintiff MOF II’s license and
ordered it to discontinue making or brokering any loan made pursuant to the
California Financing Law (Fin. Code §22000 et seq.) and also to discontinue all
activity conducted pursuant to Financial Code sections 22340 and 22600.  Landau Ex. 1. 
Financial Code sections 22340 and 22600 permit a licensee to sell
promissory notes to institutional investors and to make agreements with
institutional investors for the collection of payments or the performance of
services with respect to those notes. 
Fin. Code §§ 22340(a), (c), 22600(a), (c).  Plaintiffs never sold the Term Loan Agreement
to institutional investors and never made agreements with institutional
investors to collect payments from Point.360. 
Plaintiffs are not in violation of the DFPI’s order.
Plaintiffs have shown a probability of success on their
claim.
  
4. Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose¿ 
            Attachment must not be sought for a
purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which attachment is based.¿
CCP §484.090(a)(3).  Plaintiffs seek only
to attach a portion of the amount Point.360 owes under the Term Loan Documents
and therefore seek attachment for a proper purpose.
 
            5. Exemption
            Point.360 purports to
make a  claim of exemption for unpaid
earnings under CCP section 487.020(c).
            Compensation
payable by an employer to an employee for personal services performed by such
employee, whether denominated as wages, salary, commission, bonus, or
otherwise, is exempt from attachment.  CCP §487.020(c); CCP §706.011(b).  This provision exempts a debtor employee from
attachment of earnings, not an employer.
 
            6. Bond
            Point.360 seeks an
undertaking in an amount no less than $1.2 million to protect it against
damages for the wrongful issuance of the writ. CCP Section 489.210 states,
“Before issuance of a writ of attachment…the plaintiff shall file an
undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any
wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the action.” “Wrongful attachment” is
defined in CCP Section 490.010 as, among other things, “levy under a writ of
attachment or the service of a temporary protective order in an action in which
the plaintiff does not recover judgment.” CCP §490.010.
If a writ of attachment is granted, Point.360’s business
will not be sustainable up to the trial date presently scheduled for January
21, 2025.  Point.360 sells the services
of its employees. Any interruption to payroll will be devastating to its business
and cause immediate closure. The closure will cause all of Point.360’s
customers to find a new service provider. Thus, the damages arising from
wrongful attachment are a minimum of $1.2 million in payroll before the trial
date.  Opp. at 8.
The undertaking
ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If
the defendant objects, the court may increase the amount of undertaking to the
amount determined as the probable recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP §489.220. 
The court also has inherent authority to increase the amount of the
undertaking sua sponte.  North
Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.



In considering the defendant’s evidence on his or her
“probable recovery from a wrongful attachment,” the trial court does not simply
assume that the attachment is wrongful for purposes of setting the
undertaking.  Id. at 689.  Rather, the trial court has discretion to
consider the strength of the plaintiff’s claim in setting the undertaking for
the defendant’s “probable recovery.”  A
showing that the plaintiff’s chances of recovery are barely more than
“more-likely-than-not” should result in an undertaking that is virtually the
full amount of the defendant’s probable loss. 
If the plaintiff makes a strong showing, however, the undertaking need
not be the full amount of the defendant’s probable loss.  Ibid. 
In this way, the remedy of attachment provides the plaintiff with
security up to the amount of his or her claim at an undertaking cost which is
not prohibitive, while affording the defendant an undertaking in an amount that
will adequately satisfy his or her damages for wrongful attachment.  Id. at 690. 
Point.360 shows irreparable harm from attachment, but
Plaintiffs have a strong showing of probability of success.  The undertaking is increased to $50,000.
 
E. Conclusion
Plaintiffs’
application for a right to attach order against Defendant Point.360 in the amount of $8,513,242.33 is granted.  Plaintiffs fail to submit a proposed right to
attach order and must do so in the next two court days or it will be deemed
waived.  No writ shall issue until
Plaintiffs post a $50,000 bond and provide evidence of posting to Point.360’s
counsel.
