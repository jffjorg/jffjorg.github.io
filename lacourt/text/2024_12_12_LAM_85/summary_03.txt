Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the respondent's (Steve Gordon, Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles) motion for judgment under CCP section 1094. The respondent argued that the petition for judicial review was untimely filed, as it was filed over a year after the DMV's decision was made. However, the judge ruled that the DMV failed to notify the petitioner (Ida P. Fung) of her right to seek judicial review, as required by Vehicle Code section 14401(b). Therefore, the statute of limitations did not begin to run, and the petition is not untimely. The judge also noted that the DMV's failure to comply with Vehicle Code section 14401(b) is fatal to the motion for judgment.
