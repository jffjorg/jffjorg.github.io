 Case Number:  24STCP01636    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2024    Dept:  85 
Ida P. Fung v. Steve Gordon, 
24STCP01636 

Tentative decision on motion for judgment: denied 



 
 
Respondent Steve Gordon, Director for the Department of
Motor Vehicles (“DMV”), moves for judgment pursuant to CCP section 1094. 
The court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition,
and reply and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Petition
a. Background 
Petitioner Fung commenced this proceeding on May 21, 2024,
alleging a cause of action for administrative mandamus.  The verified Petition alleges in pertinent
part as follows. 
On October 11, 2021, Sierra Madre Police Department (“SMPD”)
Officer Raymond So (“So”) contacted Petitioner Ida P. Fung (“Fung”) and cited
her for a misdemeanor hit-and-run. 
Officer So made a report regarding the contact on DMV form DS-427.  Officer So confiscated Fung’s driver’s
license, even though she explained that the vehicle involved in the incident
was not operated or owned by her.  Fung
explained that she owned a similar looking vehicle, but her vehicle did not
have the significant damage described regarding the subject’s vehicle.  
Based on the incident, charges were brought against Fung under
Vehicle Code section 20002, which pertains to damage to property, not
persons.  These charges contradicted
Officer So’s report regarding the subject vehicle attempting to hit a person as
opposed to property.  Ultimately, the
charges against Fung were dismissed during a jury trial on January 10,
2023.  
 
b. The DMV Hearing
Fung timely requested a DMV hearing, and the first hearing
occurred on March 7, 2022.  At the
hearing the DMV marked five exhibits: (1) Order of Suspension/Revocation, (2)
Law Enforcement Referral dated 10/11/2021, (3) DMV Driver Knowledge Test, (4)
DMV Vision Test, and (5) a Driver Medical Evaluation dated 2/2/2022.  Officer So did not testify at this hearing or
the other hearing held by the DMV. 
The second hearing occurred on February 2, 2023.  Between the hearings, Fung provided the DMV
with a satisfactory physical and mental evaluation, a satisfactory vision
evaluation, and a passed score on the Driver Knowledge Test.  At the second hearing, Fung testified that
the only vehicle she owns and operates did not have any significant damage and
that she was not involved in the incident for which her license was
suspended.  Furthermore, the criminal charges
filed against her in LASC No. PAS2PD25158-01 had been dismissed during a jury
trial on January 10, 2023.  Hearing
Officer Maria Herrera either did not understand this fact or arbitrarily
ignored it.  
 
c. The Decision 
On March 13, 2023, Hearing Officer Herrera issued a Notice
of Decision and Finding (“decision”) which maintained the October 18, 2021
suspension of Fung’s driver’s license.  The
decision was improper because Fung was subjected to an unlawful and prolonged
seizure of her driver’s license without probable cause; the criminal court
dismissed the misdemeanor case against Fung months prior to the decision, and
the Hearing Officer’s summary dismissal of Fung’s unrefuted and reasonable
testimony was not warranted.    
 
2. Course of
Proceedings
On May 21, 2024, Petitioner filed the Petition for Writ of
Mandate. 
On June 28, 2024, Respondent filed an Answer. 
 
B. Applicable Law
A motion for judgment under CCP section 1094 is a mechanism
to obtain a streamlined review on a particular undisputed issue based on
undisputed facts or the administrative record. 
Dunn v. County of Santa Barbara, (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th
1281, 1293.  See also 2 CEB California Administrative Mandamus §13.23 (3d ed.
2007).  
            When
a question of fact is raised by the respondent’s answer, the petitioner has the
right to countervail it with proof.  CCP
§1091; Lassen v. City of Alameda, (1957) 150 Cal.App.2d 44, 47.  If the facts are undisputed or only a
question of law is raised, the court may hear the matter upon the papers filed
and argument.  Id. at 47.  The petitioner also may waive the right to
present evidence and the matter may be heard under CCP section 1094.  Ibid. 
If a question of fact is raised by the answer, a CCP section 1094 motion
is not appropriate, and the matter must be heard at trial.  See
id. at 48.
            In
denying a CCP section 1094 motion, the court may decide that the facts are
disputed and hence the motion is procedurally defective, or it may decide that
the undisputed facts/record show the moving party cannot prevail on that issue.   
 
C. Statement of
Facts
            Petitioner Fung is a California
resident with no significant violations or infractions on her 45-year driver’s
record.  AR 174-75.  
On October 11, 2021, Officer So cited Fung for a violation
of Vehicle Code section 20002, misdemeanor hit and run.  Officer So referred Fung to the DMV for
reexamination due to unsafe driving.  AR
173.  
            Fung
participated in the DMV reexamination process but did not successfully pass
reexamination due to an unsuccessful driver knowledge exam and vision exam. AR
2.  Therefore, on October 18, 2021, the
DMV suspended Fung’s driving privileges pursuant to Vehicle Code section 13953,
effective October 18, 2021.  AR 2.
            Fung
contested the suspension. Accordingly, on March 7, 2022, she appeared before a
Driver Safety Hearing Officer for a Lack of Knowledge/Lack of Skill Interview
or hearing to determine if her ability to operate a motor vehicle safely was
affected.  AR 149.  The examiner found that Fung numerous reckless
driving errors during the 27-minute road test evaluation.  AR 149-50.
            On
March 22, 2022, DMV Hearing Officer D. Cotton sustained the suspension of Fung’s
privilege to operate a motor vehicle.  AR
22-24.
            Fung
challenged this decision.   On February
2, 2023, a second hearing was held before a Hearing Officer Herrera regarding
the suspension of Fung’s driving privileges. 
AR 3-5.  At the February 2, 2023
hearing, Fung reconfirmed her mailing address. 
AR 97-98.
            Hearing
Officer Herrera issued her decision on March 13, 2023, affirming the initial
suspension of Fung’s driving privileges. 
AR 3-5.  The Hearing Officer
considered the fact that Fung again failed a reexamination on March 9, 2023. AR
5.  
The March 13, 2023 decision did not notify Fung of her right
to judicial review and limitations deadline. 
See AR 3.  
            
Castro Declaration[1]
On March 13, 2023, Hearing Officer Herrera issued her
decision following a Lack of Knowledge/Lack of Skill interview, also referred
to as a hearing.  Castro Decl., ¶4.  
Also on March 13, 2023, the DMV served Fung by mail with the
decision.  Pursuant to the DMV’s
practice, the decision was mailed via regular United States mail.  Castro Decl., Ex. A; AR 3-5.  There is nothing in the DMV’s records that
would suggest the decision was not received by Fung soon after the date of
mailing.  Castro Decl., ¶5.
 
D. Analysis
Respondent DMV
contends that the Petition is barred by the statute of limitations.  Fung opposes.
Vehicle Code section 14401 provides: 
 
“(a) Any action brought
in a court of competent jurisdiction to review any order of the department
refusing, canceling, placing on probation, suspending, or revoking the
privilege of a person to operate a motor vehicle shall be commenced within 90
days from the date the order is noticed.”
(b) Upon final
completion of all administrative appeals, the person whose driving privilege
was refused, canceled, placed on probation, suspended, or revoked shall be
given written notice by the department of his or her right to a review by a
court pursuant to subdivision (a).” 
 
The failure to meet section 14401’s 90-day deadline is fatal
to an untimely filed petition. Sinetos v. Department of Motor Vehicles, (“Sinetos”)
(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 1172, 1175; see also Vitkievicz v. Valverde,
(“Vitkievicz”) (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1306, 1309 (affirming sustaining of
demurrer to petition as untimely under section 14401).
The DMV argues that
it served Fung with Hearing Officer Herrera’s decision on March 13, 2023.   Fung had 90 days from March 13, 2023—until
June 11, 2023—to challenge the DMV’s decision under section 14401(a).  She
did not timely file her Petition, doing so only on May 21, 2024, over one year
after the decision. The Petition is barred by the statute of limitations and the
DMV’s motion for judgment should be granted. 
Mot. at 3.
Fung’s response is
that the DMV did not give her notice of her right to seek judicial review and
the deadline to file a mandamus petition under CCP section 1094.6.  CCP section 1094.6(f) requires that “[i]n
making a final decision… the local agency shall provide notice to the party
that the time within which judicial review must be sought is governed by this
section.”  Without this notice, the
statute of limitations cannot begin to run.  Donnellan v. City of Novato, (2001) 86
Cal.App.4th 1097, 1102; El Dorado Palm Springs, Ltd. v. Rent
Review Commission, (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 335, 345.  Opp. at 4.
The DMV’s moving
papers misleadingly cropped the March 13, 2023 decision (Mot. at 4), but the
actual page shows that the Hearing Officer did not check a box that would
notify Fung of her right and deadline to file mandamus in superior court.  AR 3.  Opp.
at 4-5.  Fung anticipates that the DMV
may argue that the unchecked box is insignificant, but a petitioner should be
entitled to rely on this failure to conclude that no time limit applies, as
Fung did.  Opp. at 6-7.
Fung argues that, because
of this failure, the 90-day limitation period was never triggered.  She adds that the DMV’s citations to Sinetos,
supra, 150 Cal.App.3d at 1172, and Vitkievicz, supra, 202
Cal.App.4th at 1306, are distinguishable. 
Opp. at 7-8.
The Vitkievicz court upheld a trial court order
sustaining a demurrer after the petitioner claimed his petition was timely under
section 14401 because the time to act was extended five days for service by
mail under CCP section 1013.  202
Cal.App.4th at 1312-13.  The
notice of final decision stated: “You have a right to seek a court review of
this action provided you do so within 94 days of the mailing date on this
notice shown below.”  Id. at
1310.  The court held that the five-day
extension in CCP section 1013 applies only if a statue establishes thetime
within an act must be performed after “service of a document”.  Id. at 1313.  If a statute requires that an act must be
performed after the mailing of a document, CCP section 1013(a) does not extend
the act.  Id.  Section 14401 requires that the petition for
judicial review be commenced within 90 days after “the date the order is
noticed.”  Id.  Under Vehicle Code section 23, notice is
complete four days after deposit of the notice in the mail.  Id. at 1314.  Thus, the “order is noticed” four days after
mailing and the 90-day period then starts.  
Id.  The five-day extension
of CCP section 1013 does not apply.  Id.
In Sinetos, supra, 160 Cal.App.3d at 1172, the
court noted: “As required by statute, the [DMV’s] letter informed the plaintiff
of his right to commence judicial review within 90 days from the date such
order is noticed.  (Veh. Code, §14401, subd.
(a.)”.  Id. at 1174.  The court also cited Vehicle Code section
14401(b), which requires the DMV to give written notice of the right to review
pursuant to subdivision (a).  Id.
at 1174, n.2.  The court held that
Vehicle Code section 14401 makes no provision for an extension of time in which
to petition for judicial review, and the petition filed more than a month
beyond the 90-day limitations period was untimely.  Id. at 1175- 76. 
The DMV correctly replies that CCP section 1094.6 has no
application to this case.  The DMV is a
state agency and CCP section 1094.6 applies to local agencies.  CCP §1094.6(a) (f).  The statute of limitations for Fung’s case is
set forth in Vehicle Code section 14401. 
Opp. at 9.
However, Vehicle
Code section 14401(b) contains a similar provision to CCP section 1094.6,
requiring the DMV to notify Fung of her right to seek judicial review within 90
days.  The failure to provide the notice
required by Vehicle Code section 14401(b) negates accrual of the 90-day period
for the same reasons it does for CCP section 1094.6 petitions.  That is, “since [section 1094.6] adopted a
much shorter limitations period, it is crucial that the party have proper
notice.”  Donnellan v. City of Novato,
supra, 6 Cal.App.4th at 1105 (citation omitted).  The same is true for Vehicle Code section
14401(b).
The DMV attempts to show
compliance by noting that Hearing Officer Cotton’s March 13, 2022 decision did
properly notify Fung of her right to seek judicial review in 94 days.  AR 22-24. 
Reply at 4, 8.  
There are three
answers to this argument.  First, Vehicle
Code section 14401(b) requires that notice be given “[u]pon final
completion of all administrative appeals”. 
Fung’s final appeal was decided in Hearing Officer Herrera’s March 13,
2023 decision, and that is when notice should be given.  Second, the requisite notice must be given
for each appeal decision; the DMV cannot bootstrap from a previous
decision.  Third, Hearing Officer
Herrera’s failure to check the notice box misleads the reader to conclude that
the 94-day period does not apply.  
In sum, the DMV
failed to comply with Vehicle Code section 14401(b) for the March 13, 2023
decision and the statute of limitations did not begin to run.  The Petition is not untimely.[2]
 
F. Conclusion
The motion for
judgment is denied.
