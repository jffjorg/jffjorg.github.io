Demurrer
 
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a
matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In
testing the sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of
(1) the properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably
inferred from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) 
The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of
fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.App.4th 634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of a complaint, the plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts
sufficient to establish every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw v. California Physicians
Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) 
Where the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County of
Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case
"with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to
acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of
action.”  (Gressley v. Williams
(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) 
"Whether the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is
irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer." 
(Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605,
609–610.)  Under Code Civil Procedure §
430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is “uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s
factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently apprise a
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
 
Active Environmental Solutions, LLC and Joshua
Lingurar
 
Defendants demur to the third through sixth causes of
action on the ground that the causes of action fail to state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action.
 
At the outset, a review of the allegations of the SAC appear
to reveal that the third through sixth causes of action are essentially
premised upon this allegation: “Active Environmental Defendants purportedly had
Ms. Pleatman sign a written “Work Authorization” in which Active Environmental
agreed to perform all necessary environmental testing. However, Active
Environmental did not conduct all necessary environmental testing; in
particular, they did not perform mold testing.”  (SAC, ¶ 58.)  Plaintiffs’ opposition did not meaningfully
contest the fact that the third through sixth causes of action are based on
this single factual circumstance.
 
In addition, the Court notes that Defendants did not
previously demur to the fourth cause of action in the FAC. However, when a Plaintiff
files an amended complaint after an order sustaining a prior demurrer with
leave to amend, the amended pleading is considered as a new pleading.  A defendant may demurrer on any ground.  Goncharov v Uber Technols., Inc. (2018)
19 Cal.App.5th 1157, 1166–67.  In
addition, despite the fact that Defendants did not previously demur to this
cause of action, Defendants did not run afoul of CCP § 430.41(b) which states:
“A party demurring to a pleading that has been amended after a demurrer to an
earlier version of the pleading was sustained shall not demur to any portion of
the amended complaint, cross-complaint, or answer on grounds that could have
been raised by demurrer to the earlier version of the complaint,
cross-complaint, or answer.”  Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41(b). The grounds asserted herein could not have been asserted
earlier because the allegation noted above in paragraph 58 was not included in
the FAC. The FAC merely alleged that Defendants did not have a contractor’s
license.
 
Meet and
Confer
 
Defendants set forth a meet and confer declaration in
sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41 and CCP § 435.5.  (Decl., Keith A. Haskins.)
 
Demurrer
 
Third Cause of Action for Fraud 
 
The demurrer to the third cause of action is sustained
with 20 days leave to amend. Plaintiffs fail to state facts sufficient to state
the causes of action. 
 
“A complaint for fraud must allege the following
elements: (1) a knowingly false representation by the defendant; (2) an intent
to deceive or induce reliance; (3) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and
(4) resulting damages.”  Service by
Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816. “[T]he
elements of an action for fraud and deceit based on a concealment are: (1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he has known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.” Boschma v. Home Loan
Center, Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 230, 248.
 
“Every element of the cause of action for fraud must
be alleged in the proper manner and the facts constituting the fraud must be
alleged with sufficient specificity to allow defendant to understand fully the
nature of the charge made.”  Tarmann
v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.  Plaintiffs must state facts which “show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered.”  Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.
 
First, the entire premise of this cause of action is
lacking in sufficient facts because it is, at the outset, unclear whether
Defendants did or did not commit the act complained of. The use of the word
“purportedly” makes it unclear whether any alleged misrepresentation did or did
not occur. In fact, the use of this word makes it appear that Plaintiffs do not
even have personal knowledge of this allegation.  Second, even if the word “purportedly” is
eliminated, Plaintiffs still have not alleged specific facts as to how and by
what means the representations were made.  From the nature of the allegation, it is not
entirely clear whether the cause of action is simply based on the “purported”
written agreement itself, or, upon a separate oral representation.  In addition, Plaintiffs have not alleged
specific facts to meet the elements of knowledge of falsity, intent to deceive,
and justifiable reliance.  Plaintiffs
have only pled conclusions. 
 
Finally, to the extent that the cause of action does
appear to be premised upon the existence of a written agreement, Plaintiffs
have not alleged facts to demonstrate the existence of a duty separate and
apart from the duty contained within the agreement. “[C]onduct amounting to a
breach of contract becomes tortious only when it also violates a duty
independent of the contract arising from principles of tort law. An omission to
perform a contract obligation is never a tort, unless that omission is also an
omission of a legal duty.”  Erlich v.
Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 551 (internal citations and quotations
omitted).
 
Defendants’ demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend.
 
Fourth Cause of Action for Negligent Misrepresentation
and Fraud – Contractor Status
 
Defendants’ demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend. Plaintiffs fail to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action.
 
“The elements of negligent misrepresentation are (1)
the misrepresentation of a past or existing material fact, (2) without
reasonable ground for believing it to be true, (3) with intent to induce
another's reliance on the fact misrepresented, (4) justifiable reliance on the
misrepresentation, and (5) resulting damage. While there is some conflict in
the case law discussing the precise degree of particularity required in the
pleading of a claim for negligent misrepresentation, there is a consensus that
the causal elements, particularly the allegations of reliance, must be
specifically pleaded.” National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v.
Cambridge Integrated Services Group, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 35, 50
(internal citations and quotations omitted).
 
The cause of action fails to state sufficient facts
for the same reasons noted in the ruling to the demurrer to the third cause of
action. While the cause of action also makes reference to a lack of a
contractor’s license, it appears that Plaintiffs concede that this allegation
is directed to other Defendants and not these demurring Defendants.
 
Defendants’ demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend.
 
Fifth Cause of Action for IIED
 
Defendants’ demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend. Plaintiffs fail to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action.
 
“The elements of a prima facie case for the tort of
intentional infliction of emotional distress are: (1) extreme and outrageous
conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard
of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's
suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate
causation of the emotional distress by the defendant’s outrageous
conduct.”  Miller v. Fortune Commercial Corp. (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 214,
228–29.
 
Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts to meet the elements
of the cause of action. Almost all the factual allegations appear to be
directed against entirely different Defendants. The only allegation that appears
to be directed against demurring Defendants is the allegation set forth in
paragraph 58 which is incorporated within this cause of action. Again, for the
same reasons noted in the ruling to the demurrer to the third cause of action,
the allegation fails to demonstrate extreme and outrageous conduct with the
intention or reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional
distress, as well as causation of severe emotional distress. 
 
The demurrer to the fifth cause of action is sustained
with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Sixth Cause of Action for Elder Abuse
 
Defendants’ demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend. Plaintiffs fail to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action.
 
Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.30 states, in relevant
part: “(a) “Financial abuse” of an elder or dependent adult occurs when a
person or entity does any of the following:
(1) Takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains
real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or
with intent to defraud, or both.
(2) Assists in taking, secreting, appropriating,
obtaining, or retaining real or personal property of an elder or dependent
adult for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud, or both.
(3) Takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or
retains, or assists in taking, secreting, appropriating, obtaining, or
retaining, real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult by undue
influence, as defined in Section 15610.70.”
 
“Under the Elder Abuse Act, an “elder” is “any person
residing in this state, 65 years of age or older.” (§ 15610.27.) As relevant
here, elder abuse includes “[p]hysical abuse, neglect, abandonment, isolation,
abduction, or other treatment [of an elder] with resulting physical harm or
pain or mental suffering.” (§ 15610.07, subd. (a)(1).2) “Mental suffering” is
defined as “fear, agitation, confusion, severe depression, or other forms of
serious emotional distress that is brought about by forms of intimidating
behavior, threats, harassment, or by deceptive acts performed or false or
misleading statements made with malicious intent to agitate, confuse, frighten,
or cause severe depression or serious emotional distress of the elder or
dependent adult.” (§ 15610.53.)” Darrin v. Miller (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th
450, 453–54(finding that no special relationship is required between an elder
and the abuser so long as the elements above were met). 
 
Pleading a claim for elder abuse requires specific
facts of intentional or, at a minimum, reckless conduct.  See, Worsham v. O’Connor Hospital
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 331, 338. To state the statutory cause of action for
Financial Elder Abuse, Plaintiff must plead specific facts.  See, Covenant Care v. Superior Court
(2004) 32 Cal.4th 771, 790.  
 
Plaintiffs have failed to state the requisite specific
facts to state a cause of action. Similar to the allegations of the third
through fifth cause of action, the same conclusory allegation referenced above
is set forth again to support the sixth cause of action. 
 
In addition, Plaintiffs seek enhanced remedies under
the Elder Abuse Act which requires Plaintiffs to plead the requisite specific
acts to meet the requirements of Civ. Code § 3294 as required by Wel. &
Inst. Code § 15657.5.  Here, Plaintiffs
have failed to allege specific facts stating that Defendants acted with malice,
in conscious disregard for the rights of Plaintiffs. 
 
Defendants’ demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend.

Meet and Confer
 
Both demurring Defendants set forth meet and confer
declarations in sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41 and CCP § 435.5.  (Decls., Norman Lau.)
 
Demurrer by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company
 
First, at the outset, the basis for any liability
against Liberty Mutual Insurance Company has not been adequately alleged.  Plaintiffs have not alleged facts to
demonstrate that this entity has a duty of care to Plaintiffs either
contractually or through tort law.  Plaintiffs
appear to concede that there is no contractual duty since Plaintiffs have not
named this entity in the contract-based causes of action.  As to the tort claims, it appears that
Plaintiff is attempting to allege liability based on an alter ego theory of
liability.
 
“In California, two
conditions must be met before the alter ego doctrine will be invoked.  First, there must be such a unity of interest
and ownership between the corporation and its equitable owner that the separate
personalities of the corporation and the shareholder do not in reality
exist.  Second, there must be an
inequitable result if the acts in question are treated as those of the
corporation alone.”  Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523,
538.
 
Among the factors to be
considered in applying the alter ego doctrine are commingling of funds and
other assets of the two entities, the holding out by one entity that it is
liable for the debts of the other, identical equitable ownership in the two
entities, use of the same offices and employees, and use of one as a mere shell
or conduit for the affairs of the other. 
See Id. at 538-539.  Other factors include inadequate
capitalization, disregard of corporate formalities, lack of segregation of
corporate records, and identical directors and officers.  See Id.
at 539.  No one characteristic
governs.  The courts must look at the
totality of the circumstances to determine whether the doctrine should be
applied.  See, Id.
 
Plaintiffs have only pled bare bones boilerplate
conclusions in the SAC with respect to alter ego liability. (SAC, ¶¶ 31-32.) 
 
Thus, as to Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, the
Demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.

Third Cause of Action for Fraud 
 
The demurrer to the third cause of action is sustained
with 20 days leave to amend. Plaintiffs fail to state facts sufficient to state
the causes of action. 
 
“A complaint for fraud must allege the following
elements: (1) a knowingly false representation by the defendant; (2) an intent
to deceive or induce reliance; (3) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and
(4) resulting damages.”  Service by
Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816. “[T]he
elements of an action for fraud and deceit based on a concealment are: (1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he has known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.” Boschma v. Home Loan
Center, Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 230, 248.
 
“Every element of the cause of action for fraud must
be alleged in the proper manner and the facts constituting the fraud must be
alleged with sufficient specificity to allow defendant to understand fully the
nature of the charge made.”  Tarmann
v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.  Plaintiffs must state facts which “show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered.”  Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.
 
The third cause of action is based on this allegation:
“The Liberty Defendants engaged in intentional misrepresentation by
representing that Rainbow Defendants were licensed contractors when the Liberty
Defendants knew they were not. Liberty Defendants made these misrepresentations
through their employee and/or agent Richard Jasbring, Filed Claims Resolution
Specialist III, Liberty Mutual Insurance, in various emails to Mrs. Pleatman
and to Mark Percin in 2020 either expressly or by implication (hiring
contractors implies that they were licensed contractors).”  (SAC, ¶ 113.)  First, the actual misrepresentation is not set
forth any specificity. Plaintiffs merely reference a series of emails but do
not state the specific representations.  Instead,
Plaintiffs appear to provide some form of summary of the totality of the
emails.  If Plaintiffs do, in fact, have
emails, then, Plaintiffs could clearly meet the specificity standard by setting
forth verbatim the email or emails which set forth the specific
representations. 
 
In addition, Plaintiffs have not alleged specific
facts to meet the elements of knowledge of falsity, intent to deceive, and
justifiable reliance.  Plaintiffs have
only pled conclusions. 
 
Finally, to the extent that the cause of action does
appear to be premised upon duties contained within a written agreement
(insurance policy), Plaintiffs have not alleged facts to demonstrate the
existence of a duty separate and apart from the duty contained within the
agreement. “[C]onduct amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious only
when it also violates a duty independent of the contract arising from
principles of tort law. An omission to perform a contract obligation is never a
tort, unless that omission is also an omission of a legal duty.”  Erlich v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th
543, 551 (internal citations and quotations omitted).
 
Defendant’s demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend.
 
Fourth Cause of Action for Negligent Misrepresentation
and Fraud – Contractor Status
 
Defendant’s demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend. Plaintiffs fail to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action.
 
“The elements of negligent misrepresentation are (1)
the misrepresentation of a past or existing material fact, (2) without
reasonable ground for believing it to be true, (3) with intent to induce
another's reliance on the fact misrepresented, (4) justifiable reliance on the
misrepresentation, and (5) resulting damage. While there is some conflict in
the case law discussing the precise degree of particularity required in the
pleading of a claim for negligent misrepresentation, there is a consensus that the
causal elements, particularly the allegations of reliance, must be specifically
pleaded.” National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v. Cambridge
Integrated Services Group, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 35, 50 (internal
citations and quotations omitted).
 
The cause of action fails to state sufficient facts
for the same reasons noted in the ruling to the demurrer to the third cause of
action. 
 
Defendant’s demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend.
 
Fifth Cause of Action for IIED
 
Defendant Liberty Insurance Company’s demurrer is overruled.
Plaintiffs state facts sufficient to state a cause of action.
 
“The elements of a prima facie case for the tort of
intentional infliction of emotional distress are: (1) extreme and outrageous
conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard
of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's
suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate
causation of the emotional distress by the defendant’s outrageous
conduct.”  Miller v. Fortune Commercial Corp. (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 214,
228–29.
 
First, for the same reasons noted in the ruling to the
demurrer to the third cause of action, the allegation with respect to the
alleged misrepresentation fails to demonstrate extreme and outrageous conduct
with the intention or reckless disregard of the probability of causing
emotional distress, as well as causation of severe emotional distress. 
 
However, as to Liberty Insurance Company, Plaintiffs
have essentially repeated the allegations of the second cause of action with
respect to the claims of insurance bad faith.  Under appropriate factual circumstances,
allegations of insurance bad faith may satisfy the pleading elements of IIED.  Fletcher v. Western Nat'l Life Ins. Co.
(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 376, 394.  Here,
Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to satisfy the elements of the cause
of action.  (SAC, ¶¶ 124-126.)  “Where reasonable [minds] may differ, it is
for the jury, subject to the control of the court, to determine whether, in the
particular case, the conduct has been sufficiently extreme and outrageous to
result in liability.”  Fuentes v.
Perez (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 163, 172. 

 
The demurrer to the fifth cause of action is overruled.

 
Sixth Cause of Action for Elder Abuse
 
Defendant’s demurrer is overruled. Plaintiffs state
facts sufficient to state a cause of action.
 
Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.30 states, in relevant
part: “(a) “Financial abuse” of an elder or dependent adult occurs when a
person or entity does any of the following:
(1) Takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains
real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or

(2) Assists in taking, secreting, appropriating,

(3) Takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or
retains, or assists in taking, secreting, appropriating, obtaining, or
retaining, real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult by undue
influence, as defined in Section 15610.70.”
 
“Under the Elder Abuse Act, an “elder” is “any person
residing in this state, 65 years of age or older.” (§ 15610.27.) As relevant
here, elder abuse includes “[p]hysical abuse, neglect, abandonment, isolation,

450, 453–54(finding that no special relationship is required between an elder
and the abuser so long as the elements above were met). 
 
Pleading a claim for elder abuse requires specific
facts of intentional or, at a minimum, reckless conduct.  See, Worsham v. O’Connor Hospital
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 331, 338.  To
state the statutory cause of action for Financial Elder Abuse, Plaintiff must
plead specific facts.  See, Covenant
Care v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 771, 790.  
 
Similar to the allegations of the fifth cause of
action, the allegations referenced above, with respect to IIED, sets forth the
required specific facts to support the sixth cause of action.  
 
Defendant’s demurrer is overruled. 
 
Seventh Cause of Action for Negligence

Defendant’s demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend. Plaintiffs fail to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action.

 
“To state a cause of action for negligence, a
plaintiff must allege (1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care, (2)
the defendant breached that duty, and (3) the breach proximately caused the
plaintiff's damages or injuries.” Lueras v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP
(2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 49, 62.
 
The cause of action is based on the alleged hiring of
unlicensed contractors. However, the basis of this duty of care would be the
same duty that would be included within the contract. “[C]onduct amounting to a
breach of contract becomes tortious only when it also violates a duty
independent of the contract arising from principles of tort law. An omission to
perform a contract obligation is never a tort, unless that omission is also an
omission of a legal duty.” Erlich v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 551 (internal
citations and quotations omitted).
 
Tenth Cause of Action for Negligence 
 
Defendant’s demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend. Plaintiffs fail to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action.

 
“To state a cause of action for negligence, a
plaintiff must allege (1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care, (2)
the defendant breached that duty, and (3) the breach proximately caused the
plaintiff's damages or injuries.” Lueras v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP
(2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 49, 62.
 
The cause of action is based on the alleged inadequate
policy which was sold by an insurance agent who sells Liberty Insurance
policies. However, there is no negligence liability based on the inadequate
coverage.  Fitzpatrick v. Hayes
(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 916, 927.
 
Eleventh Cause of Action for Intentional
Misrepresentation
 
Defendant’s demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend. Plaintiffs fail to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action.

 
“A complaint for fraud must allege the following
elements: (1) a knowingly false representation by the defendant; (2) an intent
to deceive or induce reliance; (3) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and
(4) resulting damages.”  Service by
Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816. “[T]he
elements of an action for fraud and deceit based on a concealment are: (1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he has known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.” Boschma v. Home Loan
Center, Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 230, 248.
 
“Every element of the cause of action for fraud must
be alleged in the proper manner and the facts constituting the fraud must be
alleged with sufficient specificity to allow defendant to understand fully the
nature of the charge made.”  Tarmann
v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.  Plaintiffs must state facts which “show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered.”  Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.
 
The cause of action is based on the alleged inadequate
policy which was sold by an insurance agent who sells Liberty Insurance
policies and purported misrepresentations made by the agent. However, Plaintiffs
have not alleged the specific representations. Plaintiffs have not alleged
specific facts as to how, by what means, where, and to whom the representations
were made. In addition, the elements of knowledge of falsity, intent to
deceive, and justifiable reliance are not alleged with specificity, but only through
conclusions. 
 
Motion to Strike of Active Defendants
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. 
CCP § 436(a).  The court may also
strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with
the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.  CCP § 436(b). 
The grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant,
false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with
laws.  CCP § 436.  The grounds for moving to strike must appear
on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.  CCP § 437.
 
Active Defendants move to strike the prayer for
punitive damages and prayer for double damages pursuant to the Probate Code. 
 
Civ. Code, § 3294 states, in relevant part:
“(a) In an action for the breach of an obligation not
arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that
the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff,
in addition to the actual damages, may recover damages for the sake of example
and by way of punishing the defendant.
(b) An employer shall not be liable for damages
pursuant to subdivision (a), based upon acts of an employee of the employer,
unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and
employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are
awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. With respect
to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization,
ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an
officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.
(c) As used in this section, the following definitions
shall apply:
(1) “Malice” means conduct which is intended by the
defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is
carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the
rights or safety of others.
(2) “Oppression” means despicable conduct that
subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that
person's rights.
(3) “Fraud” means an intentional misrepresentation,
deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the
intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of
property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.”
 
To state a claim for punitive damages, Plaintiffs must
allege specific facts rather than conclusions that Defendant’s conduct
constitutes oppression, fraud, or malice.  Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73
Cal.App.3d 864, 872.  Here, as noted
above, in the Court’s ruling to the demurrer to the third through sixth causes
of action, Plaintiffs have failed to state sufficient specific facts to allege
that Defendants acted willfully, maliciously, intentionally, and/or recklessly
to support Plaintiffs’ prayer for punitive damages. As to the claim for double
damages pursuant to Probate Code § 859, the motion to strike is granted based
on the ruling sustaining the demurrer to the sixth cause of action.
 
Therefore, the motion to strike is granted, with 20
days leave to amend.
 
Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
