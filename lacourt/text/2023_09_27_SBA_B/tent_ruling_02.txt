Counsel Pro Hac Vice  
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Michael A. Lesczczynski’s Application
to Appear as Counsel Pro Hac Vice is granted. 
 
Background
 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on April 20, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. This action stems from a fire allegedly caused by
Southern California Edison which first started on the parking lot of First
United Methodist Church of Inglewood. The fire caused damage to Plaintiff’s
insured’s property. 
 
Application to Appear Pro Hac Vice
 
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 9.40 states, in relevant
part:
 
“(d) The application must state:
(1) The applicant's residence and office address;
(2) The courts to which the applicant has been
admitted to practice and the dates of admission;
(3) That the applicant is a licensee in good standing
in those courts;
(4) That the applicant is not currently suspended or
disbarred in any court;
(5) The title of each court and cause in which the
applicant has filed an application to appear as counsel pro hac vice in this
state in the preceding two years, the date of each application, and whether or
not it was granted; and
(6) The name, address, and telephone number of the
active licensee of the State Bar of California who is attorney of record.
(e) An applicant for permission to appear as counsel
pro hac vice under this rule must pay a reasonable fee not exceeding $50 to the
State Bar of California with the copy of the application and the notice of
hearing that is served on the State Bar.”
 
The applicant has met all the requirements mandated in
Rule 9.40. The application to be admitted as counsel pro hac vice is therefore
granted. 
 
Michael A. Lesczczynski is admitted as counsel pro hac
vice in the pending matter.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
