Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.'s demurrer to Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint is continued to a date to be determined at the hearing in Department G (Pomona). The Judge finds that the parties did not adequately meet and confer prior to the filing of the demurrer, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. The Judge orders Defendant's counsel to meet and confer with Plaintiffs' counsel regarding the demurrer and to file a supplemental declaration describing such meet and confer efforts at least nine (9) court days before the next scheduled hearing. The Judge's ruling is based on the fact that Defendant's counsel did not describe any code-compliant attempt to meet and confer after the court granted Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings on November 7 and after the Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended Complaint on November 17.
