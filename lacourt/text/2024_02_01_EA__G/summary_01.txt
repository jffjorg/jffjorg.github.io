The court finds that the defendant failed to provide timely discovery responses and awards sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $435 for each motion. The court also notes that the defendant failed to comply with the court's order to provide verified responses on or before October 20, and therefore finds that the plaintiff is entitled to monetary sanctions. The court awards sanctions using a lodestar approach and in view of the totality of the circumstances, and finds reasonable attorney fees and costs in the amount of $435 for each motion. The sanctions are payable in thirty days.
