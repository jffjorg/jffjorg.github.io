ANALYSIS
Truong
moves to compel Vuong to provide verified responses to Truong’s discovery
requests. Truong also seeks an award of sanctions for the present motions.
Legal Standard
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (b) allows the propounding
party to file a motion to compel responses to requests for production if a
response has not been received. Similarly, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.290, subdivision (b), the propounding party may file a motion to
compel responses to interrogatories if a response has not been received. In
both cases, a response must be provided within 30 days of service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); § 2031.260, subd. (a).) If responses are
untimely, the responding party waives objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (a); 2031.300, subd. (a).) The court shall impose monetary
sanctions against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes such orders to compel absent substantial justification or other
circumstances that make imposition of sanctions unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (c); 2031.300, subd. (c).) While the imposition of sanctions is
mandatory, the court “has discretion to reduce the amount of fees and costs
requested as a discovery sanction in order to reach a reasonable award.” (Cornerstone
Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th
771, 791 (Cornerstone).)
Discussion
On
April 12, 2023, Truong’s counsel served form interrogatories, special
interrogatories, and requests for production on Vuong. (Dunham Decl., ¶ 3.)
After no verified responses were provided, Truong’s counsel sent a meet and
confer letter to Vuong’s counsel on July 17 that requested full verified
responses by July 24. (Dunham Decl., ¶ 4.) No responses were provided and
during an informal discovery conference on October 11, the court ordered Vuong
to provide verified responses by October 20. (Dunham Decl., ¶ 5; 10/11/2023
Minute Order.) According to Truong’s counsel, Vuong has still failed to provide
verified responses. (Dunham Decl., ¶ 5-6.)
In
response, Vuong’s counsel filed a declaration stating counsel had located Vuong
and will be providing verified responses within two weeks of November 7. (Hess
Decl., ¶ 3-7.) On November 28, Vuong’s counsel served discovery responses on
Truong. (Nguyen Decl., ¶ 7.) Thus, the court DENIES Truong’s motions as moot.
But, because Vuong failed to provide timely discovery responses and because
Vuong failed to comply with the court’s order to provided verified responses on
or before October 20, the court finds Truong is entitled to monetary sanctions.
Utilizing
a lodestar approach and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the court
awards sanctions to Truong against Vuong and finds reasonable attorney fees and
costs in the amount of $435 for each motion (one hour drafting the present
motion and 0.5 hours attending the hearing at an hourly rate of $250/hr, plus a
filing fee of $60), payable in thirty (30) days.
