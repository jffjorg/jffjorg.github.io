And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint. The plaintiffs are ordered to file and serve a clean stand-alone copy of the Third Amended Complaint within 10 days of this order. The discovery cutoffs will be calculated based on the current trial date of January 14, 2025, for allegations added in the Second Amended Complaint and new allegations added in the Third Amended Complaint. All other discovery matters will remain closed. The judge has also ordered that the parties give notice of this ruling. The judge's ruling is based on the parties' agreement that the filing of the Third Amended Complaint is reasonable and narrowly tailored, and that the requested limitations on discovery are reasonable.
