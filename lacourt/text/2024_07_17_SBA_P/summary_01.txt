English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the moving, opposition, and reply papers in this case, in which plaintiff Hanh Huy Ha is suing defendants California Home Liberty, LLC and James Frakes for fraud and cancellation of a written instrument. The court has found that plaintiff has stated a cause of action for fraudulent inducement, as defendants allegedly made false representations to induce plaintiff to sell the property for $500.00. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled as to the first cause of action.

However, the court has sustained the demurrer as to the second cause of action, seeking cancellation of the written instrument. The court finds that plaintiff has not pleaded a reasonable apprehension of serious injury if the grant deed is not cancelled, and therefore, there is no possibility to amend the complaint to allege a serious injury.
