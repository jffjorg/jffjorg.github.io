  Case Number:  23TRCV03117    Hearing Date:   July 17, 2024    Dept:  P DemurrerThe court considered the moving, opposition and reply papers.RULINGThe demurrer is OVERRULED as to the first cause of action and SUSTAINED without leave to amend as to the second cause of action.BACKGROUNDOn April 18, 2024, plaintiff Hanh Huy Ha (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against defendants California Home Liberty, LLC and James Frakes (collectively, “Defendants”), alleging the following causes of action: (1) Fraud and (2) cancellation of written instrument under Civil Code section 3412.The complaint alleges that Plaintiff was the owner of a parcel of land on Rose Hill Court (hereinafter “Property”). (Compl. ¶FR-2(a).) There were unpaid property taxes on the Property and it was due to be sold at auction so that the County could recoup those delinquent taxes. (Id. at FR-2(b).) Prior to the auction, Plaintiff sold the Property to Defendants for the sum of $500.00. (Id. at FR-2(e).) During the conversation that culminated in the agreement to sell the Property,Defendant Frakes told Plaintiff that: 1) allowing the tax sale to go through would have negative consequences to Plaintiff’s credit score, 2) if the property was sold to Defendant California Home Liberty, no tax sale would take place, 3) if the tax sale went through, Plaintiff would lose any equity in the property, and 4) Defendants had helped people similarly situated to Plaintiff in the past. (Id.) Plaintiff sold the Property to Defendants and, thereafter, the property was sold at auction. (Id. at FR-6.) The sale generated proceeds in excess of the taxes due in the amount of $63,552.34. (Id.)LEGAL AUTHORITYA demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747. When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. Wilson v. Transit Authority of City of Sacramento (1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21.In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not on the evidence or facts alleged.” E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315. As such, the court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. Ibid. However, it does not accept as true deductions, contentions, or conclusions of law or fact. Stonehouse Homes LLC v. City of Sierra Madre (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 531, 538.A demurrer may be sustained “only if the complaint fails to state a cause of action under any possible legal theory.” Sheehan v. San Francisco 49ers, Ltd. (2009) 45 Cal.4th 992, 998.“If a complaint does not state a cause of action, but there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment, leave to amend must be granted.” Milligan v. Golden Gate Bridge Highway & Transportation Dist. (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1, 6.DISCUSSIONA. Fraud“The essential elements of fraud, generally, are (1) a misrepresentation; (2) knowledge of falsity; (3) intent to induce reliance; (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damage.” (City of Industry v. City of Fillmore (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 191, 211.)“A duty to disclose facts arises only when the parties are in a relationship that gives rise to the duty, such as seller and buyer.” (Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal. App. 5th 276, 311.)Fraud actions are subject to strict requirements of particularity in pleading. (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216.) Fraud must be pleaded with specificity rather than with general and conclusory allegations. Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184. The specificity requirement means a plaintiff must allege facts showing how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were made, and, in the case of a corporate defendant, the plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who made the representations, their authority to speak on behalf of the corporation, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when the representation was made. Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.In this case, Plaintiff alleges he was induced to sell the Property to Defendants for $500.00 because Defendants informed him that, if he did not, there would be negative consequences to his credit score and he would lose any equity he had in the Property. He further alleges that Defendants were knowledgeable about tax sales and knew that these representations were false. Plaintiff alleges that he sold the Property in reliance on Frakes’ representations. Finally, Plaintiff asserts that he was damaged by the fraud because, but for his reliance on Frakes’ statement, he would have received the proceeds from the tax sale.Given the above, the court finds that Plaintiff has stated a cause of action for fraudulent inducement. Therefore, the demurrer is OVERRULED as to the first cause of action.B. Civil Code Section 3412“A written instrument, in respect to which there is a reasonable apprehension that if left outstanding it may cause serious injury to a person against whom it is void or voidable, may, upon his application, be so adjudged, and ordered to be delivered up or canceled.” (Civil Code section 3412.) “To prevail on a claim to cancel an instrument, a plaintiff must prove (1) the instrument is void or voidable due to, for example, fraud; and (2) there is a reasonable apprehension of serious injury including pecuniary loss or the prejudicial alteration of one's position.” (Thompson v. Ioane (2017) 11 Cal. App. 5th 1180, 1193–94.)In this case, the court has found that Plaintiff has stated a cause of action for fraud in the contract which resulted in the conveyance of the Property to Defendants. The remaining question is whether “there is a reasonable apprehension of serious injury” if the grant deed is not cancelled. The court finds that Plaintiff has plead no serious injury if the deed is not cancelled. Indeed,Plaintiff is merely seeking the recover the excess proceeds generated by the tax sale of the Property. (Compl. at p. 6.) This injury is both certain and fixed and may be remedied in law, not equity.As Plaintiff has not shown “serious injury” if the deed is not cancelled, the demurrer as to the second cause of action is SUSTAINED. As Plaintiff has plead only the desire to have the “excess” funds from the tax sale returned to him, the court finds that there is no possibility to amend the complaint to allege a “serious injury.” Therefore, leave to amend is DENIED.
