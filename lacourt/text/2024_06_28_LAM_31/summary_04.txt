The Court has issued a Tentative Ruling in the matter of Heidi A. Christiansen v. Carmiel Cohen, et al. (BC594264). The case concerns a motion to enforce a settlement agreement, which was entered into on January 19, 2017. The agreement contemplated cash payments of $600,000 and $862,000, as well as child support payments until the parties' youngest child turned 18. The Defendant, Carmiel Cohen, failed to make the payments, and the Plaintiff, Heidi A. Christiansen, seeks to enforce the agreement.
