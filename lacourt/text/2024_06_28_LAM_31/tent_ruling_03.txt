I.             BACKGROUND
On January 30, 2023, Plaintiff SIG
EP Housing of California, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants
Savas Sirkci, Daniel Sallus, Ilker Sanar, Zuma Housing Downtown LLC, Zuma
Works, LLC (“Zuma Works, LLC”), and Does 1 through 10, inclusive, asserting one
cause of action for breach of contract. 
The Complaint alleges the
following. On or about December 6, 2018, Plaintiff and Savas Sirkci, on behalf
of Zuma Works, entered into a lease agreement for the real property located at
700 West 28th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90007. (Compl., ¶ 11.) Under the terms of the lease, Zuma Works was
obligated to pay rent and late fees and leave the premises in good condition. (Compl.,
¶ 24.) “Defendants
failed to perform these obligations by repeatedly failing to pay rent and
committing both willful and negligent acts to damage the condition of the
Premises.” (Compl., ¶
25.) “Defendants’ failure to perform the contractual obligations is a material
breach of the Lease which has resulted in substantial economic loss to
Plaintiff.” (Compl., ¶
26.) “At all times relevant herein, Plaintiff completed its obligations
required under the Lease.” (Compl., ¶ 27.) “As a direct and proximate result of the breaches by
Defendants, Plaintiff was harmed and has suffered loss. Plaintiff has suffered
damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to at
least $333,909.88.” (Compl., ¶
29.)
On February 22, 2023, Plaintiff
dismissed defendant Daniel Sallus. 
On January 12, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant motions to compel defendant Savas Sirkci (“Defendant”) to
serve further responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set
One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One. 
On February 6, 2024, Defendant
filed his oppositions to the motions to compel further responses. 
On February 13, 2024, Plaintiff
filed its replies to the oppositions. 
On February 21, 2024, the Court
held a hearing on the motions to compel further discovery responses and noted
that the parties had not participated in an IDC. Therefore, the Court continued
the hearing for Plaintiff’s motions to April 25, 2024, to allow the parties to
participate in an IDC. (Minute Order dated February 21, 2024, pp. 1-2.)
On March 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a request for an informal discovery conference (“IDC”) concerning Defendant’s
responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 13,
14, 15, 17, 33, 34, 35, and Special Interrogatory, Set One, Nos. 41-49 and
53-58.
On March 28, 2024, Defendant filed
its answer to Plaintiff’s request for an IDC. 
On April 3, 2024, the Court held
the IDC. The Court and counsel conferred at the IDC, but the issues were not
resolved. Therefore, the Court directed counsel to meet and confer on April 19,
2024, and defense counsel was to produce documents by April 26, 2024. The Court
further ordered: “If necessary, Counsel for Plaintiff is to file a motion by
May 7, 2024. Briefing schedule is to follow pursuant to the Code of Civil
Procedure. ¶ The Court
orders Counsel for Plaintiff to prepare and submit a Notice of Outcome within
five court days following the meet and confer date.” (Minute Order dated April
3, 2024 (“April 3 Order”), p. 1.) In addition, the Court advanced the dates of
the motions to compel further responses from April 25, 2024, to May 31, 2024. 
The Court has reviewed court
records and noted that Plaintiff’s counsel did not file a Notice of Outcome
within five (5) court days following the parties’ meet and confer, even though
counsel was ordered to do so in the April 3 Order. 
 On May 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant
motions to compel Defendant’s further responses to its Request for Production
of Documents (Set Two) and Special Interrogatories (Set Two). Plaintiff also
seeks an order imposing sanctions on Defendant. 
On May 24, 2024, Defendant filed
his oppositions to the motions, arguing only that Plaintiff did not give
Defendant the requisite 16-court day notice before the hearing date; Plaintiff
filed the motions to compel on May 17, 2024, only nine (9) court days before
the hearing on May 31, 2024, and asking the Court to continue the hearing to
allow Defendant to fully respond to the motions. Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
failure to give the requisite notice has prejudiced his ability to respond to
the moving papers and 75-page separate statements. 
On May 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed
its replies, arguing that the parties had agreed at the IDC on April 3, 2024, that
the hearing for the motions to compel further responses would be May 31, 2024,
and that defense counsel never requested a continuance from the hearing set on
May 31, 2024. 
A jury trial is set for August 11,
2025. 
II. LEGAL STANDARD
A.    Request for Production of Documents 
The
following rules apply to responses to requests for production of documents.
“The
party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling has been
directed shall respond separately to each item or category of item by any of
the following:
(1)   A statement that
the party will comply with the particular demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling by the date set for the inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 2031.030 and
any related activities.
(2)   A representation
that the party lacks the ability to comply with the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling of a particular item or category of item.
(3)   An objection to
the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling.”
(Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.210, subd. (a).) “If only part of an item or
category of item in a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
objectionable, the response shall contain a statement of compliance, or a
representation of inability to comply with respect to the remainder of that
item or category.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240, subd. (a).)
“If the responding party objects to
the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of an item or category
of item, the response shall do both of the following: ¶ (1) Identify with particularity any document, tangible
thing, land, or electronically stored information falling within any category
of item in the demand to which an objection is being made. (2) Set forth clearly the extent of, and the specific
ground for, the objection. If an objection is based on a claim of privilege,
the particular privilege invoked shall be stated. If an objection is based on a
claim that the information sought is protected work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010), that claim shall be expressly asserted.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.240, subd. (b).)
A
motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents “shall
set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by
the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)
B.     Interrogatories
The following rules apply to responses to
interrogatories. 
(a)   Each answer in a response to interrogatories shall be as complete and
straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party
permits.
(b)   If an interrogatory cannot be answered completely, it shall be answered
to the extent possible.
(c)   If the responding party does not have personal knowledge sufficient to
respond fully to an interrogatory, that party shall so state, but shall make a
reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other
natural persons or organizations, except where the information is equally
available to the propounding party.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220.)
In addition, “[i]f an objection is made to an
interrogatory or to a part of an interrogatory, the specific ground for the
objection shall be set forth clearly in the response.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.240, subd. (b).) 
“On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following
apply: ¶ (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.
¶ (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. ¶
(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
III. DISCUSSION
Plaintiff seeks an order
compelling Defendant’s further responses to its Request for Production of
Documents (Set Two), Nos. 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, and 43, and Special
Interrogatories (Set Two), Nos. 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, and
122. 
In opposition, Defendant argues
the Court should continue the hearing because Plaintiff did not give Defendant
the requisite 16-court day notice before the hearing date on May 31, 2021;
Plaintiff filed the motions to compel on May 17, 2024, only nine (9) court days
before the hearing. Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s failure to give the
requisite notice has prejudiced his ability to respond to the moving papers. 
In reply, Plaintiff argues that
the parties had agreed at the IDC on April 3, 2024, that the hearing for the
motions to compel further responses would be May 31, 2024, and that defense
counsel never requested a continuance from the hearing set on May 31, 2024. 
The relevant statute states: “Unless
otherwise ordered or specifically provided by law, all moving and supporting
papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing. The
moving and supporting papers served shall be a copy of the papers filed or to
be filed with the court. However, if the notice is served by mail, the required
16-day period of notice before the hearing shall be increased by five calendar
days if the place of mailing and the place of address are within the State of
California ….” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)
When
a moving party fails to give an opposing party the requisite notice under the
statute above, case law holds that the Court can simply continue the hearing to
compensate for insufficient notice. (See Shields v. Shields (1942) 55
Cal.App.2d 579, 584-585 [holding that lack of enough notice under Section
1005(b) is a “technical one,” and, in any event, the party raising that
argument did not show they were prejudiced by the other party’s failure to give
them the statutory ten day’s notice instead of nine for the notice of motion);
see also Karz v. Karl (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 637, 648 [“Nothing in [one
case], however, supports Karz’ contention that inadequate notice cannot be
remedied by continuing the hearing at which the opponent appears and contests
the motion on the merits. Under such circumstances, this Division upheld the
resulting order in [Shields v. Shields, supra, 55 Cal.App.2d at
p. 584]”].) 
The
Court finds good cause to continue the hearing for the following reasons. 
First,
the IDC, on April 3, 2024, concerned Plaintiff’s Request for Production of
Documents (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One), not the second sets at
issue in the instant motions to compel further responses. Therefore, it appears
the May 31, 2024, hearing was reserved for the motions to compel further
responses to the first set of the Plaintiff’s request for production of
documents and special interrogatories, not the second set. Indeed, although
Plaintiff argues that at the IDC, the Court stated that Plaintiff must serve
the Request for Production of Documents, Set Two, by April 10, 2024, the Court
has reviewed its Minute Order and has not seen any note regarding any service
of Request for Production of Documents, Set Two or anything with regard to the
April 10, 2024 date. 
            Given the volume of items at issue, Defendant’s
request to continue the hearing for the motions to compel is granted. 
IV.
CONCLUSION
The hearing on the Motion to
Compel Further Discovery Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set Two), and
Request for Production of Documents (Set Two) is continued to Friday, July 26,
2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 31 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
Defendant is ordered to file and
serve any supplemental opposition at least nine (9) court days before the next
hearing. 
            Plaintiff
is ordered to file and serve any supplemental reply papers at least five (5)
court days before the next hearing. 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
               Dated this 28th day of June 2024
