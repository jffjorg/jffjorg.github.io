And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents and interrogatories. The Plaintiff, SIG EP Housing of California, Beta, LLC, is seeking an order compelling the Defendant, Savas Sirkci, to serve further responses to the Plaintiff's Request for Production of Documents, Set Two, and Special Interrogatories, Set Two. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff did not give sufficient notice before the hearing date and seeks to continue the hearing.

The Judge finds good cause to continue the hearing, citing the volume of items at issue and the fact that the parties did not agree on a service date for the second set of requests for production of documents. The hearing is continued to July 26, 2024, and the Defendant is ordered to file and serve any supplemental opposition at least nine court days before the next hearing. The Plaintiff is ordered to file and serve any supplemental reply papers at least five court days before the next hearing.
