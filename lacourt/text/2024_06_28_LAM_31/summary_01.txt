And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants, Creative Artists Agency, LLC and Andrew Miller, are permitted to file a new motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication based on the plaintiff's filing of a Second Amended Complaint. The judge found that the plaintiff's addition of new allegations about being placed on an "Underperforming Writers List" and "Cutting List" moots the defendants' original motion for summary judgment and that it is appropriate to allow the defendants to file a new motion based on the operative pleading, which is the Second Amended Complaint. The judge ordered the parties to discuss an appropriate briefing schedule and hearing date and to submit a stipulation to the court within 10 court days.
