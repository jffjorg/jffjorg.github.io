And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Plaintiff Linda Alexander-Lieblang against Defendant Momentum Agencies' Answer. The demurrer was filed on February 9, 2024, and the hearing is scheduled for March 13, 2024. The Court has reviewed the pleadings and finds that the Answer fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a defense or affirmative defense on several grounds. The demurrer is sustained in part, with leave to amend, on the ground that the Answer fails to plead sufficient facts to support the statute of limitations defense. The demurrer is overruled in part, as the Answer adequately pleads facts supporting the exhaustion of administrative remedies defense. The Court also finds that the remaining affirmative defenses are not sufficiently pleaded and are sustained. The Plaintiff's first amended answer must be filed and served within 30 days after the date of this order.
