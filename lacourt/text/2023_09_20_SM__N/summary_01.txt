English text:
The tentative ruling is for Cyrus Hekmat's Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs, which is GRANTED in the amount of $484,803.25. Plaintiff Cyrus Hekmat is required to give notice. The Judge's reasoning is based on the matter that went to trial in February 2023, and the jury returned a verdict in Plaintiff's favor. The Judge states that Plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees pursuant to Penal Code section 496, subdivision (c), because the jury found Defendant Jonathan Mahboubi liable to Plaintiff for theft by false pretenses. The Judge finds that 1,022.4 hours of attorney work is a reasonable number of hours spent preparing the action and trying the case, and Plaintiff's hourly rates ranging from $395 to $600 per hour are reasonable. However, the Judge reduces Plaintiff's fees as to the present motion, as the Court finds that 10 hours spent preparing the motion at the rate of $400 per hour, plus one hour attending the hearing on the motion at the rate of $400 per hour, is more reasonable. Accordingly, Plaintiff Cyrus Hekmat’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $484,803.25, which consists of $479,803.25 for pretrial and trial fees and $5,000 for fees incurred in preparing the present motion and attending the hearing for the same.
