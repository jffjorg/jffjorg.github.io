And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered Defendant's motion for reconsideration of the order on the Citibank accounts. The motion was filed on October 14, 2024, and Plaintiff filed his opposition on November 1, 2024. The court has concluded that Defendant has failed to properly trace the funds in the Citibank accounts, and therefore, there is no basis to find that any amount is exempt from levy beyond the $384,143.02 conceded by Plaintiff. The court has denied Defendant's motion for reconsideration.
