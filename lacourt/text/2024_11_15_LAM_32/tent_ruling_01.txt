     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motion for reconsideration 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On January 22, 2019, Plaintiffs
Antonio Leon and Blanca Leon filed this action against Defendants James Jaber,
MD, Georgia Bode, MD, and Los Angeles Community Hospital, asserting causes of
action for (1) medical malpractice and (2) loss of consortium. The First
Amended Complaint was filed on May 8, 2019. Blanca Leon’s claims were
dismissed, leaving Antonio Leon’s medical malpractice claim. 
            The matter came on for trial between
January 29, 2024 and February 9, 2024, after which the jury returned a verdict
for Plaintiff against Defendant Bode. Judgment was entered on March 21, 2024 in
the total amount of $12,478,222.95.    
            On August 8, 2024, Plaintiff levied
Defendant’s deposit accounts at Citibank and Chase Bank. Citibank and Chase
turned over $1,227,657.16 and $97,915.03 to the levying officer, respectively. 
            On September 30, 2024, the Court
granted Defendant’s claim of exemption as to the Citibank funds in the amount
of $384,143.02. 
            On October 14, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant motion for reconsideration of the Court’s order. Plaintiff filed
his opposition on November 1, 2024.    
LEGAL STANDARD
“When an application for an order has been
made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or
granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order
and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application
to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and
modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall
state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge,
what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008(a).) 
Additionally, “the trial court retains the
inherent authority to change its decision at any time prior to the entry of
judgment.” (Darling v. Kritt (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1148, 1156.) “[S]ection
1008 does not govern the court's ability, on its own motion, to reevaluate
its own interim rulings.” (Ibid.) “[T]he only requirement of the court
is that it exercise ‘due consideration’ before modifying, amending, or revoking
its prior orders.” (Id. at p. 1157.) 
DISCUSSION
Social security and pension benefits are
exempt from levy. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 704.080, 704.110.) However, “[t]he
exemption claimant has the burden of tracing an exempt fund.” (Id., §
703.080(b).) “The tracing of exempt funds in a deposit account shall be by
application of the lowest intermediate balance principle unless the exemption
claimant or the judgment creditor shows that some other method of tracing would
better serve the interests of justice and equity under the circumstances of the
case.” (Id., § 703.080(b).)     
The additional bank records attached to
Defendant’s motion do not demonstrate that the Citibank accounts consist solely
of social security and pension funds. (See Bode Decl., Ex. A-I.) Defendant
claims that she has shown the lowest intermediate balance as follows: “As the
deposited benefits accumulated, they were transferred to savings, including
account ending in 3084 and certificates of deposit. Enough money has been
deposited into the Bodes’ Citibank accounts to fully exempt the levied funds.”
(Mtn. 6:11-14.) Defendant then concludes that because the total Social Security
and LACERA deposits ($1,251,747.01) exceeds the levied amount ($1,227,657.16),
the levied funds must necessarily be exempt. That is not how the lowest
intermediate balance rule operates. 
Plaintiff’s forensic accountant avers that
Defendant has not accurately applied the lowest intermediate balance principle
and explains the faults in Defendant’s methodology. (See Orrico Decl.) In
particular, the expert notes the following: 
 
“Judgment Debtor
simply considered the balances in the Citibank Accounts as of the levy date and
did not apply the LIBP on a day-to-day basis and did not identify non-exempt
source funds. Thus, Judgment Debtor did not correctly apply the LIBP in her
analysis and therefore, her analysis cannot be relied upon to provide an
accurate accounting of Exempt Funds under the LIBP.” 
(Id.,
¶ 18.)
 
“[F]or $778,542 of
the $1,227,657 of total levied funds, no support was provided. As such, it
cannot be assessed or determined whether the source funds were exempt or
non-exempt, and to the extent the source funds were exempt, whether such funds
were depleted or remain in the account. Thus, it is unclear how Judgment Debtor
concluded that $778,542 of the levied funds are exempt and therefore, her
analysis cannot be relied upon to provide an accurate accounting of exempt
funds under the LIBP.” 
(Id.,
¶ 20.)
Because Defendant has failed to properly
trace the funds, the Court has no basis to find that any amount is exempt
beyond the $384,143.02 conceded by Plaintiff. Accordingly, there is no reason
to amend the Court’s order on the Citibank accounts.  
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motion for
reconsideration is DENIED.
