And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant J. Paul Getty Trust's motion to compel a mental examination of Plaintiff Odile Madden. The judge found that there is good cause for the examination, as Plaintiff has alleged mental and emotional difficulties and has not denied that her mental state is in controversy. The judge also deferred to the expert's assessment of the necessary scope of the examination, which may include Plaintiff's history and neurological tests. The judge ruled that Plaintiff's counsel is entitled to obtain the test materials, including the audio recording, and that production shall be subject to a protective order. The judge also denied Plaintiff's request to condition the examination on Defendant waiving its right to take further examinations and to strike portions of the doctor's report.
