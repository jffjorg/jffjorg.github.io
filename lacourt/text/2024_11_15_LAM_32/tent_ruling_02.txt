  Case No.:  23STCV31214
  Hearing Date:  November 15, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant/cross-complainant dr. sebi’s
  office, inc.’s motion for sanctions  




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On December 21, 2023, Plaintiff
Trocadero International (TI) filed this action for breach of contract and fraud
against Defendants Dr. Sebi, LLC; Dr. Sebi’s Office, Inc.; and Agustin Ruiz
Miller. The complaint alleges that TI entered into an oral agreement with
Defendants to provide packaging for Defendants’ tea product in exchange for
$58,462.80. Defendants have allegedly failed to pay the balance of $30,082.80. 
            On May 7, 2024, Dr. Sebi’s Office,
Inc. (DSOI) filed a cross-complaint against TI, Richard Benichou, Alex
Benichou, and Custom Co-Pak, LLC for breach of contract and fraud. 
On June 20, 2024, DSOI filed two motions
to compel TI’s responses to Requests for Production and Form Interrogatories. The
Court denied these motions on August 23, 2024 because TI served its responses
before the hearing, but the Court awarded sanctions of $1,050 due within 30
days. 
On October 14, 2024, DSOI filed the
instant motion for sanctions based on TI’s failure to pay the monetary
sanctions previously awarded by the Court. TI filed its opposition on October
31, 2024. DSOI filed its reply on November 7, 2024. 
DISCUSSION
            “[M]onetary sanction orders are
enforceable through the execution of judgment laws.” (Newland v. Superior
Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 615.) “These orders have the force and
effect of a money judgment, and are immediately enforceable through execution,
except to the extent the trial court may order a stay of the sanction.” (Ibid.)
Due to the availability of enforcement of judgment procedures, it is not
necessary to impose further monetary sanctions. 
            Terminating sanctions, which DSOI
mentions in its reply, are unwarranted for a failure to pay monetary sanctions.
DSOI has not been deprived of any discovery, thus termination would be
disproportionate. Aghaian v. Minassian (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 603, 616-17
is distinguishable because the court in that case imposed issue and evidentiary
sanctions for failure to respond to discovery, not for failure to pay
sanctions. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant/Cross-Complainant Dr.
Sebi’s Office, Inc.’s motion for sanctions is DENIED.
