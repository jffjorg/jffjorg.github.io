And here is the English summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has taken the plaintiffs' motions to compel further responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories off the calendar due to the failure of counsel to participate in an informal discovery conference. The plaintiffs, Orlando Baniaga and Ronie Soriano Rivera, filed their complaint against Kia America, Inc. on February 21, 2023, and the defendants filed their answer and amended answer on April 25, 2023 and May 3, 2023, respectively. On January 18, 2024, the plaintiffs filed the motions, which were opposed by the defendants on February 2, 2024. The plaintiffs then filed their replies in support of the motions on February 9, 2024. The Judge notes that the Court's Trial Orders require an informal discovery conference before considering discovery motions, which has not occurred in this case.
