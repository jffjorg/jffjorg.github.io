ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Discussion
 
This Court’s Trial Orders require that Counsel attend
an informal discovery conference before any discovery motion will be heard in a
Lemon Law case. (See Court’s Trial Orders, § VIII.) That has not occurred
regarding these motions. 
 
The Court takes these motions off calendar because
Counsel have not participated in an informal discovery conference. 
 
II.      
Conclusion 
 
The motions are TAKEN OFF CALENDAR.
