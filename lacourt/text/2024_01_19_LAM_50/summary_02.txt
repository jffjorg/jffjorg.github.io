And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the causes of action in the First Amended Complaint (FAC). The judge notes that the causes of action are misnumbered, with the fifth cause of action for fraudulent inducement and the sixth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation incorrectly labeled. The judge also points out that the FAC does not allege where the representations were tendered, as required. Additionally, the judge denies the Demurring Defendants' request for judicial notice of a trial court order, stating that new evidence is not permitted with reply papers.
