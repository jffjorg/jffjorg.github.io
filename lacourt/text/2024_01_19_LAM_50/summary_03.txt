Here is a brief English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case JC 2020 CORP. v. NEW HAMPSHIRE BBL, LLC, et al., setting a hearing date of January 19, 2024. The case involves a demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) by the defendants, who also filed a cross-complaint. The judge notes that the defendants have not met and conferred with the plaintiff as required by law, and therefore takes the demurrer off calendar. The judge orders the defendants to file an answer to the FAC within 10 days of the date of the order, and the plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this order.
