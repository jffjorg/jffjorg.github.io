  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:  
 
DEMURRER TO FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  
 




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 
 



 
Background
Plaintiff JC 2020 Corp. (“JC 2020”) filed this action on May 10, 2022
against Defendants New Hampshire BBL, LLC (“New Hampshire BBL”) and Robert Lee,
an individual dba Landpac Properties. 
On June 30, 2022, JC 2020 filed amendments to the Complaint naming
Christine A. Lee AKA Soo Lee in place of Doe 3 and Timothy Lee in place of Doe
4. On July 27, 2022, JC 2020 filed an amendment to the Complaint naming
Christopher Y Lee in place of Doe 5.  
JC 2020 filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on July
27, 2022, asserting causes of action for (1) breach of written contract, (2)
promissory estoppel, 
(3)
fraudulent concealment, (4) fraudulent misrepresentation, and (5) fraudulent
transfer. 
On July 20, 2022, Robert Lee and New Hampshire BBL filed a
Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants JC 2020, Jeannie Yoon, Benjamin Ahn,
and James Mortensen. The Cross-Complaint asserts causes of action for (1)
indemnification, (2) apportionment of fault, (3) intentional tort, and (4)
intentional tort. 
Christine A. Lee, Christopher Y. Lee, Timothy Lee, and Robert Lee
(collectively, “Defendants”) now demur to each of the causes of action of the
FAC. JC 2020 opposes. 
Discussion 
As an initial matter,
the Court notes that it issued a minute order on November 13, 2023 continuing
the hearing on the instant demurrer from November 13, 203 to January 19, 2024. 
The Court’s November 13, 2023 minute order notes that “[t]he
Court does not find that Defendants’ counsel’s declaration demonstrates that
the parties met and conferred by telephone or in person concerning Defendants’
demurrer to the FAC. Defendants’ counsel states that ‘Plaintiff had notice of
Defendants’ objections to the Complaint by telephone and in April 19 and May
21, 2022,’ but this appears to concern the original Complaint, as the FAC was
filed on July 27, 2022.” 
The Court’s November 13,
2023 minute order further provides that “Defendants are ordered to meet and
confer with JC 2020 within 10 days of the date of this order. If the parties
are unable to resolve the pleading issues or if the parties are otherwise unable
to meet and confer in good faith, Defendants are to thereafter file and serve a
declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer in compliance with
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a)(3) within 15 days of
this order.”  
The
Court notes that Defendants have not filed any declaration setting forth
Defendants’ counsel’s efforts to meet and confer. Moreover, on January 8, 2024,
plaintiffs’ counsel filed a declaration stating that on November 13, 2023, he
emailed defense counsel stating that “[a]fter reading the
tentative, which continued your demurrer, I will offer to file a TAC,
consisting of the FAC + the exhibits that seem to be a principal issue in your
demurrer - same that were on the original complaint. You would need to stip to
leave of the court to file it. If you agree, we can have a phone call
confirming it, to comply with the judge’s desire that we do a telephone or
in-person meet and confer.” (Mortensen Decl., ¶ 2.) Plaintiffs’ counsel states
that he has “not received any response to [his] inquiries or other
communication from Defense counsel to meet and confer about the demurrer.”
(Mortensen Decl., ¶ 4.) 
Conclusion

Based on
the foregoing, Defendants’ demurrer is taken off calendar and Defendants are
ordered to file an answer to the FAC within 10 days of the date of this Order.
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this order.
