LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL FURTHER – REQUESTS
FOR PRODUCTION
Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may obtain discovery
regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action..., if the matter either is itself admissible in
evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.”  The Section
specifically provides that “[d]iscovery may relate to the claim or defense of
the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action,” and that
discovery “may be obtained of the identity and location of persons having
knowledge of any discoverable matter, as well as of the existence, description,
nature, custody, condition and location of any document, electronically stored
information, tangible thing, or land or other property.”

 
CCP § 2031.310(a) provides that a party demanding a document
inspection may move for an order compelling further responses to the demand if
the demanding party deems that:
“(1)   A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete.
  (2)   A
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
  (3)  
An objection in the response is without merit or too general.”  

 
Under
CCP § 2031.310 (b)(1), “The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.”  
 
“In
the more specific context of a demand for production of a tangible thing, the
party who asks the trial court to compel production must show “good cause” for
the request—but unless there is a legitimate privilege issue or claim of
attorney work product, that burden is met simply by a fact-specific showing of
relevance.” (TBG Ins. Services Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96
Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)


PROCEDURAL ANALYSIS
45-Day Requirement
Unless
notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing, the demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to
the demand. (CCP §2031.310(c).) 
Neither party addresses the 45-day requirement.
Meet and Confer
“The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.” (CCP §2031.310(b)(2).)
Here, Movant alleged it met and conferred. (Serrano
Decl. ¶28-32.)
ANALYSIS
As a preliminary matter, this Court notes that the notice
of motion states that this motion pertains to RFPs 1-32; however, the Separate
Statement did not include RFPs 5, 6, or 10. Therefore, the Court will not
address the RFPs that Plaintiff did not address in their Separate Statement.
TENTATIVE RULING(TR) RFPs 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
,9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 32
Defendant’s
objections are overruled. The objections did not comply with 2031.240.
Defendant’s responses are evasive. If Defendant is stating it is complying in
full in any of its responses, it needs to comply with 2031.220. If Defendant is
stating its inability to comply in any of its responses, it needs to comply
with 2031.230.
Motion to compel further response to RFPs 1, 2, 3, 4,
7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 32 is GRANTED.
TR 16, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 
Defendant’s
objections on overly broad are sustained. 
“In the more specific context of a demand for
production of a tangible thing, the party who asks the trial court to compel
production must show “good cause” for the request—but unless there is a
legitimate privilege issue or claim of attorney work product, that burden is
met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins. Services
Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)
Here, the Court fails to see how Plaintiff attempts to
explain good cause because the instant request dates back to 2017.
Motion to compel further responses to RFPs 16, 24, 25,
26, 27, 28, 29, and 30 is DENIED.
TR 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 
Defendant’s
objections on overly broad are sustained.  
“In the more specific context of a demand for
production of a tangible thing, the party who asks the trial court to compel
production must show “good cause” for the request—but unless there is a
legitimate privilege issue or claim of attorney work product, that burden is
met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins. Services
Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)
The Court fails to see how Plaintiff attempts to
explain good cause because the instant requests do not pertain to vehicles of
the same make, model, and year as the subject vehicle, nor is the request
limited to California.
Motion to compel further responses to RFPs 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22, and 23 is DENIED.
TR 31
The
Court will hear argument as to RFP 31.
 
OVERALL AS TO ALL TENTATIVE
RULINGS
For
those RFPs in which the Court is compelling a further response, Defendant is to
provide a verified, code compliant, further response, without objection, within
10 days of this hearing. 
 
 
Sanctions
Except
as provided in subdivision (j), the court shall impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further
response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. (CCP §2031.310(h).)
 
“The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
No sanctions were
requested by either party.
