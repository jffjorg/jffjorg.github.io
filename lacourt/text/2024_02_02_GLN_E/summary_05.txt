English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Cross-Defendants' motion to set aside/vacate default of the Cross-Complaint is GRANTED. The Judge finds that the mandatory relief provision of CCP § 473(b) is applicable, and that the Cross-Defendants' attorney submitted an affidavit of fault attesting to his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The Judge also notes that the default was entered on November 21, 2023, and this motion was made on December 5, 2023, within the six-month timeliness requirement. The issue of sanctions will be taken up at the hearing.
