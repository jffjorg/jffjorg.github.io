The Judge's tentative ruling is that Plaintiff, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., has met its burden of showing that there is no defense to its breach-of-contract claim against Defendants, Flexvisual, Inc. and Chad R. Williams. The Judge requires Plaintiff to address several issues, including service issues, the amount of damages, and the legal significance of the "Small Business Administration" and its effect on the amount of damages. The Judge also requires Plaintiff to clarify and point to evidence of the issue of Plaintiff's alleged damages and to address whether attorney fees and costs are properly before the Court on this MSJ or whether attorney's fees and costs should be brought to the Court on noticed motion. The Judge notes that Plaintiff did not put the alleged affirmative defenses that Plaintiff is attacking into issue in the Separate Statement.
