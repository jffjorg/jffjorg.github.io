Case Name: JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. v.
FLEXIVISUAL, INC.; CHAD R. WILLIAMS and DOES 1-10
 
[PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT] 
 
Moving Party:  Plaintiff, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
Responding Party: No Opposition by either Defendant
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Plaintiff, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., moves
this Court for summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants
Flexvisual, Inc. (Flexvisual) and Chad R. Williams (Williams).
 
This Motion is
made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 437c, on the grounds that there is
no triable issue as to any material fact with respect thereto, that Plaintiff's
evidence submitted herewith establishes each and every element of the causes of
action at issue, that Defendants have not raised any valid defense to the
Complaint and that Defendants cannot produce any evidence to the contrary.
Alternatively, if for any reason summary judgment may not be had, Plaintiff
seeks summary adjudication of the following claims:
 
On or about December 7, 2017,
FLEXVISUAL executed a Line of Credit Note with Chase in the amount $350,000.00
and Credit Agreement (collectively, the “Contract”). 
 
On or about December 7, 2017,
WILLAIMS executed a Guaranty (“Guaranty”), pursuant to which WILLIAMS
guaranteed repayment of the Contract. 
 
FLEXVISUAL has defaulted under the
terms of the Contract and there is now due, owing, and unpaid to Chase, the
principal sum of $343,787.00, plus late fees and costs of $1,903.62 for a total
of $345,690.62. 
 
WILLAIMS has failed to cure the
default of FLEXVISUAL on the Contract pursuant to his Guaranty. Accordingly,
WILLAIMS is in default under the Guaranty. 
 
Chase has performed all obligations
under the Contract. FLEXVISUAL has failed to pay under the terms of the
Contract and is in default. WILLAIMS has failed to cure the default of
FLEXVISUAL under the Guaranty. Pursuant to the terms of the Contract,
Defendants agreed to pay all collection costs, including court costs and
reasonable attorneys’ fees which Chase incurs in enforcing the Contract.
 
Plaintiff now seeks a judgment for
the balance owing under the Contract from Defendants. Accordingly, Plaintiff is
entitled to summary judgment or, alternatively, summary adjudication as there
are no triable issues of material fact and Defendants do not have any defense
to these causes of action. Plaintiff requests damages in the total sum of
$373,787.00; consisting of the: (1) principal sum of $343,690.62; (2) late fees
and costs of $1,903.62; (3) attorneys’ fees of $26,382.50; and (4) costs of
suit of $5,328.30 (for filing fees of $935.00, service of process costs of
$268.00, and deposition fees of $4,125.30). There are no triable issues of
material fact as to any of the affirmative defenses in Defendants’ Answer
because Defendant, Flexvisual, Inc. has defaulted, and the asserted defenses of
Defendant Chad Williams are without merit.
 
 
PROCEDURAL
Moving Papers: Notice; Memorandum; Garan Declaration;
Request for Judicial Notice; Memorandum of Costs; Proposed Judgment; Separate
Statement; Betz Declaration; Proof of Service
 
Opposition Papers: No Opposition papers
 
Reply Papers: No Reply Papers
 
Correct Address (CCP §§ 1013, 1013(a)): No – At the
hearing, Plaintiff is to address whether Defendants were served at the proper
addresses. 
 
There are several issues here as to whether Defendants were
served at the proper addresses. 
 
Plaintiff’s proof of service lists service by mail and by
federal express at the following four addresses:
 
Flexvisual, Inc.
2629 Foothill Blvd., Ste 172 La Crescenta CA 91214 
 
Chad R Williams
2629 Foothill Blvd., Ste 172 La Crescenta CA 91214 
 
Chad R Williams
3370 Saint Rose Pkwy, Apt. 2326 Henderson, NV 89052 
 
Flexvisual, Inc.
3370 Saint Rose Pkwy, Apt. 2326 Henderson, NV 89052
 
First, Plaintiff
is to address why it served each Defendant at two different addresses.
 
Second, Plaintiff
is to address what the proper service address is for both Defendants. 
 
In Plaintiff’s
motion, Plaintiff states that subsequent to filling of Defendants’ Answer,
Defendants’ counsel withdrew and Defendant Flexvisual was without counsel
before this court. (Pl. Memo. p. 2.) Further, Plaintiff states that on February
8, 2022, the Court struck Defendant Flexvisual’s Answer as an entity cannot be
self-represented. (Pl. Memo. p. 2.)
 
On eCourt, Chad
Williams’ mailing address is listed as 2629 Foothill Blvd, Suite 172, La
Crescenta, CA 91214. 
On eCourt,
Flexvisual’s mailing address is listed as 2629 Foothill Blvd, Suite 172, La
Crescenta, CA 91214. 
 
Plaintiff needs to clarify how it knows what the proper service
address is.
 
75/80 Days
“Notice of the motion and supporting papers shall be
served on all other parties to the action at least 75 days before the time
appointed for hearing. If the notice is served by mail, the required 75-day
period of notice shall be increased by 5 days if the place of address is within
the State of California, 10 days if the place of address is outside the State
of California but within the United States, and 20 days if the place of address
is outside the United States. If the notice is served by facsimile transmission,
express mail, or another method of delivery providing for overnight delivery,
the required 75-day period of notice shall be increased by two court days.”
(CCP §437c(a)(2).)
The instant hearing is scheduled for February 2, 2024.
Seventy-five (75) days before the hearing would be November 19, 2023. 
If basing the notice period on service via mail,
service at the address in California and service at the address in Nevada are
both untimely.  Seventy-five (75) days
before the hearing would be November 19, 2023, and service was executed on
November 15, 2023. However, since 5 days would have to be added for mail within
CA, then service would have had to be done on November 14, 2023; however,
service was not executed until November 15, 2023.  As to service at the Nevada address, 10 days
would have to be added to November 19, 2023; therefore, service would have had
to be completed by November 9, 2023; however, service was not complete until
November 15, 2023. 
The proof of service also indicates service by federal
express. Under, CCP §437c(a)(2), if the notice is served by facsimile
transmission, express mail, or another method of delivery providing for
overnight delivery, the required 75-day period of notice shall be increased by
two court days. (CCP §437c(a)(2).) Here, the proof of service also indicates
service via Federal Express. Adding two court days would mean service would
need to be complete by November 16, 2023. At the hearing, Plaintiff is to
address whether or not service via federal express is considered service under
“another method of delivery providing for overnight delivery,” under
437c(a)(2). If it is, it appears as if the instant motion is timely because
adding two court days to November 19, 2023 would mean that service needed to be
complete by November 16, 2023, and here, service was executed on November 15,
2023.
30 Days
“ The
motion shall be heard no later than 30 days before the date of trial, unless
the court for good cause orders otherwise. The filing of the motion shall not
extend the time within which a party must otherwise file a responsive
pleading.” (CCP §437c(a)(3).)
Here, trial is scheduled for 3/4/2024 and the instant
hearing in scheduled for 2/2/2024; therefore, the motion appears to comply with
437c(a)(3).



 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., filed a complaint against Defendants,
Flexvisual, Inc., and Chad R. Williams (“Williams”) alleging causes of action
for (1) breach of contract, (2) money lent, and (3) account stated. Plaintiff
alleged that Flexvisual entered into a borrowing relationship with Chase by
executing a Line of Credit Note and Credit Agreement in the amount of
$350,000.00 on December 7, 2017. (Compl. ¶7.) Plaintiff further alleged that
Williams executed a continuing guaranty wherein Williams guaranteed repayment
of the contract. (Compl. ¶8.) Plaintiff alleged that Flexvisual defaulted under
the terms of the contract and there is now due and owing $345,802.22 plus late
fees and costs, and Williams failed to cure the default. (Compl. ¶9-10.)
 
On 04/29/2022 this Court tentatively granted Plaintiff’s
MSJ; however, after hearing argument on 4/29/2022, the Court denied Plaintiff’s
MSJ and noted as follows:
 
Triable
issues of material fact remain as to at least the following: whether, and for
what time period(s), the purpose of the parties' agreement was frustrated;
whether, and for what time period(s); defendants' performance was excused or
partially excused; and the amount of plaintiff's damages, if any.
 
(Min. Order 04/29/2022,
p. 6.)
 
LEGAL STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure § 437c, subdivision (a) provides that “a
party may move for summary judgment in an action or proceeding if it is
contended that the action has no merit or that there is no defense to the
action or proceeding.” The motion shall be granted if all the papers
submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c(c).)
 
In determining if
the papers show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact, the
court shall consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers, except the
evidence to which objections have been made and sustained by the court, and all
inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence, except summary judgment
shall not be granted by the court based on inferences reasonably deducible from
the evidence if contradicted by other inferences or evidence that raise a
triable issue as to any material fact. (Id.)


Plaintiff has met
his or her burden of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if
that party has proved each element of the cause of action entitling the party
to judgment on the cause of action. (CCP § 437c(p).) Once the plaintiff has met
that burden, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that a triable issue of
one or more material fact exists as to the cause of action or a defense
thereto. (Id.)
 
ANALYSIS
Causes
of Action
The instant motion appears to be directed just at the breach of contract
cause of action in the Complaint. On January
24, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Request for Dismissal Without Prejudice of:
“Complaint as to Does 1 through 10 and causes of action for Money Lent and
Common Count.” 
 
Breach of Contract
“A
cause of action for breach of contract requires proof of the following
elements: (1) existence of the contract; (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse
for nonperformance; (3) defendant’s breach; and (4) damages to plaintiff as a
result of the breach.” (Miles v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 394, 402 citing CDF Firefighters v. Maldonado (2008) 158
Cal.App.4th 1226, 1239.)
 
Plaintiff
argues that it has met its burden in establishing every element of Plaintiff’s
breach-of-contract claim by the following:
 
(1)
Existence of the contract
“Flexvisual
entered into a Line of Credit Note in the amount of $350,000 and Credit
Agreement with Chase by executing the Contract. Williams executed the Guaranty,
pursuant to which Williams guaranteed repayment of the Contract, and Williams
does not dispute this. (SSUF ¶¶ 1, 2, 4)” (Pl. Memo p. 5.)
 
(2)
Plaintiff’s Performance or excuse for nonperformance and (3) Defendant’s breach
“Chase
has performed all of its obligations under the Contract by extending loans to
Flexvisual, and Williams, as CEO of Flexvisual does not dispute this. (SSUF ¶
5). Flexvisual has failed to pay under the terms of the Contract and is in
default. A transaction history for the Contract reflects payments made,
advances taken under, and the assessment of fees on the Contract. (SSUF ¶ 6).”
(Pl. Memo p. 5.)
 
“The
Small Business Administration (“SBA”) guaranteed the loan memorialized in the
Contract. Following Flexvisual’s default on the Contract, the SBA repurchased
the SBA guaranteed portion of the loan and, on September 6, 2022, paid to Chase
$174,325.92. Chase accounted for the repurchased by applying the SBA purchase
funds to the loan account. The transaction history reflects that this payment
was posted to the Contract on September 7, 2022. (SSUF ¶ 7). Further, Defendant
Williams acknowledges the outstanding balance owed by Flexvisual, and has not
cured the default of Flexvisual (SSUF ¶¶ 9 and 13).” (Pl. Memo p. 5.)
 
(4)
Damages to Plaintiff as a Result of the Breach
“As
a direct and proximate result of Flexvisual’s breach of the Contract and
Williams’s breach of Guaranty, Chase has suffered damages. The transaction
history reflects payments made on the Contract. A screen print from the system
Chase currently uses to service the Contract reflects that as of November 9,
2023, Flexvisual owes Chase the principal balance of $343,787, plus late fees
and costs of $1,903.61 for a total of $345,690.62. (SSUF ¶ 8.)” (Pl. Memo p.
6.)
 
“Pursuant
to the terms of the Contract, Defendants agreed to pay all collection costs,
including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees which Chase incurs in
enforcing the Contract. Chase has incurred attorneys’ fees and legal expenses
to enforce its rights. (SSUF ¶ 14.) As such, Chase is entitled to attorneys’
fees of $26,382.50, and costs of suit in the amount of $5,328.30 (for filing
fees of $935.00, service of process costs of $201.00, and deposition fees of
$4,192.30).” (Pl. Memo p. 6.)
 
Further,
Plaintiff submitted the Declaration of Christine Betz which states as follows:
 
I
am employed by Plaintiff JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("Chase") as a Special
Credit Recovery Analyst I with a corporate title of Associate. Unless otherwise
indicated below, I make this declaration based on my personal knowledge and my
review of Chase's business records described in paragraph 2 of this
declaration.
 
In
my capacity as Associate, I am one of Chase's employees responsible for
managing a loan to FLEXVISUAL, INC. ("Flexvisual"), which is the
subject of this action (the "Loan"). I have access to certain of
Chase's records, including Chase's records relating to the Loan. The records
for the Loan, including computerized records indicating the sums advanced, and
payments made on account of the Loan, are created and maintained by Chase in
the course of its regularly conducted business activities and were made at or
near the time of the occurrence of the events they reflect, by or from
information transmitted by a person with knowledge. It is the regular practice
of Chase to keep such records in the ordinary course of a regularly conducted
business activity.
 
On
or about December 7, 2017, Flexvisual entered into a Line of Credit Note with
Chase in the amount of $350,000.00 and Credit Agreement (collectively, the
"Contract"). A true and correct copy of the Contract is attached as
Exhibit A. 
 
On
or about December 7, 2017, CHAD R WILLIAMS ("Williams") entered into
a guaranty (the "Guaranty"). A true and correct copy of the Guaranty
is attached as Exhibit B. 
 
Flexvisual
has failed to pay under the terms of the Contract and is in default. A true and
correct copy of a transaction history for the Contract is attached as Exhibit
C. Exhibit C reflects payments made, advances taken under, and the assessment
of fees on the Contract. 
 
The
Small Business Administration ("SBA") guaranteed the loan
memorialized in the Contract. Following Flexvisual's default on the Contract,
the SBA repurchased the SBA-guaranteed portion of the loan and, on September 6,
2022, paid to Chase $ 174,325.92. Chase accounted for the repurchased by
applying the SBA purchase funds to the loan account. The transaction history
attached as Exhibit C reflects that this payment was posted to the Contract on
September 7, 2022.
 
Exhibit
C reflects the payments made on the Contract. As of November 9, 2023, Chase is
owed the principal balance of $343,787.00 ($ 169,461.08 + $ 174,325.92), plus
late fees and costs of $ 1,903.62 for a total of $345,690.62. 
 
Williams
has failed to cure the default of Flexvisual under the Guaranty. Accordingly,
Williams is in default under the Guaranty. 
 
Chase
has also incurred attorneys' fees and legal expenses to enforce its rights.
 
(Decl.
Betz ¶¶1-9.)
 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
The Court will hear argument.
Generally, it appears as if Plaintiff has submitted
sufficient evidence in support of its breach-of-contract claim to shift the
burden of proof to Defendant to show that there are triable issues of material
fact extant.
However, the Court needs Plaintiff to address the
service issues it previously mentioned in its tentative.
Further, Plaintiff is to clarify and point the Court
to the evidence of the issue of Plaintiff’s alleged damages. Plaintiff is to
clarify the legal significance of the “Small Business Administration” and its
legal effect on this action and its effect on the amount of damages in this
action. Plaintiff is also to clarify the several discrepancies as to the amount
of damages requested. 
In the Complaint, Plaintiff states that the principal
sum due on the contract is $345,802.22. 
Further, the Notice of Motion states on page 2, line
9-11, “FLEXVISUAL has defaulted under the terms of the Contract and there is
now due, owing, and unpaid to Chase, the principal sum of $343,787.00, plus
late fees and costs of $1,903.62 for a total of $345,690.62.”
To add further confusion, the Notice of Motion states
on page 2, lines 22-25, “Plaintiff requests damages in the total sum of $373,787.00;
consisting of the: (1) principal sum of $343,690.62; (2) late fees and costs of
$1,903.62; (3) attorneys’ fees of $26,382.50; and (4) costs of suit of
$5,328.30 (for filing fees of $935.00, service of process costs of $268.00, and
deposition fees of $4,125.30).”
Further, the Betz Declaration at ¶7 states, “Exhibit C
reflects the payments made on the Contract. As of November 9, 2023, Chase is
owed the principal balance of $343,787.00 ($ 169,461.08 + $ 174,325.92), plus
late fees and costs of $ 1,903.62 for a total of $345,690.62.”
Further, Plaintiff is to address whether attorney fees
and costs are properly before this Court on this MSJ or whether attorney’s fees
and costs should be brought to the Court on noticed motion. 
Plaintiff’s motion also argues that Defendants have no
defense to Plaintiff’s claims and make arguments about frustration of purpose
not being applicable to the guaranty and impossibility/impracticability not
being applicable to the guaranty. 
An issue with Plaintiff’s arguments that Defendants
have no defense to Plaintiff’s claims is that Plaintiff did not put the alleged
affirmative defenses that Plaintiff is attacking into issue in the Separate
Statement. “ The Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in
support of a motion must separately identify: (A)  Each cause of action,
claim for damages, issue of duty, or affirmative defense that is the subject of
the motion; and (B)  Each supporting material fact claimed to be without
dispute with respect to the cause of action, claim for damages, issue of duty,
or affirmative defense that is the subject of the motion.” (CRC, Rule 3.1350(d)(1).)
Here, Plaintiff’s Separate Statement only lists one
issue that is described as, “Issue One: Chase is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law on its Cause of Action for Breach of Contract because each
element of the cause of action is established.”
Therefore, the Court does not find Plaintiff’s attack
on the affirmative defenses to be at issue in this motion for summary judgment.

Request for Judicial Notice
Plaintiff requests judicial notice of “Exhibit A : A
copy of California, Executive Order N-07-21 Rescinding lock-down orders related
to the Covid-19 Pandemic and reopening,” and “Exhibit B: Copies of Declarations
of Emergency, Directives 49 and 50 by the Governor of the State of Nevada,
rescinding lockdown orders and allowing for large mass events.”
Plaintiff requested judicial notice pursuant to
Evidence Code Section 452 and 453 and CRC Rules 3.1113(l) and 3.1306(c).
Evidence Code § 452
Judicial notice may be taken of the following matters

(b) Regulations and legislative enactments issued
by or under the authority of the United States or any public entity in the
United States.
(c) Official acts of the legislative, executive,
and judicial departments of the United States and of any state of the United

(Enacted by Stats. 1965, Ch. 299.)
Evidence Code § 453.
The trial court shall take judicial notice of any
matter specified in Section 452 if a party requests it and:
(a) Gives each adverse party sufficient notice of
the request, through the pleadings or otherwise, to enable such adverse party
to prepare to meet the request; and
(b) Furnishes the court with sufficient
information to enable it to take judicial notice of the matter.
The Court will hear argument as to Plaintiff’s request
for judicial notice.
