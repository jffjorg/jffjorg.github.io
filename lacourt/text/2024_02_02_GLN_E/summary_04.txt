And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is issuing a tentative ruling on a motion for sanctions filed by the plaintiff, Aurea Construction, Inc. against the defendant's attorney, Pedram Zivari. The plaintiff argues that Zivari continued to litigate despite a statutory stay and court-imposed stay, and seeks sanctions of $1,500 under California Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5. The defendant's attorney argues that there was confusion as to what was embraced by the stay, and that his actions were without good cause or substantial justification.

The court finds that the defendant's attorney's arguments are persuasive, and that there may have been confusion as to what was embraced by the stay. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions.
