The motion was filed because USAA's insured, Demarco Smith, cannot be located. The court finds that USAA has established an interest in the litigation and has an unconditional right to intervene under Code of Civil Procedure, § 387(b). The court also finds that USAA's intervention will not enlarge the issues or change the nature of the proceedings. Therefore, USAA's Motion for Leave to File Complaint-in-Intervention is granted.
