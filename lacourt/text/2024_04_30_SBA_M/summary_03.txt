And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the third cause of action for Premises Liability, brought by Defendants Mercury Air Cargo, LLC and Worldwide Flight Services, Inc., is overruled. The judge found that the plaintiff has stated sufficient facts to state a cause of action and the cause of action is not uncertain. The judge also disagreed with the defendants' argument that the plaintiff's allegations are duplicative of the first cause of action for Negligence. The judge noted that the plaintiff is pursuing a theory of negligence based on premises liability based on ownership, possession, and control of the subject property, which is different from the first cause of action. The judge ordered the defendants to file and serve an answer within 10 days of the ruling.
