            23TRCV01367
1.      Mercury
Air Cargo, LLC, et al.’s Demurrer to Complaint  
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Mercury Air Cargo, LLC and Worldwide Flight Services,
Inc.’s Demurrer to Complaint is overruled. 
 
            
            Background
 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on April 28, 2023.
Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff was injured by a pallet being
carried by a forklift operated by Defendants on property owned or controlled by
Defendants. Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action. 1. Negligence; 2.
Negligent Hiring, Retention, and Supervision; 3. Premises Liability.  
 
Demurrer
 
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a
matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In
testing the sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of
(1) the properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably
inferred from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) 
The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of
fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.App.4th 634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of a complaint, the plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts
sufficient to establish every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw v. California Physicians
Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) 
Where the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County of
Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case
"with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to
acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of
action.”  (Gressley v. Williams
(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) 
"Whether the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is
irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer." 
(Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605,
609–610.)  Under Code Civil Procedure §
430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is “uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s
factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently apprise a
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
 
Meet and Confer
 
Defendants set forth a meet and confer declaration in
sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41. (Decl., Valeria Granata.)
 
Demurrer
 
Defendants demur to the third cause of action for
failure to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action and uncertainty.
 
Third Cause of Action for Premises Liability
 
Defendants’ demurrer to the third cause of action is overruled.
Plaintiff states sufficient facts to state a cause of action and the cause of
action is not uncertain. 
 
“To state a cause of action for negligence, a
plaintiff must allege (1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care, (2)
the defendant breached that duty, and (3) the breach proximately caused the
plaintiff's damages or injuries.” Lueras v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (2013)
221 Cal.App.4th 49, 62. “The elements of a cause of action for premises
liability are the same as those for negligence. Accordingly, the plaintiff must
prove, legal duty to use due care, a breach of such legal duty, and the breach as
the proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.” Jones v. Awad
(2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 1200, 1207 (internal citations and quotations omitted).
 
First, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to
distinguish the purported conduct of each Defendant and instead simply group
them together. However, in paragraph 30 of the Complaint, Plaintiff has alleged
that both Defendants owned, possessed, and operated the subject property.
Plaintiff is only required to allege general and not specific facts to state a
cause of action for premises liability. The allegations are sufficiently stated
in a manner to allow Defendants the opportunity to respond.
 
“Demurrers for uncertainty under Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e) (sic) are disfavored.
A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even
where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be
clarified under modern discovery procedures.
A demurrer for uncertainty should be overruled when the
facts as to which the complaint is uncertain are presumptively within the
defendant's knowledge.” Chen v. Berenjian (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th
811, 822 (internal citations and quotations omitted
 
Second, Defendants argue that the cause of action is
duplicative of the first cause of action for Negligence because the same factual
allegations of the first and third causes of action are utilized to state the
elements of each of the causes of action - purported duty of care, breach of
duty, and causation of damages. Plaintiff citing to Kesner v. Superior Court
(2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132 argues that “premises liability is subject to
specific defenses that do not necessarily apply to negligence. The most notable
example is ownership and control of the subject property.” (Opposition, page 5,
lines 11-13.) 
 
Importantly, the Court notes that Plaintiff did not
incorporate the factual allegations of paragraph 5 regarding ownership,
management, and control of the subject property into the first cause of action
for Negligence. Again, as noted above, while the elements of the causes of
action are the same for both causes of action, by not incorporating those
factual allegations into the first cause of action, Plaintiff has made clear
that she is pursuing the first cause of action merely on the contention that
Defendants breached a general duty of care of the ordinary prudent person to
not operate a forklift to harm Plaintiff rather than a duty of care based on
ownership or control of the property itself. As to the third cause of action,
Plaintiff is pursuing a theory of negligence based on premises liability based
on ownership, possession, and control of the subject property. (Complaint, ¶ 30.)
 
Thus, the demurrer to the third cause of action is
overruled.  
 
Defendants are ordered to file and serve an Answer
within ten days of this date.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
