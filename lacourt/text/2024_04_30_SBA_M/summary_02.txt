And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Gary Y. Tanaka regarding a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Stuart Lee Zubrick, et al. (defendants) against Epps & Coulson, LLP (plaintiff). The judge denies the motion as to the first through third causes of action, which allege fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract. The judge concludes that the allegations state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. As to the fourth cause of action, which alleges slander of title, the judge also denies the motion, finding that the litigation privilege does not apply because the alleged slander occurred during the course of the defendant's alleged breach of professional duties.
