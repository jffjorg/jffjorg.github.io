And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling by the judge addresses the defendant's request to file four additional in limine motions. The court has denied the request, except for one potential exception. The exception is if the plaintiff has not made Donell available for deposition. If that is the case, the court may allow the motion. The court emphasizes that the plaintiff is required to make experts available for deposition, as stated in the disclosure declaration. The judge notes that the defendant's motions are attempts to attack the plaintiff's experts, but the attacks go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.
