And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's motion for fees on the contract is denied. The plaintiff claimed that they were entitled to fees under the promissory note, which has a fee provision giving fees to the prevailing party to an action under the note. However, the judge disagrees and argues that there is no cause of action under the note, as the plaintiff did not sue to enforce the note. Additionally, the judge points out that even if the court were to import the note's fee provision to the shareholder's agreement, the plaintiff did not truly prevail in the litigation, as they only recovered a fraction of what they sought. Therefore, the judge denies the fee motion.
