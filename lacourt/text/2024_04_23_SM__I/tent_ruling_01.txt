  Case Number:  19SMCV02200    Hearing Date:   April 23, 2024    Dept:  I Having already filed 16 in limine motions—many out of
the form book—defendant seeks leave to file four more.  No good cause has been shown and leave is
DENIED with one potential exception.  Of
course, that does not stop defendant from objecting at trial.  Even were the court to allow the new motions,
they would be denied.  Essentially, they
are attempts to attack plaintiff’s experts.  
But the attack goes to weight, not admissibility in this instance.   
 
The only exception is that defendant contends that plaintiff
has not made Donell available for deposition. 
If that is true, it is a problem. 
The court assumes that Donell has since been made available or at least
that it has offered numerous dates.  If
not, the court will likely allow that one in limine motion.  Plaintiff is required to make experts
available for deposition—indeed, it is in the disclosure declaration.  If either plaintiff or Donell are too busy to
be deposed, then Donell is too busy to testify.
