And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the City of Los Angeles' motion for issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions against Gregory Blaine Heffron, the plaintiff. The motion was filed after Heffron failed to produce required documents during his deposition. However, the judge found that Heffron was in a rehabilitation facility during the time period at issue and was unable to produce the documents due to restrictions imposed by his medical treatment. As a result, the judge denied the request for evidence and issue sanctions, finding that there had been no willful violation of a court order. The judge also denied the request for monetary sanctions, finding that imposing further sanctions would be unjust.
