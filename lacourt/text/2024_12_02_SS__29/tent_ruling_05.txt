 Case Number:  23STCV02798    Hearing Date:   December 2, 2024    Dept:  29 Kham v. Morlin Asset Management
23STCV02798
Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Form Interrogatories (Set One)
 
Tentative
 
The motion is denied without
prejudice on procedural grounds.
 
Background
 
On February 8, 2023, Shaheriav
Kham (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (“LACMTA”), Morlin Asset Management, LP (“Morlin”),
and Does 1 through 20, asserting a cause of action for premises liability
arising out of an alleged slip and fall at Union Station in Los Angeles on June
20, 2022.
 
On April 27, 2023, County of Los
Angeles (“County”) filed an answer stating that it was erroneously sued as
LACMTA.
 
On August 30, 2023, Morlin filed
an answer.
 
On June 7, 2024, Plaintiff
amended the complaint to name ABM Industries, Inc. as Doe 1.
 
On July 12, 2024, ABM Industry
Groups, LLC (erroneously sued as ABM Industries, Inc.) (“ABM”) filed an answer.
 
On October 30, 2024, based on the
oral stipulation of counsel, the Court granted the motion of County to withdraw
its answer.
 
On
November 4, 2024, ABM filed the instant motion to compel Plaintiff to respond
to Form Interrogatories (Set One).
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
Discussion              
 
All motions
must be served on all parties who have appeared in the action.  Here, however, ABM filed a proof of service
showing that this motion was served only on Plaintiff, and not on Morlin.
 
Accordingly,
the motion is denied without prejudice based on incomplete service.
 
Conclusion 
 

The
Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Defendant ABM’s motion to compel Plaintiff to
respond to Form Interrogatories (Set One). 

 

Moving party to give notice.
