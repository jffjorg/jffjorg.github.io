 Case Number:  23STCV02887    Hearing Date:   December 2, 2024    Dept:  29 Heffron v. City of Los Angeles
23STCV02887
Defendant’s Motion for Issue, Evidence, and Monetary Sanctions 
 
Tentative
 
The motion is denied.
 
Background
 
On February 9, 2023, Gregory
Blaine Heffron (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against City of Los Angeles
(“City”), Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (“DWP”), County of Los
Angeles (“County”), State of California (“State”), and Does 1 through 200 for
liability of a public entity under Government Code section 815 and negligence
for a scooter accident occurring on May 13, 2022.
 
On May 15 and 16, 2023, County
and State filed answers. These defendants were dismissed, at the request of
Plaintiff, on April 19, 2024.
 
On June 26, 2023, City filed an
answer (on its own behalf and acting by and through DWP) and a
cross-complaint against Roes 1 through 10.
 
Discovery
has not proceeded smoothly in this matter, and the Court has made a series of
orders regarding discovery.
 
As is
particularly relevant here, on June 28, 2024, City took the deposition of
Plaintiff.  (Houle-Sandoval Decl., ¶
4.)  The deposition ended early due to an
emergency.  (Ibid.)  The deposition resumed on July 8.  (Ibid.) 
At neither session did Plaintiff produce documents.  (Ibid.)
 
On
October 8, 2024, the Court heard and granted City’s motion to compel.  The Court ordered Plaintiff to appear for a
further session of his deposition by no later than October 28, to produce
documents identified in the deposition notice, and to answer questions about those
documents.
 
On
October 17, 2024, Plaintiff appeared for his deposition but did not produce the
required documents.  (Houle-Sandoval
Decl., ¶ 10.)  The deposition commenced
at 11:08 a.m.  (Id., ¶ 16 & Exh.
K.)  At 11:07 a.m., Plaintiff’s counsel
emailed a verified document response to City’s counsel in which Plaintiff
stated that he had no responsive documents. 
(Mesaros Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh. A.)
 
On
November 1, 2024, City filed this motion for issue, evidence, and monetary
sanctions, asserting that Plaintiff failed to obey the Court’s Order of October
8, 2024.  
 
On
November 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion.  On the same day, Plaintiff served a supplemental
response to the document request in which Plaintiff stated that he had located
responsive documents; copies of the documents were attached to the supplement
response.  (Mesaros Decl., ¶ 9 & Exh.
B.)  According to Plaintiff’s counsel,
Plaintiff was in an in-patient rehabilitation facility from September 18
through November 6, 2024, with little or no access to his phone or other
electronic communication devices.  (Id.,
¶¶ 2, 6, 8; see also (Houle-Sandoval Decl., Exh. K, at 179:11-180:9, 181:14-21, 185:4-8, 187:10-15.).)
 
City
filed a reply and objections to the declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel on November
21.  
 
Legal
Standard 
 
When a party fails to obey an order compelling testimony and the
production of documents at a deposition, “the court may make those orders that
are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction,
or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 [of the Civil Discovery Act.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(h).)  “In lieu of, or in addition to,
this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
….”  (Ibid.)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act,
section 2023.030 provides for monetary, evidence, issue, and terminating
sanctions for any “misuse of the discovery process,” “[t]o the extent
authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any
other provision of this title.”  A “misuse of the discovery process”
is defined to include (among other things) failing to respond or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery; making, without substantial justification,
an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive response to a
discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide discovery; and making or
opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without substantial justification.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an
escalating and “incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with
monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez
v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and
commensurate with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is
required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied
discovery.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
967, 992.) “If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is
warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally
harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.;
see also, e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) 
The primary purpose of discovery sanctions is
to obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is
not to punish. (Newland v. Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608,
613; Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery sanction should not create a “windfall” for
a party or place a party in a better position than it would have been if the
opposing party had simply complied with its obligations under the Court’s
orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2024),
¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
Objections
to Evidence 
 
The
Court OVERRULES City’s objections. 
 
Discussion              
 
The motion for issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions is
denied.  During the time period at issue,
Plaintiff was in a rehabilitation facility obtaining treatment for a serious
medical condition.  Even so, he appeared for
deposition as ordered by the Court and answered City’s questions.  He was unable to produce the required documents,
however, until after his release.
 
Indeed, Plaintiff explained at his deposition
on October 17, 2024, that he was unable to produce the required documents because
of the restrictions imposed on him during his medical treatment.  (Houle-Sandoval Decl., Exh. K, at 179:11-180:9,
181:14-21, 185:4-8, 187:10-15.)
 
Under these circumstances, the Court denies
the request for evidence and issue sanctions. 
The Court finds that there has been no willful violation of a court
order.
 
The Court also denies City’s request for
monetary sanctions.  The Court finds that
under these circumstances, the imposition of further monetary sanctions would be
unjust.
 
Conclusion 
 
The Court DENIES the request of
Defendant City of Los Angeles for issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
