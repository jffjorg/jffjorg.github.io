And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to continue the trial date from February 5, 2025 to a date on or after July 29, 2025. The motion was filed by Defendant Carolyn Sanchez, who also has a motion for summary judgment set for hearing on June 23, 2025. The court found that good cause exists to continue the trial date because the summary judgment motion must be heard at least 30 days before trial. The new trial date was chosen to ensure that the summary judgment motion can be heard before trial. The court advises all parties to treat the new trial date as firm and notes that further requests for continuances will be viewed with disfavor.
