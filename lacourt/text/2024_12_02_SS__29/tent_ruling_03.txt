22STCV22618
Defendant’s Motion for Terminating, Issue, or Evidentiary Sanctions
 
Tentative
 
The Court will call this matter and speak to counsel.
 
The Court would like to hear from Plaintiff’s counsel
regarding why Plaintiff has not complied with the Order of the Court made on September
10, 2024.
 
Background
On July 13, 2022, Carmit Burstyn
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Bed Bath & Beyond and Does 1
through 30 for general negligence and premises liability arising out of an
incident on October 30, 2021, in which Plaintiff was allegedly struck by a
metal rod.
On September 16, 2022, Bed Bath
& Beyond, Inc. (“BBB”) filed an answer. On May 30, 2023, BBB filed notice
of stay of proceedings due to bankruptcy.
On November 20, 2023, Plaintiff
amended the complaint to name Studio City East 93K, LLC (“Studio”) as Doe 1. 
On March 8, 2024, Studio filed an
answer and a cross-complaint against BBB, Bed ‘N Bath O Studio City, Inc, and
Roes 1 through 50.
On September 10, 2024, the Court
granted Studio’s motions to compel Plaintiff provide verified responses to interrogatories and
document requests and granted Studio’s motion for a deemed-admitted order as to
requests for admission.  The Court also
ordered Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions to Studio. 
 
On October 17, 2024, Studio filed
this motion for terminating sanctions. On October 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.

On
October 18, 2024, on Studio’s ex parte application, the Court continued the
trial date to March 12, 2025, and reset all discovery deadlines based on the new trial date. 
Legal
Standard
 
When
a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling answers to interrogatories, “the court may make those orders that are just, including
the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to, that sanction,
the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
When
a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling responses to requests for
production, “the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to, that sanction,
the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.030 provides for monetary,
evidence, issue, and terminating sanctions for any “misuse of the discovery
process,” “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  A “misuse of the
discovery process” is defined to include (among other things) failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide
discovery; and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without
substantial justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)
The
Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and “incremental approach to
discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the
ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract
Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566,
604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate with
the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to protect
the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes v.
Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating
sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th
at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The primary
purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery
Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v. Super. Ct. (1995)
40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery sanction should not create a “windfall”
for a party or place a party in a better position than it would have been if
the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations under the Court’s
orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023),
¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
It is “never justified” for a court
to impose a terminating sanction “solely because of a failure to pay a monetary
discovery sanction.”  (Newland, supra,
40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.)
 
Discussion 
 
On September 10,
2024, the Court (among other things) ordered Plaintiff to respond to the
interrogatories and document requests propounded by Studio within 15 days of
notice.  Studio gave notice on September
12.  Plaintiff has not complied with the
Court’s Order.  (Arquell Decl., ¶ 13.)
 
Plaintiff argues in opposition that notice of the motion was
not timely served, but this issue was fully resolved when Studio rescheduled
the hearing to December 2, 2024. 
Plaintiff has received adequate notice.
 
Plaintiff also argues in the opposition that the motion was
not set to be heard at least 15 days before trial.  But the Court has continued the trial date to
March 2025 and reset all discovery deadlines based on the new trial date.
What Plaintiff does not address in
the opposition is why Plaintiff did not comply with the Court’s Order.  More than two months have passed since the deadline
set by the Court for Plaintiff to comply.
The Court will call this matter.
The Court has already granted Studio’s
request for a deemed-admitted order as to requests for admission.  Studio now seeks additional nonmonetary
sanctions: a terminating sanction or, in the alternative, issue or evidence
sanctions.
In certain circumstances, such sanctions
are appropriate for willful violations of a discovery order. 
Studio does not seek further
monetary sanctions.
Conclusion 
 
The
Court will call this matter and hear from counsel.
 
Moving party is
ordered to give notice.
