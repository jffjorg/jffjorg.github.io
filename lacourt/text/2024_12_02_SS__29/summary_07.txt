And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file an amended complaint to add a cause of action for general negligence. The plaintiff's original complaint alleged motor vehicle negligence, but the plaintiff's new counsel discovered that the complaint did not include a cause of action for general negligence. The judge determined that the plaintiff has complied with all substantive and procedural requirements for the motion and that the proposed amendment will not prejudice the defendants. The judge also noted that the defendants will have sufficient time to conduct discovery related to the new cause of action before the trial, which is set for July 3, 2025. The judge denied the defendants' argument that the statute of limitations on a general negligence cause of action has run, as the court will not adjudicate affirmative defenses or determine whether the relation back doctrine applies on a motion for leave to amend.
