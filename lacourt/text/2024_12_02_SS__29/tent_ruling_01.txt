Legal
Standard
 
Per California Rules of Court (CRC), rule 3.1332, subdivision (c): the
court may grant a continuance for “good cause,” which includes: (1)
unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness due to death, illness, or
other excusable circumstances; (2) unavailability of a party due to death,
illness, or other excusable circumstances; (3) unavailability of trial counsel
due to death, illness, or other excusable circumstances; (4) substitution of
trial counsel required in the interests of justice; (5) addition of a new party
or other parties in regard to a new party’s involvement hasn’t had a reasonable
opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial; (6) party’s excused
inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence
despite diligent efforts; or (7) significant, unanticipated change in the
status of the case as a result of which indicates the case is not ready for
trial. (CRC Rule 3.1332(c).)
 
Other relevant factors to be considered may include: “(1) the proximity
of the trial date; (2) whether there was any previous continuance, extension of
time, or delay of trial due to any party; (3) the length of the continuance
requested; (4) the availability of alternative means to address the problem
that gave rise to the motion or application for a continuance; (5) the
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;
(6) if the case is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for
that status and whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid
delay; (7) the court’s calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on
other pending trials; (8) whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial; (9)
whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance; (10) whether the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the
matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and (11) any other fact
or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application” (CRC Rule 3.1332(d).)
 
Discussion
 
Here, Defendant Sanchez moves for an
order continuing the current trial date and all related dates including the
final status conference to a date no less than 30 days after June 23, 2025.
Sanchez has a motion for summary judgment set for hearing on June 23, 2025. 
 
The Court finds that good cause
exists to continue the current trial date. A motion for summary judgment must
be heard no later than 30 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(a)(3).)
The current trial date is set for February 5, 2025, which is three months
before the summary judgment motion is set to be heard by the Court. Sanchez
reserved the summary judgment motion for the first available date in accordance
with Los Angeles Superior Court’s Eighth Amended Order. (Karayan Decl., ¶¶5-6,
8-9.) Sanchez has a right to have the timely filed summary judgment motion
heard before trial.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
GRANTS Defendant Sanchez’s motion to continue trial.
 
The Court
CONTINUES trial to a date on or after July 29, 2025. The Final Status
Conference and all discovery deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
 
The Court
ADVISES all parties to treat the new trial date as FIRM. Further requests for a
continuance will be viewed with disfavor. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
