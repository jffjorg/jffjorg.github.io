And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the case. The court previously sustained the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint, and ordered the plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 20 days. The plaintiff then filed a motion to request an extension to file the amended complaint, citing a serious illness and hospitalization. However, the plaintiff did not file the amended complaint and has not opposed the defendant's motion to dismiss. The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to request an extension and granted the defendant's motion to dismiss. The case will be dismissed unless the plaintiff files a second amended complaint by the hearing date.
