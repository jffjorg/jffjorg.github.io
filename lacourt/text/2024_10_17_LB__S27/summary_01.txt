And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the parties' settlement agreement and the motion to enforce it. The defendant seeks to enforce the settlement agreement and reduce it to a binding judgment, while the plaintiff opposes the motion. The plaintiff argues that the settlement agreement contains terms not present in the original offer, and that the agreement cannot be enforced because it was not personally signed. The judge notes that the parties' correspondence contemplated the defendant drawing up the final version of the agreement and release for signature, and that the court will deny the motion if it finds the final version of the agreement contained a material variance from the terms of the parties' offer and acceptance correspondence. The judge also notes that the language at issue is boilerplate and does not appear to meaningfully change the parties' settlement agreement. The judge wishes to hear from the plaintiff at the time of the hearing about how the additional term has materially affected the parties' settlement agreement. The judge will hear argument at the hearing on the issue of inclusion of third parties in the release and will grant the motion if the parties submit on the tentative.
