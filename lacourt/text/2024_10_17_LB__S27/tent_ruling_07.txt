 Case Number:  23LBCV02486    Hearing Date:   October 17, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.     History
of Discovery Dispute
Defendant propounded RPDs on
Plaintiff on 4/18/24.  The parties agreed
to extend time to respond to 6/12/24. 
Plaintiff responded on 6/13/24, indicating it would produce responsive
documents.  On 6/21/24, Defendant wrote
to Plaintiff, demanding production by 6/28/24. 
On 7/03/24, Defendant filed this motion. 
On 7/05/24, Plaintiff produced responsive documents.  On 7/19/24, Plaintiff produced the remaining
responsive documents.  
 
2.     Sanctions
The parties agree that the sole
remaining issue is whether to impose sanctions. 
Sanctions are not imposed for two reasons.  First, in both the moving papers and the
reply, Defendant seeks sanctions pursuant to CCP §2031.320(c), which provides
for sanctions in the event the Court orders production and the party subject to
the order continues to fail to produce documents.  Despite Plaintiff pointing out the fact that
the correct section would be §2031.320(b) in the opposition, Defendant
continues to rely on §2031.320(c) in reply. 
Defendant therefore did not provide any applicable authority in support
of the request for sanctions.
 
Additionally, while §2031.320 does
not impose any timeline for production of documents after indicating an intent
to produce, the Court finds Defendant acted unreasonably in waiting only one
week after receiving responses to demand production and, in said demand, giving
only one week to comply.  The Court finds
Plaintiff acted reasonably in producing documents on 7/05/24 and 7/19/24,
approximately a month after promising compliance in its responses, and six
months prior to the parties’ scheduled trial date.  
 
The motion is substantively
moot.  The request for sanctions is
denied.
 
Defendant is ordered to give
notice.
