 Case Number:  23LBCV01923    Hearing Date:   October 17, 2024    Dept:  S27 Defendants’ attorney of record,
John B. Stephens, moves to be relieved as counsel for Defendants, Jason
McKeever and Matrix Environmental, Inc. 
Counsel contends there has been a breakdown in communication that precludes
further representation.  
 
The motion is denied.  It is set to be heard unreasonably close to
the trial date.  The trial date in the
case is 11/12/24, and the FSC is scheduled for 11/08/24, less than one month
after this motion.  
 
Unlike their clients, attorneys do
not have an absolute right to withdraw from representation at any time with or
without cause. Even where grounds for termination exist, attorneys seeking to
withdraw must comply with the procedures set forth in California Rule of
Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3-700 and are subject to discipline for failure to
do so.  Where withdrawal is not
mandatory, an attorney normally must continue representation on the matter
undertaken. The fact the client or matter proves unpleasant or unprofitable
does not excuse attorney performance. The rules have been liberally construed
to protect clients.  See Vann v. Shilleh
(1975) 54 Cal.App.3d 192, 197; Chaleff v. Superior Court (1977) 69 Cal.App.3d
721; Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915. 
 
 An attorney, either with the client's consent
or the court's approval, may withdraw from a case when withdrawal can be
accomplished without undue prejudice to the client's interests.  A lawyer violates his or her ethical mandate
by abandoning a client (Pineda v. State Bar (1989) 49 Cal.3d 753, 758 759), or
by withdrawing at a critical point and thereby prejudicing the client’s case. CRPC
3 700(A)(2); Vann, supra, 54 Cal.App.3d at p. 197.  
 
Counsel is ordered to give
notice.
