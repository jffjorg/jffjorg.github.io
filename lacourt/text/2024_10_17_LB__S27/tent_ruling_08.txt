 Case Number:  24LBCV00778    Hearing Date:   October 17, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.     Background
Facts
Plaintiff, George Britt, Deceased,
by and through his Heirs and Successors in Interest Margaret Britt and Marshee
Webb, filed this action against Defendants, Colonial Care Center, Inc. and Long
wood Management Corporation for elder abuse and related claims.  
 
2.     Motion
to Compel Arbitration
Defendants move to compel arbitration. 
Defendants show Decedent’s legal representative, Marshee Webb, signed an
agreement requiring all claims against Defendants to be resolved by way of
binding arbitration.  Absent a specific
showing of non-arbitrability, CCP §1281.2 mandates granting a petition to
compel arbitration when there is a signed arbitration agreement governing the
parties’ dispute.  Any opposition to the
motion was due on or before Friday, 10/04/24. 
The Court has not received timely opposition, and will not consider
late-filed opposition.  In the absence of
opposition, Plaintiff necessarily failed to show any exception to the
arbitration agreement applies.  The
motion to compel arbitration is therefore granted.  
 
CCP §1281.4 requires the Court to stay the action pending the outcome
of binding arbitration.  This action is
therefore stayed.  The Court retains
jurisdiction to rule on any motion to confirm, vacate, or alter the arbitration
award.  
 
3.     Case
Management Conference
The parties are reminded that there
is a CMC on calendar concurrently with the hearing on this motion to compel
arbitration.  The Court asks Counsel to
make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on the motion and the CMC.
