And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in a discovery dispute between the parties. The dispute centers around whether sanctions should be imposed on the plaintiff for failing to produce documents in a timely manner. The Court finds that the defendant did not provide any applicable authority in support of its request for sanctions and that the defendant acted unreasonably in waiting only one week after receiving responses to demand production. The plaintiff, on the other hand, acted reasonably in producing documents approximately a month after promising compliance. As a result, the Court denies the defendant's request for sanctions. The motion is substantively moot and the parties are ordered to give notice.
