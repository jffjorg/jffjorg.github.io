 Case Number:  23LBCV01493    Hearing Date:   October 17, 2024    Dept:  S27 The Court called this case for an
OSC re: dismissal (settlement) on 8/15/24. The Court noted that no dismissal
had been filed.  The Court also noted
that a hearing on a motion for attorneys’ fees had been scheduled for
1/16/25.  The Court rescheduled the
hearing on the motion for attorneys’ fees for 10/17/24 and continued the OSC
re: dismissal to 10/17/24.   
 
 To date, Plaintiff has not filed any papers in
connection with the motion for fees.  The
Court therefore takes the motion off calendar. 

 
The parties are reminded that there
is an OSC re: dismissal (settlement) on calendar today.  The Court asks the parties to make
arrangements to appear at the hearing remotely.
