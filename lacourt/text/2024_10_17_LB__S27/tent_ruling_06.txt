 Case Number:  23LBCV02382    Hearing Date:   October 17, 2024    Dept:  S27 Defense Counsel seeks to be
relieved as counsel, declaring the attorney-client relationship has
deteriorated and is no longer tenable. 
Counsel failed to file and serve a proposed order on the motion, as is
required by CRC 3.1362(d) and (e).  
 
Notably, the motion may be moot in
light of the Court’s 10/08/24 ruling denying Defendant’s motion to vacate
default.  Defendant is in default and
cannot participate in this action, whether through an attorney or not.  To the extent the motion is not moot, it is
denied due to failure to file and serve a proposed order on the motion.  
 
Counsel is ordered to give notice.
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative

the department does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting
on the tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be
placed off calendar.  If a party
submits on the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and
must identify the party submitting on the tentative. If any party does not
