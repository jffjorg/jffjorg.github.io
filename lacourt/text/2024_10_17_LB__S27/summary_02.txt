And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a hearing scheduled for October 17, 2024. The hearing is to consider the dismissal of the case and a motion for attorneys' fees. The court notes that no dismissal has been filed and that the motion for attorneys' fees was previously scheduled for January 16, 2025, but has been rescheduled for October 17, 2024. Since the plaintiff has not filed any papers in connection with the motion for fees, the court has taken it off calendar. The parties are reminded that the hearing on the OSC re: dismissal (settlement) is still scheduled for October 17, 2024, and are asked to make arrangements to appear remotely.
