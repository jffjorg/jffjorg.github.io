And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by defense counsel seeking to be relieved from representing the Defendant. The motion is based on the claim that the attorney-client relationship has deteriorated and is no longer tenable. However, the Judge has denied the motion due to defense counsel's failure to file and serve a proposed order on the motion. Additionally, the Judge notes that the motion may be moot because the Defendant is in default and cannot participate in the action. The Judge has ordered defense counsel to give notice and has instructed parties who intend to submit on the tentative ruling to send an email to the court.
