And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion of John B. Stephens, the attorney of record for defendants Jason McKeever and Matrix Environmental, Inc., to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in communication with his clients, but the judge found that Stephens must continue to represent his clients until the case is concluded, as per California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3-700. The judge noted that attorneys do not have an absolute right to withdraw from representation at any time, and that even where grounds for termination exist, attorneys must comply with the procedures set forth in CRPC 3-700 and are subject to discipline for failure to do so. The judge ordered Stephens to give notice of the ruling and set the motion to be heard on October 17, 2024.
