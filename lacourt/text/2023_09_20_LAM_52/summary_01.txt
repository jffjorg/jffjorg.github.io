And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike portions of the first amended complaint filed by defendants Paul Sandweiss and Christian Schrader. The plaintiff, Robert La Masney, brings a derivative action on behalf of Crowd Control Group, LLC, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties and engaged in oppressive and fraudulent conduct.

The judge has overruled the defendants' demurrer, finding that the plaintiff has standing to bring the derivative action despite the dissolution of the LLC. The judge also rejects the defendants' argument that the plaintiff lacks standing because he does not meet the continuous membership requirement.

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to strike portions of the first amended complaint, including allegations related to the dissolution of the LLC, the buy-out event, and the failure to follow the provisions of the Operating Agreement. The judge finds that the allegations are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages and that the defendants' conduct could be considered oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious.

The judge orders the defendants to answer the complaint within 20 days.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike portions of the first amended complaint filed by defendants Paul Sandweiss and Christian Schrader. The demurrer challenges the plaintiff's standing to bring a derivative action on behalf of Crowd Control Group, LLC, alleging that the plaintiff does not meet the continuous membership requirement. The judge has ruled that the plaintiff does meet this requirement, citing case law that holds that shareholders of a dissolved limited liability company (LLC) may still bring a derivative action.

The motion to strike portions of the first amended complaint challenges several allegations, including those related to reinstatement of the LLC, accounting, and punitive damages. The judge has ruled that the motion to strike is denied, finding that the allegations are sufficient to support the claims.

The judge has also overruled the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff has adequately alleged the necessary elements to bring a derivative action. The defendants are ordered to answer the complaint within 20 days.

**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses a legal dispute between Robert La Masney (Plaintiff) and Paul Sandweiss and Christian Schrader (Defendants) regarding Crowd Control Group, LLC, a company of which La Masney was a member.

The Defendants moved to dismiss certain claims and strike portions of the Plaintiff's complaint. The main issues were:

1. **Continuous Membership:** The Defendants argued La Masney couldn't sue on behalf of the dissolved LLC because he wasn't a continuous member. The Judge disagreed, citing legal precedent that dissolution doesn't automatically end membership rights. 
2. **Injury to Company:** Defendants argued La Masney's injury was personal, not to the LLC, and that he couldn't bring a derivative action. The Judge rejected this, stating La Masney could bring both individual and derivative claims.
3. **Reinstatement, Accounting, and Punitive Damages:** The defendants also sought to strike parts of the complaint related to reinstatement of the LLC, seeking an accounting, and seeking punitive damages. The Judge denied these motions, finding La Masney's allegations sufficient in each case. 

Ultimately, the Judge denied the Defendants' demurrer (motion to dismiss) and motion to strike.  

This ruling means the case will proceed to trial, where the Defendants will have to respond to the Plaintiff's allegations.

**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023

**Dept:** 52

**Parties:**

- Plaintiff: Robert La Masney
- Defendants: Paul Sandweiss and Christian Schrader
- Nominal Defendant: Crowd Control Group, LLC (Crowd Control)

**Facts & Disputes:**

- Plaintiff La Masney brought a derivative action on behalf of Crowd Control against defendants Sandweiss and Schrader.
- Defendants demurred to the sixth and seventh causes of action, arguing that La Masney lacks standing as he does not meet the continuous membership requirement.
- La Masney alleges he was a member of Crowd Control at the time of the transaction and throughout the litigation.
- Defendants argue that the dissolution or cancellation of Crowd Control prohibits La Masney from meeting the continuous membership requirement.
- The court, however, finds that the dissolution of a company does not cease the existence of its shareholders or their rights and potential liabilities with respect to the dissolved corporation.
- Defendants also argued that the injury was to La Masney personally, not the LLC, but the court finds that a minority shareholder may bring a derivative action against majority shareholders as an individual claim or as a derivative claim, depending on the circumstances.
- Defendants moved to strike nine portions of the first amended complaint, but the court finds their arguments improperly rely on extrinsic evidence.

**Laws & Statutes:**

- Corporations Code, § 17709.02(a)(1)
- Code Civ. Proc., § 437(a)
- Evid. Code, § 452
- Civil Code section 3294

- "As a matter of public policy, since the shareholders may be responsible for postdissolution claims against the corporation, there is no reason to deny them the right to bring a derivative action, which may benefit them postdissolution, as long as the requirements of Corporations Code section 800 are met." (Favila, supra, 188 Cal.App.4th at p. 215)
- "The principles governing derivative actions in the context of corporations apply to limited liability companies." (Sirott v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 371, 381)

- "Courts may strike allegations related to punitive damages where the facts alleged do not rise to the level of malice, oppression or fraud necessary to recover punitive damages under Civil Code section 3294." (Turman v. Turning Point of Central California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 64)
