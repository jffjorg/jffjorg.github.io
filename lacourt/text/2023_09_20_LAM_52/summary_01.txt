And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike portions of the first amended complaint filed by defendants Paul Sandweiss and Christian Schrader. The plaintiff, Robert La Masney, brings a derivative action on behalf of Crowd Control Group, LLC, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties and engaged in oppressive and fraudulent conduct.

The judge has overruled the defendants' demurrer, finding that the plaintiff has standing to bring the derivative action despite the dissolution of the LLC. The judge also rejects the defendants' argument that the plaintiff lacks standing because he does not meet the continuous membership requirement.

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to strike portions of the first amended complaint, including allegations related to the dissolution of the LLC, the buy-out event, and the failure to follow the provisions of the Operating Agreement. The judge finds that the allegations are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages and that the defendants' conduct could be considered oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious.

The judge orders the defendants to answer the complaint within 20 days.
