## Tentative Ruling Summary: Case 23STCV11962

**Case Number:** 23STCV11962
**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023
**Department:** 52

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Julio Cesar Mejia Sorto
* **Defendant:** Hyundai Motor America

**Key Documents:**

* Purchase Agreement between Plaintiff and Downey Hyundai (non-party)
* Hyundai Owner's Handbook & Warranty Information

**Issue:**

* Defendant Hyundai Motor America's motion to compel arbitration

**Judge's Reasoning:**

* The judge finds that the arbitration provision in the Owner's Handbook & Warranty Information is enforceable.
* This provision requires arbitration for any disputes related to the vehicle purchase, use, or warranty, except for personal injury claims and those under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.
* Plaintiff argues the arbitration provision is "buried" in the lengthy warranty booklet, raising procedural unconscionability concerns.
* However, the judge finds that plaintiff has not demonstrated substantive unconscionability.
* The judge notes that Hyundai is not a signatory to the initial purchase agreement but can still enforce the arbitration clause in the Owner's Handbook & Warranty Information based on the principle of estoppel. 

**Disposition:**

* Defendant Hyundai Motor America's motion to compel arbitration is **GRANTED**.
* The action is **STAYED** pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding. 




## English Summary

The judge rules that Hyundai Motor America can force Julio Cesar Mejia Sorto to resolve his case through arbitration.  
 
The judge bases this decision on an arbitration clause found in Hyundai's Owner's Handbook & Warranty Information, which Sorto agreed to by accepting the benefits of the warranty. While Sorto argues the clause is buried in the lengthy handbook, the judge finds this doesn't make it unconscionable. The judge also notes that even though Hyundai wasn't a direct party to the initial purchase agreement, it can still enforce the arbitration clause. As a result, the court case is paused while the arbitration proceeds.
