And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Hyundai Motor America, moves to compel arbitration of the action brought by the plaintiff, Julio Cesar Mejia Sorto. The defendant relies on two arbitration provisions: one in the purchase contract between the plaintiff and a non-party dealership, Downey Hyundai, and another in the plaintiff's vehicle's Owner's Handbook and Warranty Information. The judge finds that the latter arbitration provision is enforceable and grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The judge notes that the plaintiff's opposition to the motion only briefly addresses the arbitration provision in the Owner's Handbook and Warranty Information, and that the plaintiff does not show that the agreement is unconscionable. The judge concludes that the arbitration provision is fair and mutual, and orders the plaintiff to arbitrate the action against the defendant. The court hereby stays the entire action pending resolution of the arbitration proceeding.
