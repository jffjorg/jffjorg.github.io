The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Hyundai Motor America's motion to compel arbitration in the case of Julio Cesar Mejia Sorto v. Hyundai Motor America. The Judge found that the arbitration provision in the vehicle's Owner's Handbook & Warranty Information is enforceable, and that Plaintiff Mejia Sorto is required to arbitrate his claims against Defendant Hyundai Motor America. The Judge rejected Plaintiff's argument that the arbitration provision is unconscionable, finding that it is fair and mutual. The court has stayed the entire action pending resolution of the arbitration proceeding. The Judge's decision is based on the arbitration provision in the Owner's Handbook & Warranty Information, which provides that any claims or disputes between the parties related to the vehicle purchase, use, or warranty shall be resolved by binding arbitration. The Judge found that Defendant Hyundai Motor America can enforce this arbitration agreement, despite being a non-signatory to the purchase contract, because Plaintiff Mejia Sorto is seeking the benefits of the express written warranty, which contains the arbitration clause.
