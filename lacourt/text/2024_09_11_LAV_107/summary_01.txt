And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to reopen discovery and depose defendant's experts is granted in part. The court has reopened discovery for 30 days from the date of the hearing, allowing the plaintiffs to depose defendant's experts Dr. Jay Tsuruda and Dr. Ranon Udkoff. The judge found that the plaintiffs have demonstrated good cause for the limited reopening of discovery, as they are at a disadvantage at trial without deposition testimony of their own experts. The judge also considered the delay in bringing the motion and found that it was sufficient due to the unexpected continuance of the trial. The judge denied the defendant's opposition to the motion, finding that the plaintiffs were not at fault for the delay and that the depositions can be conducted prior to trial without harming judicial economy.
