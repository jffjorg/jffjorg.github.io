COURT’S
  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
 
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
 



 
BACKGROUND
 
            On May 17, 2021, Maria Salgado and
Alexis Banuelos (Plaintiffs) filed a Complaint against Southern California
Edison Company, alleging a sole cause of action of wrongful death in
negligence. This case stems from a motorcycle accident that took place on
December 28, 2019, at the intersection of Florence Avenue and Crofton Avenue in
the City of Bell California. (Complaint, ¶¶ 4-5.) There, Ismael Banuelos
Quintero (Decedent) was operating his motorcycle when he struck the curb, was
ejected off of the motorcycle, struck a “guy wire”, suffered fatal injuries,
and died after arriving at the hospital. (Complaint, ¶ 7.) 
 
            On June 28, 2022, Defendant Southern
California Edison Company (SCE) filed this motion for summary judgment. 
 
            On August 4, 2022, Plaintiffs amended
their initial Complaint to substitute Doe 1 for Crown Castle Fiber, LLC, the
company that installed the guy wire at issue. 
 
On
June 22, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion for summary
judgment and requested that the Court continue the hearing pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 437c(h). 
 
On
June 29, 2023, Defendant filed a reply. 
 
On
July 6, 2023, the Court continued the hearing at Plaintiffs’ request. 
 
            On August 28, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
a supplemental opposition. 
 
            To date, no supplemental reply has
been filed.
 
The
motion now before the Court is Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment (the
Motion). The Court considers the moving papers, the supplemental opposing
papers, and the original filed reply on June 29, 2023.

Plaintiffs’ request for judicial notice.
 
Legal Standard
 
            The function of a motion
for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether
an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and
to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001)
25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) CCP Section 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler
v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  
 
            “The function of the
pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento
(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.)
 
            As to each claim as
framed by the complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy
the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element,
or to establish a defense. (CCP § 437c(p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.)
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing
summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006)
39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
            Once the defendant has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable
issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a
defense thereto. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party
opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
 
Statement of Facts
 
            SCE’s Statement of
Facts
 
On December 28, 2019, Ismael Banuelos Quintero
(Decedent) died after being ejected from his motorcycle and striking a “guy
wire” located at 5150 East Florence Avenue, Bell, California. (UMF No. 1.)
Plaintiffs allege that the guy wire was “dangerous and lacked a covering” that
could have prevented the injuries suffered by Decedent. (UMF No. 2.) The guy
wire was attached to joint utility pole number 4452100E, which contains both
electrical and telecommunications equipment. (UMF Nos. 3-4.) Decedent only made
contact with the guy wire and did not contact the pole or any other equipment
attached to it. (UMF No. 5.)
 
SCE owns, maintains, and controls the electrical
equipment on utility pole number 4452100E but does not own, maintain, or
control the telecommunications equipment. (UMF Nos. 6-7.) The guy wire is
attached to the telecommunications level of the utility pole. (UMF No. 8.) SCE
did not own, maintain, or control the guy wire at any time; instead, a
telecommunications company was responsible for its ownership, maintenance, and
control. (UMF Nos. 9-10.) SCE also asserts that it does not install, maintain,
or repair any facilities not owned by SCE on joint utility poles and did not
have any involvement with the guy wire in question. (UMF Nos. 11-12.)
 
Plaintiffs assert a single cause of action against
SCE for negligence – wrongful death. (Complaint ¶¶ 15-24.) 
 
            Plaintiffs’ Statement
of Facts
 
On or about December 28, 2019, Decedent was ejected
from his motorcycle and struck a guy wire attached to a jointly owned utility
pole, resulting in his death. The utility pole in question was jointly owned by
members of the Joint Pole Association (JPA), including SCE and Crown Castle
Fiber, LLC (CCF). The guy wire was attached to the utility pole by CCF to
provide stabilizing support because telecommunications equipment was also
attached to the pole by CCF. (Burgos Decl. ¶¶ 6-7, Exh’s. 2-3; Marshall Decl. ¶¶
3-4; Khalid Decl. ¶¶ 1, 11.)
 
The Southern California Joint Pole Committee
(SCJPC), which includes both SCE and CCF, governs the management of joint
utility poles, as described on the SCJPC’s website. Once the guy wire was
attached, it became an integral part of the joint pole configuration,
stabilizing the pole by counteracting forces such as power lines, fiber optic
equipment, and wind. (Burgos Decl. ¶¶ 6-7, Exh’s. 2-3; Khalid Decl. ¶¶ 1, 11.) 
 
The guy wire benefited SCE by maintaining the
stability of the pole to which SCE’s electrical facilities were attached.
(Khalid Decl. ¶¶ 1, 11.) Although SCE claims it does not own, maintain, or
control the telecommunications equipment or the guy wire, SCE, as a member of
the JPA and SCJPC, shared a joint interest in the pole and benefited from the
guy wire’s stabilizing function. (Burgos Decl. ¶¶ 6-7, Exh’s. 2-3; Marshall
Decl. ¶¶ 3-4; Khalid Decl. ¶¶ 1, 11.)
 
Analysis
 
“The
elements of a cause of action for wrongful death are a tort, such as
negligence, and resulting death.” (Lopez v. City of Los Angeles (2011)
196 Cal.App.4th 675, 685.) In order to state a claim for negligence, Plaintiffs
must allege the elements of (1) “the existence of a legal duty of care,” (2)
“breach of that duty,” and (3) “proximate cause resulting in an injury.” (McIntyre v. Colonies-Pacific, LLC (2014)
228 Cal.App.4th 664, 671.)
 
            Duty
SCE moves
for summary judgment, arguing that it did not owe a legal duty of care to
Plaintiffs because it did not own the guy wire alleged to have caused the
death. SCE argues that it did not own,
maintain, or control the guy wire alleged to have caused the death of
Plaintiffs’ deceased. SCE contends that no duty of care exists because it did
not have ownership, possession, or control over the guy wire in question. 
SCE
states a defendant cannot be liable for a defective or dangerous condition on
property it does not own, possess, or control. (Gray v. America West
Airlines, Inc. (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 76; Whitney’s at the Beach v. Hovis
(1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 258.) In Gray, the court affirmed summary judgment
for the defendant airline in a premises liability case because the airline did
not own or control the luggage that caused the plaintiff’s injury. (Gray,
supra, 209 Cal.App.3d at 79-85.) Similarly, in Whitney’s at
the Beach, the court granted summary judgment for the defendant because no
evidence was presented that contradicted the defendant’s denial of ownership,
possession, or control of the skating rink where the injury occurred. (Whitney’s
at the Beach, supra, 3 Cal.App.3d at 267, 269.) SCE argues
that it is an electric utility, not involved in the telecommunications or cable
TV business, and that a telecommunications company owned, maintained, and
controlled the guy wire at all relevant times. SCE further asserts that it does
not install, maintain, or repair any facilities not owned by it on joint
utility poles, and it had no involvement with the guy wire in question.
Therefore, under California law, SCE argues that it cannot be liable for
injuries caused by property it does not own, maintain, or control.
 
            In their supplemental opposition, Plaintiffs
argue that SCE owes a legal duty to them due to its joint ownership and control
of the utility pole and the attached guy wire, contrary to SCE’s reliance on
cases such as Gray and Whitney’s at the Beach. Unlike in Gray,
where the airline did not control the common area where the injury occurred, in
this case, Plaintiffs assert that SCE had control over the joint utility pole
and the installation of the guy wire when the telecommunications equipment was
attached. (Gray, supra, 209 Cal.App.3d 76.). Similarly, in
Whitney’s at the Beach, the court found the defendant did not own or
control the premises where the injury happened; however, here, Plaintiffs state
that SCE is a joint owner of the utility pole and had control over its
placement and the guy wire, which benefited its operations by stabilizing the
pole. (Whitney’s at the Beach, supra, 3 Cal.App.3d 258.) 
 
Plaintiffs
assert that all entities, including public utilities, have a general duty to exercise
reasonable care in managing their property. (Laabs v. Southern California
Edison Co. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1271-1272; Bily v. Arthur Young
& Co. (1992) 3 Cal.4th 370, 397.) As a member of the JPA, Plaintiffs
assert that SCE holds a joint ownership interest in the utility pole and any
appurtenances, including the guy wire. Plaintiffs argue that provisions in the
JPA create joint ownership and shared responsibility for the utility poles and
appurtenances. Section 2(b) of the JPA allows members like SCE to propose and
approve work on jointly owned poles, indicating control over the installation
of appurtenances such as the guy wire. Section 2(i) establishes that utility
poles are jointly owned as tenants in common, making all members, including
SCE, jointly liable for any tortious conduct related to the property. (Davert
v. Larson (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 407, 411.) Section 3(A) and 3(b) confirm
that all JPA members jointly own or occupy the poles and benefit from
appurtenances like the guy wire, which stabilizes the pole and prevents
potential hazards. Additionally, Section 6(b)(2) and Section 9 require members
to maintain liability insurance and indemnify each other for claims arising
from injuries or deaths due to negligence, indicating shared liability among
all members.
 
Plaintiffs
further contend that SCE, as a tenant in common with other JPA members, has
equal rights of possession and ownership of the utility pole, which includes
liability for any negligence connected to the pole or its appurtenances. (Johns
v. Scobie (1939) 12 Cal.2d 618, 623.) The JPA presumes joint liability of
all members for injuries to third parties and does not limit liability solely
to the member who placed the equipment on the pole. While the JPA provides for
negligent members to indemnify and hold harmless other members, this does not
absolve SCE of liability to third parties. Plaintiffs cite Myers Building
Industries, Ltd. v. Interface Technology, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 949,
969 to argue that indemnification clauses generally apply to reimbursements
between members and do not eliminate liability toward third parties. Therefore,
Plaintiffs contend that SCE owes a duty of care to them, as outlined in the
JPA, due to its joint ownership and the benefit derived from the guy wire,
which was necessary to support the stability of the utility pole.
 
            In the reply filed on June 29, 2023,
SCE argues that the cases cited by the Plaintiffs—Gerberich v. SCE
(1935) 5 Cal.2d 46, Laabs v. SCE (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1260, Schauf
v. SCE (1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 450, and Norton v. City of Pomona (1935)
5 Cal.2d 54—are irrelevant to this case because none of them involved a guy
wire owned and controlled by a telecommunications company. Instead, all of the
cited cases involved utility poles. In this case, Plaintiffs allege that the
guy wire, not the utility pole, was the contributing factor to the accident,
claiming it was “dangerous and lacked a covering which would have prevented
injuries of the type suffered by decedent.” (UMF No. 2, citing Complaint.) The Decedent
only made contact with the guy wire and did not make contact with the utility
pole itself. (UMF No. 5.) SCE further contends that unlike the defendants in
the cases cited by the Plaintiffs, it is not arguing that it has no duty
because the guy wire is in a franchise position. Instead, SCE argues that it
has no duty because it does not own or control the guy wire. (UMF Nos. 3-12.)
SCE maintains that a defendant cannot be held liable for a defective or
dangerous condition on property it does not own, possess, or control, relying
on Gray and Whitney’s at the Beach.
 
The
Court finds that there are no triable issues of fact indicating that SCE owed a
duty of care to the Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs’ argument that the JPA creates a
duty for SCE fails. Plaintiffs claim that SCE cannot avoid liability by stating
that CCF was responsible for the installation, maintenance and control of the
guy wire because SCE and CCF are both tenants in common to the JPA, and all
members to the JPA are jointly liable. While the JPA governs the joint
ownership and management of utility poles among its members, the Court
previously determined that there was no duty owed in relation to CCF’s
installation of the guy wire. Under Rowland v. Christian (1968) 69
Cal.2d 108 (Rowland), whether a duty is owed is determined by weighing seven
factors: (1) the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff; (2) the degree of
certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury; (3) the closeness of the
connection between the defendant's conduct and the injury suffered; (4) the
moral blame attached to the defendant's conduct; (5) the policy of preventing
future harm; (6) the extent of the burden to the defendant and the consequences
to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability
for breach; and (7) the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the
risk involved. 
 
The
Court incorporates its previous duty analysis from the minute order regarding
CCF’s motion for summary judgment, where it found that the Rowland factors
weigh in favor of imposing no duty on CCF. Given this finding, without a duty,
the cause of action against CCF failed. Accordingly, even if the JPA
establishes that all members jointly own the utility poles and could
potentially be subject to liability for the negligence of another member,
Plaintiffs fail to establish that SCE owed a duty of care. This is because the
Court has already found that CCF’s installation of the guy wire did not give
rise to a duty. Therefore, without a foundational duty established in
connection with the guy wire’s installation, there can be no derivative duty
imposed on SCE under the terms of the JPA.
 
            Thus, there is no duty imposed on
SCE.
 
            Causation
SCE argues that its actions were not a substantial factor in causing the
injury claimed in the negligence suit. In negligence cases, to prove causation,
the plaintiff must show that the defendant’s act or omission was a “substantial
factor” in bringing about the injury. (Saelzler v. Advanced Group 400
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 763, 774; Merrill v. Navegar Inc. (2001) 26 Cal.4th
465, 490).) A defendant’s conduct is not considered a substantial factor if the
injury would have occurred regardless of that conduct. (Yanez v. Plummer
(2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 180, 187.) As noted by the California Supreme Court, a
factor that plays only an “infinitesimal” or “theoretical” role in causing harm
does not meet the substantial factor standard. (Bockrath v. Aldrich Chem.
Co., Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 79.) While causation is typically a
question for the jury, it can be decided as a matter of law on summary judgment
if undisputed facts show that the defendant’s actions were not a substantial
factor in causing harm, as the harm would have occurred regardless of those
actions. (Lawrence v. La Jolla Beach & Tennis Club (2014) 231
Cal.App.4th 11, 33.) A plaintiff cannot avoid summary judgment by making
abstract allegations of negligence or relying on speculative expert testimony;
they must demonstrate that the injury was actually caused by the defendant’s
conduct. (Saelzler, supra, 25 Cal.4th at 774-776.) SCE
asserts that no act or omission on its part was a substantial factor in causing
the death of the Decedent. Plaintiffs allege that the guy wire was “dangerous
and lacked a covering” that could have prevented the injuries suffered. (UMF
No. 2.) However, SCE reiterates that it did not own, maintain, or control the
guy wire in question, which was managed by a telecommunications company. 
            In opposition, Plaintiffs argue that SCE was a
substantial factor in causing the injuries that resulted in the death of Decedent.
SCE contends that it did not perform any act that could be considered actual or
legal causation of Decedent’s death and that its actions regarding the guy wire
were so minimal that they cannot be considered a substantial factor. Plaintiffs
point out that SCE’s argument relies on the claim that it did not install or
maintain the guy wire; therefore, its actions could not have contributed to the
accident. However, Plaintiff states that SCE determined the placement of the
utility pole, which in turn determined the placement of the guy wire. Moreover,
SCE ratified the installation of the guy wire, which was necessary to stabilize
the utility pole and directly benefited SCE. Plaintiffs rely on Laabs v.
Southern California Edison Co. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1268-1269, to
argue that SCE had a duty of care, which is a legal determination based on
factors such as the foreseeability of harm, the connection between the
defendant's conduct and the injury, and the policy of preventing future harm. In
Laabs, the court found it foreseeable that a vehicle could lose control
and strike a light pole placed 18 inches from the curb, creating a triable
issue regarding the foreseeability of the event. Plaintiffs assert that the
facts in this case are similar, as it is foreseeable that a motorcyclist could
lose control for various reasons and collide with a guy wire placed near the
roadway. Here, SCE placed the utility pole 18 inches from the roadway, which
necessitated the guy wire’s placement at the same distance, acting as a
dangerous obstacle when Decedent struck it at high speed. Plaintiffs argue that
if the utility pole and guy wire had been positioned further from the street or
in a safer location, the impact could have been less severe, potentially
preventing Decedent’s death.
Furthermore, Plaintiffs contend that even if SCE installed the utility
pole according to California Public Utility Commission guidelines, this does
not exempt it from negligence. In Laabs, the court noted that
compliance with local guidelines does not negate a utility company’s duty of
care in determining the safest placement of utility poles. Plaintiffs maintain
that, like in Laabs, SCE had input into the placement decision and could
have chosen a safer location. Additionally, the Laabs court stated that
the likelihood of serious injury or death increases when a vehicle collides
with a fixed object near a roadway, and this principle also applies to the
placement of the guy wire in this case. (Laabs, supra, 175
Cal.App.4th at 1277-1278.) Plaintiffs argue that all of the facts presented by
SCE in its motion for summary judgment are disputed. They assert that as a
joint owner of the utility pole, SCE owed a legal duty to maintain the pole and
the guy wire in a way that accounted for foreseeable risks. Plaintiffs claim
that SCE’s suggestion that it does not owe a duty is conjectural and
unsupported by facts, while the JPA clearly establishes SCE as a joint owner of
the utility pole, thereby making it jointly liable for any negligent actions of
co-members of the JPA.
            In the reply filed on June 29, 2023,
SCE argues that Plaintiffs have failed to establish legal causation in their
negligence claim. SCE asserts that Plaintiffs have failed to provide any
evidence of legal causation linking SCE to the alleged dangerous condition of
the guy wire, despite the pole being jointly owned. 
 
            Without a duty, the cause of action must fail. As SCE has successfully negated the elements of
duty, the Court need not address causation.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Accordingly, Defendant
Southern California Edison Company’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.
