 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Robert
  Gray’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Plaintiff’s Request for
  Production, Set One, from Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc., and
  Request for Sanctions.



 
Background
Plaintiff Robert Gray sues Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. and
Does 1 through 10 pursuant to an August 5, 2022 Complaint alleging claims of
(1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty and (2)
Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty.
The claims arise from allegations that on March 6, 2020, Plaintiff entered
a warranty contract with American Honda regarding a 2016 Honda Odyssey
(Vehicle) and that during the warranty period, the Vehicle manifested defects
and nonconformities that American Honda was unable to conform to warranty after
a reasonable number of attempts.
On August 16, 2023, Plaintiff Gray
moved to compel further responses from American Honda relating to Plaintiff’s
First Set of Requests for Production of Documents (RPDs, Set One) Nos. 19-23,
25-31, 45-46, and 48-49.
On September 14, 2023, American
Honda opposed Plaintiff’s motion.
On September 20, 2023, Plaintiff
Gray replied to the opposition.
Plaintiff Gray’s motion is now
before the Court.
 
Motion to Compel Further Production

Legal Standard
A motion to compel a further
response is used when a party gives unsatisfactory answers or makes untenable
objections to interrogatories, demands to produce, or requests for admission.
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) To
request further production, a movant must establish: (1) good cause for the
production (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1); Sinaiko, supra,
at p. 403); and (2) that a further response is needed because (a) the
responding party’s statement of compliance with the demand to produce is
incomplete Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b) the responding
party’s representation that it is unable to comply is inadequate, complete, or
evasive (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2)), (c) the responding party’s
objection in the response is without merit or is too general (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court
(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or (d) if the responding party objected to
the production of ESI on the ground that it is not reasonably accessible the
movant can show that the (i) ESI is reasonably accessible or (ii) there is good
cause for production of the ESI regardless of its accessibility (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (e)).
Order Compelling Further
Production: MOOT, in Part; GRANTED, in Part; DENIED, in Part.
Plaintiff Gray initially brought
this motion seeking to compel further responses from American Honda relating to
RPDs, Set One, Nos. 19-23, 25-31, 45-46, and 48-49. (See Mot., p. 19.)
Following further production from
American Honda on September 14, 2023, Plaintiff Gray has modified his request
to only seek further production as to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 22-23 and 45-46.
(Reply, p. 1.) Further production as to Request Nos. 19-21, 25-31, and 48-49 is
thus MOOT.
I. RPDs, Set One,
Nos. 22-23
After review, the Court determines
that further production is warranted as to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 22-23. 
Request No. 22 seeks: All training
materials regarding the handling of consumer requests for a vehicle repurchase
in California since 2020.
Request No. 23 seeks: All training
materials for YOUR employees or agents tasked with determining whether a
vehicle is eligible or a vehicle repurchase pursuant to the Song-Beverly Act
since 2020.
Documents evidencing policies and
procedures used to evaluate customer requests for repurchase pursuant to the SBA
are relevant to determining whether purchase or replacement should have
occurred. The relevancy determination is strengthened where the sought-after
discovery is limited from the date of purchase (2020) to the present. These
conclusions undercut American Honda’s objections that Request Nos. 22-23 are
vague, ambiguous, overly broad, unduly burdensome, and outside the scope of
discovery.
The Court disagrees with American
Honda’s position that it has satisfied Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.240, subdivision (c)(1), in relation to Request Nos. 22-23. American Honda
qualified its responses to these production requests with, “[s]ubject to and
without waiving these objections, assuming th[ese] request[s] [are] not
directed to attorney-client communications, AHM [was] unable to comply with th[ese]
request[s]” because American Honda could not locate responsive documents after
a diligent search and reasonable inquiry. Such responses indicate to the Court
that responsive documents have been held back based on the attorney-client
privilege. However, American Honda fails to give sufficient information for the
Court to determine that any such privilege exists. Since the request seeks
training materials, it is unclear as to what attorney/client privilege American
Honda may be referring to. If an attorney sends via email a training outline to
a client along with some legal advice or representation, the email may well be subject
to the attorney/client privilege; but the substance of the training, if then provided
to the client’s employees, would likely not be. American Honda does not comply
with its discovery obligations by conclusorily stating that a privilege exists
because such a response does not provide sufficient factual information for
other parties to evaluate the merits of the alleged attorney-client privilege.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240 subd. (c)(1).)
Plaintiff’s motion is thus GRANTED
as to Request Nos. 22-23, subject to the below instructions in the Conclusion.
II. RPDs, Set One,
Nos. 45-46
After review, the Court determines
that further production is warranted as to RPDs, Set One, No. 45 but not as to
RPDs, Set One, No. 46. 
Request No. 45 seeks: “All
DOCUMENTS evidencing complaints by owners of 2016 Honda Odyssey vehicles
regarding any of the complaints that the SUBJECT VEHICLE was presented to YOUR
or YOUR authorized repair facilities for repair during the warranty period.”
All customer complaints relating to
defects and nonconformities in 2016 Honda Odyssey vehicles that overlap with
the same defects alleged in Plaintiff’s Vehicle are clearly relevant to
American Honda’s knowledge of ongoing and uncurable defects and nonconformities
in Plaintiff’s Vehicle. Such knowledge could affect a determination relating to
whether repurchase or replacement should have been more seriously contemplated
by American Honda. If American Honda had knowledge of ongoing defects it was not
able to conform to warranty in 2016 Honda Odyssey vehicles generally and those
same defects arose and were not curable in Plaintiff’s Vehicle, and if American
Honda nevertheless failed to replace or repurchase Plaintiff’s Vehicle, the
sought-after civil penalties sought by Plaintiff could be justified. As such,
the information is relevant. 
American Honda’s argument that “[a]
plaintiff need not look beyond his own service history and personal experience
with his vehicle to know if the repairs have been successful” is not
convincing. The Complaint alleges that the defects and nonconformities in the
Vehicle were not brought up to warranty after a reasonable number of attempts.
(Complaint, ¶ 19.) Service history beyond Plaintiff’s Vehicle but limited to
2016 Honda Odyssey vehicles could show that American Honda knew that the
defects alleged to have existed in Plaintiff’s Vehicle were widespread and not
curable, thus in turn affecting a determination on replacement or repurchase.
Plaintiff’s motion is thus GRANTED
as to Request No. 45, subject to the below instructions in the Conclusion.
However, Request No. 46 is
overbroad.
Request No. 46 seeks: “All
DOCUMENTS evidencing warranty repairs to 2016 Honda Odyssey vehicles regarding
any of the components that YOU or YOUR authorized repair facilities performed
repairs on under warranty.”
Unlike Request No. 45, Request No.
46 does not limit itself to the type of nonconformities alleged to have arisen
in Plaintiff’s Vehicle. Such failure to particularize this request makes it
overbroad.
Plaintiff’s motion is thus DENIED
as to Request No. 46.
Sanctions: DENIED.
Except in certain circumstances
involving electronic stored information, the court must impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(h).)
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
Here, the Court determines that
sanctions are not merited at this time. The parties have been able to resolve a
number of their disputes as of September 14, 2023. The parties have also
advanced meritorious arguments both ways, with Plaintiff’s motion granted as to
Request Nos. 22-23 and 45 but denied as to Request No. 46. Under these
circumstances, imposition of sanctions would be unjust.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff Robert Gray’s Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production, Set One, from
Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. is MOOT, in Part, GRANTED, in Part,
and DENIED, in Part, as follows:
(1) MOOT as to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 19-21,
25-31, and 48-49.
(2) GRANTED as to RPDs, Set One,
Nos. 22-23 and 45.
(3) DENIED as to RPDs, Set One, No.
46.
The Court ORDERS American Honda to
make further production as to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 22-23 and 45 within 21 days
of this ruling.
If American Honda is claiming
attorney-client privilege over any further production, it shall provide a
privilege log complying with Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.240
subdivision (c)(1) including the date of the document, the kind of document (e.g.,
email, letter, etc.) the author, the recipient, and the general topic of the
document or other basis for claiming the privilege.
Plaintiff Robert Gray’s Request for
Sanctions is DENIED.
