```

And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is on the demurrer to the Cross-Complaint filed by Simon's Caterers Inc. (SCI) against California Rent-a-Car, Inc. (Cal Rent-a-Car). The demurrer is related to the claims of fraud, violation of Penal Code section 496, unfair business practice, and common counts - money had and received.

The Court finds in favor of SCI on the first cause of action for fraud, alleging that Cal Rent-a-Car concealed its intent to defraud SCI by offering damage waiver insurance that it never intended to honor. The Court determines that the Cross-Complaint sufficiently alleges intent to defraud and concealment.

The Court sustains Cal Rent-a-Car's demurrer to the second cause of action for violation of Penal Code section 496, as the Cross-Complaint is fatally defective as stated.

The Court overrules Cal Rent-a-Car's demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action, alleging unfair business practice and common counts - money had and received. The Court determines that the Cross-Complaint alleges that Cal Rent-a-Car received money for damage waiver insurance that it never intended to honor and did not honor when the vehicle rented by SCI was vandalized by third parties.

The Court gives Cal Rent-a-Car 14 days to amend the pleadings.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the cross-complaint filed by California Rent-a-Car, Inc. against Simon's Caterers Inc. and Simon Cohen. The cross-complaint alleges that California Rent-a-Car issued a damage waiver insurance that it never intended to honor, and that Simon's Caterers Inc. paid for the insurance. The Judge has overruled the demurrer as to the first, third, and fourth causes of action, but sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the second cause of action. The Judge found that the cross-complaint sufficiently alleges intent to defraud and concealment, and that California Rent-a-Car's argument that the mere allegation of offering an optional CDW is not sufficient to show fraudulent intent is not availing. The Judge also found that the cross-complaint alleges a valid claim for unfair business practices and common counts - money had and received. The plaintiff is given 14 days to amend the pleadings.
