And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Robert Gray's Motion to Compel Further Responses to Plaintiff's Request for Production, Set One, from Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The motion is granted in part, denied in part, and moot in part.

The judge finds that American Honda must produce further responses to Requests Nos. 22-23 and 45 of the Request for Production of Documents (RPDs, Set One). Request No. 22 seeks training materials regarding the handling of consumer requests for a vehicle repurchase in California since 2020, and Request No. 45 seeks documents evidencing complaints by owners of 2016 Honda Odyssey vehicles regarding defects and nonconformities.

The judge denies the motion as to Request No. 46, which is overbroad and seeks documents evidencing warranty repairs to 2016 Honda Odyssey vehicles regarding any components that American Honda performed repairs on under warranty.

The judge also denies Plaintiff's Request for Sanctions, finding that the parties have been able to resolve their disputes and that imposition of sanctions would be unjust.

The judge orders American Honda to make further production as to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 22-23 and 45 within 21 days of this ruling, and requires American Honda to provide a privilege log complying with Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.240 subdivision (c)(1) if it is claiming attorney-client privilege over any further production.
