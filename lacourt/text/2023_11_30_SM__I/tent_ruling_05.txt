 Case Number:  23SMCV04516    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  I The ex parte application is DENIED.  
Primarily, plaintiff appears to have refused to meet and
confer.  Plaintiff might have been able
to avoid the demurrer by meeting and conferring, but failing to do so suggests
to the court that it will not exercise its discretion to advance the
hearing.  The court notes that the
hearing was set just over four weeks after filing.  While that is a bit longer than the statutory
notice, it is hardly over-long.  In any
event, if plaintiff wants to move with alacrity, it must engage in the process
as well, and that means good faith meeting and conferring.
Having snuck a peak at the demurrer and opposition,
plaintiff might want to consider whether it ought to amend the complaint rather
than fight the demurrer.  That is not a
ruling; just a thought.
The court will not hear argument on this matter today.
