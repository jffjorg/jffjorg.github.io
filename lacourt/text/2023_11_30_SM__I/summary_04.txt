And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration. The contract in question is one of adhesion, which satisfies the procedural prong of the test, but the judge is not inclined to grant the motion without considering substantive unconscionability. The plaintiff's arguments are unconvincing, except for the location of the arbitration, which requires it to occur in Santa Clara County, 300 miles from where the plaintiff resides. The defendant has offered to waive the location limitation and litigate in Los Angeles, and the judge needs more information to make a decision. The judge is concerned that the clause may be intended to intimidate the plaintiff and will not sever it or order arbitration if that is the case. The judge will hear from the defense to determine the purpose of the clause and will also inquire as to why it was not discussed in the moving papers.
