```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has denied the ex parte application, primarily due to the plaintiff's refusal to meet and confer. The judge notes that the hearing was set four weeks after filing, which is not overly long, and suggests that the plaintiff could have avoided the demurrer by meeting and conferring. The judge also suggests that the plaintiff might want to consider amending the complaint rather than fighting the demurrer. The judge will not hear argument on this matter and will not advance the hearing.
