 Case Number:  23SMCV00384    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  I The unopposed motion is GRANTED.  It appears that the agreement was that
defendant would make certain payments and that if defendant failed to do so,
and if the default was not cured, plaintiff would be entitled to a judgment in
a particular amount.  Defendant did not
make the payments nor did defendant cure the default.  The motion is proper.
