  Case Number:  20SMCV00596    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  I Plaintiff seeks an order to obtain the declaration of Saad
Sazegar in this case.  Plaintiff issued a
subpoena to Mr. Sazegar, who apparently came to court with his declaration on
November 22, 2023.  Plaintiff seems to
think that such a declaration would be filed. 
Plaintiff is wrong.  It is not to
be filed as it is not a pleading that is proper to file.  The court also notes that the matter that was
on the calendar for that day was an ex parte application “to continue
motion for reconsideration to December 18th, 2023 and compel defense
counsel to serve MSA pleadings via dropbox link to confirm receipt by plaintiff
and the court.”  (The quote is from the
application.)  The document subpoenaed
had nothing to do with the matter on calendar for that day.
To avoid this problem in the future, the court will clarify
that NO TRIAL SUBPOENAE should issue without good cause to do so consistent
with the Code of Civil Procedure. 
Section 1986 allows a subpoena to issue to a witness to appear before a
court at trial or at a deposition.  If it
is a subpoena only for documents, the documents must pertain to the issue to be
decided by the court on the date that the production is to be made.  Any subpoena issue not in compliance with the
Code of Civil Procedure will be invalid and the court will not accept any
documents by any witness in response thereto. 
Of course, if a proper subpoena is issued, that is a different story.
For now, though, the court will provide the declaration to
plaintiff and will send a copy to defense counsel.
