And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling regards a case where the plaintiff seeks an order to obtain a declaration from Saad Sazegar. The plaintiff issued a subpoena to Saad, who presented the declaration in court on November 22, 2023. The Judge notes that the declaration is not a proper pleading to file and does not relate to the matter on calendar for that day, which was an ex parte application to continue a motion for reconsideration. The Judge clarifies that trial subpoenas should only issue with good cause and that documents requested through subpoena must be relevant to the issues to be decided by the court. The Judge will provide the declaration to the plaintiff and send a copy to defense counsel, but will not accept any documents from witnesses in response to an invalid subpoena.
