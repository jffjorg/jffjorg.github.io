SYNIKA SMITH 
                           
         vs.
 
SOCIAL VOCATIONAL SERVICES, INC. 
 


 Case No.: 23STCV00542 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  April 11, 2024



 
Plaintiff’s
request for relief from waiver of objections is GRANTED.
            
On 1/10/2023,
Plaintiff Synika Smith (Plaintiff) filed suit against Social Vocational
Services, Inc., alleging: (1) discrimination; (2) retaliation; (3) failure to
prevent discrimination; (4) declaratory judgment; (5) retaliation; (6)
retaliation; (7) wrongful termination; (8) failure to pay wages; (9) failure to
provide rest periods; (10) waiting time penalties; (11) unfair competition;
(12) conversion; and (13) failure to provide itemized wage statement. 
 
            On
2/29/2024, Plaintiff moved for relief from waiver of objections. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
seeks relief from waiver of objections, contending that her failure to provide
timely responses to Defendant’s discovery was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, and excusable neglect, and because Plaintiff has subsequently
served responses that are in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210,
2030.220, 2030.230, 2030.240, 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, 2031.240,
2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.  
 
            After
review, the Court agrees that such relief is warranted. 
 
CCP section
2030.290(a) states in relevant part:
 
(a)  
The party to whom the interrogatories
are directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writing under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both the following conditions
are satisfied:
 
(1)  The
party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with
sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240.
(2)  The
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect. CCP § 2030.290(a).
 
Here,
Plaintiff has served responses in substantial compliance with sections
2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240, and thus has satisfied the first
prong. Second, Plaintiff submitted a declaration from counsel explaining that
the email containing discovery was sent counsel’s spam folder. More
specifically, counsel explains: 
 
On December
27, 2023, Mr. Nicolas Tomas, counsel for Defendant, propounded written
discovery via email to Plaintiff’s counsel. [Juarez-Munoz Decl., ¿ 5] This is the first
email Mr. Tomas sent our office, and me personally, all other prior
correspondence were from other attorneys and support staff from Defense
counsel’s office. Mr. Tomas’s emails did not include Ms. Diaz, who previously
had received all prior emails from Defense counsel’s office. 
 
Tomas’ email
included the discovery requests included in Defendant’s discovery motions to
compel on calendar for June 10, June 11, June 12 (2x), and June 17, of 2024, a
total of five motions, proposed orders, and request for sanctions. For some
unknown reason, Mr. Tomas first email to me was sent to my email junk/spam
folder and I never saw this email. [Juarez-Munoz Decl., ¿ 5] As a result, I was
unaware of the requests and did not respond to them in a timely manner.
[Juarez-Munoz Decl., ¿
5.] Further, because Ms. Diaz was also not included in this email, despite our
request that she be included in all correspondence on January 11, 2023, and
previously included in all correspondence from Defense counsel’s office, she
was not cc’d in Mr. Tomas’ December 27, 2023, email. [Juarez-Munoz Decl., ¿ 5.]
 
            (Motion,
7-15.)
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel explained it was not until 2/7/2024 that counsel became aware that the
due date to respond had passed, after an email was sent by Defendant’s counsel
to both him and Ms. Diaz. (Juarez-Munoz Decl., ¿ 6.) Plaintiff provided responses to
all outstanding discovery by 2/23/2024. Juarez-Munoz Decl., ¿ 7.)
 
            The
Court finds Plaintiff’s evidence sufficient to show that the failure to timely
serve responses was due to mistake and inadvertence, and thus the second prong
is satisfied as well. (CCP (2030.290, subd. (a).) 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request for relief from waiver of objections is
granted. 
 
It is so ordered.
