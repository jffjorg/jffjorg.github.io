And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's request for relief from waiver of objections. The Plaintiff, Synika Smith, filed a lawsuit against Social Vocational Services, Inc. alleging discrimination, retaliation, failure to prevent discrimination, and other claims. The Plaintiff's counsel explained that an email containing discovery requests was sent to their spam folder and they were unaware of the requests until it was too late. The Plaintiff subsequently responded to the outstanding discovery requests. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery requests was due to mistake and inadvertence, and thus granted the Plaintiff's request for relief from waiver of objections.
