And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motion to substitute co-executors in place of deceased plaintiff/counter defendant John A. Carr. The Carrs seek to substitute Rose M. Carr and Patrick E. Carr as co-executors for the estate of John A. Carr, who died on July 5, 2021. The Court has determined that the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure sections 377.20, 377.21, 377.31, and 377.32 have not been met. Specifically, the Court notes that the Carrs did not provide a certified copy of the decedent's death certificate, and did not indicate that no proceeding is pending in California for administration of the decedent's estate. As a result, the Court denies the motion without prejudice.
