And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Rich Honey, Inc. is overruled. The demurrer argued that the three-day notice served by KB Slauson, LLC was defective because it demanded payment of rent and other charges, exceeding the statutory requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1161, subdivision (2). However, the judge found that the Complaint adequately alleged the legal effect of the lease agreement and that the three-day notice complied with the statute. Additionally, the judge noted that Rich Honey, Inc. did not provide legal authority to support its argument. The judge also rejected Rich Honey, Inc.'s argument that the Complaint failed to attach the lease agreement or adequately allege its essential terms. As a result, the judge ordered Rich Honey, Inc. to file and serve its answer to the Complaint within 10 days of the date of the Order.
