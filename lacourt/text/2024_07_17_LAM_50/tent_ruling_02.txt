[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT  



 
Plaintiff Sooyeon Jin (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment
against Defendant James Bae in the total amount of $313,769.03, comprising $313,334.03 in damages and $435.00 in costs. 
The Court notes a few defects with the submitted request for default
judgment.  
First, Plaintiff’s operative First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) filed on June 30, 2023 names Keith Bae, James Bae, Bee
Investment, Inc., Sue Ahn, John Yi, and Does 1-50 as Defendants. On April 3,
2023, Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal as to “Defendants Bee
Investment, Inc., John Yi, and Sue Ahn,” and dismissal was entered on April 5,
2023. However, as set forth above, the FAC was filed after this date on June
30, 2023. Thus, it does not appear that Bee
Investment, Inc., Sue Ahn, or John Yi have been dismissed from the FAC. The Court notes that a party seeking a default judgment must
file “[a] dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an
application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a
showing of grounds for each judgment…”¿ (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(7).)[1]¿ 
Second, in her
supporting declaration, Plaintiff states that she seeks, inter alia,
$10,000.00 in damages ($1,000.00 x 10 months) for a “[p]ayment pursuant to
Service Agreement Contract...” (Suppl. Jin Decl., ¶ 13.) In the FAC, Plaintiff
alleges that “[r]elying upon K. BAE, BEE INVESTMENT, SUE AHN, and JOHN YI’s
representation that K. BAE was a successful restaurant entrepreneur, the
Corporation, and K. BAE on behalf of his company Birdies Corporation, entered
into a service agreement (the ‘Service Agreement’), whereby K. BAE agreed to
provide a wide range of restaurant management services, including but not
limited to bookkeeping, human resources, administration/general management,
brand management/marketing, research and development, and field supervision in
exchange for a monthly payment of one-thousand dollars ($1,000).” (FAC, ¶ 20.)
The FAC alleges that “[a]s a direct and proximate result of K. BAE’s
breach of the Service Agreement, PLAINTIFF suffered damages in an amount to be
determined at trial, plus consequential damages, and pre- and post-judgment
interest to the extent permitted by law.” (FAC, ¶ 54, emphasis added.) However,
in connection with the instant request, Plaintiff seeks the subject $10,000.00 in
damages against James Bae. The FAC does not appear to allege that Plaintiff is
entitled to damages against James Bae for a breach of the Service Agreement. 
Plaintiff also seeks “$7,457.44” for “[c]hecks to JAMES BAE’s personal
corporation, BAE FG Corp.” (Suppl. Jin Decl., ¶ 13.) However, in the FAC,
Plaintiff alleges that “K.BAE routinely withdrew cash for personal reasons
including but not limited to, funding his other restaurants/businesses, paying
for his personal tax liabilities and that of his other restaurants. In fact,
the Corporation’s financial records show that upon PLAINTIFF’s deposit of the
initial emergency call of $15,000, K. BAE wrote a check in the amount of
$8,000 to his personal corporation, Bae FG Corporation.” (FAC, ¶ 36, emphasis
added.) 
The Court notes that “[i]t is imperative in a default case that the
trial court take the time to analyze the complaint at issue and ensure that the
judgment sought is not in excess of or inconsistent with it. It is not in
plaintiffs’ interest to be conservative in their demands, and without any
opposing party to point out the excesses, it is the duty of the court to act as
gatekeeper, ensuring that only the appropriate claims get through. That role
requires the court to analyze the complaint for itself--with guidance from
counsel if necessary--ascertaining what relief is sought as against each
defaulting party, and to what extent the relief sought in one cause of action
is inconsistent with or duplicative of the relief sought in another. The
court must then compare the properly pled damages for each defaulting party
with the evidence offered in the prove-up. (§ 585, subd.
(b) [‘[T]he court shall hear the evidence offered by the plaintiff, and
shall render judgment in his or her favor for such sum (not exceeding the
amount stated in the complaint, in the statement required by Section 425.11, or
in the statement provided for by Section 425.115), as appears by such evidence
to be just. . . .’].).” (Heidary v. Yadollahi (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 857, 868.) The
Court finds that here, further information from Plaintiff is necessary to tie
the damages sought to the allegations of the FAC. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for
default judgment without prejudice. The Court will
discuss with Plaintiff a schedule for resubmission of the default judgment
package.
