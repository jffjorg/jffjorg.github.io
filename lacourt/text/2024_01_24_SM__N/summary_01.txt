English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Malibu Dream Resort, LLC (Defendant) to the Second Amended Complaint filed by Shabana Arman (Plaintiff). The court has sustained the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend for all four causes of action: rescission, breach of the implied covenant of good faith, conversion, and deceit. The court has found that the Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged concealment or misrepresentations by the Defendant, and that the Plaintiff's claims are based on her own allegations that she reviewed the Vacation Rental Agreement and contacted the Defendant about the noise ordinance. The court has given the Plaintiff an opportunity to cure the defects in her claims and has allowed her 20 days to amend her complaint.
