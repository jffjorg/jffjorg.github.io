And here is the English-text summary:

In this tentative ruling, Judge Maurice A. Leiter denies the petition for approval of the settlement without prejudice. The petition was submitted by minor plaintiff Divine Leggett, with no opposition received. The settlement amounts to $137,500.00, with $51,562.50 allocated to the minor claimant, $51,562.50 to the adult plaintiff, and $34,375.00 to counsel. However, the judge finds that the current structure of the settlement may be subject to challenge, as it appears to treat counsel as another claimant receiving a settlement amount. The judge orders the parties to follow the form's structure, disclosing the minor claimant's settlement and attorney's fees, and to resubmit the petition with the corrected information.
