No opposition has been received.
 
Plaintiffs move for approval of the
settlement for minor claimant. As currently structured, claimant is to receive $51,562.50
out of a total settlement of $137,500.00. The adult Plaintiff also is to
receive $51,562.50, and counsel is to receive $34,375.00. This structure
creates the impression that counsel is another claimant receiving their own
settlement amount. This is not how the minor’s compromise form is structured;
in Plaintiff’s current structure the minor claimant’s settlement could be
subject to challenge. Plaintiffs must follow the form’s structure: the form
must disclose the total amount of the minor claimant’s settlement, and the
portion of that settlement being allocated to attorney’s fees. It appears the
parties intend that minor’s claimant’s settlement is $68,750.00, 25% of which
($17,187.50) is allocated to attorney’s fees. If that is the minor claimant’s
settlement, the petition for approval must reflect this.
