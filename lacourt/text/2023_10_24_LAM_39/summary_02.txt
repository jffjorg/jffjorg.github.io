And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to amend the plaintiffs' complaint. The plaintiffs seek to add additional causes of action against the defendants. The judge has granted the motion, citing the liberally granted nature of leave to amend under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1). The judge has also noted that there is no prejudice to the defendants, as the trial is not until July 16, 2024, and ample time remains for discovery and preparation. The defendants do not oppose the motion. The judge's order grants the motion, requires the plaintiffs' counsel to file and serve the first amended complaint within ten days, and requires notice and proof of such filing with the court.
