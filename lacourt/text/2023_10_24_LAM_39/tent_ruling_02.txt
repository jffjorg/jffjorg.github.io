 Case Number:  21STCV23854    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2023    Dept:  39 Kimberly
Hummer, et al. v. La Marquise, LLC, et al.
Case
No. 21STCV23854
Motion
for Leave to Amend
 
Plaintiffs seek leave to amend
to add additional causes of action against Defendants.  Under Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (a)(1), the Court has wide discretion to allow either party to
amend pleadings “upon any terms as may be just.”  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(a)(1).)  Judicial policy favors
resolution of all disputed matters between the parties and, therefore, leave to
amend is liberally granted.  (Berman vs. Bromberg (1986) 56
Cal.App.4th 936, 945.)  “[I]t is an abuse of discretion for the
court to deny leave to amend where the opposing party was not misled or
prejudiced by the amendment.”  (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court
(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048.)  There
is no prejudice with respect to this amendment, because trial is not until July
16, 2024, which means there is ample time to conduct discovery and prepare for
trial.  Defendants do not oppose the
motion.
 
Based
upon the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
1.         Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend
is granted.
 
2.         Plaintiffs’ counsel shall file and
serve the first amended complaint within ten days.
 
3.         Plaintiffs’ counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
