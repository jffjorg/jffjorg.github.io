 Case Number:  22STCV35924    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2023    Dept:  39 Daniel Chavira v.
Hyundai Motor America, Inc., et al.
Case No.
22STCV35924
Motion for
Attorney’s Fees
 
            Plaintiff
Daniel Chavira (“Plaintiff”) filed a case under the Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act against Hyundai Motor America and Commerce Hyundai (collectively,
“Defendants”), which settled.  Now,
Plaintiff’s counsel seeks the following: (1) Attorney’s fees in the amount of
$15,095; (2) A multiplier of 1.30 which equals an additional $4,528.50; and (3)
Costs in the amount of $874.70. 
Defendants do not oppose the motion.
 
            The
determination of reasonable amount of attorney fees is within the sound
discretion of trial courts. (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79 Cal. App. 4th 1127, 1134.)  The burden is on the party seeking
attorney fees to prove reasonableness of the fees.  (Center for Biological Diversity v. County
of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal. App. 4th 603, 615.)  The Court has broad discretion in determining
the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award which will not be overturned
absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary
findings not supported by substantial evidence.”  (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008)
167 Cal. App. 4th 1379, 1393-94.)  The Court need not explain its
calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the
factors considered in arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura v. ABM
Industries Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.)
 
            Although
Plaintiff’s counsel’s rates are high for a case of this nature, the record
reflects efficiency in the handling of this case, which makes up for the high
rates.  Defendants do not oppose the
motion.  Finally, overall, a request for
approximately $15,000 to handle a case of this nature is reasonable.  Therefore, the Court grants the motion and
approves attorneys’ fees in the amount of $15,095.  The Court also approves costs in the amount
of $874.70.  However, the Court denies the
request for a multiplier, as this case does not satisfy the criteria for a
multiplier.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion and
orders Defendants to pay $15,969.70 in attorneys’ fees and costs within thirty
(30) days.
 
            2.         The Court dismisses this case with
prejudice.
 
            3.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
