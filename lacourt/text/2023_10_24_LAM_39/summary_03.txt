Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which includes granting Bartlett's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint and denying Tidhar's motion to strike. The judge has also overruled Tidhar's demurrer with respect to the first, third, and fourth causes of action, but sustained it with respect to the second and fifth causes of action. The judge has ordered Tidhar to file an answer within thirty days and has given counsel for Tidhar notice to provide proof of such filing with the court.

The judge has also ruled on the legal sufficiency of the allegations in the cross-complaint, finding that Bartlett has stated causes of action for breach of contract, equitable indemnity, and equitable contribution against Tidhar. The judge has, however, sustained Tidhar's demurrer with respect to the second cause of action, which alleges negligence, because Bartlett does not allege that Tidhar owes a duty to Bartlett. The judge has also sustained Tidhar's demurrer with respect to the fifth cause of action, which seeks declaratory relief, because Bartlett has adequate remedies on other causes of action at trial.
