And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service made by defendant Carlos Rodriguez. The motion was filed on August 9, 2024, after the plaintiff, Aaron Michael Schroeder, filed a proof of substitute service on July 17, 2024. However, before the judge could rule on the motion, the plaintiff filed a proof of personal service and an opposition to the motion on September 6, 2024. As a result, the judge has determined that the motion is moot and has placed it off the calendar. The judge has instructed the court clerk to give notice of this decision.
