And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the defendant's motion to reopen discovery. The defendant, Nahid Lahiji, is seeking to reopen discovery to complete "limited discovery" related to the contract performance and mechanic's lien. The judge is not persuaded that the defendant has shown diligence in seeking discovery, citing the defendant's delay in seeking counsel and the fact that the defendant has not provided sufficient evidence to support their claims of health and family difficulties. The judge is also concerned that reopening discovery would cause further delay and prejudice to the plaintiff, who has already experienced multiple continuances of the trial date. The judge is denying the motion to reopen discovery and setting the trial date for November 6, 2024.
