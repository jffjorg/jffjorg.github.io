Cazares,
et al. v. Central Storage, Inc., et al.MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
(CCP §
437c) 
TENTATIVE RULING:  
 
Defendant Central Storage,
Inc.’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND SERVE A
PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN 10 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On March 25, 2022, Plaintiffs Marcus
Cazares and Victoria Murdock (“Plaintiffs”) filed
this action against Defendant Central Storage, Inc. (“Defendant”). Plaintiffs
filed a First Amended Complaint on June 27, 2023. At the case management
conference on June 29, 2023, the Court set motions to strike or grant judgment
on the pleadings on its own motion “because the case fails to state a cause of
action as a matter of law with the exception of a possible one-month overpay
for a month without adequate notice meaning about $100 due.” (Minute Order,
06/29/23.) The Court also set a Walker hearing for the same date to transfer
the action to the limited jurisdiction court. (Ibid.) On July 20, 2023,
the action was transferred to a limited jurisdiction court. (Minute Order,
07/20/23.) 
 
Following transfer, the limited
jurisdiction court held a trial setting conference and noted that no response
had been filed to the First Amended Complaint. (Minute Order, 08/31/23.) The
Court set an order to show cause regarding filing Defendant’s answer for
November 2, 2023. (Ibid.) On October 31, 2023, Defendant filed a
Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint, which the Court sustained without
leave to amend as to the second and fourth causes of action for negligence, and
overruled as to the first and third causes of action for breach of
contract. (Minute Order, 12/13/23.) Defendant filed its Answer to the First
Amended Complaint on January 25, 2024.  
 
Defendant filed the instant Motion
for Summary Judgment on March 22, 2024. Plaintiffs filed an opposition on
August 22, 2024 and Defendant replied on August 29, 2024.  
 
Discussion
 
Allegations in the First
Amended Complaint
 
The First Amended Complaint
alleges that since about 2010, Plaintiffs contracted with Defendant to store
their personal belongings and at all times have been current on their rent.
(FAC, ¶10-11.) Defendant allegedly changed the terms of the contract by increasing
the rent without providing 30 days notice. (FAC, ¶¶BC-1.) Defendant also
illegally included an unconscionable term in violation of Civil Code section
1770, subdivision (a)(19). (Id. at Attachment to Cause_1, BC-2.)
Defendant was also not registered as a business with the City of Glendale. (Ibid.)
Plaintiffs have been damaged in the amount of overpayment of rent from March 1,
2022 to July 1, 2023. (Id. at Attachment to Cause_1, BC-2.) Defendant had a
duty to be registered to do business in the City of Glendale per Ordinance
Number 5.04.030. (FAC, ¶GN-1.) Defendant unlawfully collected rent because it
did not have a right to raise rent on the storage units. (Ibid.)
Plaintiffs have been damaged in the amount of rent charged illegally. (Ibid.)

 
Requests for Judicial Notice
 
Defendant’s request for judicial
notice that January 30, 2022 is 30 days before March 1, 2022 is granted
pursuant to Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (h). 
 
Plaintiffs’ request for judicial
notice that January 30, 2022 was a Sunday is also granted pursuant to Evidence
Code section 452, subdivision (h). 
 
Motion for Summary Judgment
 
A defendant seeking summary
judgment must show either (1)
that one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established; or (2) that there is a complete
defense to that cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)
Plaintiff is under no evidentiary burden to produce rebuttal evidence until
Defendant meets its initial moving burden. (Binder v. Aetna Life Insurance
Company (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839-840.) 
 
An action for breach of
contract must demonstrate the following elements: (1) the existence of the
contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the
defendant’s breach; and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff. (D’Arrigo
Bros. of California v. United Farmworkers of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th
790, 800.) Defendant moves for summary judgment on the grounds that there are
no disputed facts as to its lack of liability for breach of storage agreement.
The breach of contract causes of action are based on the allegation that
Defendant changed the terms of the contract by increasing the rent without
providing 30 days’ notice. 
 
Defendant’s Initial Burden of Proof
 
In support of its Motion for Summary Judgment for the breach
of contract causes of actions, Defendant presents the following facts as
undisputed. The parties contracted for Plaintiffs to store their personal
belongings. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 1; FAC, ¶¶10-11; Rosas Decl.,
¶3.) The contract requires Defendant to provide 30 days’ notice before
increasing the rental rate. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 2; FAC,
Attachment, Term (4); Rosas Decl., ¶4.) The rent increase notices were sent to Plaintiffs
on January 30, 2022. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 3; Rosas Decl., ¶5
and Exh. 5.) The effective date of the rent increases was March 1, 2022.
(Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 4; Rosas Decl., ¶6 and Exh. B.) On
January 30, 2022, Defendant received confirmation that Plaintiffs received and
opened the messages with the rate change notice. (Motion, Separate Statement,
Fact No. 5; Rosas Decl., ¶7 and Exh. B.) January 30, 2022 was 30 days before
March 1, 2022. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 6; RJN.)
 
This evidence carries Defendant’s initial burden of proof
that there are no disputed facts regarding its lack of liability for breaching
the parties’ contract. Specifically, Defendant provided notice of the rental
charge increase as required by the parties’ contract such that Defendant did
not breach that term of the contract. The burden now shifts to Plaintiffs to
demonstrate the existence of triable issues of material fact regarding Defendant’s
breach of the notice provision. 
 
 
 
Plaintiffs’ Responsive Burden
of Proof
 
In opposition, Plaintiffs argue
that the parties’ agreement does not allow notice by electronic mail. (Opp.,
Separate Statement, Fact No. 3.) The opposition, however, does not cite to any
language in the parties’ rental agreement prohibiting electronic notice. (Opp.,
Separate Statement, Fact No. 3.) The parties’ rental agreement merely states
“Operator may adjust Monthly Rental Rate effective on the next monthly due date
after giving Occupant(s) thirty (30) days written notice.” (FAC, Attachment,
Term (4).) 
 
Plaintiffs also argue that
Defendant’s Motion does not address the causes of
action for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing or
unconscionable contract term. No such causes of action are alleged in the First
Amended Complaint, however. Plaintiffs may have included conclusory allegations
in the breach of contract causes of action that Defendant “illegally included
an unconscionable term in the contract” and “breach of covenant of good faith
and fair dealing” but this is not sufficient to state those causes of action
without supporting facts. (See FAC, ¶¶BC-2.) 
 
Therefore,
Plaintiffs have not demonstrated the existence of triable issues of material
fact regarding Defendant’s breach of the parties’ agreement. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Central Storage,
Inc.’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND SERVE A
PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN 10 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
