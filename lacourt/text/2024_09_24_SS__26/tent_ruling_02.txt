Mold Masters, Inc. v. Lahiji, et al.MOTION FOR TO REOPEN DISCOVERY 
(CCP
§§ 2030.300; 2033.290) 
TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
Defendant Nahid
Lahiji’s Motion to Reopen Discovery is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff
Mold Masters, Inc (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendant
Nahid Lahiji, individually, and as Trustee of the Nahid Lahiji Trust dated
September 22, 2017, (“Defendant”) on January 7, 2020. On December 13, 2021,
Defendant filed an answer to the Complaint in propria persona.
 
Trial
was set for September 8, 2022. (Minute Order, 04/12/22.) Following Defendant’s
ex parte application, trial was continued to March 15, 2023. (Minute Order,
07/29/22.) Pursuant to the parties’ stipulations, trial was then continued to
August 21, 2023, November 20, 2023, and January 22, 2024. On January 12, 2024,
the Court granted Plaintiff’s ex parte application to continue the trial date
to April 15, 2024. (Minute Order, 01/12/24.) When the parties appeared for
trial, the Court ruled on Defendant’s ADA request and continued the trial date
to June 26, 2024. (Minute Order, 04/15/24.) Defendant filed an ex parte
application to continue the trial date and discovery cutoffs on June 21, 2024. On
June 24, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiff’s request for emergency relief,
including a request to reopen discovery for failing to show diligence. (Minute
Order, 06/24/24.) 
 
On June
26, 2024, the trial date was continued to November 6, 2024. (Minute Order,
11/06/24.) Defendant filed a substitution of attorney on July 17, 2024. The
Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend the Complaint on September
11, 2024. (Minute Order, 09/11/24.) The First Amended Complaint was filed on
the same date. 
 
Defendant
filed the instant Motion to Reopen Discovery on September 5, 2024. Plaintiff
filed an opposition on September 12, 2024, which was only eight court days
prior to the hearing. This is less than the required statutory notice. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005.) However, Defendant filed a substantive reply on September
18, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 2024.050 allows the Court to extend or reopen discovery
at its discretion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050, subd. (b)) In determining
whether to grant such relief, the Court should consider (1) the necessity and
the reasons for the discovery; (2) the diligence or lack of diligence of the
party seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery motion, and the
reasons that the discovery was not completed or that the discovery motion was
not heard earlier; (3) any likelihood that permitting the discovery or hearing
the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to trial on the date set,
or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar, or result in prejudice to any
other party; and (4) the length of time that has elapsed between any date
previously set, and the date presently set, for the trial of the action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050, subd. (b).)
 
Defendant
moves to reopen discovery in order to complete what they characterize as
“limited discovery.” Defendant argues that the relates directly to Plaintiff’s
performance under the contract for which Plaintiff seeks compensation, and to
the timeliness of the mechanic’s lien for which Plaintiff seeks foreclosure. Also,
the Motion is supported by Defendant’s declaration, in which they contend they
have struggled with health and family difficulties, and with obtaining counsel,
leading to a delay in seeking this discovery. (Motion, Lahiji Decl., ¶¶2-7.) The
Court is not persuaded that Defendant has been significantly hindered in their
defense of this action by their health difficulties. The Court ruled that
Defendant’s request for an ADA accommodation did not provide evidentiary
support for any accommodation other than remote appearances. (Minute Order,
04/15/24.) Yet Defendant again attempts to rely on the ADA request to support
the instant Motion. (Motion, Lahiji Decl., ¶7.) 
 
Defendant
contention that she has been unable to obtain counsel until very recently also
lacks credibility. In their initial declaration, Defendant stated that they “encountered
significant difficulties in securing legal representation within my financial
means.” (Motion, Lahiji Decl., ¶4.) In the reply, however, Defendant states
that they were unable to find an attorney because of the attorneys’ workloads
and the modest sum in dispute in this action. (Reply, Lahiji Decl., ¶2.) 
 
Defendant
also changes position with respect to the trial date. Defendant initially
acknowledged that a trial continuance will be required. (Id. at ¶6.)
Trial in this action has been so frequently continued that the Court strongly
disfavors any additional continuances. In the reply, however, Defendant
contends that they wish to keep the current trial date of November 6, 2024.
(Reply, Lahiji Decl., ¶10.) Yet it is not explained how it will be possible to
keep the current trial date if discovery is reopened. Plaintiff will need 30
days to respond to Defendant’s requests, and if a dispute over the responses
arises no time will be left for discovery motions.
 
Conclusion 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant Nahid Lahiji’s Motion to Reopen Discovery is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
