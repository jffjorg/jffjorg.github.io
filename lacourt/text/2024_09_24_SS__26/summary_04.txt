Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to deem the requests for admission admitted and to seek sanctions. The defendant, Carlos A. Salazar, failed to respond to the requests for admission despite a meet and confer effort. The plaintiff filed the motion on July 11, 2024, and the hearing was continued to September 24, 2024. The judge found that the defendant's failure to respond constituted a waiver of objections and that the plaintiff was entitled to an order deeming the requests for admission admitted. The judge also awarded sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $360.00, which is based on one hour of attorney time billed at $300.00 per hour, plus a $60.00 filing fee. The defendant is ordered to pay the sanctions within 20 days of service of the order.
