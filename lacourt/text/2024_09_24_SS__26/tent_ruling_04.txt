ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Midway Rent a Car, Inc. dba Midway Car Rental
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant Carlos A. Salazar (“Defendant”) on October 19, 2023. Defendant
answered in propria persona on December 1, 2023. On December 7, 2023, Plaintiff
served Requests for Admissions on Defendant. (Motion,
Moss Decl., Exh. 1.) To date, despite a meet and confer effort,
Defendant has not served verified responses to the Requests for Admission. (Id.
at ¶¶6-7 and Exh. 2.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Deem Requests for
Admission Admitted (“the Motion”) on July 11, 2024. The Motion initially came
for hearing on September 10, 2024, at which time Defendant appeared through an
attorney, Evan Selik (“Selik”). (Minute Order, 09/10/24.) The Court, on its own
motion, continued the hearing to September 24, 2024. (Ibid.)
 
No substitution of attorney, nor additional papers regarding
the Motion, have been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Due to Defendant’s failure to timely serve verified responses and resultant
waiver of objections, Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the Requests
for Admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
The Court is required to award sanctions under the moving
statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) While properly noticed, the
sanctions sought are excessive. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
granted against Defendant in the amount of $360.00 based on one hour of
attorney time billed at $300.00 per hour, plus the $60.00 filing fee. (Motion,
Moss Decl., ¶8.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Midway Rent a Car, Inc.
dba Midway Car Rental’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and
Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT CARLOS A. SALAZAR IS ORDERED TO PAY
SANCTIONS OF $360.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS
ORDER.
