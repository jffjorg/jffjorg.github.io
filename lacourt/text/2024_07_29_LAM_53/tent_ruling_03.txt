  Order RE:
 
defendants’ motion to strike portions of
  complaint
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:              Defendants 24 CMN, LLC and CYN,
LLC   
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:    Plaintiffs Mugihiko
Morijiri, Keiko Morijiri, and Zion Morijiri and Ewan Morijiri, by and through
their guardian ad litem, Keiko Morijiri

Motion to Strike Portions of Complaint
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Defendants 24 CMN, LLC and CYN, LLC (“Defendants”) move the court for
an order striking the prayer for punitive damages (Compl., Prayer, p. 23:20)
and related allegations (Compl., ¶¶ 117, 161, 172[1])
in the Complaint filed by plaintiffs Mugihiko Morijiri, Keiko Morijiri, and
Zion Morijiri and Ewan Morijiri, by and through their guardian ad litem, Keiko
Morijiri (“Plaintiffs”).
The court grants Defendants’ motion to strike the prayer for punitive
damages and related allegations because Plaintiffs have not alleged facts
establishing (1) Defendants are guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, and (2)
advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification, or act
of oppression, fraud, or malice on the part of an officer, director, or
managing agent of Defendants.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 436; Civ. Code, § 3294, subds. (a), (b).)  
The court finds that the allegations that Ariana Javaheri, the
property supervisor and managing agent of Defendants, informed Plaintiffs that
the dark staining on their wall was not mold but mildew and advised Plaintiffs
that they would have to pay for the mold test if the results were negative (Compl.,
¶¶ 21-23) do not show that Defendants (1) engaged in conduct intended to cause
injury to Plaintiffs or despicable conduct carried on with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of Plaintiffs, or (2) engaged in
despicable conduct subjecting Plaintiffs to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of their rights. 
(Civ. Code, § 3294, subds. (c)(1) [defining malice], (c)(2) [defining
oppression].)  Moreover, while the court acknowledges
that Plaintiffs have also alleged that plaintiff Ewan Morijiri was diagnosed
with leukemia, is immunocompromised, and was advised not to reside in a
premises with mold because it would be injurious and possibly fatal (Compl., ¶
23), Plaintiffs did not allege facts establishing that Defendants knew of this
risk, such that Ariana Javaheri’s conduct may be considered malicious or
oppressive. 
ORDER
            The court grants defendants CMN, LLC
and CYN, LLC’s motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages and paragraphs
117, 161, and 172 of plaintiffs Mugihiko Morijiri, Keiko Morijiri, and Zion
Morijiri and Ewan Morijiri, by and through their guardian ad litem, Keiko
Morijiri’s Complaint in this action. 
            The court grants plaintiffs Mugihiko
Morijiri, Keiko Morijiri, and Zion Morijiri and Ewan Morijiri, by and through
their guardian ad litem, Keiko Morijiri 20 days leave to file a First Amended
Complaint that cures the defects set forth in this ruling. 
 
 
            The court orders defendants CMN, LLC
and CYN, LLC to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  July 29, 2024
