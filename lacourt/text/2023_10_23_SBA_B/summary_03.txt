```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to consolidate the instant action with Case No. 23IWUD01503, USRE Trust v. Howell, an unlawful detainer action. The plaintiff had argued that the actions involve common questions of law and fact, contain common parties, and that consolidation would promote judicial resources. However, the judge found that the purpose of consolidation, which is to promote trial convenience and economy by avoiding duplication of procedure, is not present in the actions. The judge also noted that the plaintiff may raise issues of title in the unlawful detainer action that may support his contention that he should retain the right to possess the property, and that consolidation would merely result in further delay and inefficiency. Therefore, the judge denied the motion for consolidation and declined to order the instant action as related to Case No. 23IWUD01503.
