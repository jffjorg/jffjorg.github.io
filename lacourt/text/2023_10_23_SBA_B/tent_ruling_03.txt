23TRCV01707
1.      Perry Howell’s Motion for Consolidation of Actions,
or, in the Alternative, to Stay the Unlawful Detainer Action    
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Perry Howell’s Motion for
Consolidation of Actions, or, in the Alternative, to Stay the Unlawful Detainer
Action is denied, in part.  
 
            Background
 
            Plaintiff filed the Complaint on February
17, 2023. Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff is the former owner
of real property located at 10225 South 7th Avenue, Inglewood, California 90303.
The property was transferred away from Plaintiff through forgery. Plaintiff
alleges the following causes of action: 1. Slander of Title; 2. Quiet Title; 3.
Declaratory Relief; 4. Cancellation of Written Instrument; 5. Violation of Cal.
Bus. & Prof. Code Sections 17200 et seq. 
 
            Motion to Consolidate
 
The trial court has discretion to consolidate actions
involving common questions of law or fact. 
Code Civ. Proc., §1048.  The
purpose of consolidation is “to promote trial convenience and economy by
avoiding duplication of procedure, particularly in the proof of issues common
to both actions.”  Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 485.
 
The court generally considers the following: (1)
timeliness of the motion, i.e., whether granting consolidation would delay the
trial of any of the cases involved; (2) complexity, i.e., whether joining the
actions involved would make the trial too confusing or complex for a jury; and
(3) prejudice, i.e, whether consolidation would adversely affect the rights of
any party.  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1956) 47 Cal.2d
428, 430–31; Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon
Shield Claimants Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978-79.
 
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.300 states:
“A pending civil case is related to another pending
civil case, or to a civil case that was dismissed with or without prejudice, or
to a civil case that was disposed of by judgment, if the cases:
(1) Involve the same parties and are based on the same
or similar claims;
(2) Arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact;
(3) Involve claims against, title to, possession of,
or damages to the same property; or
(4) Are likely for other reasons to require
substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges.”
 
Plaintiff moves
for an order to consolidate the instant action with Case No. 23IWUD01503, USRE
Trust v. Howell, an unlawful detainer action, or, in the alternative, to
stay the UD action. Plaintiff argues that the actions involve fundamental
common issues of law and fact, contain common parties, and that consolidation
will promote judicial resources. Plaintiff may assert affirmative defenses in
an unlawful detainer action if they go to the issue of title or possession of
the subject property.  See Adler v. Elphick (1986) 184
Cal.App.3d 642, 645-46.  “California law
does not prohibit an unlawful detainer defendant from interposing a defense
involving title issues, so long as the defense, if established, would result in
the tenant retaining possession of the premises.” Coyne v. De Leo (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 801, 818.
 
Therefore, the
Court finds that convenience and economy will not be fostered by consolidation
of the cases. The Court finds
that the purpose of consolidation - to promote trial convenience and economy by
avoiding duplication of procedure, particularly in the proof of issues common
to all actions – is not present in the actions. Plaintiff may raise
issues of title in the unlawful detainer action that may support his contention
that he should retain the right to possess the property.  Consolidation is, therefore, not required for
Plaintiff to present these issues of title. 
Instead, consolidation would merely result in further delay and
inefficiency, and would not foster the policy of promoting the speedy
resolution of UD actions.
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s Motion to Consolidate is
denied. The Court declines to rule upon Plaintiff’s request for a stay of the
UD action as any request for a stay of that action must be presented in that
action.
 
The Court declines to order
the instant action as related to Case No. 23IWUD01503.  The motion for consolidation is denied.
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
