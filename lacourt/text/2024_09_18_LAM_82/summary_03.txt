```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The tentative ruling dismisses the petition for writ of mandate as moot since the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has completed production of all responsive, non-exempt records on May 10, 2024, and the Petitioner has not challenged the LAPD's decision to withhold and/or redact certain records.

The judge also declines to rule on the motion for attorneys' fees and costs because it is unclear what was produced on May 10, 2024, and why additional documents were produced so long after the City completed its search in September 2023.

The judge notes that the Petitioner's broad CPRA requests were the reason for the delays in this case, and that the Petitioner's modification of the request did not limit the number of document custodians but merely limited emails based upon certain search terms. The judge concludes that the Petitioner's decision to limit the request to something reasonable, not this petition for writ of mandate, compelled the City to respond.
