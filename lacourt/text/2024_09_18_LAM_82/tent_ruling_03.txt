[Tentative] Order Dismissing Petition for
Writ of Mandate as Moot
 
[Tentative] Order on Petitioner’s Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs
 
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
             Three Group, Inc. (“Petitioner”) filed this
petition for a writ of mandate compelling the City of Los Angeles (“Respondent”
or the “City”) to produce all public records responsive to Petitioner’s
California Public Records Act (the “CPRA”) request.  The City produced more than 1,800 pages of
responsive records after the litigation was filed, and Petitioner does not
argue that the City improperly withheld or redacted any records.  Petitioner “has determined that the City’s
completion of its production of records following the filing of this action has
rendered the lawsuit moot” and “does not oppose the dismissal of the Petition.”
Accordingly, the court dismisses the petition as moot.  Petitioner now moves for an award of “prevailing
party” attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to Government Code section
7923.115(a) in the total amount of $218,564.46. 
The City opposes the motion.  The
Court does not have sufficient information to issue a tentative order on the
motion for attorneys’ fees.      
 
BACKGROUND 
 
A.        Petitioner’s
CPRA Request and the City’s Initial Responses 
            
On
June 22, 2022, the City Council passed a motion, at the recommendation of the
Los Angeles Police Department (the “LAPD”), to initiate nuisance abatement
proceedings against Petitioner’s business, “Crazy Girls Strip Club,” which is
located in Hollywood.  The Department of
City Planning (“City Planning”) set the proceedings for hearing before the
Zoning Administrator on November 10, 2022. 
(Freedman Decl. ¶ 2.)[1]
 
On
November 5, 2022, Petitioner submitted a CPRA request to the LAPD seeking: “copies
of any and all records, including any and all evidence of communications,
relating to or referencing (i) 1433 North La Brea Avenue; (ii) ‘Crazy Girls’ or
‘Crazy Girls Strip Club’; or (iii) case no. DIR-2022-3752-RV” for the period
“July 14, 2021 through … November 5, 2022.” 
(hereafter, the “CPRA Request”)  (Orocio
Decl. ¶ 10, Exh. 1.)  On November 7,
2022, the LAPD searched through its “Web Focus” database and identified four
pages of responsive “Calls for Service” records.  (Orocio Decl. ¶ 15; Freedman Decl. Exh. 4 at
58.)
 
On
November 21, 2022, the LAPD informed Petitioner that it had performed a search
of the LAPD email database for the terms of the CPRA Request and that the
search “resulted in 23,999 items not including attachment file(s) that exceeds
the maximum gigabyte (GB) that our system would allow to export” and
“therefore, [the LAPD was] unable to search for and identify emails responsive
to your request.”  (Freedman Decl. Exh. 4
at 61.)  The LAPD asked Petitioner to
narrow the scope of its request.  (Ibid.)  
 
On
November 22, 2022, Petitioner agreed that with respect to emails, the LAPD
could rely on search terms: (1) “Crazy Girls” and “1433 La Brea;” and (2) “Crazy
Girls” and “club.”  (Consoli-Tiensvold
Decl. Exh. 5 at 56; Lee Decl. ¶ 6.)  Petitioner
did not agree to modify the request in any other way.  (See Lee Decl. ¶ 6.)  
 
On
December 12, 2022, having not heard anything since the LAPD’s last
communication, Petitioner’s counsel asked for an estimate of when the records
would be made available.  (Freedman Decl.
Exh. 4 at 60.)  According to Ryan Lee, a
CPRA analyst with the LAPD who worked on the request, the LAPD’s Information
Technology Bureau (“ITB”) performed a search based on this modified request on
or about December 12, 2022, “but the results were still voluminous and too
large to extract.”  (Lee Decl. ¶ 6.)  On December 22, 2022, the LAPD produced the
four “Calls for Service” records that it found on November 7, 2022.  (Orocio Decl. ¶ 15.)  On this date, the LAPD also updated
Petitioner as follows: “[The] LAPD continues to search for and identify records
responsive to your request. We will provide another response regarding more
records within a couple of weeks.”  (Freedman
Decl. Exh. 4 at 59.)
 
On
or about January 4, 2023, Lee requested that Petitioner further narrow the CPRA
Request.  Petitioner’s counsel declined
to further narrow the CPRA Request.  Lee
informed Petitioner that “even if ITB broke up the search by date ranges …
continuing to use the requested search terms could still yield voluminous
results that might take quite some time to review and complete.”  Petitioner’s counsel responded that Petitioner
was “ok with this.”  (Lee Decl. ¶ 8;
Consoli Decl. Exh. 5 at 44.)  
 
On
January 24, 2023, the LAPD informed Petitioner that it “estimates that it will
be able to provide you with an update and/or copies of responsive, non-exempt
records by March 24, 2023, and on a rolling basis thereafter.”  (Freedman Decl. Exh. 4 at 57.)  On March 23, 2023, LAPD informed that that it
“continues to review potential records that may contain confidential portions
that are exempt from disclosure” and that the LAPD had revised its estimate
such that it would start providing responsive records by April 25, 2023.  (Id. Exh. 4 at 56.)  Other than the four calls for service
records, LAPD did not produce any responsive records before the petition for
writ of mandate was filed.  (See Ibid.;
Orocio Decl. ¶ 12.)
 


 
B.        The
Petition, Trial Setting Conferences, and Discovery
 
On
March 28, 2023, Petitioner filed its petition for writ of mandate and complaint
for declaratory relief in this action.  The
City made one production of documents on June 7, 2023, which was before the
first trial setting conference (“TSC”) on July 7, 2023.  (See Orocio Decl. ¶ 12.)  The City made additional document productions
on August 10, August 17, and August 31, 2023. 
(Ibid.)  At the TSC on
August 11, 2023, Judge Beckloff ordered the head of the LAPD’s Discovery Unit,
Detective Philip Orocio, to appear at a continued TSC on September 1, 2023 “to
explain the delay/process/procedure” with respect to LAPD’s response to the
CPRA Request.  (Consoli-Tiensvold Decl. Exh.
10.)  
 
In
August 2023, Petitioner finally agreed to narrow the scope of the search of the
LAPD’s email database to 27 identified officers.  (Orocio Decl. ¶ 18.)  According to Orocio:
 
[T]he search
results for the email queries the 27 Officers was significantly less voluminous
than the results of any of the multiple ‘any and all’ email searches LAPD had
previously conducted using the parameters specified in the Request, which
Petitioner had previously declined to narrow or focus. Accordingly, LAPD was
able to spend substantially less time reviewing the emails from the August 2023
search, and could spend more time on other searches it believed were called for
by the Request.
 
(Id.
¶ 19.)  These searches had the same
search term limitations.  (Id. ¶
18.)  According to the City, “[t]hese
searches were complete by early September 2023. 
(Ibid.)  The City made
document productions on September 8, September 20, October 6, November 3,
November 9, and November 13, 2023.  (Orocio
Decl. ¶ 12; see also Freedman Decl. Exh. 4.) 
 
             At the TSC on November 17, 2023, Judge
Beckloff, apparently frustrated by the City’s lack of completion of the
document production, stated: 
 
I think I’m done
micromanaging your case.  I will set it
for trial.  I don’t know what else to
do.  Mr. Freedman, every time we are
together we spend an hour.  We’ve spent
three or four hours together trying to work this out.  The deposition was taken, apparently that
officer didn’t connect any search.  I
know that the City may view it differently. 
I have many, many cases and I can’t baby-sit forever.
 
(Consoli-Tiensvold
Decl. Exh. 14 at 4.)  Judge Beckloff set
a trial date, and the City made another document production on November 30,
2024.  (Ibid.; see also Orocio
Decl. ¶ 12.)  The City made one final
document production, on May 10, 2024. 
(Orocio Decl. ¶ 12.)    
 
C.        Petitioner Requests Extensions of the
Deadline to Submit Evidence to the Zoning Administrator in the Nuisance
Abatement Proceedings 
 
On
November 10, 2022, after a hearing, the Zoning Administrator took the zoning
abatement matter “under advisement” and left the record open for two months to
allow Petitioner to submit additional evidence in response to testimony offered
against it.  (Freedman Decl. ¶ 6.)  On December 23, 2022, May 1, 2023, and June
16, 2023—before the LAPD produced all responsive public records—Petitioner
requested extensions from the Zoning Administrator to submit additional
evidence that it was seeking in the CPRA Request and this writ action.  (Id. ¶ 7 and Exh. 1-3.)  The Zoning Administrator granted such
requests.  (Id. ¶ 7.)  After several extensions, the administrative
record in the zoning abatement matter was closed on April 5, 2024.  (See Lum Decl. ¶¶ 18-24.)  Between November 7, 2022, and April 5, 2024,
City Planning did not receive any additional evidence from Petitioner to add to
the administrative record for the nuisance abatement proceeding.  (Id. ¶ 20.)  Petitioner also did not request to reopen the
record after receiving all responsive, non-exempt records for its CPRA Request
on May 10, 2024.  (Id. 
¶
23.)  
 
DISCUSSION
 
A.        The Petition is Moot 
 
It
is undisputed that the LAPD completed production of all responsive, non-exempt
records on May 10, 2024.  (Orocio Decl. ¶
12; Freedman Decl. Exh. 4 at 1.) 
Petitioner has not challenged LAPD’s decision to withhold and/or redact
certain responsive records as exempt. 
Accordingly, the petition is dismissed as moot.  “[I]f the respondent has complied with the petitioner’s
demands … , the petition should be dismissed as moot.”  (See Bruce v. Gregory (1967) 65 Cal.2d
666, 671.)  
 
B.        The Court Does Not Have Sufficient
Information to Resolve the Motion 
 
            “If the requester prevails in
litigation filed pursuant to [the CPRA], the court shall award court costs and
reasonable attorney’s fees to the requester.” 
(Gov. Code § 7923.115(a).)  Under the
CPRA, an award of attorney’s fees to a prevailing plaintiff is mandatory.  (Fontana
Police Dept. v. Villegas-Banuelos (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1249, 1252.)  
 
            A petitioner prevails within the
meaning of the CPRA when the petitioner “files an action which results in defendant
releasing a copy of a previously withheld document.”  (Belth v. Garamendi (1991) 232
Cal.App.3d 896, 898.)  “A plaintiff is
considered the prevailing party if his lawsuit motivated defendants to provide
the primary relief sought or activated them to modify their behavior, or if the litigation substantially
contributed to or was demonstrably influential in setting in motion the process
which eventually achieved the desired result.” 
(See Belth v. Garamendi (1991)
232 Cal.App.3d 896, 901.)  “The
appropriate benchmarks in determining which party prevailed are (a) the
situation immediately prior to the commencement of suit, and (b) the situation
today, and the role, if any, played by the litigation in effecting any changes
between the two.’”  (Id. at
902.)  “[A] plaintiff need not achieve a
favorable final judgment in order to be a successful party.”  (Id. at 901.)
 
            Here, it appears that Petitioner’s broad CPRA
requests were the reason for the delays in this case.  Petitioner’s first request sought “any and
all records,” including communications, relating to or referencing the physical
location or the name of the club for approximately 16 months.  Petitioner’s modification of the request did
not limit the number of document custodians but merely limited emails based
upon certain search terms.  It was not
until Petitioner limited the searches to 27 document custodians that the
request became reasonable.  Indeed, as
soon as Petitioner did so in August 2023, the searches were completed in
September 2023, and the productions occurred on September 8, September 20, October
6, November 3, November 9, November 14, and November 30, 2023.  (See Orocio Decl. ¶ 12.)  The City provided a privilege log on December
8, 2023.  (See Mot. 12:15-16.)  Therefore, it appears that Petitioner’s
decision to limit the request to something reasonable—not this petition for
writ of mandate—compelled the City to respond. 

 
            However,
the court cannot rule on this motion because it is unclear what was produced on
May 10, 2024.  (See Orocio Decl. ¶ 12.)  Nor is it clear why additional documents were
produced so long after the City completed its search in September 2023.
