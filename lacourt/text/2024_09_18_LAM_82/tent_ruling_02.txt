[1] For 416 S. Wall
St., Receiver also received three counteroffers, with a high-priced offer at
$3.8 million.  The Receiver did not
accept the high counteroffer because “the $3.8M offer had a 15-day inspection
contingency, meaning that the prospective purchaser was free to cancel or
significantly reduce the offering price during that 15- day period, whereas
Buyer was fully committed.”  (Id. ¶
9.)  The court concurs in this
decision.
