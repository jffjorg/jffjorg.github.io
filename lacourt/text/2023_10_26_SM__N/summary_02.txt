And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The defendant argued that she was not properly served with the summons and complaint, as the proof of service did not match her physical description and she was not personally served. However, the judge found that the defendant's statements were not credible, as she failed to provide sufficient facts to support her claims. The judge also noted that the defendant did not dispute the fact that the address where she was served was her own residence. As a result, the judge exercised its discretion to consider the motion and denied it. The defendant is ordered to file a responsive pleading within 15 days. Additionally, the judge denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, as the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient facts to support its claim that the defendant's motion was brought primarily for an improper purpose.
