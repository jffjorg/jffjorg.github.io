REASONING
 
Defendant
Providence Saint John’s Health Center’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff John
Tebbens’ Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One; Defendant Providence Saint
John’s Health Center’s Motion to Compel
Plaintiff John Tebbens’ Responses to Request for Production of Documents and
Things, Set One from Plaintiff John Tebbens; Defendant Providence Saint
John’s Health Center’s Motion to Compel
Plaintiff John Tebbens’ Responses to Specially Prepared Interrogatories, Set
One; Defendant Providence Saint John’s Health Center’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to
Specially Prepared Interrogatories, Set Two; and Request for Monetary Sanctions
in the Amount of $840.00; Defendant Providence Saint John’s Health
Center’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff
John Tebbens’ Responses to Request for Production of Documents and Things, Set
Two and Request for Monetary Sanctions in the Amount of $840.00 Against
Plaintiff John Tebbens
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and
for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds. (b), (c).)
Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work
product, unless “[t]he party has subsequently served a response that is in
substantial compliance” and “[t]he party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion
to compel where no responses have been served. All that need be shown in the
moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the
opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of
any kind has been served. (Leach v.
Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)
 
Similarly,
where there has been no timely response to a Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.010 demand, the demanding party must seek an order compelling a response.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) Failure to timely respond waives
all objections, including privilege and work product.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(a).) Thus, unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief
from waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. (Ibid.) There is no deadline for a motion
to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving party need
not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the motion. (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) Where the motion seeks only a response to
the inspection demand, no showing of “good cause” is required. (Contra Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1) [good cause requirement for motion to
compel further responses].)
 
Defendant Providence Saint John’s Health Center served Plaintiff John Tebbens
(“Plaintiff”) with its Form Interrogatories, Set One, Request for Production of
Documents and Things, Set One, Specially Prepared Interrogatories, Set One, on
October 3, 2022. (Mots., Benson Decls. ¶ 3.) Responses were due on or
before November 7, 2022, and defense counsel also communicated with Plaintiff
to extend the response date to November 23, 2022. (Mots., Benson Decls. ¶ 4.) Defendant Providence Saint John’s Health
Center also served Plaintiff with its Specially Prepared Interrogatories, Set
Two, and Request for Production of Documents and Things, Set Two, on May 4,
2023. (Mots., Benson Decls. ¶ 3.) Responses were due on or before June 8, 2023.
(Ibid.) To date, no responses
have been received to any of these discovery requests. (Mots., Benson Decls. ¶¶
4, 5.)
 
Accordingly, Defendant
Providence Saint John’s Health Center’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff John
Tebbens’ Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One is GRANTED; Defendant
Providence Saint John’s Health Center’s Motion
to Compel Plaintiff John Tebbens’ Responses to Request for Production of
Documents and Things, Set One from Plaintiff John Tebbens is GRANTED; Defendant
Providence Saint John’s Health Center’s Motion
to Compel Plaintiff John Tebbens’ Responses to Specially Prepared
Interrogatories, Set One is GRANTED; Defendant Providence Saint John’s
Health Center’s Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Responses to Specially Prepared Interrogatories, Set Two is GRANTED;
and Defendant Providence Saint John’s Health Center’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff John Tebbens’
Responses to Request for Production of Documents and Things, Set Two is
GRANTED. Plaintiff John Tebbens shall provide code compliant responses, without
objections, to Defendant Providence Saint John’s Health Center’s
discovery requests within thirty (30) days of entry of this order.
 
If a
motion to compel responses to interrogatories or requests for production is
filed, the Court may impose a monetary sanction against the losing party
“unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c); 2031.300, subd. (c).)
Further, “[t]he court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a
party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the
motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested
discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)
 
Defendant
Providence Saint John’s Health Center requests $840 in monetary sanctions for two
of its five motions. The Court finds that monetary sanctions are proper, but
the Court reduces the amount to $705, representing one hour spent preparing each
of the two motions and one hour spent appearing at the hearing on the motions,
totaling three hours at the rate of $195 per hour, as well as two filing fees
of $60. Accordingly, Defendant Providence Saint John’s Health Center’s Request
for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $705, payable by
Plaintiff John Tebbens to Defendant Providence Saint John’s Health Center and
defense counsel within thirty (30) days of entry of this order.
 
Defendant
Michael B. Gerhardt, M.D.’s Motion to
Compel Plaintiff, John Tebbens to Respond to Special Interrogatories, Set One,
and Request for Monetary Sanctions Against Plaintiff, John Tebbens, in the
Amount of $480 for His Misuse of the Discovery Process; Defendant
Michael B. Gerhardt, M.D.’s Motion to
Compel Plaintiff, John Tebbens to Respond to Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, and Request for Monetary Sanctions Against Plaintiff, John
Tebbens, in the Amount of $480 for His Misuse of the Discovery Process; Defendant
Michael B. Gerhardt, M.D.’s Motion to
Compel Plaintiff, John Tebbens to Respond to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and
Request for Monetary Sanctions Against Plaintiff, John Tebbens, in the Amount
of $900 for His Misuse of the Discovery Process; Defendant Michael B.
Gerhardt, M.D.’s Motion to Deem
Admitted Defendant’s Request for Admissions, Set One to Plaintiff John Tebbens;
and Request for Monetary Sanctions Against Plaintiff John Tebbens in the Amount
of $690 for His Misuse of the Discovery Process
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely

where there has been no timely response to a Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.010 demand, the demanding party must seek an order compelling a response.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) Failure to timely respond waives

Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1) [good cause requirement for motion to
compel further responses].)
 
Further, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280,
subdivision (b), a “party may move for an order that the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.” The court “shall” grant the
motion to deem requests for admission admitted “unless it finds that the party
to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that
is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
Defendant Michael B. Gerhardt, M.D., served Plaintiff with his Special Interrogatories, Set
One, Form Interrogatories, Set One, Requests for Production of Documents, Set
One, and Request for Admissions, Set One, on October 21, 2022. (Mots., Liu
Decls. ¶ 3.) Responses were due on or before November 22, 2022. (Mots., Liu
Decls. ¶ 4.) To date, no responses have been received. (Mots., Liu Decls. ¶ 6.)
 
Accordingly, Defendant
Michael B. Gerhardt, M.D.’s Motion to
Compel Plaintiff, John Tebbens to Respond to Special Interrogatories, Set One
is GRANTED; Defendant Michael B. Gerhardt, M.D.’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff, John Tebbens to
Respond to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, is GRANTED; and Defendant
Michael B. Gerhardt, M.D.’s Motion to
Compel Plaintiff, John Tebbens to Respond to Form Interrogatories, Set One, is
GRANTED. Plaintiff John Tebbens shall provide code compliant responses, without
objections, to Defendant Michael B. Gerhardt, M.D.’s discovery requests
within thirty (30) days of entry of this order. Defendant Michael B. Gerhardt,
M.D.’s Motion to Deem Admitted
Defendant’s Request for Admissions, Set One to Plaintiff John Tebbens is also
GRANTED. The matters identified in Defendant Michael B. Gerhardt, M.D.’s
Request for Admissions, Set One, are
deemed admitted against Plaintiff John Tebbens as of the date of entry of this
order.
 
If a
motion to compel responses to interrogatories or requests for production is
filed, the Court may impose a monetary sanction against the losing party
“unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c); 2031.300, subd. (c).) If a
motion to have requests for admission deemed admitted is filed, “[i]t is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction . . . on the party or
attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for
admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Further, “[t]he court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a
party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the
motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested
discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)
 
Defendant
Michael B. Gerhardt, M.D., requests $2,550 in monetary sanctions for the four motions.
The Court finds that monetary sanctions are proper, but the Court reduces the
amount to $1,290, representing one hour spent preparing each of the four
motions and one hour spent appearing at the hearing on the motions, totaling five
hours at the rate of $210 per hour, as well as four filing fees of $60.
Accordingly, Defendant Michael B. Gerhardt, M.D.’s Request for Monetary
Sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $1,290, payable by Plaintiff John
Tebbens to Defendant Michael B. Gerhardt, M.D., and defense counsel within
thirty (30) days of entry of this order.
