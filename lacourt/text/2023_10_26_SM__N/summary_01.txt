And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted several motions to compel responses to discovery requests filed by the defendants. The plaintiff, John Tebbens, has failed to respond to the discovery requests served on him, including form interrogatories, request for production of documents, and specially prepared interrogatories. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to provide code-compliant responses to the discovery requests within 30 days.

The judge has also awarded monetary sanctions to the defendants in the amounts of $705 and $1,290, respectively, for the defendants' time and expenses spent preparing and litigating the motions.

The judge has also deemed certain requests for admissions admitted against the plaintiff, as he failed to respond to them in a timely manner.

The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, 2031.300, and 2033.280, which govern discovery and provide for the imposition of monetary sanctions for failure to comply with discovery requests.
