And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case involving Bottega, who has provided supplemental responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests after the plaintiff filed motions to compel further responses and production of documents. The judge notes that while Bottega's responses are timely, they do not render the motions moot. The judge will analyze the motions as of the date they were filed (July 9, 2024) and will consider whether Bottega's responses comply with the court's orders. The judge also notes that providing code compliant responses can help defendants recognize and abandon unsupported affirmative defenses.
