I.              
BACKGROUND 
Plaintiff
Level 8 Management, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) brings a breach of contract action
against Defendants Nicola Di Lello a/k/a Nick Di Lello (“Di Lello”) and Ital
Concepts, LLC d/b/a Bottega Pizzeria Ristorante (“Bottega”) (collectively,
“Defendants”) arising out of Plaintiff’s alleged performance of professional
accounting services to assist Defendants apply for and obtain Employee
Retention Tax Credits.
Defendants
now move for a judgment on the pleadings. Plaintiff also moves to compel
Defendants’ further responses to eight separate discovery requests. The Court

III.        
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.            
Judgment
on the Pleadings 
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings
performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only
defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be
judicially noticed.” (Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th
1057, 1064.) In considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings, courts
consider whether the factual allegations, assumed true, are sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. (See Fire Ins. Exchange v.
Superior Court (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452-53.) Thus, it may be granted
if, from the pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed,
it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (See Code
Civ. Proc. § 438(d)[1]; Saltarelli & Steponovich v.
Douglas (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1, 5.)
    A defendant or plaintiff’s motion for judgment
on the pleadings may be made after the time to demur has expired and an answer
has been filed. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 438(f).)
B.      Request for Production of Documents 
In responding to a request for
production of documents, a party must provide one of the following: (1) a
legally adequate statement of compliance; (2) a statement of inability to
comply; or (3) an objection to the particular demand. (See Code Civ.
Proc. § 2031.210(a).) If any objections are made, they
must: (1) “[i]dentify with particularity any document …
falling within any category of item in the demand to which an objection is
being made”; and (2) “[s]et forth clearly the extent of, and the specific
ground for, the objection.”¿(Id. at § 2031.240(b).) A statement that
the responding party is unable to comply with a particular demand “shall affirm
that a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to
comply with that demand”; “shall also specify whether the inability to comply
is because the particular item or category has never existed, has been
destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no
longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding party”; 
and “shall set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization
known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that
item or category of item.” (Id. at § 2031.230.) 
A party who
believes a responding party has served (1) an incomplete statement of
compliance, (2) an inadequate, incomplete, or evasive statement of compliance,
or (3) an unmeritorious objection can move for an order compelling further
responses but must “set forth specific acts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the demand.” (See id. at §§
2031.310(a)-(b)(1).) 
C.            
Interrogatories 
A propounding party may move for an order
compelling further responses to interrogatories if the responding party
produced an evasive or incomplete answer or a meritless or overly general
objection in response to an interrogatory. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
2030.300(a).) A motion to compel further responses to interrogatories lies
where the party to whom the interrogatories were directed gave responses deemed
improper by the propounding party; e.g., objections, or evasive or incomplete
answers. (See id. at § 2030.300.)¿The moving party must also include reasons why
further answers should be ordered: legal or factual arguments why the answers
given were incomplete or nonresponsive, or the objections invalid.¿(See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c).) 
However, where a timely motion to has been
filed, “the
burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure to fully
answer the interrogatories.”¿(Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civil
Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2017) ¶ 8:1179.)¿“The ruling usually is based on consideration
of the following factors: [¶] the relationship of the information sought to the
issues framed in the pleadings; [¶] the likelihood that disclosure will be of
practical benefit to the party seeking discovery; [¶] the burden or expense
likely to be encountered by the responding party in furnishing the information
sought.”¿(Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Superior
Court (Rolfe) (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19.)
D.      Requests for Admissions
Under Code of
Civil Procedure § 2033.290, a requesting party may move for further responses
to requests for admissions when responses have been timely served but the
requesting party finds the requests evasive or incomplete or objections without
merit or too general. No further responses can be ordered, however, to RFAs
that have been unqualifiedly denied, even if the facts are unquestionably true.
(See Holguin v. Superior Court (Hoage) (1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 812, 820.)
IV.         
MEET AND CONFER
A.            
Judgment on the Pleadings 
“Before
filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the moving party shall meet and
confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading
that is subject to the motion for judgment on the pleadings for the purpose of
determining if an agreement can be reached that resolves the claims to be
raised in the motion for judgment on the pleadings.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 439(a)
(emphasis added).)          
Defendants have not complied with their
meet and confer obligations and did not address these obligations in either a
declaration or their Motion. Defendants’ counsel thus made absolutely no
attempt to informally avoid this Court’s intervention as required. Accordingly,
the Motion is procedurally defective and is denied on that basis alone.
Nevertheless, the Court will address the merits below.   
B.            
Compel Further Discovery Responses 
Before bringing a motion to compel further responses to any
discovery request, the moving party is required to make efforts to meet and
confer in good faith and must submit a declaration attesting to those efforts.
(See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.310(b)(2), 2030.300(b)(1), and 2033.290(b)(1).)
“A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing
a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.” (Id. at § 2016.040.) However, a discovery
motion should not be denied automatically based upon the reason that the moving
parties failed to meet and confer in good faith. (See Obregon v.
Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 434.) 
Plaintiff provides a meet and confer declaration attesting to the
parties meet and confer efforts, which consists of one meet and confer letter
and a reply. (See, e.g., Bottega RFAs Declaration of Simon Song filed July
9, 2024, ¶ 7, Exs. E & F.) 
As a general rule, this Court doesn’t find a single letter and
reply adequate to satisfy the meet and confer requirements under this rule. Particularly
unproductive – not to mention ironic – was how Plaintiff’s counsel’s purported “refus[al]
to meet and confer in person or telephonically as required before filing any
such motions to compel”, id. at Ex. F, drew Defendants’ counsel’s ire when
(a) no such in person or telephonic requirement exists and (b) Defendant’s
counsel didn’t even bother to send a letter before filing its Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings despite the fact that motion does require meeting
and conferring to be done in person or by telephone. 
The Court will address the merits of Plaintiff’s motions in the interest
of judicial efficiency. However, the
Court expects more collaborative efforts from both counsel going forward that
are more than box-checking exercises designed to merely comply with the letter
of the law, but, more importantly, comply with its spirit as well.
V.            
ANALYSIS
There are nine
motions presently before this Court. The Court will first address Defendants’ Motion.
The Court will next address Plaintiff’s eight discovery motions, first
addressing those propounded upon Di Lello, and next addressing those propounded
upon Bottega. 
A.            
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings 
1.              
Judicial Notice
Defendants request this Court take judicial notice
of the following: (1) Secretary of State’s Certificate of No Record, which
states no record was “found in the Limited Liability Company files of this
office…of the name: LEVEL 8 MANAGEMENT, LLC;” (2) County of Los Angeles’
Certificate of Fact of Non-Filing, indicating no record of “Level 8 Management,
LLC” could be found; (3) 31 CFR § 10.27; (4) Treasury Department Circular No.
230, 31 C.F.R. part 10 (Circular 230); (5) “That no entities called Level 8
Management LLC or Level 8 Management, Inc. appear in a California Department of
Consumer Affairs, Board of Accountancy License Search, demonstrating that
Plaintiff does not have a license to perform accountant services in California;”
and (6) “That no individuals named Sam Derakshan appear in a California
Department of Consumer Affairs, Board of Accountancy License Search,
demonstrating that Plaintiff’s principal, Sam Derakshan does not have a license
to perform accountant services in California.” (Defendants’ Request for
Judicial Notice (“RJN”) Nos. 1-6, Exs. A-D.) 
In opposition, Plaintiff objects to Defendants 5th
and 6th request for judicial notice, on the basis that Plaintiff already
addressed and proved his status as a licensed tax prepare via declaration in
opposition to Defendants’ previous Demurrer. (See Plaintiff’s Objection
to RJN Nos. 5-6.) 
The Court will address each request in turn. 
The Court GRANTS Defendants’ RJN Nos. 1 and 2 as official
acts of the state, per Evidence
Code § 452. 
The Court GRANTS Defendants’ RJN Nos. 3 and 4 per
Evidence Code § 452.
The Court OVERRULES Plaintiff’s objections but
DENIES Defendants’ RJN Nos. 5 and 6 because Defendants have not attached any
Exhibits to these requests. As such, the Court assumes Defendants are
requesting this Court take judicial notice of statements that, based on
Plaintiff’s objections, are reasonably subject to dispute and thus
inappropriate for judicial notice. (See Evid. Code § 452.) 
Finally, in their Reply, Defendants appear to
request this Court take judicial notice of the fact that “Level 8 Management,
Inc. was formed on March 8, 2024, as confirmed by the California Secretary of
State.” (See Reply, pg. 5, fn. 1.) The Court DENIES this request because
Defendants did not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(l) (requiring
a separate statement) and Code of Civil Procedure § 438(d) (requiring it to be
specified in the notice of motion) as to that fact.
///
///

2.              
The Court Denies Defendants’ Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings.
Defendants
move for a judgment on the pleadings arguing Plaintiff’s first cause of action
for breach of contract fails to state a cause of action as (1) Plaintiff lacks
standing to sue; (2) the contract is void; and (3) Plaintiff operated as an
unlicensed contractor. (See Motion, pp. 6-10.) Defendants also argue
Plaintiff’s second cause of action for common counts fails to state a cause of
action because Plaintiff lacks standing to sue. (See id. at 10-11.) 
First, Defendants’
Motion is improper per Code of Civil Procedure § 438(g)(1). Section 438(g)(1)
allows a party who has already demurred to a complaint to bring a motion for
judgment on the pleadings on the same grounds as the demurrer “provided that
there has been a material change in applicable case law or statute since the
ruling on the demurrer” (Code Civ. Proc. § 438(g)(1) (emphasis added).)
 Here, Defendants’ Motion relies on the exact
same grounds as their previously overruled Demurrer: (1) Plaintiff lacks
standing to sue; (2) The contract is void; (3) Plaintiff operated as an
unlicensed contractor. (See Demurrer.) Defendants attempt to bolster
their identical grounds with what appears to be rebuttal to the court’s ruling on
their Demurrer, but these additional arguments are just that—additional
arguments. (See Minute Order dated August 7, 2023; see, e.g., Motion,
pg. 8:8-28, 9:1-10.) Additional arguments are not material changes in case law
or statute and thus are inappropriate for a subsequent motion for judgment on
the pleadings. The Court denies Defendants’ Motion on this ground alone. 
The only new facts
Defendants submit, and which this Court granted judicial notice of, are
their RJN Nos. 1 and 2. Even if this Court were to disregard the glaring
deficiencies in Defendants’ Motion and consider their Motion on the merits,
which it is not, the Motion would fail. RJN Nos. 1 and 2 do not implicate
Plaintiff’s standing to sue as they address the existence of Level 8
Management, LLC—not Plaintiff, Level 8 Management, Inc. Plaintiff
alleges “although Plaintiff was not a party to the original contract, it is the
real party in interest and a proper plaintiff because Level 8 Management, LLC
transferred and/or assigned its contractual duties and rights under the
Agreement to Plaintiff.” (See FAC, ¶ 4.) “The question for purposes of
standing is not the name used by the party suing but whether the party suing is
the party possessing the right sued upon.” (The Rossdale Group, LLC v.
Walton (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 936, 945–946 (citations omitted).) Thus, Plaintiff
has properly alleged standing at the pleading stage.[2] 
In reply,
Defendants reiterate their arguments concerning Level 8 Management, LLC’s
nonexistence and assert their Motion is brought on non-statutory grounds and so
is not subject to Code of Civil Procedure § 438(g)’s restrictions. (See Reply, pp. 3-4.) The Court is unpersuaded. In their Motion and Reply, Defendants
ask this Court to make the leap from (1) Level 8 Management, LLC, does not turn
up in searches of the California Secretary of State or County of Los Angeles
records to (2) Plaintiff does not have standing. The Court will not make such a
leap at the pleading stage, even if this Motion had been properly brought. 
Accordingly, the
Court DENIES Defendants’ Motion.
B.            
Plaintiffs’ Motions to Compel Further
Discovery Responses Are Granted.
1.              
Plaintiff’s Motions Are Timely
Notice of a
motion to compel further responses must be given within 45 days of service of
verified responses or supplemental responses, or on or before any specific
later date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (See Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 2031.230(c),
2030.300(c),
2033.290(c).) When responses are served by mail, that time is extended by five
days. (See id. at 1013(a).) If such notice is not given timely, the
propounding party waives any right to compel a further response. (See id.)¿¿ ¿¿
Here, Defendants
served their responses to all eight discovery requests on May 21, 2024, via
mail. (See, e.g., Bottega SROGS Declaration of Simon Song filed
July 9, 2024, pg. 13, ¶ 6.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motions on July 9, 2024
– 49 days later and within the applicable 50-day window. (See, e.g.,
Bottega SROGS.) Therefore, the motions are timely.
2.              
Compel Further Discovery Responses from
Di Lello
Plaintiff
moves to compel Di Lello’s further discovery responses to its RFPs, FROGS,
SROGS, and RFAs. (See, e.g., Di Lello RFPs.) After several extensions, Di
Lello provided the same unverified response to each: “Defendant NICOLA DILELLO
aka NICK DILELLO (“Defendant”) objects to the entirety of Plaintiffs [RFPs or
FROGS or SROGS or RFAs] propounded by Plaintiff LEVEL 8 MANAGEMENT, INC. There
are no allegations in the First Amended Complaint against Defendant. Defendant
is not liable to Plaintiff under any theory and any information requested from
Defendant violates his right to privacy and is not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Defendant will not provide any
substantive responses and demand is reiterated that he be dismissed from this
case.” (See, e.g., Di Lello RFPs Declaration of Simon Song filed
July 9, 2024, pg. 13, ¶ 6, Ex. D.)
Plaintiff
argues further responses are required because “Defendant is a named defendant
in this action, and the person who executed the MSA on behalf of Bottega.
Plaintiff is clearly entitled to seek discovery from Defendant regarding his
claims and defenses.” (See, e.g., Di Lello RFPs, pp. 4-5.)
In
opposition, Di Lello argues “The services were allegedly performed by Level 8
Management, LLC and then the collection rights assigned to Plaintiff. However,
Level 8 Management, LLC does not exist and never existed. That entity cannot
enforce any contractual or common law rights. As such, any assignment of such
rights is non-existent… Regardless, Defendant still fully supplemented the
discovery responses in dispute and served those responses on September 5, 2024.”
(See, e.g., Di Lello RFPs Opposition, pp. 2-3.) 
The Court is
unpersuaded by Di Lello’s objections or arguments. As Plaintiff notes, Di Lello
is a named defendant and the individual who signed the contract attached to
Plaintiff’s FAC on behalf of Bottega. As such, his copy-and-paste objection is completely
meritless as are his attestations to serving supplemental discovery after
Plaintiff filed the instant motions.[3] Plaintiff
is entitled to code-compliant responses without objection and responsive
documents for each of its four motions pursuant to §§ 2031.310, 2030.300, and 2033.290.
 
Accordingly,
the Court overrules all of Di Lello’s objections and orders Di Lello to provide
code-compliant responses without any further objection – including privilege
because that was not asserted in their initial responses. Furthermore, the
Court orders Di Lello to produce all responsive documents to Plaintiff’s RFPs,
FROGS, SROGS, and RFAs on or before October 11, 2024. In doing so, the Court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion RFPs, Motion FROGs, Motion SROGS, and Motion RFAs as
to Di Lello.
3.              
The Court Grants Plaintiff’s Motions To
Compel Further Responses From Bottega.
a.              
RFPs
Plaintiff
moves to compel Bottega’s further responses to RFPs Nos. 1-9. (See Bottega’s
Separate Statement in Support of Opposition to Bottega RFPs (“SS Bottega
RFPs”), pp. 2-25.)
To each,
Bottega did not object but simply provided the following response: “Defendant
has performed a diligent search and reasonable inquiry and will produce any and
all non-privileged documents responsive to this Request that are in its
possession, custody, or control. Responding Party reserves the right to produce
further documents when they become available.” (See id.) 
Plaintiff is
entitled to further responses to its RFPs. Simply put, section 2031.210(a) presents
a multiple-choice question requiring respondents to select one of three specific
options; it does not allow for fill in the blank style responses. Rather than
do that, Bottega’s responses blend the gist of subdivision (a) with language from
section 2031.230 by referring to having made “a diligent search and reasonable
inquiry.” Moreover, Bottega’s attempt to avail itself of any privilege is not
well taken because they never raised an objection based on a specific privilege.
Therefore, Plaintiff is unable to determine what category of documents is being
withheld, if any,  and why. Finally, as
of the date of the filing of the Motion RFPs on July 9, 2024, Bottega had
failed to produce any documents whatsoever despite 49 days having passed.[4] In
summary, Bottega RFP responses are not code compliant because they fail to provide
(1) a legally
adequate statement of compliance; (2) a statement of inability to comply; or
(3) an objection to the particular demand. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.210(a).) 
Accordingly,
the Court orders Bottega to provide code-compliant responses without objection –
including as to any privileges – and produce all responsive documents to
Plaintiff’s RFPs on or before October 11, 2024.
b.             
FROGS
Plaintiff
moves to compel Bottega’s further responses to FROGS Nos. 3.4-3.7, 15.1, 17.1,
and 50.5. (See Bottega’s Separate Statement in Support of Opposition to
Bottega FROGS (“SS Bottega FROGS”), pp. 2-46.) The Court has grouped the FROGS
at issue and will address each in turn.
                                                                           
i.                   
FROGS Nos. 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and 17.1
(RFAs Nos. 19-28) 
Bottega did
not provide a response to FROGS Nos. 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7,
and 17.1 (RFAs Nos. 19-28). 
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion FROGs as to these FROG. The Court orders
Bottega to provide code compliant responses without objection to its FROGS Nos.
3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and 17.1 (RFAs Nos. 19-28) pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 2030.220 on or before October 11, 2024.
                                                                         
ii.                   
FROG No. 15.1
FROG No. 15.1
asks Bottega to “[i]dentify each denial of a material allegation and each
special or affirmative defense in your pleadings and for each: (a) state all
facts upon which you base the denial or special or affirmative defense; (b) state
the names, ADDRESSES, and telephone numbers of all PERSONS who have knowledge
of those facts; and (3) identify all DOCUMENTS and other tangible things that
support your denial or special or affirmative defense, and state the name,
ADDRESS, and telephone number of the PERSON who has each DOCUMENT.” (SS Bottega
FROGS, pg. 15.)
          Rather
than provide separate responses to its general denial and each of its 30
affirmative defenses, Bottega provides one single longform response to subpart (a).
As to subpart (b), Bottega’s response is “Nicola and Christine DiLello, who may
be contacted via counsel, Gregory F. Wilder, Saman Derakhshan, and perhaps
others in the employ of Wildflower Legacy and Wealth Planning, LLC and the
Level 8 entities. Bottega’s response to subpart (c) is “All documents
referenced above, the agreement between the parties and all correspondences
exchanged amongst the parties and other related to this project. All documents
are either publicly available or equally available to Plaintiff.” (SS Bottega
FROGS, pp. 15-18.) 
Plaintiff is
entitled to further responses to its FROG No. 15.1 pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure §§ 2030.220 and 2030.300. The whole point of 15.1 is to force a
responding party to provide specific facts relating to each affirmative
defense so that the propounding party may evaluate the strength of each one
separately. Doing them separately also enables the propounding party to
evaluate the responsiveness of each response to the affirmative defense for
which it is given. Bottega’s approach is incomplete at best and purposely
obfuscatory and evasive at worst.[5] To
provide code-complaint responses, Bottega must either respond completely as to
each affirmative defense or state it does not have sufficient
personal knowledge to answer the interrogatory and that it made a reasonable
and good-faith effort to obtain the requested information from other
individuals and organizations. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.220(c).) Bottega
has not done either. 
                                                                       
iii.                   
FROG No. 17.1 (RFAs Nos. 2-11, 15-16,
18)
FROG No. 17.1
states “[i]s your response to each request for admission served with these
interrogatories at unqualified admission? If not, for each response that is not
an unqualified admission: (b) state all facts upon which you base your
response; (d) identify all DOCUMENTS and other tangible things that support
your response and state the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the PERSON
who has each DOCUMENT or thing.” (SS Bottega FROGS, pp. 21-35.)
In response
to 17.1(b) (RFAs Nos. 2-11, 15-16), Bottega refers to either its responses to its
RFAs or previous argument but does not otherwise provide a response. (See id.
at 27, 31.) In response to 17.1(b) (RFA No. 18), Bottega states “Defendant
admits that it has not tendered payment for any portion of the $59,858.04 but
denies that said amount was due.” (Id. at 35.)
In response
to 17.1(d) (RFAs Nos. 2-11, 15-16, and 18), Bottega states “All documents
referenced above, the agreement between the parties and all correspondences
exchanged amongst the parties and others related to this project. All documents
are either publicly available or equally available to Plaintiff.” (Id.)
Plaintiff is
entitled to further responses to its FROG 17.1(b) (RFAs Nos. 2-11, 15-16) and
17.1(d) (RFAs Nos. 2-11, 15-16, and 18), but not 17.1(b) (RFA No. 18) as
it finds Bottega’s response to this subpart sufficient. For the rest, the Court
reiterates: Bottega’s response is incomplete at best and intentionally obfuscatory
and evasive at worst. To provide code-complaint responses, Bottega must either
respond completely or state it does not have sufficient personal knowledge to
answer the interrogatory and that it made a reasonable and good-faith effort to
obtain the requested information from other individuals and organizations. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.220(c).) Bottega has not done so here. 
                                                                        
iv.                   
FROG No. 50.5
FROG No. 50.5
asks, “Is any agreement alleged in the pleadings unenforceable? If so, identify
each unenforceable agreement and state why it is unenforceable.” (SS Bottega
FROGS, pg. 43.) 
In response,
Bottega states “[y]es. The entire agreement is unenforceable for the reasons
stated above and herein.” (Id.)
Plaintiff is
entitled to further responses to its FROG No. 50.5. Since this response incorporates
by reference responses the Court has already found defective for the reasons
stated above, the Court reincorporates its analysis regarding those defective
responses here. 
The Court
therefore GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Plaintiff’s Motion FROGs. More
specifically, the only FROG the Court is denying Plaintiff’s Motion FROGs is FROG
17.1 regarding RFA No. 18. Accordingly, the Court orders Bottega to provide
code-compliant responses without objection to Plaintiff’s FROGS Nos. 3.4-3.7,
15.1, 17.1, and 50.5 in accordance with its analysis above on or before October
11, 2024.
c.              
SROGS
Plaintiff
moves to compel Bottega’s further responses to SROGS Nos. 4, 8, 10, 12-14, 18-23,
27, 28-32, 39, 40-41, 43-44, 53-54, and 60-61. (See Bottega’s Separate
Statement in Support of Opposition to Bottega SROGS (“SS Bottega SROGS”), pp. 1-96.)

To SROGS Nos.
4, 8, and 10, Bottega stated “All documents referenced above, the agreement
between the parties and all correspondences exchanged amongst the parties and
other related to this project. All documents are either publicly available or
equally available to Plaintiff.” (SS Bottega SROGS, pp. 2, 5, 9.)
To SROGS Nos.
12-14, 21, 30, 39, 43-44, 53-54, and 60-61, Bottega stated “Defendant does not
know.” (SS Bottega SROGS, pp. 14, 17, 21, 34, 55, 65, 76, 79, 83, 86, 90, 93.)
To SROGS Nos.
18 and 27, Bottega stated “Defendant does not recall.” (SS Bottega SROGS, pp.
24, 45.)
Finally, to
SROGS Nos. 19-20, 22-23, 28-29, 31-32, and 40-41, Bottega stated “N/A.” (SS
Bottega SROGS, pp. 27, 31, 38, 41, 48, 52, 58, 62, 69, 72.)
Once again, Bottega’s
responses are not code compliant. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to further
responses to its SROGS Nos. 4, 8, 10, 12-14, 18-23, 27, 28-32, 39, 40-41,
43-44, 53-54, and 60-61. The Court reincorporates its reasoning above regarding
the incomplete and evasive nature of Bottega’s responses.
Accordingly,
the Court orders Bottega to provide code-compliant responses without objection to
Plaintiff’s SROGS Nos. 4, 8, 10, 12-14, 18-23, 27, 28-32, 39, 40-41, 43-44,
53-54, and 60-61 on or before October 11, 2024.
d.             
RFAS
Plaintiff
moves to compel Bottega’s further responses to RFAs Nos. 2-11 and 25-27. (See
Bottega’s Separate Statement in Support of Opposition to Bottega RFAs (“SS
Bottega RFAs”), pp. 1-54.) 
In response
to each, Bottega offers objections only, such as the request is “impermissibly
compound,” “asks Defendant to admit to something that is within the sole knowledge…of
Level 8,” and “calls for a legal conclusion and the opinion of an expert.” (SS
Bottega RFAs.)
Plaintiff is
entitled to further responses to its RFAs Nos. 2-11 and 25-27. As a preliminary
matter, Plaintiff’s RFAs are not impermissibly compound. (See Code Civ.
Proc. § 2033.060(f).) Additionally, Bottega’s objections are improper. It is
not ground for an objection that an RFA calls for an opinion, is ambiguous, or
that the facts are known to the propounder of the request. (See Cembrook v.
Superior Court (Sterling Drug, Inc.) (1961) 56 Cal.2d 423, 430; see Hillman
v. Stults (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 848, 885.) These responses miss the entire
point of RFAs: to find as many potentially undisputed factual and legal issues
as possible.
Accordingly,
the Court overrules all of Bottega’s objections and orders Bottega to provide
code-compliant responses without objection to Plaintiff’s RFAs on or before
October 11, 2024.[6]
VI.         
SANCTIONS
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction¿. . .¿against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel¿. . .” responses to
interrogatories, requests for production, or request for admission, absent
substantial justification or other circumstances that make imposing the
sanctions unjust.¿(Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c), & 2033.290(d).)
Similarly,¿“[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery process includes “[f]ailing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery,” and “[d]isobeying¿a court order to provide discovery.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2023.010(d), (g).) 
Plaintiff seeks $2,800.00 in discovery sanctions for
its Di Lello FROGS, which accounts for 4 hours to draft the motion, 2 hours to
prepare a potential reply, 1 hour to attend the hearing, and a billing rate of
$400.00 an hour.
For the rest of its motions, Plaintiff seeks
$2,000.00 per motion, which accounts for 2 hours to draft the motion, 2 hours
to prepare a potential reply, 1 hour to attend the hearing, and a billing rate
of $400.00 an hour.
In total, Plaintiff seeks $16,800.00 in discovery
sanctions. 
Defendants also request discovery sanctions. 
The Court finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate of
$400 reasonable given the prevailing rates in the Greater Los Angeles area for
attorneys with his level of experience. However, given the overlapping issues,
Plaintiff’s duplicated hearing requests, and Plaintiff’s “omnibus” Reply, the
Court finds it appropriate to award Plaintiff’s counsel $7,660.00 in discovery
sanctions, which accounts for 2 hours of drafting time per motion [16 total
hours], 2 hours to draft its omnibus Reply, 1 hour to attend the hearing, plus
the $60.00 filing fee. This breaks down to $950 per motion.
Defendants’ counsel shall pay Plaintiff’s counsel
monetary sanctions in the amount of $7,660.00 on or before October 31, 2024. 
Defendants
are not entitled to sanctions as they did not prevail on their Motion or
Plaintiff’s motions. 
VII.      
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court DENIES
Defendants’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. 
The Court
also GRANTS:
(1)      Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendants’
Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One as to Di Lello;
(2)      Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendants’
Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One as to Di Lello;
(3)      Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendants’
Further Responses to Requests for Admission, Set One as to Di Lello;
(4)      Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendants’
Further Responses to Request for Production, Set One as to Di Lello;
(5)      Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendants’
Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One as to Bottega;
(6)      Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendants’
Further Responses to Requests for Admission, Set One as to Bottega; and
(7)      Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendants’
Further Responses to Request for Production, Set One as to Bottega.
In addition,
the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Defendants’ Further Responses to Form Interrogatories. 
Accordingly,
the Court also orders Defendants to provide code-compliant supplemental responses
without objection along with all responsive documents on or before October 11,
2024.
Finally, the
Court orders Defendants’ counsel to pay Plaintiff’s counsel discovery sanctions
in the amount of $7,660.00 on or before October 31, 2024. 
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
DATED:      September 19, 2024
