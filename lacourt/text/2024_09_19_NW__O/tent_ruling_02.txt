[1] All statutory references
are to California codes unless stated otherwise.


[2] Even if Defendants’ arguments were viable, they would only affect a
party’s capacity to sue, not standing, and so do not implicate
jurisdiction. Capacity must be raised by a special demurrer or it is waived. Since
that time has passed, Defendants cannot challenge capacity.
 


[3] Though not attached to
any subsequent filings, Defendants appear to have served supplemental responses
to all eight of Plaintiff’s discovery requests on September 5, 2024. (See,
e.g., Di Lello RFPs Opposition.) The Court will analyze each of Plaintiff’s
eight motions as of the date of filing (July 9, 2024) because the Court does
not consider motions to compel further responses moot when responses are
provided after such motions are filed unless the moving party withdraws them.
Whether these supplemental responses comply with this Court’s order here will
be up to counsel to ultimately determine.


[4] The same logic the Court
applies to supplemental responses provided after a motion to compel
further responses has been filed applies to the production of documents after
such motion as well. (See fn. 3, supra.)


[5] In the Court’s
experience, one of the added benefits to providing code compliant responses to
this FROG is that it forces defendants to recognize those affirmative defenses
for which there is no evidence to support them and smartly abandon them. 


[6] To the extent Bottega
provided supplemental responses after Plaintiff filed its Motion RFAs, that
does not render the motion moot as Bottega’s argument implies for the reasons
already stated above.
