English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is to deny the motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings without prejudice. The defendant, MW Residential SoCal Corp., moved to compel arbitration and stay proceedings, arguing that a valid arbitration agreement exists between the parties. However, the defendant failed to submit competent evidence to establish the existence of the arbitration agreement and also failed to establish the plaintiff's refusal to arbitrate. The judge's ruling is based on the lack of evidence and the defendant's inability to demonstrate that the plaintiff has refused to arbitrate. The judge orders the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
