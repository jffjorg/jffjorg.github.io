```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant, Semisi Pomee. However, the proof of service is defective because the electronic service address of the person making the service is not set forth. Additionally, electronic service of documents on a self-represented party like the plaintiff requires express consent, which is lacking. As a result, the demurrer and motion to strike are taken off the calendar.
