[TENTATIVE] ORDER TAKING OFF CALENDAR DEMURRER TO COMPLAINT AND
MOTION TO STRIKE BY DEFENDANT 
 
       The Court has reviewed the demurrer filed by Defendant, Semisi
Pomee, and motion to strike. Both motions were served electronically on
Plaintiff. The proof of service is defective as the electronic service address
of the person making the service is not set forth. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1013b.) Additionally,
electronic service of documents on a self-represented party such as Plaintiff
requires express consent, of which there is no evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6 subd. (c).) 
       Accordingly,
the demurrer and motion to strike are taken off calendar.
