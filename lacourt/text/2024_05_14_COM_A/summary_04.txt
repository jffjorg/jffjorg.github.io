And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Semisi Pomee will be taken off calendar. The Judge has reviewed the demurrer and motion, which were served electronically on Plaintiff Siuanga Lamani. However, the proof of service is defective, as the electronic service address of the person making the service is not set forth. Additionally, electronic service of documents on a self-represented party like Plaintiff requires express consent, which is lacking in this case. As a result, the Judge has decided to take the demurrer and motion to strike off the calendar.
