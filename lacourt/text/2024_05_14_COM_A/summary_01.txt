```

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's motion to compel arbitration is denied. The defendant seeks to compel arbitration based on the arbitration agreement in the sales contract between the plaintiff and the dealer. However, the court finds that the defendant is not a signatory to the sales contract and therefore cannot elect arbitration. The court also finds that the plaintiff's claims are not preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act and that the defendant has not demonstrated that the plaintiff is equitably estopped from repudiating the arbitration clause. The court relies on various case law, including Felisilda v. FCA US, LLC, Ochoa v. Ford Motor Co., and Ford Motor Warranty Cases, to support its decision.
