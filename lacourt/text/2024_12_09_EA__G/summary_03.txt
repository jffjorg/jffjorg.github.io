And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that Gershman Properties, LLC's application for default judgment is granted as to CH Glendora, LLC in the amount of $416,764.86. However, the application is tentatively granted as to Arturo Concha and Erika De La Teja in the amount of $460,168.53 pending the submission of an updated CIV-100 form with Section 8 completed. The court finds that Gershman has submitted sufficient evidence to support its application for default judgment against CH Glendora. However, the application is incomplete as to Concha and De La Teja because Section 8 of the CIV-100 form fails to specify counsel's basis for knowing their non-military status.
