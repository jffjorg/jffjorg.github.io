And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Novolex Holdings, LLC's demurrer to Andes Harvest, Inc.'s First Amended Complaint. The demurrer is continued to a date to be determined at the hearing in Department G (Pomona). Novolex's counsel is ordered to meet and confer with Andes's counsel regarding the demurrer and to file a supplemental declaration describing such meet and confer efforts, including whether the attempts were made by telephone, video conference, or in person, at least nine (9) court days before the next scheduled hearing on the demurrer. The Judge finds that the parties did not adequately meet and confer, and that Novolex's counsel's declaration lacks sufficient detail about the meet and confer process.
