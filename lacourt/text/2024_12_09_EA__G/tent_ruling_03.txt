 Case Number:  24PSCV02272    Hearing Date:   December 9, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Gershman Properties, LLC’s Application for
Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Gershman
Properties, LLC’s Application for Default Judgment is GRANTED as to Defendant
CH Glendora, LLC and TENTATIVELY GRANTED as to Defendants Arturo Concha and
Erika De La Teja pending Plaintiff Gershman Properties, LLC’s submission of an
updated CIV-100 form with Section 8 completed.
BACKGROUND
This
is an action for breach of lease agreement. In February 2023, Plaintiff
Gershman Properties, LLC (Gershman) entered into a written lease agreement with
Defendant CH Glendora, LLC (CH Glendora) in which Gershman agreed to lease
commercial property in Glendora to CH Glendora. In support of the lease
agreement, Defendants Arturo Concha and Erika De La Teja executed a guaranty of
lease. Subsequently, Gershman alleges CH Glendora breached the lease agreement
by failing to pay rent.
On July
15, 2024, Gershman filed a complaint against CH Glendora, Concha, and De La
Teja (collectively, Defendants) as well as Does 1-30, alleging the following
causes of action: (1) breach of written contract and (2) liability under
written guaranty. On September 23, 2024, Gershman’s process server served Defendants
with substitute service in Downey.
On November
5, 2024, the court entered default against Defendants after they failed to file
a timely answer. On November 14, 2024, Gershman submitted the present
application for default judgment.
A case
management conference is set for December 9, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Gershman
seeks default judgment against CH Glendora in the total amount of $416,764.86,
including $410,018.57 in damages, $5,990.19 in attorney fees, and $756.10 in
costs. Gershman also seeks default judgment against Concha and De La Teja in
the total amount of $460,168.53, including $453,422.24 in damages, $5,990.19 in
attorney fees, and $756.10 in costs.
Because
the court finds Gershman submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS Gershman’s
application for default judgment as to CH Glendora.
But
as to Concha and De La Teja, Gershman’s application is incomplete as Section 8
of the CIV-100 form fails to specify counsel’s basis for knowing Concha and De
La Teja’s nonmilitary status. Accordingly, the court TENTATIVELY
GRANTS Gershman’s
application for default judgment as to Concha and De La Teja pending Gershman’s
submission of an updated CIV-100 form.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Gershman’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED as to CH Glendora and TENTATIVELY
GRANTED as to Concha and De La Teja pending Gershman’s submission of an
updated CIV-100 form with Section 8 completed.
