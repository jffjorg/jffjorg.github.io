I.           
INTRODUCTION
On August 2, 2023, plaintiffs Faheem
Asmar Ali (“Ali”) and Gryphon Security Service, LLC (“Gryphon Security”)
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action against defendant Tesla, Inc.
dba Tesla Motors, Inc. (“Tesla”). Plaintiffs assert causes of action for
violations of the Song-Beverly Act and allege that Tesla has failed to comply
with its warranty and repair obligations in connection with Plaintiffs’ leased
2022 Tesla Model 3 (the “Subject Vehicle”). 
On September 5, 2023, Defendant filed
this motion for an order compelling Plaintiffs to arbitrate their claims. 
On January 29, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
their opposition to Defendant’s motion. 
On February 2, 2024, Defendant filed
its reply brief. 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
When seeking to compel arbitration, the
initial burden lies with the moving party to demonstrate the existence of a
valid arbitration agreement by a preponderance of evidence. (Ruiz v. Moss
Bros. Auto Group (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 836, 841-42; Gamboa v. Northeast
Community Clinic (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 158, 164-65.) It is sufficient for
the moving party to produce a copy of the arbitration agreement or set forth
the agreement’s provisions. (Gamboa, supra, 72 Cal.App.5th at p. 165.)
The burden then shifts to the opposing party to prove by a preponderance of
evidence any defense to enforcement of the contract or the arbitration clause.
(Ruiz, supra, 232 Cal.App.4th at p. 842; Gamboa, supra,
72 Cal.App.5th at p. 165.) The trial court then weighs all the evidence
submitted and uses its discretion to make a final determination. (Id.) 
III.       
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Tesla requests judicial notice of
Plaintiff’s Complaint.  The Court grants
the request pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(d).
IV.        
DISCUSSION
In ruling on a motion to compel
arbitration, the Court must first determine whether the parties actually agreed
to arbitrate the dispute, and general principles of California contract law
help guide the court in making this determination. (Mendez v. Mid-Wilshire
Health Care Center (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 534, 541; Victoria v. Superior
Court (1985) 40 Cal. 3d 734, 835.) “[A]rbitration is a matter of contract
and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he
has not agreed so to submit.” (AT&T Technologies v. Communications
Workers (1986) 475 U.S. 643, 648 (citations and internal quotations
omitted); see also Sparks v. Vista Del Mar Child & Family Services
(2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 1511, 1518 [“Because arbitration is a contractual
matter, a party that has not agreed to arbitrate a controversy cannot be
compelled to do so”].) 
Tesla has met its burden to show that
an arbitration agreement exists. The lease agreement between Plaintiff and
Tesla (“Lease”) requires arbitration of “any dispute arising out of or relating
to any aspect of the relationship between you [Plaintiff] and Tesla”. (Kim
Decl., Ex. 1.) The arbitration will be “administered by the American
Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules” and Tesla
will pay all AAA fees. (Id.) Ali’s electronic signature is on the Lease
as an authorized signatory of Gryphon Security. (Id.) 
In opposition, Plaintiffs do not dispute
that the arbitration agreement in the Lease is signed or authentic, but solely argue
that the agreement is unenforceable because it is procedurally and
substantively unconscionable. (Opp., pp. 2-8.) Unconscionability generally
includes the absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties
together with contract terms that unreasonably favor the other party. (Carboni
v. Arrospide (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 76, 82-83.) Unconscionability has both a
‘procedural’ and a ‘substantive’ element.” (A & M Produce Co. v. FMC
Corp. (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 473, 486.) 
An agreement to arbitrate is unenforceable only if both procedural and
substantive unconscionability is shown. (Stirlen v. Supercuts, Inc.
(1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1519, 1533.) Procedural unconscionability focuses on
whether there is “oppression” arising from an inequality of bargaining power or
“surprise” arising from buried terms in a complex printed form. (Id. at
1280.)  Substantive unconscionability
addresses the existence of overly harsh or one-sided terms. (Id.) 
Plaintiff has the burden of proving
both procedural and substantive unconscionability. (Crippen v. Central
Valley RV Outlet. Inc. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1165). Both, however,
need not be present to the same degree. A sliding scale is applied so that the
“more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of
procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the
term is unenforceable, and vice versa.” (Morris v. Redwood Empire Bancorp
(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1317.) 
Plaintiffs argue that the Lease is an
adhesive contract because it was offered on a “take it or leave it” basis
without any meaningful opportunity to negotiate with Tesla regarding any of the
terms. But even if it were offered on a take it or leave it basis, the contract
is not adhesive because it includes an opt-out provision which allows the
Plaintiffs to opt out of the arbitration agreement within 30 days. (Kim Decl.,
Ex. 1.) Plaintiffs also argue that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable
because the Consumer Arbitration Rules were not attached to the agreement. But
Tesla informs the consumer of two ways to obtain information about the Rules. The
arbitration agreement states: “To learn more about the Rules and how to begin
an arbitration, you may call any AAA office or go to www.adr.org.” (Kim Decl.,
Ex. 1.) This instruction, when coupled with opt-out provision, reduces any
procedural unconscionability caused by the “adhesive” nature of the contract to
a minimal amount. 
Next, Plaintiffs argue that the
arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable. First, Plaintiffs claim
the arbitration agreement allows the party electing arbitration to choose the
arbitration organization and rules. (Opp., p. 6.) However, this is not the text
of the agreement, which provides that the arbitration will be administered by AAA
and under AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules. Courts have found AAA and its rules
to be neutral and fair. (Lagatree v. Luce, Forward, Hamilton & Scripps
(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1105, 1126-1127.) Second, Plaintiffs claim that the
arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable because the consumer is
responsible or arbitration costs above $5,000. (Opp., p. 7.)  But the agreement provides that Tesla will
“pay all AAA fees for any arbitration, which will be held in the city or county
of your [Plaintiff’s] residence.” (Ex. 1 to Kim Decl.) Therefore, Plaintiffs
fail to show how the arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable. 
 
V.          
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Tesla’s motion
to compel arbitration is GRANTED. The action is stayed pending the completion
of arbitration. The Court sets a status conference for August 8, 2024 at 8:30
a.m. in Department 3 of the Alhambra Courthouse. A joint statement is to be
submitted to the Court no later than five days before the hearing.
