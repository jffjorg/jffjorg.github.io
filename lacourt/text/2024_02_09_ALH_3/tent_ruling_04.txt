[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: PETITION FOR APPROVAL OF COMPROMISE OF ACTION FOR MINOR

 
Dept.
  3
8:30
  a.m.

February
   9, 2024



 
Claimant Chloe
 Segura (“Claimant”), a minor, by and through their Guardian Ad Litem, Valerie
 Gutierrez (“Petitioner”), has agreed to settle their claims against
Defendant CEC Entertainment GUC Trust in exchange for $22,744.08.
If approved, $11,000 will be used for litigation costs, consisting
of expert fees, mediation fees, and transcripts, leaving a balance of $11,744.08
for Claimant to be deposited into a blocked account, subject to withdrawal
only upon authorization of the court. No attorney’s fees are requested and
counsel is only requesting to be reimbursed for $11,000 out of $29,512.48 in
costs. (Attachment 13b.)  
Court approval is required for all
settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate
Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc. § 372.) The Court has reviewed the proposed settlement and finds
that it is fair and reasonable. 
The Court notes that the proposed order
on Form MC-351 does not identify the $11,000 in costs to be paid. Therefore,
the Court interlineates this amount into the proposed order (Item 8 (a)(2)) payable
to Rose, Klein & Marias LLP and GRANTS the unopposed petition. 
The Court sets an OSC re: proof of
deposit for May 9, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in the Alhambra Courthouse. (Cal. Rules
of Court, Rule 7.953(a).) If an acknowledgement of receipt by the financial
institution is filed before that date, no appearance will be required.
Per California Rules of Court, Rule
7.952, Petitioner and Claimant must appear at the hearing, unless the Court
finds good cause to excuse their appearance. The Court finds that Claimant’s
appearance is not necessary, but will require Petitioner to appear.
Moving party to give notice.
