Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Lyco 1, LLC vs. Michael Cheng, et al. The ruling concerns a motion for an order to show cause why Truong Ngoc should not be held in contempt for willfully disobeying a deposition subpoena. The deposition subpoena was issued to Ngoc on August 30, 2023, and personally served on her on September 7, 2023. Ngoc failed to appear for the deposition on September 28, 2023, and later filed a response to the motion, claiming that her failure to appear was due to her attorney's understanding that the deposition would not be proceeding.

The judge finds that the parties discussed whether the deposition would proceed after Ngoc's failure to appear and that there is no indication of Plaintiff's intent to proceed with the deposition after this discussion. The judge also notes that Mr. Hogue, Ngoc's attorney, experienced medical issues and was unavailable for depositions, and that Michael Cheng, a defendant and cross-complainant, was hospitalized for abdominal surgery and has pancreatic cancer.

Instead of issuing an order to show cause (OSC) re: contempt, the judge orders Ngoc to comply with the deposition subpoena and appear for her deposition within the next 30 days. The judge expects the parties to meet and confer regarding a future deposition date for Ngoc and any reasonable accommodations that may be required. If the parties fail to agree on those accommodations, Ngoc may file a motion for a protective order.
