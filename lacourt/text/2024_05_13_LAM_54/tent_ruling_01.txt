COUNSEL TO NOTICE.
 
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
The Court may issue an order allowing
an attorney to withdraw from representation, after notice to the client.  (CCP § 284.) 
The attorney may withdraw from representation where the withdrawal would
not result in undue prejudice to the client’s interest—for example, counsel
cannot withdraw at a critical point in the litigation.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.
App. 4th 904, 915; see California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.) 
 
Ropers, Majeski PC seeks
to withdraw from representation of Cross-Defendants Moonlight Construction, Ben
Nino Hunter, and Moran Elkarif. Counsel states that there is a conflict of
interest requiring withdrawal. The Court’s record reflects the parties have
settled the action. No prejudice will result from counsel’s withdrawal. Counsel
has complied with CRC 3.1362. 
 
There is good cause
for counsel’s withdrawal. The motion is GRANTED.
