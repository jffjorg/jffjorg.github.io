And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendants, The Church of Our Savior, et al., to the first amended complaint filed by plaintiff Rosalyn Sevgiyan. The court has sustained the demurrer to the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action for FEHA violations, as the defendants are exempt from FEHA obligations as a religious organization. The court has also sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action for wrongful termination, as it is derivative of the claims for FEHA violations. However, the court has overruled the demurrer to the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth causes of action for slander, as the allegations are not duplicative or redundant. The defendants are ordered to file and serve answers to the first amended complaint within 30 days of the ruling.
