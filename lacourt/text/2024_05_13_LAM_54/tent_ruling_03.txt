BACKGROUND
 
On February 23, 2024, Plaintiff Rosalyn
Sevgiuan filed the operative first amended complaint against Defendants The Rector, Wardens and Vestry of The Church of Our Saviour, in San
Gabriel, California (sued as The Church of Our Saviour and A Child’s Garden
School), and Jeffrey Thornberg, asserting 16 causes of action for FEHA and CFRA
violations, wrongful termination and slander.
 
Plaintiff alleges she was terminated from her position as a teacher at
the Defendant school due to her pregnancy, disability, and race. Plaintiff also
alleges Defendant Thornberg sexually harassed her and falsely accused her of
stealing.
 
REQUEST FOR
JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
Defendants’ request for judicial notice
is GRANTED.    
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken to the whole complaint or to any
of the causes of action in it.  (CCP §
430.50(a).)  A demurrer challenges only
the legal sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its factual
allegations or the plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996)
50 Cal. App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court
must treat as true the complaint's material factual allegations, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.  (Id. at 732-33.)  The complaint is to be construed liberally to
determine whether a cause of action has been stated.  (Id. at 733.)
 
A. Fourth,
Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Causes of Action for FEHA Violations
 
Defendants demur to the fourth, fifth, sixth
and seventh causes of action for FEHA violations on the grounds that Defendants
are exempted from FEHA obligations as a religious organization. Gov. § 12926(d) provides, “ ‘Employer’ does not
include a religious association or corporation not organized for private profit.”

In
opposition, Plaintiff asserts Defendants waived the exemption by displaying
FEHA posters and having anti-discrimination policies in their handbook. In
support, Plaintiff cites cases generally discussing the concepts of waiver and
estoppel but provides no California authority holding that a religious
organization (or any exempt organization) can waive FEHA exemptions. This is
insufficient to show Defendants are liable under FEHA.
The
demurrer to the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh causes of action is SUSTAINED.
As Plaintiff cites no authority allowing liability for FEHA violations against
a religious organization, the Court declines leave to amend.
B. Third Cause of
Action for Wrongful Termination
Defendants
assert the third cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of
public policy fails because it is derivative of the claims FEHA violations. Under
this cause of action, Plaintiff alleges she was wrongfully terminated for
reporting Labor law and FEHA violations. This claim is based at least in part
on allegations of whistleblower retaliation. The demurrer cannot be sustained
to part of a cause of action.
C. Fourteenth,
Fifteenth and Sixteenth Causes of Action for Slander
Defendants
demur to the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth causes of action for slander
on the grounds that they are duplicative and redundant. Plaintiff alleges
different defamatory statements under each cause of action. They are not
duplicative or redundant.
The
demurrer to the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth causes of action is
OVERRULED.
