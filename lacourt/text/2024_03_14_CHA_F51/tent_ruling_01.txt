Motion Filed: 11/20/23
 
MOVING PARTY: Cross-Defendant Direct 2U Insurance
Services (“Cross-Defendant”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendants/Cross-Complainants John
Harris; and Kavah Harris (“Cross-Complainants”)
NOTICE: OK
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order deeming each of Cross-Defendant’s
Requests for Admission (“RFAs”), Set One, propounded on Cross-Complainants, be
admitted.
 
TENTATIVE RULING: The unopposed motion is granted. The
Court deems each of Cross-Defendant’s RFAs, Set One as admitted. The Court
imposes sanctions against Cross-Complainants in the amount of $250.00. 
 
Cross-Defendant is reminded to review the 5/3/19 First
Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil. When e-filing
documents, parties must comply with the “TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS” which are set
forth at page 4, line 4 through page 5, line 12 of the Court’s 5/3/19 First
Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil (particularly
bookmarking declarations and exhibits). (CRC 3.1110(f)(4).) Failure to comply
with these requirements in the future may result in papers being rejected,
matters being placed off calendar, matters being continued so documents can be
resubmitted in compliance with these requirements, documents not being
considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is an action for subrogation
and indebtedness arising from a vehicle collision which took place on 5/10/19. (Pl.’s
Mot. 4:1–2.)  On 12/18/20, Plaintiff
California Casualty and Indemnity Exchange filed its complaint, alleging
against Defendants/Cross-Complainants the following causes of action: (1)
Subrogation; and (2) Indebtedness. On 6/2/22, Cross-Complainants filed their
operative third amended complaint, alleging against three named
cross-defendants the following causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract; (2)
Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (3) Declaratory Relief; and
(4) Negligence.
 
On 9/19/23, Cross-Defendant served Cross-Complainants
with its RFAs, Set One by electronic service. (Decl. of Shain Wasser ¶ 2.) On 11/20/23,
Plaintiff filed the instant motion to deem its RFAs as admitted. No opposition
has been filed to date.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.   
Legal Standard
 
A responding party must respond to
each propounded request for admission with either a substantive answer or an
objection to the particular request. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.210.) 
A propounding party may move for an order deeming the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted if the responding party fails to serve a timely
response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2033.280, subd. (b); 2033.250,
subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve a timely
response “waives any objection to the requests, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product” unless the Court grants it
relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall
make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Id. at subd. (c).)
 
Here, as Cross-Defendant served its
RFAs on Defendant by e-mail on 9/19/23, the last day for Cross-Complainants to serve
their responses was 10/23/23. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.260, subd. (a); 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).) Cross-Complainants
have not served any responses to date, nor have they filed any opposition to
the instant motion. (Wasser Decl. ¶
4.) As Cross-Complainants failed to timely serve any response to Cross-Defendant’s
RFAs, they have consequently waived any objections thereto. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280,
subd. (a).) Based on the foregoing, the Court grants Cross-Defendant’s
unopposed motion to deem its RFAs, Set One to Cross-Complainants as admitted.
 
B.    
Sanctions¿ 
 
“It is mandatory that the court
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests
for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd.
(c).) Additionally, “the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that
conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
 
Here, in granting the instant
motion, the Court finds it reasonable to award Cross-Defendant sanctions
against Cross-Complainants in the amount of $250.00.

CONCLUSION¿ 
 
The unopposed motion is granted. The
Court deems each of Cross-Defendant’s RFAs, Set One as admitted. The Court
imposes sanctions against Cross-Complainants in the amount of $250.00.
