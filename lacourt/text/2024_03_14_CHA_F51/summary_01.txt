And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge grants the unopposed motion filed by Cross-Defendant Direct 2U Insurance Services to deem its Requests for Admission (RFAs) as admitted. The RFAs were propounded on September 19, 2023, and no responses were served by the Cross-Complainants, John Harris and Kavah Harris. The Judge finds that the Cross-Complainants failed to timely serve any responses, which waived any objections they may have had to the RFAs. As a result, the Judge orders that each RFA, Set One, be deemed admitted. Additionally, the Judge imposes sanctions against the Cross-Complainants in the amount of $250.00.
