The ruling grants the motion to compel further responses to discovery requests filed against LACFCD, denies the motion to compel further responses to discovery requests filed against COLA, and finds that the Plaintiffs have waived their right to compel further responses to discovery requests filed against COLA. The ruling also declines to impose sanctions on either party.
