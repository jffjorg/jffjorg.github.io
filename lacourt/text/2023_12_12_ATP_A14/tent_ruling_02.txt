Legal Standard
 
Standard
for Judgment on the Pleadings – A defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings only
when: a motion for judgment on the pleadings may only be made on one of the
following grounds: (1) the court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the
cause of action alleged in the complaint; or (2) the complaint does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 438(c)(1).)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A motion for
judgment on the pleadings challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading’s
allegations, not their veracity. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) Thus, a motion for judgment on the pleadings is the
functional equivalent of a general demurrer. (Lance Camper Mfg. Corp. v.
Republic Indemnity Co. of Am. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198; see also Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999 [“A motion for judgment on
the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence
attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that
can be judicially noticed. Presentation of extrinsic evidence is therefore not
proper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.”].)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
The
standard for ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially
the same as that applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of
the pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears
that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Bezirdjian v.
O'Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322 [citing Schabarum v.
California Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216].)¿Any defects must either appear on the face
of the pleading, or else be taken by judicial notice. (Id. at 321-22.)
The parties’ ability to prove their respective claims is of no concern. (Cloud,
supra, 67 Cal.App.4th 995 at 999.) Though the Court must accept the
allegations of the complaint and answer as true (Gerawan Farming, Inc. v.
Lyons (2000) 24 Cal.4th 468, 515), it will not do so for “conclusions of
law or fact, opinions, speculation, or allegations contrary to law or
[judicially noticed] facts. . .” (Stevenson Real Estate Servs., Inc. v. CB
Richard Ellis Real Estate Servs., Inc. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1215,
1219–20.)¿¿

Discussion
 
Application – EUSD demurs to all claims asserted against it. 
 
EUSD
presents that in 2019, the Legislature passed AB 219, signed into law by
Governor Newsom on October 13, 2019 and effective January 01, 2020, which opened
a three-year window for plaintiffs to file suit for childhood sexual abuse
regardless of how long ago the abuse allegedly occurred and amended Cal. Gov.
Code § 905 by eliminating language stating that an exemption to a claim
requirement for childhood sexual abuse claims applied only to claims in which
the conduct occurred on or after January 1, 2009. EUSD next argues (1) the
Legislature cannot pass a law attempting to impose liability on a public entity
for a past occurrence where there is no enforceable claim (i.e., portions of AB
219 are unconstitutional), and (2) Plaintiff did not have an enforceable claim
as Plaintiff never presented a claim to EUSD regarding the misconduct.
 
Plaintiff
attacks the arguments, arguing that EUSD (1) fails to show clear invalidity of
AB 218[1];
(2) the gift clause is distinct from any claims presentation deadline as the
cases cited by Plaintiff discuss “gifts” in the form of public monies; and (3)
the Legislature is free to enact such laws for a public purpose.
 
EUSD,
in reply, argues that (1) AB 218 creates liability where none had previously
existed, (2) legislative intent does not override constitutional restraints,
highlighting the use of state funds/public money; (3) that Coats v. New
Haven Unified School District (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415, cited by
Plaintiff, is misplaced and inapplicable as the case was filed prior to the
passing of AB 218 and did not raise constitutional issues; and (4) the
constitutionality of AB 218 is only challenged as it applies to public
entities. 
 
As
an initial matter, Plaintiff concedes in the Complaint that she is 32 years
old. Under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. , Plaintiff’s claim is timely as “[i]n an
action for recovery of damages suffered as a result of childhood sexual
assault, the time for commencement of the action shall be within 22 years of
the date the plaintiff attains the age of majority or within five years of the
date the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered that
psychological injury or illness occurring after the age of majority was caused
by the sexual assault, whichever period expires later” for actions against any
person for committing an act of sexual assault; actions for liability against
any person or entity who owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, if a wrongful or
negligent act by that person or entity was a legal cause of the childhood
sexual assault that resulted in the injury to the plaintiff; and actions for
liability against any person or entity if an intentional act by that person or
entity was a legal cause of the childhood sexual assault that resulted in the
injury to the plaintiff.. (See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 340.1(a).)
 
Ordinarily,
a governmental claim must be presented to the local public entity within six
months after accrual of the cause of action (Cal. Gov. Code § 911.2(a)), and
that accrual date is not postponed or tolled during the claimant's minority. (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 352(a)). Thus, e.g., an 11-year-old child injured on a school
playground due to the negligent supervision of a school employee must present
her governmental claim within six months of the accident notwithstanding her
status as a minor. However, Cal. Gov. Code § 905 designates 13 classes of
claims against local public entities that are not subject to the claims
procedures of the Government Claims Act, Gov Code §§ 810-996.6. Among these
exceptions are “[c]laims made pursuant to Section 340.1of the Code of Civil
Procedure for the recovery of damages suffered as a result of childhood sexual
assault.” (Cal. Gov. Code § 905(m).) Significantly, the present and applicable
iteration of Gov. Code § 905(m) makes Cal. Gov. Code § 905(m) retroactive. (See
Cal. Gov. Code § 905(p).) Plaintiff did not present a governmental claim under
prior to filing suit, nor was she required to do so.
 
Recognizing
that Plaintiff’s Complaint is timely for purposes of the statute of limitations
unless Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 340.1 and Cal. Gov. Code § 905(m) are found to be
unenforceable against it, EUSD claims that those provisions, as applied to it
here, are unconstitutional. There are, however, a plethora of California cases
holding that a legislature may constitutionally adopt a new statute of
limitations that effectively revives a civil claim previously barred by the
former statute of limitations. (See, e.g., Coats v. New Haven Unified School
District (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415, 425 [“Legislation reviving the statute
of limitations on civil law claims does not violate constitutional principles.”];
Deutsch v. Mosonic Homes of California, Inc. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 748,
760-762 [statute reviving certain claims of childhood sexual abuse otherwise
barred by statutes of limitations is not unconstitutional on its face under the
due process clause]; 20th Century Insurance Company v. Superior Court
(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1247 [application of Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 340.9
(special earthquake statute) to revive plaintiff's action did not impermissibly
impair defendant's right of contract or deny it substantive due process by the
destruction of vested contract rights]; Hellinger v. Farmers Group, Inc.
(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1049, 1061 [revival aspect of Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
340.9 is not unconstitutional; “It has been established law for over a century
that a legislature may revive a civil claim that is barred by the statute of
limitations. The reason is that, in a civil case, there is no constitutional
right of repose.”]; Roman Catholic Bishop of Oakland v. Superior Court
(2020) 128 Cal.App.4th 1155 [statute reviving statute of limitations did not
violate ex post facto principles by reviving punitive damages claim].) The
former January 1, 2009 limitation was selected by the Legislature, itself, in
its 2009 version of Gov. Code § 905(m). (See 2009 version of Cal. Gov. Code §
905(m).) 
 
Notably,
EUSD cites no case that has held that the Legislature's enactment of the
present version of Government Code § 905(m), eliminating the claim presentation
requirement for all claims for childhood sexual assaults, including those
occurring prior to pre-January 1, 2009, is unconstitutional, and this Court is
unwilling to make new law in this area. Should EUSD wish to change the law in
this area, it needs to address that concern to the Legislature.
 
Accordingly,
the MJOP is DENIED.

Conclusion
 
Defendant Eastside Union School District’s Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings is DENIED.
