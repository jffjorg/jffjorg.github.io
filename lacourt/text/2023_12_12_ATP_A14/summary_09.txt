Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled on the Demurrer filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. to the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Alicia Lee. The Demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the Complaint and argues that it lacks specificity and essential supporting facts.

The Court has sustained the Demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that Plaintiff has the opportunity to file an amended pleading within 30 days. The Court has ruled that the Complaint is uncertain and lacks specificity in its allegations, particularly with regard to the doctrine of respondeat superior.

The Court has also declined to sustain the Demurrer without leave to amend, as there is a reasonable possibility that an amendment will successfully rectify the deficiencies within the Complaint.
