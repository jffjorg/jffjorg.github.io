And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a mortgage foreclosure action brought by plaintiff Rodney Rouzan against defendants Newrez LLC DBA Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing and Bank of New York Mellon FKA the Bank of New York as Trustee for the Certificate Holders Cwalt, Inc. Alternative Loan Trust 2005-47 CB. The defendants demurred to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) and the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. The court found that the FAC fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that the defendants are barred from relitigating the same claims due to res judicata. The court also found that the defendants are in privity with each other and with the previous parties in the case, and that the doctrine of res judicata applies.
