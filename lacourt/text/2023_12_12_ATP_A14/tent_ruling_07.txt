 Case Number:  23AVCV00581    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2023    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This is a fraud action. Plaintiff
Amir Edwards (“Plaintiff”) alleges that Defendant New American Funding, LLC,
erroneously sued as Broker Solutions dba New American Solutions (“NAF”),
concealed from Plaintiff that it would be using his promissory notes to clear
all liens and encumbrances order to convey clear title to Plaintiff and a
secondary promissory note to obtain more funding from the Federal Reserve Bank
or other institutions that buy and sell mortgage-backed security. Plaintiff
alleges that NAF received up to three times the amount of money required to
purchase the property and kept the proceeds to itself. 
 
On June 02, 2023, Plaintiff filed
his Complaint alleging four causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) General
Negligence, (3) Fraud, and (4) Common Counts. 
 
On October 12, 2023, NAF and
Defendants Rick Arvielo (“Rick”)[1]
and Patty Arvielo (“Patty” and collectively “Defendants”) filed their Demurrer.
 
No Opposition has been filed. “All
papers opposing a motion so noticed shall be filed with the court and a copy
served on each party at least nine court days. . .before the hearing.” (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 1005(b).) “Section 1013, which extends the time within which
a right may be exercised or an act may be done, does not apply to a notice of
motion, papers opposing a motion, or reply papers governed by this section.” (Ibid.)
The hearing is set for December 12, 2023. Accordingly, an Opposition was due by
November 29, 2023. Should an Opposition be filed, it is now untimely. 
 
On December 05, 2023, Defendants
filed a Notice of Non-Opposition.

Legal Standard
 
Standard for Demurrer – A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action.¿ (Hahn v.¿Mirda¿(2007) 147 Cal.
App. 4th 740, 747.) ¿When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context.¿ (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and
Power¿(2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.)¿ In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial
notice.¿ (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.30(a).)¿A demurrer tests the pleadings
alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.¿ (SKF Farms v.
Superior Court¿(1984) 153 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)¿ Therefore, it lies only
where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially
noticed.¿¿(Ibid.)¿¿The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is
whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.¿ (Hahn,¿supra,¿147 Cal.App.4th at
747.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
A general demurrer admits the truth of all
factual, material allegations properly pled in the challenged pleading,
regardless of possible difficulties of proof.¿¿(Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿ Thus, no matter how unlikely or improbable, plaintiff’s
allegations must be accepted as true for the purpose of ruling on the
demurrer.¿¿(Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.¿(1981) 123
Cal.App.3d 593, 604.)¿ Nevertheless, this rule does not apply to allegations
expressing mere conclusions of law, or allegations contradicted by the exhibits
to the complaint or by matters of which judicial notice may be taken.¿¿(Vance
v. Villa Park¿Mobilehome¿Estates¿(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 698, 709.)¿A general
demurrer does not admit contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the complaint; facts impossible in law; or allegations contrary to
facts of which a court may take judicial notice.¿¿(Blank,¿supra,
39 Cal.3d at p. 318.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Pursuant to¿Code Civ. Proc.¿§430.10(e), the
party against whom a complaint has been filed may object by demurrer to the
pleading on the grounds that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.¿ It is an abuse of discretion to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend if there is a reasonable probability that the
defect can be cured by amendment.¿¿(Schifando¿v. City of Los Angeles¿(2003)
31 Cal.4th 1074, 1082,¿as modified (Dec. 23, 2003).)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿

¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Meet and Confer Requirement – Before filing a demurrer or a motion to strike, the demurring or
moving party is required to meet and confer with the party who filed the
pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the motion to strike
for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be reached through a
filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be raised in
the demurrer.¿ (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41 and 435.5.)¿The Court notes that
this requirement has not been satisfied. (See Decl. Ryan C. Thomason ¶ 3.) However,
“[a] determination by the court that the meet and confer process was
insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.” (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 430.31(a)(4).) Accordingly, the Court determines the Demurrer
on its merits.

Discussion
 
Application – As an
initial matter, Defendants argue that there is no location given for the
property at issue. This is correct. The Complaint fails to include an address.
(See Complaint [generally].) Plaintiff has provided an address in the Civil
Case Cover Sheet Addendum for the location of where the cause of action arose:
“1012 E Ave.” However, this address is not complete. Further, as a fact and
proposition that is not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy, the Court takes judicial notice of the address. (See
Cal. Evid. Code § 452(h).) As written, “1012 E Ave” is not an address that
exists. Thus, as pled, the Complaint is uncertain as defined in Cal. Civ. Code
§ 430.10 as Defendants cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted
or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him or her. (See Weil
& Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group) § 7:85.)
 
The Court addresses Defendants’
remaining arguments. 
 
As to the First Cause of Action
(Breach of Contract), Defendants argue that Plaintiff is relying on the “vapor
money” theory where “no enforceable debt accrues from a lender that does not
fund a loan through hard cash” and such a theory has been found to be frivolous
by various courts. (Demurrer 6:9-10 [citing Kenny Family Trust v. World
Savings Bank FSB (N.D.Cal. Jan. 19, 2005) 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2403].) Defendants
further argue that the Complaint fails to allege any element of a breach of
contract claim. 
 
“To prevail on a cause of action
for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2) the
plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the
defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff.” (Richman
v. Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.) 
 
For this cause of action,
Plaintiff alleges: “NAF concealed the fact from the buyer [Plaintiff] that it
would be using the buyer’s promissory notes; first to clear all the liens and
encumbrances in order to convey clear title to the buyer and then use the
second promissory note to obtain more money from the Federal Reserve Bank or
other institutions that buy and sell mortgage-backed security. NAF received up
to three times the amount of money required to purchase the property and kept
the proceeds to itself.” Notably, the allegations do not address any element of
a claim for breach of contract. Further, as Defendants correctly point out, Plaintiff’s
pleading is a variant of the “ ‘vapor money’ ” theory. That is, the “vapor
money” theory is “the convoluted and nonsensical argument that a plaintiff does
not owe the money advanced by the lender on [his or her] loan because the
indebtedness was not funded by the lender with actual money.” (Tonea v. Bank
of Am., N.A. (N.D. Ga. Mar. 18, 2014) 6 F.Supp.3d 1331, 1344.) No court of
which this Court is aware has accepted this theory, and it is more often than
not rejected as not only without merit, but frivolous. (See Id. [“Courts
in this district have routinely rejected the ‘vapor money’ theory as frivolous.

money" theory must be dismissed.”]; See also Miner v. JPMorgan Chase

19, 2005) (and cases cited therein).”].) This Court sees no reason to deviate
from long-standing precedent though they are persuasive and not binding on this
Court. 
 
As to the Second Cause of Action
(Negligence), Defendants argue that (1) no facts alleged in the Complaint
support a negligence claim; (2) Plaintiff merely asserts nonsensical arguments
that no actual money was used to purchase the real property at issue and why is
there a need for mortgage loans if that is the case; (3) Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants “breached all of its fiduciary duties to the buyer and is therefore
guilty of criminal breach of trust by failing in its good faith requirement”
(Complaint, General Negligence Attachment); and (4) Plaintiff attempts to lead
the Court down the “rabbit hole” with theories about how obligations and other
securities of the United States should be used and how there was any lack of
consideration for the alleged transaction complained about.
 
“ ‘The elements of a cause of
action for negligence are well established. They are “(a) a legal duty to use
due care; (b) a breach of such legal duty; [and] (c)the breach as the proximate
or legal cause of the resulting injury.” ’ ” (Ladd v. County of San Mateo
(1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 917.)
 
Here, Plaintiff’s Complaint does
not discuss duty, breach, or causation. Rather, Plaintiff provides further
allegations stemming from the “vapor money” theory, contract law, “criminal
breach of trust” (see Complaint, General Negligence Attachment), and
“obligations of the United States” (ibid.).
 
As to the Third Cause of Action
(Fraud), Defendants present that the Complaint fails to allege facts supporting
a claim for fraud. Defendants focus on the allegation: “NAF led me to believe
that the money going to the seller would be coming from its own asset account
in the form of a ‘Loan.’ ” (Complaint, Fraud Attachment.) Defendant highlights
that Plaintiff’s allegations are conclusory. 
 
It appears that Plaintiff is
alleging fraudulent concealment. “[T]he elements of an action for fraud and
deceit based on a concealment are:(1) the defendant must have concealed or
suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to
disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3)the defendant must have intentionally
concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4)
the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he
did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of
the concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff must have sustained
damage.” (Boschma v. Home Loan Center, Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 230,
248.)
 
Here, Plaintiff once again
alleges the “vapor money” theory. (See Complaint, Fraud Attachment [“They lied
because they knew, or ought to have known, that their own book or ledger would
show that NAF does not have any money to lend and that their records will show
that no such loan transaction ever took place. . .[NAF] violated its corporate
charter by lending “credit” or “nothing at all” and then charging on this
make-believe loan. . .”].) No elements of fraud are addressed.
 
As to the Fourth Cause of Action
(Common Counts), Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not pled any facts to show
that money was received by Defendants that belonged to Plaintiff or was
intended to be used for the benefit of Plaintiff and why this money should be
returned for him. 
 
“In the common law action of
general assumpsit, it is customary to plead an indebtedness using ‘common
counts.’ In California, it has long been settled the allegation of claims using
common counts is good against special or general demurrers. The only essential
allegations of a common count are ‘(1) the statement of indebtedness in a
certain sum, (2) the consideration, i.e., goods sold, work done, etc., and (3)
nonpayment.’ ” (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th
445, 460.) Moroever, "[w]hen a common count is used as an alternative way
of seeking the same recovery demanded in a specific cause of action, and is
based on the same facts, the common count is demurrable if the cause of action
is demurrable." (McBride v. Boughton (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 379,
394-395.)
 
Here, the Plaintiff has checked
off that a claim for common counts applies as “an account was stated in writing
by and between plaintiff and defendant in which it was agreed that defendant
was indebted to plaintiff,” “within the last four years for money had and
received by defendant for the use and benefit of plaintiff,” and “for money
lent by plaintiff to defendant at defendant’s request.” (Complaint, Common
Counts Attachment.) However, there is no further information. That is there is
no exhibit supporting that an account was stated in writing, no evidence of the
$315,000 requested by Plaintiff, no evidence of the 3.99% interest rate written
in by Plaintiff, or otherwise. Further, a reasonable inference drawn by the
Complaint is that the Fourth Cause of Action is premised on the same
allegations as an alternate way of seeking recovery from Defendants as that
demanded in the breach of contract causes of action and is based on the same
facts. As the causes of actions were demurrable for reasons ante, so too
is the Fourth Cause of Action. 
 
Leave to amend must
be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman
v. Kennedy¿(1976), 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) While under California law leave to amend is
liberally granted, “leave to amend should not be granted where, in
all probability, amendment would be futile.” (Vaillette v. Fireman's Fund
Ins. Co. (1993), 18 Cal. App. 4th 680, 685).¿ “A trial court does not abuse
its discretion when it sustains a demurrer without¿leave to amend¿if
either (a) the facts and the nature of the claims are clear and no liability
exists, or (b) it is probable from the nature of the defects and previous
unsuccessful attempts to plead that the plaintiff cannot state a claim.” (Cantu
v. Resolution Trust Corp.¿(1992)¿4 Cal.App.4th 857, 889.)¿Plaintiff cannot
rectify the pleadings by an amendment as it is premised on the “vapor money”
theory which has been rejected by various courts as frivolous. 
 
Accordingly, the Demurrer is
SUSTAINED without leave to amend.

Conclusion
 
Defendants Rick Arvielo, Patty
Arvielo, and New American Funding, LLC’s Demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to
amend.
