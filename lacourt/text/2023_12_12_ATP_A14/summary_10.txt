And here is the English summary:

The Court's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff The California LP's Motion to Set Aside and Vacate Dismissal. The motion was filed by Plaintiff on October 30, 2023, seeking to set aside the dismissal of the unlawful detainer action that occurred on October 11, 2023, due to the mistake of Plaintiff's counsel's office. The Court notes that Defendant Shanniece Stevenson has not filed an opposition to the motion and that a failure to oppose a motion may be construed as a concession on the merits. The Court finds that Plaintiff's argument is supported by the declaration of Larry Hales and that the motion is granted based on the mandatory relief provision of California Code of Civil Procedure section 473.
