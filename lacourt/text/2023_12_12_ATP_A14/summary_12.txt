```

Summary:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration, finding that the arbitration agreement in the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) is not unconscionable. The Judge notes that the doctrine of unconscionability requires an absence of meaningful choice and contract terms that are unreasonably favorable to one party, and that the arbitration agreement in this case does not meet these criteria. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff has not shown that she would be unable to pay the arbitration costs over $5,000.00, and that the provision in question has not been shown to be substantively unconscionable. The Judge grants the motion to compel arbitration and denies the Plaintiff's challenge to the agreement.
