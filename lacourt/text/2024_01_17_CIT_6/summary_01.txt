Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the respondent's motion for reconsideration and modification of the order on the petition for writ of mandate. The respondent, El Monte Union High School District, had sought to reconsider the court's order regarding the disclosure of records regarding Justin Rosien. The respondent argued that new facts had arisen, including Rosien's objection to the court's order and the respondent's decision to waive attorney-client privilege regarding a confidential report. However, the court found that the respondent had not presented new facts or circumstances justifying reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. The court also found that the respondent's decision to waive attorney-client privilege was not a new fact or circumstance justifying reconsideration. The court noted that the respondent was aware of the report earlier and chose to maintain attorney-client privilege over it, and that the respondent's subsequent decision to waive that privilege did not entitle it to have the court reconsider the order.
