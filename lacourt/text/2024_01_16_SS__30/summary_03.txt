And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Sofia Jamora in the case of JAMORA vs JAXSON HAYES, case number 22STCV10458. The defendant has moved for a protective order to prevent the plaintiff from taking the deposition of Robert Pelinka, Vice President of Basketball Operations and General Manager of the Los Angeles Lakers. The plaintiff seeks to depose Pelinka to gain information about the vetting process of Jaxon Hayes, who was arrested and sentenced for an incident in 2021.

The court finds that Pelinka is an apex deponent, and that the plaintiff has not shown good cause that he has unique or superior personal knowledge of discoverable information. The court also finds that the information sought by the plaintiff is available through other sources, such as lower-level employees of the Lakers or written discovery.

As a result, the court grants the defendant's motion for a protective order and prohibits the taking of Pelinka's deposition. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
