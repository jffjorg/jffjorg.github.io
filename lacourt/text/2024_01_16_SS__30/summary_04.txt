And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file an amended complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add defendants Isaac Faliv, Minoo Faliv, and Ethan Faliv, and allege additional causes of action for nuisance, breach of governing documents, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiff discovered through discovery that there had been prior complaints by other building occupants, and that Defendant Wilshire Manning HOA was aware of residents' desire to increase the height of the guardrails. However, the plaintiff's unit's balcony guardrail height was not increased, contributing to Robert Niksefat's death. The judge finds that the plaintiff's motion is granted, as the proposed amended complaint complies with the rules of court and the plaintiff has demonstrated why the amendment is necessary and proper.
