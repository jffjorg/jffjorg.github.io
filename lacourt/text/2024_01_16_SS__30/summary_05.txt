And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge is issuing a tentative ruling regarding a motion to compel arbitration. The motion was filed by the defendant, Santander Consumer USA Inc., et al., to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's claims in accordance with the terms of their written agreement to arbitrate. The Judge is continuing the motion to a date convenient to the Court and the parties so that the moving party can serve the notice of motion and motion on the answering defendants. The Judge is also ordering the moving party to file proof of service showing that the motion was served on the answering defendants. Additionally, the Judge is requiring the moving party to update their declaration to show that the plaintiff has consented to electronic service, if applicable. The Judge is continuing the motion due to the lack of proof of service showing that the answering defendants were served with the motion, and due to the need for the moving party to demonstrate that electronic service was proper.
