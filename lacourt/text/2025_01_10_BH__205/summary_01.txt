And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment against the defendant. The plaintiff, Capital One, N.A., is seeking a default judgment of $57,338.78 against the defendant, Alexandra Edenborough, for damages and costs. The plaintiff had filed a complaint against the defendant for a credit account default and had served the defendant with the complaint, but the defendant did not respond. The plaintiff then requested entry of default and default judgment.

The judge is denying the request because the plaintiff did not fully comply with the requirements for substitute service. The plaintiff served the defendant through an employee at a commercial post office box, but there was only one attempt made to serve the defendant, and the declaration of due diligence filed in connection with the proof of service shows that the process server attempted service only once.

Additionally, the judge notes that the declaration of the plaintiff's CEO, Michelle Imhotep, lacks personal knowledge of the facts alleged in the declaration. The judge is setting an order to show cause why the case should not be dismissed on April 10, 2025.
