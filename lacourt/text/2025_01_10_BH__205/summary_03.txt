And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge sustains the demurrer filed by Sanwa Technologies, Inc. (Cross-Defendant) to the cross-complaint filed by Paul Joseph Titus and Hayat Bi (Cross-Complainants) without leave to amend. The Court agrees with Sanwa's argument that Cross-Complainants have failed to plead facts supporting one or more of the grounds for seeking rescission of the stock purchase agreement (SPA). Specifically, the Court finds that Cross-Complainants have failed to plead fraud with specificity, duress, or menace as required by California law. Additionally, the Court holds that Cross-Complainants' claims for ambiguity and lack of consideration are not grounds for rescission under California law. As a result, the Court sustains the demurrer to the declaratory relief claim, which is based on the rescission claim that fails for the reasons set forth above.
