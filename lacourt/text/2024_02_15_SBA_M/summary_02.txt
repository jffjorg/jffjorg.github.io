And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses to request for production of documents, set one, and request for sanctions. The motion is moot as to certain requests, but granted in part and denied in part as to other requests. The judge finds that the requests for specific information related to customer complaints and warranty repairs involving the same make, model, and year as the plaintiff's vehicle are justified and orders the defendant to serve further verified responses within 10 days. The judge also denies the request for all documents produced in another unrelated litigation, finding it to be overly broad, vague, and burdensome. Finally, the judge denies the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions and the defendant's counter request for monetary sanctions.
