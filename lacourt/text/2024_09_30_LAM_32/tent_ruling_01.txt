  order RE:
claim of exemption (chase bank) 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On January 22, 2019, Plaintiffs
Antonio Leon and Blanca Leon filed this action against Defendants James Jaber,
MD, Georgia Bode, MD, and Los Angeles Community Hospital, asserting causes of
action for (1) medical malpractice and (2) loss of consortium. The First
Amended Complaint was filed on May 8, 2019. Blanca Leon’s claims were
dismissed, leaving Antonio Leon’s medical malpractice claim. 
            The matter came on for trial between
January 29, 2024 and February 9, 2024, after which the jury returned a verdict
for Plaintiff against Defendant Bode. Judgment was entered on March 21, 2024 in
the total amount of $12,478,222.95.    
            On August 8, 2024, Plaintiff levied
Defendant’s deposit accounts at Citibank and Chase Bank. Citibank and Chase
turned over $1,227,657.16 and $97,915.03 to the levying officer, respectively. 
            On August 27, 2024, Defendant
submitted claims of exemption to the levying officer, claiming exemption over
all levied funds. The claims of exemption were served to Plaintiff on August
30, 2024. 
            On September 13, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant opposition to the claim of exemption regarding Chase Bank.
Defendant filed her reply on September 20, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“Except as otherwise provided by law, all
property of the judgment debtor is subject to enforcement of a money judgment.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 695.010(a).) “[A]fter entry of a money judgment, a writ of
execution shall be issued by the clerk of the court, upon application of the
judgment creditor, and shall be directed to the levying officer in the county
where the levy is to be made and to any registered process server.” (Id.,
§ 699.510(a).) 
“Except as otherwise provided by statute,
property that has been levied upon may be claimed to be exempt as provided in” sections
703.510 to 703.610. (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.510(a).) “The claimant may make a
claim of exemption by filing with the levying officer, either in person or by
mail, a claim of exemption together with a copy of the claim.” (Id., §
703.520(a).) “Promptly after the filing of the claim of exemption, the levying
officer shall serve [a copy of the claim of exemption and a notice of claim of
exemption] on the judgment creditor personally or by mail.” (Id., §
703.540.) “Within 15 days after service of the notice of claim of exemption, a
judgment creditor who opposes the claim of exemption shall file with the court
a notice of opposition to the claim of exemption and a notice of motion for an
order determining the claim of exemption.” (Id., § 703.550(a).) 
“The hearing on the motion shall be held
not later than 30 days from the date the notice of motion was filed with the
court unless continued by the court for good cause.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
703.570(a).) “The claim of exemption and notice of opposition to the claim of
exemption constitute the pleadings, subject to the power of the court to permit
amendments in the interest of justice.” (Id., § 703.580(a).) “At a
hearing under this section, the exemption claimant has the burden of proof.” (Id.,
§ 703.580(b).) “At the conclusion of the hearing, the court shall determine by
order whether or not the property is exempt in whole or in part. Subject to
Section 703.600, the order is determinative of the right of the judgment
creditor to apply the property to the satisfaction of the judgment. No findings
are required in a proceeding under this section.” (Id., § 703.580(d).) 
DISCUSSION
            Retirement funds are “exempt only to
the extent necessary to provide for the support of the judgment debtor when the
judgment debtor retires and for the support of the spouse and dependents of the
judgment debtor, taking into account all resources that are likely to be available
for the support of the judgment debtor when the judgment debtor retires.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 704.115(e).) 
Defendant claims an exemption over the funds
in her Chase accounts based on the contention that the money consists of retirement
funds. Plaintiff argues that Defendant fails to trace any portion of the levied
$97,915.03 to IRA funds.  
            Defendant’s declaration attached to
her claim of exemption avers that “[a]ll relevant accounts at Chase are
retirement accounts. Attached hereto as Exhibit E is a true and correct copy of
my Chase account records showing the only transactions in the past two years
are IRA deposits.” (Manasserian Decl., Ex. 5, p. 7, ¶ 19.) 
            However, there is no indication that
the amount in Exhibit E is linked to the levied amount. Even if it was from the
same funds, Defendant provides no evidence that all other funds from Chase
constitute IRA funds. The total levied sum from Chase was $97,915.03, whereas
Exhibit E represents -$63,328.48 from one account. 
Furthermore, Defendant fails to prove
which portion of the levied amount represents funds necessary for supporting
Defendant or her husband. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 704.115(e).) Defendant
presents no evidence in her reply, and does not cite any previously-filed
evidence, that could be used to determine such amounts. Defendant argues
without evidence that her husband’s medical costs are $35,000 per month.
Defendant also fails to show that such medical expenses require the entire
levied sum to be exempt.   
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s claim of exemption for
Chase Bank is DENIED.

DISCUSSION
I.
Social Security 
A “deposit account in which payments of
public benefits or social security benefits are directly deposited by the
government” is “exempt without making a claim” up to certain amounts. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 704.080(a)(1), (b).) The highest of these amounts is $5,250. (Id.,
§ 704.080(b)(4).) The excess amount “is exempt to the extent that it consists
of payments of public benefits or social security benefits,” but “the judgment
debtor has the burden of proving that the excess amount is exempt.” (Id.,
§ 704.080(c), (e)(4).) “[A] fund that is exempt remains exempt to the extent
that it can be traced into deposit accounts.” (Id., § 703.080(a).) “The
exemption claimant has the burden of tracing an exempt fund.” (Id., §
703.080(b).) 
Plaintiff has identified the Social
Security deposits that can be ascertained from Defendant’s evidence. (Opp.
9:18-10:6.) Therefore, Plaintiff concedes that $122,309 is subject to release. To
the extent that there are more Social Security deposits than what Plaintiff has
identified, Defendant cites to no evidence of such deposits. Thus, Defendant
has not proven that any amount beyond $122,309 is exempt under Social Security.   
            Defendant cites Kilker v.
Stillman (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 320, 324 for the proposition that “[i]f funds
are directly deposited by the government, there is no need to trace their
source.” But that does not mean the entire levied amount of $1.2 million
consists of funds deposited by the government. Again, Plaintiff has identified
the Social Security deposits ascertainable from Defendant’s evidence. Defendant
does not contend that Plaintiff’s calculation is incorrect or cite to evidence
of additional Social Security deposits. Kilker does not override the
general rule that the exemption claimant bears the burden of proof. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 703.580(b).)    
Kilker is also factually distinguishable
because in that case, it was “undisputed Stillman's bank account at Preferred
Bank solely contained Social Security payments.” (Kilker, supra, 233
Cal.App.4th at p. 324.) Here, Defendant does not claim, much less prove, that
her Citibank accounts consist solely of Social Security payments. Instead,
Defendant’s declaration in support of the claim of exemption avers that her
bank accounts consist of social security payments, pension benefits, retirement
plans, and earnings. (Manasserian Decl., Ex. 6, p. 6, ¶ 3.) Defendant also
confirms that she has multiple accounts at Citibank. (Id., ¶ 5.) Thus,
the Court cannot infer that the levied amount necessarily consists of Social
Security payments (beyond the $122,309 conceded by Plaintiff).
II.
Pension
“All amounts held, controlled, or in
process of distribution by a public entity derived from contributions by the
public entity or by an officer or employee of the public entity for public
retirement benefit purposes, and all rights and benefits accrued or accruing to
any person under a public retirement system, are exempt without making a claim.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 704.110(b).) This means that “a pension benefit from a
public entity . . . may not be levied upon or made subject to attachment to
satisfy a money judgment.” (Krolikowski v. San Diego City Employees'
Retirement System (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 537, 563.) 
Defendant’s LACERA distributions
constitute “a pension benefit from a public entity” that cannot be levied to
satisfy a judgment. Plaintiff thus concedes that $261,834.02 is subject to
release. There is no indication of any further amounts from LACERA.     
 
 
III.
Wages
            “Paid earnings that can be traced
into deposit accounts . . . are exempt in the following amounts: 
(1) All of the paid earnings are exempt if
prior to payment to the employee they were subject to an earnings withholding
order or an earnings assignment order for support. 
(2) Disposable earnings that would
otherwise not be subject to levy under Section 706.050 that are levied upon or
otherwise sought to be subjected to the enforcement of a money judgment are
exempt if prior to payment to the employee they were not subject to an earnings
withholding order or an earnings assignment order for support.”
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 704.070(b).) 
“‘Paid earnings’ means earnings as defined
in Section 706.011 that were paid to the employee during the 30-day period
ending on the date of the levy.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 704.070(a)(2).) “‘Earnings’
means compensation payable by an employer to an employee for personal services
performed by such employee, whether denominated as wages, salary, commission,
bonus, or otherwise.” (Id., § 706.011(b).) “‘Employee’ means a public
officer and any individual who performs services subject to the right of the
employer to control both what shall be done and how it shall be done.” (Id.,
§ 706.011(e).)  
Defendant claims $9,000 as exempt wages. However,
Defendant identified herself as a “1099 worker” or independent contractor and
indicated that her earnings were subject to “no withholdings.” (Manasserian
Decl. ¶ 26, Ex. 6, p. 3.) Thus, Defendant has not proven that the $9,000 at
issue fall under the wage exemption. In fact, Defendant concedes that she “will
allow Judgment Creditor to retain the levied amount of her paid earnings.”
(Reply 7:26-27.) 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s claim of exemption for
Citibank is GRANTED in the amount of $384,143.02.
