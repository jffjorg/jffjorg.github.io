     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant david kilgore’s demurrer to
  first amended complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 10, 2024, Plaintiff Kevin
Massengale filed this action against Defendants Tangular Gray, David Kilgore,
Lorraine Jimenez, and Analu Fernandini. Plaintiff filed the operative First
Amended Complaint on July 24, 2024. 
The FAC is pled on Judicial Council Form
PLD-C-001 and asserts a cause of action for breach of contract. Plaintiff also
alleges “Deprivation of constitutional protected rights, misrepresentation,
force compelled association, involuntary servitude, Exiled in my own Native
State.” The FAC seeks damages of two hundred million dollars. Plaintiff also
filed a separate document titled “Amended Cause of Action,” which appears to be
a part of his FAC. 
            On August 20, 2024, Defendant
Kilgore filed the instant demurrer to the FAC. Plaintiff filed his opposition
on September 13, 2024.   
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether a
pleading states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the pleading, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)
The Court notes that Defendant has complied with the meet and confer
requirement. (See Jedrzejek Decl.)
DISCUSSION
            The FAC, including the document
“Amended Cause of Action,” is unintelligible and contains no facts supporting
any cognizable cause of action. In his opposition, Plaintiff concedes the
defects and requests leave to amend. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant David Kilgore’s demurrer
is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
