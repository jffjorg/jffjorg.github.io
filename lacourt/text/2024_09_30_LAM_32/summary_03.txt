And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering two motions by the plaintiff, Cynthia Cuellar, to compel responses to discovery requests and to deem matters admitted. The plaintiff filed these motions on August 23 and 27, 2024, after the defendants, The Providence College and Aboli Ndri, failed to respond to the discovery requests on time. The defendants missed the deadline of June 17, 2024, and then requested an extension, which the plaintiff granted. However, the defendants still failed to respond by the new deadline of July 15, 2024.

The judge finds that the defendants have failed to timely respond to the discovery requests and that an order compelling responses is warranted to ensure that the responses are provided. The judge also finds that the defendants' failure to respond is not justified and sanctions are warranted. The judge awards the plaintiff $1,050 in sanctions.

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to the discovery requests and orders the defendants to provide responses within 15 days of the order. The judge also grants the plaintiff's motion to deem matters admitted unless the defendants provide substantially compliant responses before the hearing on the motions.
