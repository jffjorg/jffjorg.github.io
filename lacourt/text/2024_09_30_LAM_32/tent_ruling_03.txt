  Case No.:  23STCV17499
  Hearing Date:  September 30, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motions to compel responses
  and deem matters admitted 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On July 26, 2023, Plaintiff Cynthia
Cuellar filed this employment discrimination action against Defendants The
Providence College and Aboli Ndri. 
            On August 23 and 27, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant two motions to compel responses and deem matters admitted.
Defendants filed their oppositions on September 17, 2024.   
LEGAL STANDARD
Discovery responses are due 30 days after
service of the requests, unless the parties stipulate or the court orders
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a).) If a
responding party fails to respond in time, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling the responses or deeming matters admitted. (Id., §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b), 2033.280(b).) The responding party also waives its
objections. (Id., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a).)  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff served her RFPs Set Two
and RFAs Set One on May 15, 2024. (Derkalousdian Decl. ¶ 2.) Defendants missed
the deadline of June 17, 2024. (Id., ¶ 3.) On July 1, 2024, Defendants
requested an extension, which Plaintiff granted. (Id., ¶¶ 4-5.)
Defendants missed the new deadline of July 15, 2024. (Id., ¶ 5.)
Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to follow up, but received no response. (Id.,
¶ 6.) Plaintiff has not received any responses. (Ibid.) 
These facts show that Defendants have
failed to timely respond to duly served discovery requests. Defendants’
oppositions claim that they will be responding to the requests. Nonetheless, an
order compelling the responses is warranted to ensure that responses are
provided. The RFAs will not be deemed admitted if Defendants serve
substantially compliant responses before the hearing on the motions. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) 
Sanctions are warranted as Defendants
provide no substantial justification for their failure to timely respond to
discovery. Sanctions are mandatory with regards to the RFAs. (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280(c).) Plaintiff’s counsel claims an hourly rate of $350 and
two hours for each motion. (Derkalousdian Decl. ¶ 7.) Given the simplicity of
the motions, the Court finds that three hours is the reasonable time for both
motions combined. Therefore, the Court awards $1,050 total.
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel
responses to RFPs Set Two is GRANTED. Defendants shall provide responses to
RFPs Set Two within 15 days of this order. 
            Plaintiff’s motion to deem matters
admitted is GRANTED unless Defendants serve substantially compliant responses
before September 30, 2024. 
            The Court sanctions Defendants and
their counsel in the total amount of $1,050, to be paid within 30 days of this
order.
