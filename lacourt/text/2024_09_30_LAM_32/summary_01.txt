And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the claim of exemption filed by Defendant James Jaber, M.D., et al. regarding the levied funds from Citibank. The court has determined that Defendant's claim of exemption is GRANTED in the amount of $384,143.02. This amount includes:

* $122,309 in Social Security deposits that can be ascertained from Defendant's evidence
* $261,834.02 in LACERA distributions that constitute a pension benefit from a public entity
* $9,000 in wages that are exempt under the wage exemption statute

The court has denied Defendant's claim of exemption regarding the remaining levied funds from Chase Bank, finding that Defendant failed to trace any portion of the levied $97,915.03 to IRA funds and failed to prove that all other funds from Chase constitute IRA funds.
