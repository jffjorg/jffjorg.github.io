* "The excluded categories of information include, in criminal proceedings, 'the conclusions of any officer investigating a complaint filed pursuant to section 832.5 of the Penal Code,' and otherwise include '[f]acts sought to be disclosed that are so remote as to make disclosure of little or no practical benefit.'" (Evid. Code, ยง 1045, subd. (b))
* "Section 1043 clearly requires a showing of 'good cause' for discovery in two general categories: (1) the 'materiality' of the information or records sought to the 'subject matter involved in the pending litigation,' and (2) a 'reasonable belief' that the governmental agency has the 'type' of information or records sought to be disclosed." (Santa Cruz, supra, 49 Cal.3d at p. 83)
