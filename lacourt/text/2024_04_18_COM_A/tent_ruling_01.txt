[TENTATIVE] ORDER
GRANTING IN PART, DEFENDANT’S THREE MOTIONS TO COMPEL
PLAINTIFF’S FURTHER RESPONSES TO FORM AND SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, AND
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE; IMPOSITION OF MONETARY SANCTIONS

 
I.       
BACKGROUND       
       This is an
action for premises liability and negligence arising from an alleged dangerous
condition on Defendant’s property. Defendant’s three motions filed on January
23, 2024, request orders to compel Plaintiff to provide further responses to
written discovery served on September 8, 2023. Plaintiff served responses on
November 8, 2023. Defendant believes the responses are deficient. Plaintiff did
not respond to Defendant’s meet and confer letter and did not serve further
responses. 
       In opposition,
Plaintiff argues that the motions are rendered moot since further responses
were served on February 1, 2024. Plaintiff’s counsel contends she inadvertently
missed defense counsel’s emails because they were marked “read” without having
been read. Defendant failed to follow up with Plaintiff.
       Defendant argues
the motions are not moot. Plaintiff’s further responses remain defective in
substance because Plaintiff asserted improper and irrelevant objections, the
responses are incomplete. Sanctions should be imposed for Plaintiff’s failure
to meet and confer.              
       
II.     
DISCUSSION
       A
party can move to compel a further response to discovery where the party deems
an answer to be evasive or incomplete or an objection is without merit or too
general. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300 subd. (a).) The parties are required to
meet and confer prior to making the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300 subd.
(b).) 
       Defendant’s
reply acknowledges receipt of Plaintiff’s further responses. The original
responses, which are the subject of this motion, are no longer at issue. The
parties are required to meet and confer in good faith with respect to the newly
served responses. 
       Plaintiff,
however, did not serve further responses until after Defendant incurred costs
and expenses to file these motions. Plaintiff has not shown substantial
justification for her conduct. The Court finds that $185 per hour is a
reasonable fee. The Court permits three hours (reduced from four) to prepare
each motion, reply, and to appear ($555 per motion) and allows costs of $60 per
motion ($180). Sanctions are awarded as follows:



Preparation of motion
  and reply and appear ($555 x 3 motions)


$1,665.00




Filing fees ($60 x 3)


180.00




Total for all motions


$1,845.00



 
III.   
CONCLUSION
       As Plaintiff served further responses, an
order compelling further responses is no longer necessary. To the extent
Defendant believes the further responses are deficient, the parties are ordered
to meet and confer in good faith. The Court GRANTS Defendant’s request for
imposition of monetary sanctions of $1,845.00 for all three motions against
Plaintiff and counsel of record, jointly and severally, payable to Defendant
within 10 days.
