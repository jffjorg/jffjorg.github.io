  Case Number:  22STCV29462    Hearing Date:   July 10, 2024    Dept:  57 Defendant's motion to compel Plaintiff's attendance for a deposition of Plaintiff is granted.   Plaintiff is ordered to appear for her deposition within 10 days of this order.   Defendant's request for an order imposing sanctions against Plaintiff's counsel in the form of an award of the attorney's fees and costs Defendant incurred in connection with the motion to compel Plaintiff's deposition is denied  because, in the Court's view, the actions of Plaintiff's counsel were substantially justified.  Plaintiff's motion for a protective order is denied as moot in light of the ruling on Defendant's motion to compel Plaintiff's deposition.  No sanctions are imposed on either side in connection with the motion for a protective order.  The Court also is taking this opportunity to advise the parties in advance of today's hearing that the Court will be denying Plaintiff's ex parte application to advance to August 1, 2024 the hearing on Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories.  The Court is unavailable on August 1, 2024.
