And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a ruling on several motions ahead of a hearing on July 10, 2024. The defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's attendance for a deposition is granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to appear for the deposition within 10 days. The defendant's request for an order imposing sanctions against the plaintiff's counsel is denied because the actions of the plaintiff's counsel were substantially justified. The plaintiff's motion for a protective order is denied as moot in light of the ruling on the defendant's motion to compel. The court is also denying the plaintiff's ex parte application to advance the hearing on their motion to compel further responses, as the court is unavailable on the proposed new date. Finally, no sanctions are imposed on either side in connection with the motion for a protective order.
