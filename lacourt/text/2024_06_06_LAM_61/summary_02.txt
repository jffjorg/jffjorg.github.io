And here is a brief English summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted Defendant Liv Burger's Special Motion to Strike (Anti-SLAPP) the First Amended Complaint. The Judge finds that Plaintiff's claims of defamation, sex-based discrimination, invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and intentional interference with economic relationships are without merit and lack evidence to support them. The Judge concludes that Defendant Liv Burger's statements on Facebook constitute protected activity under the Anti-SLAPP statute and that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on his claims.
