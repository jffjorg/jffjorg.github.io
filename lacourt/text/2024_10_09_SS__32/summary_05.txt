And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion to continue trial and all related dates filed by J & J Tree Service, Inc. (Cross-Defendant). The motion is unopposed, and the current trial date is scheduled for November 18, 2024. Cross-Defendant is requesting a continuance to June 16, 2025, or alternatively, to vacate the current trial date and set a trial setting conference in 60 days.

The Judge has considered the factors for granting a continuance, including the proximity of the trial date, whether there was any previous continuance, the length of the continuance requested, and the availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion. However, the Judge has denied the motion, citing that Cross-Defendant does not set forth with specificity sufficient good cause to justify the length of continuance requested. The Judge has also noted that the expert witness depositions cannot be taken promptly, and no outstanding fact discovery is set forth in the motion.

The Judge has concluded that the motion is denied, and the current trial date remains in effect.
