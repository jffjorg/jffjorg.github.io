And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a trip and fall accident that occurred on March 17, 2020. The accident happened when the plaintiff, Hugo Salcedo, was delivering goods for PDQ on Veritiv's premises. Salcedo was an independent contractor hired by XPO Logistics Cartage, LLC (Cartage) to transport the goods.

Cartage is moving for summary judgment, arguing that it did not owe a duty to train or protect Salcedo, and therefore, it is not liable for the injury. Veritiv Operating Company (Veritiv) opposes the motion, arguing that Cartage is a motor vehicle carrier and therefore owes a duty to ensure the safety of its independent contractors.

The judge has reviewed the relevant laws and regulations and has concluded that Cartage did not delegate its duty to Salcedo, and therefore, it is not liable for the injury. The judge has granted Cartage's motion for summary judgment.

The case involves the application of several legal doctrines, including the Privette doctrine, which holds that a hirer of an independent contractor generally has no right of control over the mode of doing the work, and the nondelegable duty doctrine, which holds that a carrier owes a nondelegable duty to ensure the safety of its independent contractors. The judge has also considered the Federal Motor Carrier Act, which provides that a person may provide transportation as a motor carrier only if registered under the Act.
