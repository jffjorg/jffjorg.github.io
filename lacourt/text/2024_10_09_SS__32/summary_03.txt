And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a motion brought by defendants Lillian Lugosi and Jeff Lugosi to compel inspection of plaintiff's vehicle and for sanctions. The defendants served a demand for inspection on July 9, 2024, and plaintiff failed to produce the vehicle for inspection on August 9, 2024. Despite being properly served, plaintiff did not object or respond to the demand, and therefore, the court grants the defendants' motion to compel vehicle inspection. The court also imposes sanctions against plaintiff and counsel of record D. Hess Panah in the amount of $469, to be paid within 30 days of the order. The court orders plaintiff to produce the vehicle for inspection within 15 days of the order and requires defendants to provide notice of the order and file proof of service.
