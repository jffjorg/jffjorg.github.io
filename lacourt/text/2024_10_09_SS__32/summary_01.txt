And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiffs' Motion to Set Aside the dismissal of their case. The Plaintiffs argued that their counsel failed to appear at the hearing due to a calendaring error, but the Court found that the declaration of counsel did not establish sufficient grounds to set aside the order taking the motion off calendar. The Court noted that counsel did not provide information regarding the "calendar conflict" and did not explain why he did not contact the Court or why his staff failed to contact another counsel. As a result, the Court denied the motion and ordered the Plaintiffs to provide notice of this Order and file proof of service of such.
