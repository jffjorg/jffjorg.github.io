And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to strike portions of Defendant's supplemental expert witness declaration and has denied the motion. The court finds that Defendant timely designated Dr. Delis as a supplemental expert witness and that Plaintiff has failed to show that Defendant did not anticipate that Plaintiff would designate a neuropsychologist. The court also finds that Plaintiff is not prejudiced by the supplemental designation.

In addition, the court has denied Plaintiff's request to strike one of Defendant's two forensic economists. The court finds that Plaintiff has failed to show good cause for a protective order and that Defendant has shown that he will only call one expert at trial.

The court orders that Plaintiff shall provide notice of the court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
