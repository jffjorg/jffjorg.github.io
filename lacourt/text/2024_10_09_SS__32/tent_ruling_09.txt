[1] Defendant’s
supplemental disclosure is dated August 19, 2024, which appears to fall in the
20 day period. 


[2] Though
Plaintiff seeks to distinguish Du-All Safety, LLC in
reply, stating that the defendant there did not “retain” experts until after
the initial designation, Plaintiff fails to address the reasoning in Du-All
Safety, LLC—namely, that a party need only designate the expert it expects
to call at trial. Based on the evidence presented, it appears Defendant did
this. 


[3] The
Court notes that a motion to reopen discovery to conduct the IME is scheduled
for November 4, 2024, which will be addressed at that time.
