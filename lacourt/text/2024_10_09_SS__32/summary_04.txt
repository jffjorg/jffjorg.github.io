And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the motions filed by the plaintiff, Xochitl Alvarez Espindola, to compel the defendant, Luke Mitchell, to serve verified responses to demands for production, form interrogatories, and requests for admissions. The judge found that the defendant failed to serve timely responses and has not provided a complete set of responses to the demands. The judge denied the motions, finding that the proper motion is a motion to compel further responses, which require a separate statement and the parties to engage in an IDC (meet and confer).
