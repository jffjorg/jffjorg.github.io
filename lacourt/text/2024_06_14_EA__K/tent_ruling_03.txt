[1]              Motion #1, filed April 23, 2024,
was not accompanied by a proof of service. Moving counsel also failed to file a
proof of service for Motion #1, which was due May 13, 2024 (i.e., pursuant to California
Rules of Court rule 3.1300, subdivision (c)) based on the original May 20, 2024
hearing date; as such, the court on May 20, 2024 continued the hearing date on
Motion #1 and Motion #2 [see below] to June 13, 2024 and provided notice
to counsel of such. Immediately preceding the hearing on May 20, 2024, moving
counsel filed a “Proof of Service of Motion,” reflecting email service of Motion
#1 on Defendants’ counsel and email and mail service to Client on April 19,
2024. On May 20, 2024, moving counsel filed (and electronically served to
Defendants’ counsel and to the Client) a “Notice of Continuance of Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel,” advising therein that the hearing on Motion #1 had been
continued to June 13, 2024. On May 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a “Notice of
Continuance of Hearings on Motion to be Relieved as Counsel and Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Judgment” (electronically served May 23, 2024 on Defendants’
counsel and on the Client), advising therein that the hearing on Motions #1 and
#2 had been continued to June 14, 2024.
 
Motion #2 was filed (and electronically served) on
February 21, 2024 and originally set for hearing on May 8, 2024. On May 8,
2024, the court elected to trail Motion #2 to May 20, 2024 (in light of Motion
#1); notice was waived. The motion was subsequently continued to June 13, 2024 [see
above].
