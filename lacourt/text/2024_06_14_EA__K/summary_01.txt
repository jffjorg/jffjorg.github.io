Here is the English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's Application for Default Judgment without prejudice. The Judge notes several defects in the Plaintiff's proposed judgment, including the lack of specificity in the relief sought and the failure to define the phrase "Plaintiff's Trademarks" and specify the Plaintiff's EIN number. The Judge also queries whether the Plaintiff's claims against Li are time-barred, and requests the Plaintiff to brief this issue. Additionally, the Judge notes that the Plaintiff's exhibits have not been authenticated and that the relief sought in the prayer for relief does not appear to be supported by the evidence. The Judge sets an Order to Show Cause for June 14, 2024.
