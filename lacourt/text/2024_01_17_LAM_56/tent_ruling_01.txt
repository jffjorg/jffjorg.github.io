  CASE NO.:  21STCV07668
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION FOR
  RECONSIDERATION
 
Date: 
  January 17, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
Judge: Holly J. Fujie
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff 
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Hyundai Motor America, Inc. (“Moving
Defendant”)
 
The Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply
papers.   
 
BACKGROUND
This action arises
out of the sale of an allegedly defective vehicle (the “Vehicle”) that was
manufactured by Defendant.  On February
25, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint (the “Complaint”) alleging: (1) breach of
implied warranty of merchantability under the Song-Beverly Act; and (2) breach
of express warranty under the Song-Beverly Act. 
 
 
 
On December 2,
2021, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration (the
“Arbitration Motion”) and ordered that this matter proceed to arbitration on
the grounds that Moving Defendant was entitled to enforce an arbitration
agreement contained in the sales contract that Plaintiff entered into with the
dealership that sold the Vehicle under Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020)
53 Cal.App.5th 486 (“Felisilda”).
 
On October 5,
2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration (the “Motion”) that requests
that the Court reconsider its December 2, 2021 order granting the Arbitration
Motion due to a change in law regarding the enforcement of arbitration
agreements by nonsignatories.   
 
DISCUSSION
Under California Code of
Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 1008, subdivision (a), when an application
for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or
in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected
by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of written notice
of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or
law, make application to the same judge or court that made the order, to
reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.  (CCP § 1008, subd. (a).)  The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.  (Id.)  A party seeking reconsideration must also
provide a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce the evidence at
an earlier time.  (Id.) 
 
Under CCP section 1008, subdivision (c), if a court at any time
determines that there has been a change of law that warrants it to reconsider a
prior order it entered, it may do so on its own motion and enter a different
order.  (CCP § 1008, subd. (c).)  A trial court intending to exercise this
power must provide the parties notice that it may do so and a reasonable
opportunity to litigate the question.  (Brown,
Winfield & Canzoneri, Inc. v. Superior Court (2010) 47 Cal.4th 1233,
1248.)  A
procedurally improper motion may inspire the trial court to reconsider its
previous decision on its own motion.  (See
id. at 1249; In re Marriage of Barthold (2008) 158
Cal.App.4th 1301, 1307-08.)  
 
The Motion argues that the
Court should reconsider its order granting the Arbitration Order in light of
the Second District Court of Appeal’s 2023 holding in Ford Motor Warranty
Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324 in which the appellate court issued
a ruling that diverges from Felisilda. 

 
The Court finds that the
Motion is procedurally improper, since it was filed more than 10 days after
service of notice of the Arbitration Motion.  The Court therefore DENIES the Motion. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of this
ruling. 
 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to
the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on
the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive
an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed
off calendar. 
 
 
  Dated
this 17th day of January 2024
