  CASE NO.: 21STCV36577
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION TO COMPEL DEPOSITION
 
Date: January 17, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 



 
MOVING
PARTY: Defendant Quiang Ma (“Moving Defendant”)
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition papers were filed.  Any
opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at least nine
court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”)
section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
 
BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff’s complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges: (1) professional
negligence/legal malpractice. 
 
 
 
 
On December 1, 2023, Moving Defendant filed a motion
to compel Plaintiff’s deposition and production of documents (the
“Motion”).  The Motion also requests
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and counsel.
 
DISCUSSION

            Under CCP
section 2025.450, where a deponent fails to attend a deposition and produce
documents, an opposing party can ask the court to order the deponent’s
attendance and testimony at a deposition, as well the production of the
documents specified in the deposition notice. 
The motion must include: (1) facts showing good cause justifying the
production of documents; and (2) where a deponent fails to attend the
deposition and produce the documents, a declaration must accompany the motion
indicating that the party seeking the order to compel contacted the deponent to
inquire about the deponent’s nonappearance. 
(CCP § 2025.450, subd. (b)(1)-(2).) 
 
            The Motion provides evidence of Moving Defendant’s
attempt to schedule and conduct Plaintiff’s deposition, which culminated in
Plaintiff’s failure to appear for his noticed November 9, 2023 deposition.  (See Declaration of Jon D. Robinson
(“Robinson Decl.”) ¶¶ 2-8.)  The
Court finds that the Motion complies with the requirements of CCP section
2025.450.  For this reason and because it
is unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Motion. 
(Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  Plaintiff is ordered to appear for his
deposition within 20 days of the date of this order. 
 
 
 
Monetary Sanctions
            Moving Defendant requests monetary sanctions in the
amount of $7,119.10.  (Robinson Decl. ¶
11.)  This amount represents: (1) court
reporter fees in the amount of $1,140.55; (2) interpreter fees in the amount of
$1,368.55; (3) 0.7 hours waiting for Plaintiff to appear at the November 9, 2023
deposition at a rate of $650 per hour; (4) 2.8 hours preparing the moving
papers; (5) an anticipated 1.5 hours to prepare reply papers and two hours to
appear at the hearing; and (3) $60 in filing fees.  (Id.)
455
 The Court exercises its discretion and GRANTS
the Moving Defendant monetary sanctions in the reasonable amount of $4,844.10,
which represents: $1,140.55 in court reporter fees; $1368.55 in interpreter
fees; 0.7 hours of attorney time waiting for Plaintiff to appear at the
deposition at a rate of $650 per hour; 2.8 hours preparing the moving papers;
and the $60 filing fee.  (Moran v. Oso
Valley Greenbelt Assn. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1029, 1034.)  Plaintiff and counsel are jointly responsible
for paying this amount within 20 days of the date of this order. 
 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice.         
 
 
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
 
           Dated this 17th day of January 2024
