Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56



 
MOVING
PARTY: Defendant Life Steps Foundation, Inc. (“Moving Defendant”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving papers.  No opposition papers were filed.  Any opposition papers were required to have
been filed and served at least nine court days before the hearing under
California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).  
 
BACKGROUND
 
On
August 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint (the “Complaint”) alleging: (1)
discrimination in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”);
(2) failure to prevent discrimination in violation of FEHA; (3) violation of
Labor Code section 1102.5; and (4) violation of Labor Code section 98.6.  
 
 
On
November 28, 2023, Moving Defendant filed a demurrer (the “Demurrer”) on the
grounds that the Complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a
cause of action.  On January 3, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (the “FAC”).
 
            Given that the FAC is now the operative pleading, the
Demurrer is MOOT and is taken off calendar. 
(See JKC3H8 v. Colton (2013)
221 Cal.App.4th 468, 477.)  
 
            Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar. 
 
          
Dated this 17th day of January 2024
