And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Life Steps Foundation, Inc. The plaintiff, Thatcharnok Pichitchartree, filed a complaint alleging discrimination and other claims, and the defendant filed a demurrer, arguing that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The plaintiff then filed a first amended complaint, which is now the operative pleading. The court finds that the demurrer is moot and hereby grants it as such. The defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling. Parties who wish to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court, and if no email is received and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
