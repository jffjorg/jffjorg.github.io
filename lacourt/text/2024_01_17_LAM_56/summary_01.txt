And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling of Judge Holly J. Fujie denies the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's order granting the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiff had filed a complaint alleging breach of implied and express warranty due to a defective vehicle, and the court had granted the arbitration motion on the basis of an arbitration agreement in the sales contract. The plaintiff sought to reconsider the order due to a change in law concerning the enforceability of arbitration agreements by non-signatories. The court finds the motion procedurally improper because it was filed more than 10 days after service of notice of the arbitration motion, and therefore denies the motion.
