And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to bifurcate the trial of liability and apportionment from damages. The plaintiffs, Heddar Sherazi and Melanie Sherazi, seek to have the trial of liability and apportionment heard separately from the trial of damages. The defendants, George Yadegar, Hong Kook Kim, Wong Woo Pak, and Carlos Jimenez, oppose the motion. The judge denies the motion, finding that the convenience of witnesses, the ends of justice, or the economy and efficiency of handling the litigation would not be promoted by bifurcation. The judge also notes that the plaintiffs' concerns about the defendants' defense strategy do not provide a sufficient basis for bifurcation. The judge orders the defendants to provide notice of the ruling.
