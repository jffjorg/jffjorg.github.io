And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Isabel Jones, to the first amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Edwin Figueroa and Lizbeth Figueroa. The plaintiffs alleged that they entered into a verbal agreement with the defendant in approximately 2005 for the defendant to eventually transfer title in the property to the plaintiffs. The defendant argued that the alleged agreement is barred by the statute of frauds and that the plaintiffs failed to allege a written contract signed by the defendant.

The judge sustained the demurrer, meaning that the defendant's arguments were successful, and denied the plaintiffs' request to amend their complaint. The judge ordered the defendant to file and serve a proposed judgment of dismissal within 30 days.

The judge also noted that the plaintiffs failed to allege facts supporting their right to the property and a wrongful acquisition of the property by the defendant, which is necessary to support a constructive trust. The judge also found that the plaintiffs' alleged oral agreement with the defendant was unclear and ambiguous, making it difficult to determine what promises were made and what obligations were incurred.

Overall, the tentative ruling is in favor of the defendant and dismisses the plaintiffs' claims without leave to amend.
