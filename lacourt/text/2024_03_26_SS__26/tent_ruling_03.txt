ANALYSIS:
 
On August 3, 2021, Plaintiff
Katherina Pellegrin (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for breach of lease
agreement and related claims against Defendants Georgina Capital, Inc. and Todd
M. Smith (“Defendants”). Following Defendants’ failure to file a responsive
pleading, default judgment was entered in Plaintiff’s favor on May 20, 2022.
(Default Judgment 05/20/22.) The Court awarded Plaintiff attorney’s fees with
the judgment in the amount of $1,006.74. (Default Judgment, 05/20/22, p.
2:14-15.) 
 
Plaintiff filed a motion to amend
judgment on August 28, 2023, which the Court denied without prejudice following
an order to show cause regarding the status of Plaintiff’s counsel. (Minute
Order, 11/20/23.) Plaintiff filed the instant renewed Motion to Amend Judgment
on January 18, 2024. The hearing originally set for March 20, 2024 was
continued to March 26, 2024. (Minute Order, 03/20/24.) To date, no opposition
has been filed. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend
Judgment seeks to add an award of post-judgment attorney’s fees to the
judgment, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 685.070 and 685.080. “The judgment creditor may claim
under this section the following costs of enforcing a judgment: . . . (6)
Attorney's fees, if allowed by Section 685.040.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 685.070, subd. (a).) Code of Civil Procedure, section 685.040 states: “The judgment
creditor is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment.
Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are not included in costs
collectible under this title unless otherwise provided by law. Attorney’s
fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as costs collectible under
this title if the underlying judgment includes an award of attorney’s fees to
the judgment creditor pursuant to
subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section 1033.5.” Also,
the motion must be brought within two years of the incurred costs. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 685.080, subd. (a).) 
 
The Court, previously having awarded
Plaintiff attorney’s fees on the judgment, finds that post-judgment attorney’s
fees may be awarded. Plaintiff seeks an award of $8,429.35. (Motion, Gomez Decl., Exh. 3, p. 5.) The
moving party bears the burden of proof with respect to attorney’s fees. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5)(A).) Specifically, a party seeking
fees has the burden of showing the fees incurred are “allowable,” are “reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation,” and are “reasonable in amount.”  (Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.
(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807, 816.) The Court’s objective is to award attorney’s fees at the fair market value based
on the particular action. (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) “The reasonable
hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “‘[T]he fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate . . . .’” (Ketchum v.
Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1134.) 
 
The
Motion is not supported by a declaration that sets forth the number of attorney
hours expended, nor the attorney’s reasonable hourly rate. Instead, the
supporting declaration only provides a description of the work performed by
Plaintiff’s counsel upon being hired: filing and recording an abstract of
judgment; filing an application for issuance of a writ of execution; sending
notice of the writ of execution to the Sheriff’s Department; filing an
application and order for appearance and examination; filing a memorandum of
costs after judgment; filing the first motion to amend judgment and appearing
for the hearing; filing a declaration for and appearing at the order to show
cause. (Motion, Gomez Decl., ¶¶8-17.) The Court finds that a reasonable amount
of time to have spent on these tasks was ten hours, and a reasonable hourly
rate for a limited jurisdiction breach of contract action is $350.00.
Therefore, Plaintiff is awarded attorney’s fees of $3,500.00. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff
Katherina Pellegrin’s Motion to Amend Judgment is GRANTED. THE JUDGMENT IS
AMENDED TO ADD AN AWARD OF ATTORNEY’S FEES IN THE AMOUNT OF $3,500.00.
