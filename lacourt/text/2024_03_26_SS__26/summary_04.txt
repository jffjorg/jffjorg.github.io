This ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel responses to discovery requests and imposes sanctions on the plaintiff for failing to timely respond.

Additionally, Caceres is ordered to pay sanctions of $500.00 to the defense counsel within 20 days of service of this order. The judge finds that Caceres' failure to respond to the discovery requests constitutes a misuse of the discovery process and that sanctions are appropriate under the California Code of Civil Procedure.
