And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Young Chow Dai's Motion for Reconsideration. The motion was filed under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a), which allows a party to reconsider a prior order based on new or different facts, circumstances, or law. However, the judge found that the motion did not comply with the requirements of the statute. Specifically, the judge could not discern which order it was asked to reconsider, and the plaintiff did not provide a supporting declaration that shows what application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown. As a result, the judge lacks jurisdiction to reconsider the prior ruling.
