Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Pritpal Walia's successor-in-interest, Manmohan Walia's, Motion for Attorney's Fees. The motion was brought under Government Code section 12965, which allows the court to award attorney's fees to the prevailing party. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's successor-in-interest failed to demonstrate that they are the prevailing party in this action. The Judge cited several reasons for this finding, including the fact that the Plaintiff's successor-in-interest did not provide a specific analysis of the prevailing party standard, and that the parties' settlement does not reflect that the Plaintiff's successor-in-interest achieved their litigation objectives on a practical level more so than the Defendant. The Judge also noted that the Plaintiff's successor-in-interest's motion was brought after the 30-day deadline, and that the parties' 998 offer to compromise did not provide for an award of attorney's fees.
