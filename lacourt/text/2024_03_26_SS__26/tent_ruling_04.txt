ANALYSIS:
 
On October 12, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Jin Koo
(“Defendant Koo”) served Form Interrogatories, Set One and Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, on Plaintiff Luis Caceres (“Plaintiff
Caceres”). (Motions, Bhatia Decl., Exh.
A.) Despite a meet and confer effort extending the deadline to serve verified
responses without objections, Plaintiff Caceres has not served responses to the
discovery. (Id. at ¶¶5-10 and Exh. B.) Defendant Koo filed the instant
(1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request
for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions on February 27, 2024. No
opposition has been filed to date. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, 2031.300.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)
Based on Plaintiff Caceres’ failure to timely respond to the propounded
discovery, Defendant Koo is entitled to an order compelling service of verified
responses to the discovery requests without objections. 
 
Plaintiff Caceres’ failure to timely respond constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)
Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and
2023.030 and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is
excessive for simple and unopposed motions. Pursuant to a lodestar calculation,
sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff Maria in the amount of $500.00 based on
two hours of attorney time billed at $190.00 per hour and filing fees of $60.00
per motion. (Motions, Bhatia
Decl., ¶13.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Jin Koo’s (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel
Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for
Sanctions are GRANTED. PLAINTIFF LUIS
CACERES IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, AND
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS
ORDER. 
PLAINTIFF LUIS
CACERES IS FURTHER ORDERED TO
PAY SANCTIONS OF $500.00 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS
ORDER.
