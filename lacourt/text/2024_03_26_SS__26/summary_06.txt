And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by defendants Savo, LLC and John Zapp aka John S. Zapp. The demurrer was filed in opposition to the complaint filed by plaintiff Alejandro Diaz, alleging a single violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. The judge has sustained the demurrer, meaning that the complaint does not adequately state a cause of action. The judge has granted the defendants 20 days' leave to amend their demurrer if they can allege facts that demonstrate the specific access barriers and how they denied the plaintiff full and equal access. The plaintiff will need to re-file the complaint and allege more specific facts regarding the access barriers it experienced at the restaurant.
