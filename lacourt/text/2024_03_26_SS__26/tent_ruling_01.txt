Dai v. Paul P. Cheng & Associates, et al.MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATION(CCP § 1008)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Young Chow Dai’s Motion for Reconsideration is
DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:  
 
On December 31, 2018,
Plaintiff Young Chow Dai (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against
Defendants Paul P. Cheng & Associates and Marsha S. Mao. Plaintiff filed
the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) on October 4, 2019 against
Defendants Paul P. Cheng (“Defendant Cheng”), Marsha S. Mao (“Defendant Mao”),
and Law Offices of Paul P. Cheng & Associates (“Defendant Cheng &
Associates”). The SAC, which arises from alleged wrongful actions in connection
with a settlement agreement, alleges causes of action for: (1) accounting; and
(2) fraud.  
 
On February 7, 2023,
Defendant Cheng filed a motion for summary judgment (“MSJ”). On March 1, 2023,
Defendant Cheng filed a motion to deem the truth of the matters in Defendant’s
Requests for Admission, Set One, served on Plaintiff, admitted and for monetary
sanctions. On April 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to transfer venue to the
Santa Monica Courthouse. 
 
On July 24, 2023, after
hearing and oral argument, the Court: (1) granted the MSJ filed by Defendant
Cheng; (2) granted Defendant Cheng’s motion to deem the truth of the matters in
Defendant’s Requests for Admission, Set One, as admitted and awarded Defendant
monetary sanctions; and (3) denied Plaintiff’s motion to transfer and change
venue. (Minute Order, 07/24/23.) On August 4, 2023, Defendant Cheng filed and
served Notice of Entry of Judgment or Order as to the Court’s July 24, 2023
order. 
 
On August 7, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a Motion to Vacate Judgment and Enter a
New and Different Judgment. On August 8, 2023, the Court entered judgment
in favor of Defendant Cheng and against Plaintiff. The Court’s order for entry
of summary judgment provides that “Plaintiff’s case against Defendant Paul P.
Cheng is therefore dismissed with prejudice.” (Minute Order, 08/08/23, p.
3:1-4.) Plaintiff filed an Amended Motion to Vacate Judgment and Enter a New
and Different Judgment on August 11, 2023. Plaintiff filed similar motions to
vacate on August 25, 2023 and September 29, 2023. 
 
In a ruling considering
all three Motions to Vacate, the Court denied the request to vacate the
judgment on January 17, 2024. (Minute Order, 01/17/24.) Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion for Reconsideration on January 23, 2024. Defendant Cheng filed
an opposition on March 13, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
The Motion
is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a),
which states in relevant part:
 
When an application for an order has been made to a judge, or
to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.
 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).) The Court lacks the jurisdiction to reconsider a
prior ruling, on motion of a party, where the motion does not comply with the
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008,
subd. (e); Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1106.) The
instant Motion is neither coherent nor supported by the requisite declaration.
The Court cannot discern which order it is asked to reconsider. Nor does
Plaintiff provide a supporting declaration that shows what application was made
before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new
or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown. (Motion, Dai
Decl.)
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff Young Chow Dai’s Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED.
