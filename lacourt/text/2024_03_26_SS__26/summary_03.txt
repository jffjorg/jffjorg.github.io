Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled in favor of Plaintiff Katherina Pellegrin's Motion to Amend Judgment. The judgment is amended to add an award of attorney's fees in the amount of $3,500.00. The Court has awarded attorney's fees to Plaintiff, finding that post-judgment attorney's fees may be awarded and that the costs incurred are reasonable and necessary. The Court has also calculated the reasonable hourly rate and number of hours reasonably expended by Plaintiff's counsel, and has arrived at a total award of $3,500.00. The Court has denied Plaintiff's original motion to amend judgment without prejudice and has granted the renewed motion.
