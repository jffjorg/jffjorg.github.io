v.
                                                                    Hearing

[Tentative] Order Denying Petition for Writ of Mandate
            
 
 
            Julie
S. Lee (“Petitioner”) petitions for a writ of administrative mandate against
the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board (“Respondent”).  The Director of Employment Development found
that during the pandemic, Petitioner’s normal pattern of earning a living was
in commissioned sales and therefore she was ineligible for unemployment
compensation benefits.  An Administrative
Law Judge (“ALJ”) affirmed that decision, and Respondent adopted the ALJ’s
decision.  Petitioner seeks a writ of
mandate compelling Respondent to set aside that decision.  
 
At the trial setting conference, the
court scheduled the petition for hearing on May 15, 2024, set a briefing schedule, and ordered the administrative record to
be lodged 15 days prior to the hearing.  On
March 7, 2024, on the court’s own motion, the court continued the hearing on
the writ petition to May 24, 2024, and ordered the briefing schedule to remain
as originally set.  The court mailed
notice of the continuance to Petitioner’s counsel.  Petitioner did not file an opening brief
pursuant to the briefing schedule set by the court.  On March 26, 2024, Respondent filed and
served a notice of Petitioner’s failure to file and serve an opening
brief.  On April 12, 2024, Respondent
filed and served an opposition brief, which further noted that Petitioner had
not filed an opening brief.  Respondent
also lodged the administrative record. 
To date, Petitioner has not filed an briefs in support of her
petition.    
 
Under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1094.5(b), the pertinent issues are whether the
respondent has proceeded without jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial,
and whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.  An abuse of discretion is established if the
agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not
supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the
evidence.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(b).)
 
An agency is
presumed to have regularly performed its official duties.  (Evid. Code § 664.)  The petitioner
seeking administrative mandamus has the burden of proof and must cite to the
administrative record to support its contentions.  (See Bixby v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal. 3d 130,
143; Steele v. Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission, (1958) 166 Cal.
App. 2d 129, 137; see also Alford v. Pierno (1972) 27
Cal.App.3d 682, 691 [“[T]he burden of proof falls upon the party attacking the
administrative decision to demonstrate wherein the proceedings were unfair, in
excess of jurisdiction or showed prejudicial abuse of discretion.”].) 

 
Under section
1094.5, “a trial court must afford a strong presumption of correctness
concerning the administrative findings, and the party challenging the
administrative decision bears the burden of convincing the court that the
administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the evidence.”  (Fukuda
v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal. 4th 805, 817.)   A reviewing court “will not act as counsel
for either party … and will not assume the task of initiating and prosecuting a
search of the record for any purpose of discovering errors not pointed out in
the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950)
99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742.)
 
A memorandum of
points and authorities is required for a noticed mandamus motion. (See Code
Civ. Proc. § 1094; CRC 3.1113(a).)   The
absence of a memorandum is an admission that the motion is not meritorious and
may be denied.  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1113(a).)  “The memorandum must contain
a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments
relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in
support of the position advanced.”  (Cal
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(b); Quantum Cooking Concepts, Inc. v. LV
Associates, Inc. (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 927, 934 [Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1113 “rests on a policy-based allocation of resources, preventing the trial
court from being cast as a tacit advocate for the moving party's theories”].)  
 
Here, Petitioner
has not filed an opening brief and has not met her burden under section 1094.5
to show a prejudicial abuse of discretion, a denial of a fair trial, or other
reversible error in the administrative decision.  Therefore, the petition for writ of mandate
is denied.
