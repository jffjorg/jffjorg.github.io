And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the petition for writ of mandate filed by Julie S. Lee, seeking to set aside the decision of the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board. The Board had found that Lee was ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits due to her normal pattern of earning a living being in commissioned sales. The court found that Lee failed to meet her burden of proof to show a prejudicial abuse of discretion or a denial of a fair trial. The court also noted that Lee failed to file an opening brief and that the absence of a memorandum of points and authorities is an admission that the motion is not meritorious.
