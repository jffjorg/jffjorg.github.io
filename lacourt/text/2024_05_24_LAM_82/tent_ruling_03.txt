[1] Respondents
suggest that these declarants were not authorized to file this lawsuit on
behalf of Petitioner.  (Oppo.
3:4-8.)  Nonetheless, because Respondents
do not fully develop the point in their opposition brief, the court declines to
consider it at this time.   


[2] It is unclear
from why this in-person convention was held in San Mateo, and not Las Vegas,
NV.  It is also unclear why the
convention held by Petitioner’s declarants was held virtually and not at Four
Points.
