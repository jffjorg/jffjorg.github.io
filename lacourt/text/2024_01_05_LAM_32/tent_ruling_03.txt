     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file
  second amended complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            This quiet title action was
initiated in November 22, 2022. On December 28, 2022, Plaintiffs Phuong Le Thai
and Edward Lee filed the operative First Amended Complaint against Defendants
Diana Lee, William Truong, and all persons claiming interest in the subject
property located in El Monte (the Property). The FAC asserts causes of action
for declaratory relief, quiet title, fraud, conversion, elder abuse, and
accounting. 
            According to the FAC, Plaintiff
Phuong Le Thai (Phuong) wished to purchase the Property but failed to qualify
for a loan. (FAC ¶ 11.) Around July or August 2017, Phuong proposed that her
daughter, Defendant Diana Lee (Diana) purchase the Property in her name and
hold legal title without assuming any obligations such as down payment, maintenance
expenses, property taxes, and loan payments. (Id., ¶ 12.) Diana
allegedly agreed to this arrangement and promised to convey title to Phuong
once Phuong had paid all expenses related to the maintenance and preservation
of the Property for a period of time sufficient to demonstrate her credit worthiness.
(Id., ¶ 13.) Diana obtained title to the Property on September 14, 2017.
(Id., ¶ 15.) The down payment was made using loans and gifts belonging
to Phuong. (Ibid.) In June 2021, after Phuong had possessed the Property
and paid the associated expenses for several years, Phuong demanded that Diana
convey title to the Property to her in accordance with their agreement, but
Diana refused. (Id., ¶¶ 16-17.) 
Phuong was married to John Shing Lee (John
Lee or Decedent), who died in September 2022. Decedent’s son, Plaintiff Edward
Lee, pursues this action as Decedent’s successor-in-interest. The FAC alleges
that Diana stole the following property: (1) Decedent’s portion of proceeds
from the sale of Plaintiffs’ other residences in Nevada and California; (2) Decedent’s
cash; (3) proceeds from Decedent’s life insurance policy; (4) and a 2006 Honda
Pilot. (FAC ¶¶ 18-31.) Defendant William Truong, Diana’s husband, allegedly
participated in the fraud and conversion. 
On November 27, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the
instant motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. Defendants filed
their opposition on December 21, 2023. Plaintiffs filed their reply on December
28, 2023.  
LEGAL STANDARD
The court may, in furtherance of justice,
and on such terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading. (Code
Civ. Proc, §§ 473, subd. (a), 576.) Courts must apply a policy of liberality in
permitting amendments at any stage of the proceeding, including during trial,
when no prejudice to the opposing party is shown. (Duchrow v. Forrest
(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1377.) In determining the extent of prejudice to
the opposing party, the court must consider various factors, such as whether
the amendment would delay trial or increase the discovery burden. (Demetriades
v. Yelp, Inc. (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 294, 306.)
DISCUSSION
            A motion for leave to amend a
complaint must be accompanied by a declaration that explains: (1) the effect of
the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the
facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the
reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. (Cal. Rules of Ct.,
Rule 3.1324(b).)   
Here, the proposed SAC adds causes of
action for fraud and fraudulent transfer based on the allegation that Diana Lee
made transfers to her spouse, William Truong. (Lew Decl. ¶¶ 5-7, Ex. 2.) The
amendment is necessary and proper to ensure that purported fraudulent transfers
arising from the same general set of facts are addressed together. (Id.
at 13:8-12.) The new facts were discovered through a review of subpoenaed
documents conducted in September or October 2023. (Id. at 13:14-20.) 
Defendants argue that the proposed
amendment fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
However, the merits of the claims may be addressed separately. Courts should
only deny leave to amend based on insufficiency of the allegations “in cases in
which the insufficiency of the proposed amendment is established by controlling
precedent and where the insufficiency could not be cured by further appropriate
amendment.” (Cal. Casualty Gen. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173
Cal.App.3d 274, 280-81.) Otherwise, “the preferable practice would be to permit
the amendment and allow the parties to test its legal sufficiency by demurrer,
motion for judgment on the pleadings or other appropriate proceedings.” (Id.
at p. 281.)  
The Court finds that Defendants will not
be prejudiced by the amendment. Trial has been continued to October 2024, and
the parties have sufficient time to conduct discovery related to the new causes
of action. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have had access to Defendants’ bank
records since March 2023 but waited eight months to bring the amendment. However,
Defendants do not explain why access to those records would have necessarily
revealed claims for fraudulent transfer. Plaintiffs’ counsel avers that the new
causes of action were revealed during a review of subpoenaed documents in September
or October 2023. (Lew Decl. at 13:14-20.) Plaintiffs filed this motion in
November 2023. The Court finds that Plaintiffs did not unreasonably delay in
bringing the amendment.  
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to
amend is GRANTED.
