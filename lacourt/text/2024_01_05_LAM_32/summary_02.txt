And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' motion to compel arbitration is granted. The plaintiff, Ava Welsing-Kitcher, had filed a complaint against Karplus Warehouse, Inc. and The Western Surety Company alleging claims arising from the purchase of a Hyundai vehicle. The defendants had filed a motion to compel arbitration, which the plaintiff failed to oppose. The judge found that the plaintiff had signed a sale contract containing an arbitration provision and an addendum providing for arbitration through the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The judge also found that the plaintiff had refused to arbitrate before AAA and that the sale contract provides that the parties may choose an arbitration provider subject to the defendants' approval. Therefore, the judge concluded that the claims are subject to arbitration before AAA under both the original sale contract and the addendum. The case is stayed pending the outcome of arbitration.
