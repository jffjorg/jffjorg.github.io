And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The Court is considering the Plaintiff's motion for prejudgment interest on the damages awarded by the jury. The Plaintiff is seeking to recover $371,244.96 in prejudgment interest on the damages awarded, which were $958,305. The Court finds that the damages became certain as of January 10, 2023, when the Plaintiff provided an expert's summary of costs calculating the damages. However, the Court also finds that the Plaintiff's claim for lost profits does not affect the certainty of the hard cost damages.

The Court concludes that the prejudgment interest is warranted and grants the motion in the amount of $83,760.03. The interest rate is 10% per annum under Civil Code section 3289(b), which applies because the parties' contract does not specify an interest rate.
