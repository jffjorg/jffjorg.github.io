     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motion for prejudgment
  interest 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On October 21, 2019, Lenny &
Larry’s, LLC filed this action against Defendant A&B Ingredients, Inc. The
operative Second Amended Complaint, filed June 6, 2022, alleges (1) breach of
the implied warranty of merchantability, (2) breach of the implied warranty of
fitness, (3) negligent misrepresentation, (4) fraudulent misrepresentation, and
(5) unfair competition. The complaint arises from the following facts.
            Plaintiff is a manufacturer of
health and fitness oriented food products, such as cookies. Defendant sells a
variety of ingredients to food manufacturers, including Plaintiff. The
particular ingredient at issue in this case is the antioxidant CytoGuard.
CytoGuard is a cultured dextrose powder (“CDP”). Plaintiff alleges that the inclusion
of CDP in its cookies caused the products to have an “off flavor” and “soapy”
taste, leading to customer complaints and forcing Plaintiff to discontinue
sales. Plaintiff contends that the cause of the flavor issue was the presence
of lipase in the CDP.  
            The matter came on for trial from October
16, 2023 to November 3, 2023, after which the jury returned a verdict in favor
of Plaintiff on the claim for breach of implied warranty of merchantability and
in favor of Defendant on the claims for breach of implied warranty of fitness,
intentional representation, and negligent representation. The jury further
found that Plaintiff’s damages were $0 for lost profits and $958,305 for other
damages. On November 27, 2023, the Court entered judgment for Plaintiff against
Defendant in the amount of $958,305.
            On December 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion for an award of prejudgment interest. Defendant filed its
opposition on December 21, 2023. Plaintiff filed its reply on December 28,
2023. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“A person who is entitled to recover
damages certain, or capable of being made certain by calculation, and the right
to recover which is vested in the person upon a particular day, is entitled
also to recover interest thereon from that day . . . .” (Civ. Code, § 3287.) Prejudgment
interest is allowable as a matter of right when damages are fixed or readily
ascertainable, but not when there is conflicting evidence over the amount owed
which requires a judicial determination to resolve. (Thompson v. Asimos
(2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 970, 991.) “The test for determining certainty under
section 3287(a) is whether the defendant knew the amount of damages owed to the
claimant or could have computed that amount from reasonably available
information.” (Howard v. American National Fire Ins. Co. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th
498, 535.) 
DISCUSSION
I.
When Damages Became Certain
            Plaintiff argues that damages were
certain based on two itemizations that it sent to Defendant. The first
itemization is a prelitigation letter sent on November 19, 2018, claiming $1.2
million in damages. (Choi Decl., TE 58.) The second itemization is an expert’s
summary of costs produced on January 10, 2023, claiming damages of $958,305. (Id.,
Ex. A.) Plaintiff argues that $739,409.05 of the damages has been known to
Defendant since the first letter sent on November 19, 2018. Plaintiff argues
that the remaining $218,895.95 of damages has been known to Defendant since the
second itemization sent on January 10, 2023. Plaintiff seeks $371,244.96 of
interest accrued since November 19, 2018 and $19,153.40 of interest accrued
since January 10, 2023.
            a. Trial Exhibit 58
            Plaintiff does not adequately
explain how a communication claiming $1.2 million in damages makes it certain
that Plaintiff actually suffered $739,409.05. Plaintiff itself acknowledges
that TE 58 does not include all of its damages and contains damages that were
not sought at trial. (Reply 2:26-3:3, 3:17-26.) Plaintiff further acknowledges
that there were “additional amounts that were not calculable in 2018 but were
calculable by January of 2023.” (Reply 6:7-9.) If Plaintiff could not finalize
its own hard costs until January 2023, Defendant could not have been certain of
those damages as early as November 2018. While certainty only requires
Defendant to possess sufficient information to calculate damages, the only such
information Plaintiff identifies is TE 58. “[I]t is incumbent on the plaintiff
to provide the defendant with some statement and supporting data from which the
defendant can make the necessary determination.” (Levy-Zentner Co. v.
Southern Pac. Transportation Co. (1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 762, 798.) 
It is true that damages are not uncertain
simply because an estimate differs from the jury award. For example, in KGM
Harvesting Co. v. Fresh Network (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 376, 391, the court
held that “an error of approximately 5.5 percent was made in the original
calculations does not make the damages uncertain.” In Esgro Cent., Inc. v.
General Ins. Co. (1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 1054, 1062, an error of 10-15% was
considered “minor in the context of the entire lawsuit” and did not “detract
from the proposition that the damages in the action . . . are fixed or
determinable.” Damages are certain if a jury award “conform[s] closely to the amount
claimed in the proofs of loss and could be ascertained from data supplied” by
the claimant. (Id. at p. 1061.)
However, Plaintiff claims that its $1.2
million estimate created certainty that it suffered $739,000 in damages. This
is a gap of almost $500,000, or around 40%, which is not a minor discrepancy
like those found in the cases above. Plaintiff argues that “when costs which
were not sought at trial are deducted, the amount outlined in the November 2018
communication totals $864,315.90,” and the discrepancy is only about $125,000.
(Reply 3:26-4:2.) However, certainty is analyzed from Defendant’s perspective. (See
Howard, supra, 187 Cal.App.4th at p. 535 [“The test for determining certainty
under section 3287(a) is whether the defendant knew the amount of
damages owed”].) Here, Defendant received a communication claiming $1.2 million
in damages. Defendant could not have known that it really only owed the damages
listed in certain categories amounting to $864,315.90 and further, that those categories
should actually be reduced to $739,000. TE 58 does not closely conform to the
jury award, and Plaintiff has not identified any other data from which
Defendant could have ascertained the true amount. 
b. Bergmark Summary
The principles discussed above compel the
opposite conclusion when applied to the Bergmark Summary from January 10, 2023.
(Choi Decl., Ex. A.) The Bergmark Summary calculated damages of $958,305, the
precise amount awarded by the jury. (Ibid.) Damages are considered
certain “where there is essentially no dispute between the parties concerning
the basis of computation of damages if any are recoverable but where their
dispute centers on the issue of liability giving rise to damage.” (Leff v.
Gunter (1983) 33 Cal.3d 508, 519.) Here, Defendant similarly disputed
liability but not the calculation of damages. (See, e.g., Choi Decl.,
Ex. B at 36:20-28.) Defendant does not deny receiving the Bergmark Summary on
January 10, 2023, nor does Defendant challenge the accuracy of the summary.
Therefore, damages were certain as of January 10, 2023.     
II.
The Effect of Plaintiff’s Claim for Lost Profits 
Although Plaintiff’s lost profits were not
certain prior to trial, that does not make Plaintiff’s hard cost damages
uncertain. Courts have affirmed prejudgment interest on a portion of damages.
(See Coughlin v. Blair (1953) 41 Cal.2d 587, 607 [affirming award of
general damages and interest thereon but reversing award of special damages]; Greater
Westchester Homeowners Ass'n v. City of Los Angeles (1979) 26 Cal.3d 86,
102-03 [invaliding an award of prejudgment interest only to the extent of
interest on noneconomic emotional damages]; Canavin v. Pac. Southwest Airlines (1983) 148
Cal.App.3d 512, 518 [holding that plaintiffs were “entitled to prejudgment
interest on that portion of the award representing their economic loss”]; Howard,
supra, 187 Cal.App.4th at p. 536 [holding that plaintiffs were entitled to “interest
on two components of damages”].) 
III.
The Correct Interest Rate         
Unless otherwise specified in a written
contract or statute, the prejudgment interest rate is 7% under the California
Constitution. (Soleimany v. Narimanzadeh (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 915, 924;
Cal. Const., Art. XV § 1.) 
            Plaintiff relies on Civil Code
section 3289 to argue that the interest rate should be 10%. Section 3289
provides that “[i]f a contract entered into after January 1, 1986, does not
stipulate a legal rate of interest, the obligation shall bear interest at a
rate of 10 percent per annum after a breach.” (Civ. Code, § 3289(b).) Plaintiff
argues that its claim for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability sounds
in contract because its damages resulted from the defective CytoGuard CDP that it
purchased from Defendant under an agreement. (Mtn. 2:19-25.) 
Defendant argues that the claim does not
sound in contract because “[u]nlike express warranties, which are basically
contractual in nature, the implied warranty of merchantability arises by
operation of law.” (American Suzuki Motor Corp. v. Superior Court (1995)
37 Cal.App.4th 1291, 1295.) However, while the implied warranty is implied by
law, it “is implied in a contract” for the sale of goods. (Com. Code, § 2314.) “[W]arranties
of fitness for a particular purpose and of merchantability are implied by law
in a contract for the sale of goods.” (Mills v. Forestex Co. (2003) 108
Cal.App.4th 625, 635, fn. 4.) Therefore, the claim is contractual in nature.
Because the parties’ contract does not specify an interest rate, the rate is 10%
under Civil Code section 3289(b). 
IV.
Calculating the Total Amount of Interest 
            Damages of $958,305 became certain
as of January 10, 2023. The length of time from January 10, 2023 to the date of
entry of judgment on November 27, 2023 is 321 days. The interest rate is 10%
per annum. Therefore, the prejudgment interest is $83,760.03. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion for prejudgment
interest is GRANTED in the amount of $83,760.03.
