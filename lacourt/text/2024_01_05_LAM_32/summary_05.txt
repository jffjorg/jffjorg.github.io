And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion to strike the punitive damage allegations in the plaintiffs' complaint. The defendants had argued that the complaint did not contain sufficient facts to demonstrate malice, but the judge noted that fraud is an independent basis for punitive damages. The judge also pointed out that the complaint had previously been found sufficient to support punitive damages for fraudulent concealment and intentional misrepresentation. As a result, the judge denied the motion to strike and allowed the punitive damage claims to proceed.
