Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint (SAC). The Plaintiffs, Phuong Le Thai and Edward Lee, seek to add causes of action for fraud and fraudulent transfer based on allegations that Defendant Diana Lee made transfers to her spouse, William Truong. The Judge finds that the proposed amendment is necessary and proper to ensure that all alleged fraudulent transfers arising from the same general set of facts are addressed together. The Judge also finds that the amendment will not cause prejudice to the Defendants, as the parties have sufficient time to conduct discovery related to the new causes of action. The Judge notes that the Plaintiffs did not unreasonably delay in bringing the amendment, and therefore grants the motion for leave to amend.
