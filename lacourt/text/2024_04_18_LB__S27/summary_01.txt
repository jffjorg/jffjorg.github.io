And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel discovery filed by the plaintiff. The court has held that the parties must meet and confer to schedule a deposition for Leigh Ann Ruijters, a Complex Claims Specialist who signed discovery verifications on behalf of the plaintiff. If Ruijters lacks personal knowledge of the facts of the case, the court encourages the parties to agree to forego the deposition and take steps to ensure that she is not a percipient witness.

The court has also ordered the parties to proceed with a deposition and document production with respect to Sam Diaz, an employee of the defendant who was identified as having knowledge of the incident. The court has limited the scope of discovery on prior incidents to those involving a fall in any way related to a shopping cart.

The court has denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the defendant took its position in good faith and with substantial justification. The parties are ordered to give notice and submit on the tentative ruling.
