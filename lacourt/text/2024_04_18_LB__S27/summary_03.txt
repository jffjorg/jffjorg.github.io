```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash service of the summons and complaint filed by Christine Perez. The Court finds that Perez's claim to have moved out of the Hanbury address in early 2023 is not supported by evidence, and that the secured property tax bill for the relevant period shows that Perez claimed the subject property as her primary home, receiving a $7000 exemption. The Court concludes that this is sufficient to meet the burden of proof to show that the address was proper for service of the summons and complaint. The motion to quash service is therefore denied.
