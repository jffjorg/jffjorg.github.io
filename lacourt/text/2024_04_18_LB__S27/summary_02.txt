Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled that the defendant's delay in responding to discovery requests was unjustified and that the defendant should be sanctioned. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's motion to compel responses was improper and that the defendant acted with substantial justification in not responding to the discovery requests. The court found that the plaintiff's motion was procedurally proper and that the defendant's failure to respond was unjustified. The court awarded sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $1500.
