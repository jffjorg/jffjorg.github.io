Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge is considering a motion filed by Plaintiff Oscar Alberto Ramirez to quash 40 subpoenas issued by Defendant Mike Rademaker dba HB Crane Services, et al. The subpoenas seek medical records, x-rays, CT scans, electrocardiograms, and insurance records from Plaintiff's medical providers and facilities. Plaintiff argues that the subpoenas are overbroad and violate his constitutional right to privacy. Defendant argues that the subpoenas are relevant and discoverable since Plaintiff placed various bodily injuries at issue.

The judge agrees with Plaintiff that the subpoenas are overbroad and grants his motion to modify the subpoenas to limit inquiry to records directly relevant to the injuries Plaintiff suffered as a result of the accident and to injuries specific to the same body parts since 2014. The judge also denies Plaintiff's request to quash the subpoena issued to the California Highway Patrol, which seeks documents related to the incident.

Additionally, the judge orders Defendant and their counsel to pay sanctions of $1,260.00 to Plaintiff within 10 days for their alleged overbroad subpoenas.
