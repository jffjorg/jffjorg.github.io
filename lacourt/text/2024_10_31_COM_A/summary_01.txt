And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel General Motors, LLC to produce a witness and documents. The judge has also ordered General Motors, LLC to comply with the request for production of documents at deposition within 10 days without objection, limitation, or condition. Additionally, the judge has imposed sanctions of $1,382.50 against General Motors, LLC and its counsel, payable to the plaintiffs within 10 days.

The judge has based its decision on several factors, including the fact that General Motors, LLC failed to provide a valid basis for its objections to the deposition notice and document request. The judge has also noted that the discovery is relevant to the plaintiffs' burden of establishing General Motors, LLC's non-compliance with its obligations under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and to the recovery of civil penalties.

The judge has also rejected General Motors, LLC's arguments that it is overburdened by the number of lemon law cases it must defend, stating that this is not an issue for the court to resolve. Finally, the judge has awarded sanctions against General Motors, LLC and its counsel for their failure to proceed with substantial justification.
