Here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment, which sought to grant summary judgment in their favor. The defendants argued that the plaintiff, Goldstar Investments, LLC, was not the initial owner or landlord under the lease, and that the plaintiff did not provide notice of a change in ownership. The defendants also argued that the plaintiff lacked standing to demand rent because a change of ownership was not provided under Civil Code section 1962. The plaintiff, on the other hand, alleged that it owns the premises at 811 N. Hillcrest Road in Beverly Hills, and that the defendants entered into a written 30-month lease with monthly rent at $13,000, which increased to at least $15,500. The plaintiff seeks past-due rent of $46,500, holdover damages of $516.66 per day, and forfeiture of the agreement. The Court found that the defendants failed to meet their burden of showing that the plaintiff lacked standing or that the lease was not valid. The Court also rejected the defendants' argument that the prior unlawful detainer action terminated the tenancy.
