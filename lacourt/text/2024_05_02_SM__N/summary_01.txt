Additionally, the Judge imposes a reduced monetary sanction of $995 on the Plaintiff, payable to the Defendants and their counsel, for the time and effort spent preparing and presenting the motions. The Judge's reasoning is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and California Rules of Court, which provide for the imposition of sanctions for failure to comply with discovery requests.
