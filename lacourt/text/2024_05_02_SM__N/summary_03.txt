And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge issues a tentative ruling in a case involving American Contractors Indemnity Company (ACIC), who has filed a Cross-Complaint for interpleader and injunction. ACIC is seeking to be discharged from liability with regard to a Contractor's License Bond issued in favor of Sun Energy Construction. The Court finds that ACIC has a legally sufficient claim in interpleader and grants its motion for an order of discharge and award of costs and attorneys' fees. The Court orders ACIC to deposit the remaining penal sum of $23,000 with the Court and awards ACIC reasonable attorney fees and expenses in the sum of $2,000. Upon the deposit of the bond, all liability asserted against ACIC in connection with the Contractor's License Bond will be discharged, and ACIC will be dismissed from the action.
