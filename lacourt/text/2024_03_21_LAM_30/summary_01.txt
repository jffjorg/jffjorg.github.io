And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' ex parte application to continue the trial, which was filed on March 20, 2024. The plaintiffs had previously filed an amended complaint and cross-complaint, and the case has been ongoing for over four years. The judge notes that the parties have had ample time to engage in settlement discussions and prepare for trial, but instead, they have failed to do so. The plaintiffs' counsel has claimed severe back pain and requested a 90-day continuance, but the judge is not convinced that this is a legitimate reason for the continuance. The judge concludes that all counsel are engaged in gamesmanship and that the parties' failure to prepare for trial is a result of their own lack of effort. The trial date and final status conference date of March 25, 2024, will stand, and the order to show cause regarding sanctions for failure to timely file trial documents will be heard at the same date and time.
