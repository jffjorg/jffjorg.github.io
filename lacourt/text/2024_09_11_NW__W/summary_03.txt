Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the order dismissing the case with prejudice. The plaintiff failed to file an amended complaint within the deadline, and the court ordered the complaint dismissed with prejudice. The plaintiff's motion for reconsideration does not comply with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1008, and the court finds that the plaintiff's failure to file the amended complaint was not due to mistake, surprise, or excusable neglect, but rather a deliberate decision to not file the pleading despite the court order and deadline.
