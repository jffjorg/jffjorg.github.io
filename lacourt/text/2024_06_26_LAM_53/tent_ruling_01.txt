  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to deem admissions
  admitted and for sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Immigrant Rights
Defense Council, LLC
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Deem Admissions Admitted and for Sanctions
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC (“Plaintiff”) moves
the court for an order (1) deeming admitted the Requests for Admission that it
served on defendant Edward Lasseville (“Defendant”), and (2) awarding monetary
sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$2,578.80. 
The court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that it served Defendant
with its Requests for Admission (1) within the time permitted by statute, and
(2) at Defendant’s address of record. 
First, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that it served
Defendant with the subject discovery within the time permitted by Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.020.
“A plaintiff may make requests for admission by a party without leave
of court at any time that is 10 days after the service of the summons on, or
appearance by, that party, whichever occurs first.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.020, subd.
(b).)  Plaintiff has not filed a proof of
service of summons on Defendant, and as of the time that Plaintiff served the
requests for admission on Defendant (March 25, 2024), Defendant had not yet
made an appearance in this action.  (Medvei
Decl., Ex. 1, p. 14 [proof of service].) 
Thus, it appears that Plaintiff was not permitted to serve its Requests
for Admission on Defendant on March 25, 2024. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.020, subd. (b).)  
Second, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that the
discovery requests were served on Defendant at his address of record. 
Plaintiff served the subject discovery on Defendant on March 25, 2024,
by mail, at the address 2407 Randolph Street, Huntington Park, California.  (Medvei Decl., Ex. 1, p. 14 [proof of
service].)  The court finds that this is
not valid service on Defendant.  As of
the date of service by mail (i.e., March 25, 2024), Defendant had not made an
appearance in this action, such that there was no address of record for
Defendant.
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that it served
Defendant with the subject discovery at the correct address of record as
required.[1]  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1013 [service by mail shall
be addressed to the person on whom document is to be served “at the office
address as last given by that person on any document filed in the cause and
served on the party making service by mail; otherwise at that party’s place of
residence”]; Lee v. Placer Title Co. (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 503, 509
[“Successful service by mail requires strict compliance with all statutory
requirements, including those set forth in section 1013; the failure to comply
deprives a court of jurisdiction to act”].) 
The court therefore denies Plaintiff’s motion. 
 
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Immigrant
Rights Defense Council, LLC’s motion to deem admissions admitted and for
sanctions. 
            The court orders plaintiff Immigrant
Rights Defense Council, LLC to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
