Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's motion to strike certain language from the complaint. The Defendant moves to strike the language alleging that he drove under the influence of alcohol and was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, as well as the prayer for punitive damages.

The Judge grants the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, finding that the allegations in the complaint do not support a claim for punitive damages. The Judge notes that while driving under the influence of alcohol may constitute an act of "malice" under California law, the allegations in the complaint do not meet the high standard required to support a claim for punitive damages.

The Judge denies the motion to strike the language alleging that the Defendant drove under the influence of alcohol, finding that the allegations are relevant and properly plead. The Judge also denies the motion to strike the language alleging that the Defendant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, finding that the allegations are properly plead and do not contain any improprieties.

The Judge gives the Defendant 20 days to amend the complaint to remove the prayer for punitive damages and to address the issues raised by the motion to strike.
