And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to set aside a judgment entered against him is continued to August 27, 2024. The defendant is ordered to file and serve a proposed answer or other responsive pleading by August 16, 2024. The court is inclined to grant the motion, finding that the defendant's declaration is sufficient to warrant relief. However, the defendant failed to attach an answer or other responsive pleading to the motion, which is a mandatory requirement under CCP § 473(b). The court is giving the defendant the opportunity to cure this procedural defect so that the matter can proceed on its merits.
