Background 
This action for quiet title was filed on January 31, 2022.
The operative Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) filed on November 6, 2023 asserts
the following causes of action: (1) Wrongful Foreclosure; (2) Cancellation of
Instruments; (3) Quiet Title; (4) Violation of Cal. Civ. Code §2923.5; and (5)
Unfair Competition. 
Plaintiffs MINA MONTEJANO an individual, and JUAN MORALES
MATA of the LU100 Trust dated July 10, 2019 (collectively “Plaintiffs”) (in pro
per) allege that “Plaintiffs discovered… there were Assignments, Substitutions,
Notice of Default, Notice of Trustee Sale, and Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale that
were either created without authority or in violation of the HBOR Act.” (TAC ¶
21.) 
Defendant JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. (“Chase”) generally
demurs to every cause of action. In addition, Chase argues that the entire TAC
is barred by the doctrine of judicial estoppel and the statute of limitations.
Chase also specially demurs to each cause of action on grounds of uncertainty.
SELECT PORTFOLIO SERVICING, INC. and U.S. BANK, NA (“U.S.
Bank”) generally demurs to every cause of action. U.S. Bank also argues that
the entire TAC is barred by the doctrine of judicial estoppel. 
Defendant QUALITY LOAN SERVICE CORPORATION (“Quality Loan”)
generally demurs to the first, second, third, and fifth causes of action, and
additionally argues that the second cause of action is barred by the statute of
limitations. The Court notes that the fourth cause of action is not asserted
against Quality Loan.
Request for Judicial Notice 
Defendants JP MORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.; and SELECT PORTFOLIO
SERVICING, INC. and U.S. BANK, NA’s Requests for Judicial Notice are GRANTED.
(Cal. Ev. Code §452.)
Plaintiffs’ Request for Judicial Notice of Exhibits 1, 2,
5, and 6 is GRANTED. (Cal. Ev. Code §452.) Plaintiffs’ Request for Judicial
Notice of Exhibits 3 and 4 is DENIED—these documents are not properly subject
to judicial notice.
Discussion 
Uncertainty
Chase argues that Plaintiffs’ claims are fatally uncertain.
This argument lacks merit because “[a] special demurrer for uncertainty is not
intended to reach the failure to incorporate sufficient facts in the pleading
but is directed at the uncertainty existing in the allegations actually made.”
(Butler v. Sequeira (1950) 100 Cal.App.2d 143, 145-146.) Moreover, demurrers
for uncertainty are disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is
so bad that the defendant cannot reasonably respond, i.e., he or she cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or
claims are directed against him or her. (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif. Inc. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even
where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be
clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.) Here, it is clear from
Chase’s other arguments that they understand what Plaintiffs at least attempt
to allege, and there is no true uncertainty. The demurrer is not sustained on
the basis of uncertainty. 
Judicial Estoppel as to Chase
Judicial estoppel precludes a party from gaining an
advantage by taking one position, and then seeking a second advantage by taking
an incompatible position. (Yanez v. U.S. (1993) 989 F.2d 323, 326; Russell v.
Rolfs (9th Cir. 1990) 893 F.2d 1033, 1037). The doctrine's goals are to
maintain the integrity of the judicial system and to protect parties from
opponent's unfair strategies. (Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v. General Cinema Corp.
(1st Cir. 1987) 834 F.2d 208, 212, 214). California state courts apply this doctrine.
(Jackson v. County of Los Angeles (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 171, 181-183.) The
doctrine is applied by the courts to prevent internal inconsistency, preclude
litigants from playing "fast and loose" with the courts, and prohibit
"parties from deliberately changing positions according to exigencies of
the moment. (U.S. v. McCaskey (5th Cir. 1993) 9 F.3d 368, 387.) The elements of
judicial estoppel are “(1) the same party has taken two positions; (2) the
positions were taken in judicial or quasi-judicial administrative proceedings;
(3) the party was successful in asserting the first position (i.e., the
tribunal adopted the position or accepted it as true); (4) the two positions
are totally inconsistent; and (5) the first position was not taken as a result
of ignorance, fraud, or mistake.” (Owens v. County of Los Angeles (2013) 220
Cal.App.4th 107, 121.)
Plaintiffs’ claims against Chase are not
precluded due to judicial estoppel. Plaintiffs do not allege facts indicating
inconsistent positions from previously filed bankruptcy actions. The judicial estoppel
arguments raised in demurrer raise factual determinations inappropriately
raised at this juncture. Chase’s demurrer is not sustained on the basis of
judicial estoppel.
Judicial Estoppel as to U.S. Bank
Plaintiffs’ claims against U.S. Bank, as alleged, are
precluded by judicial estoppel. Plaintiffs allege inconsistent positions from
previously filed bankruptcy actions. Mina Montejano acknowledged in previously
filed bankruptcy filings that SPS/US Bank was the lender and Mina Montejano did
not dispute the loan. U.S. Bank’s demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend
on judicial estoppel grounds.
Statute of Limitations as to Chase and Quality
Loan
The statute of limitations is an affirmative defense. The
delayed discovery rule is an exception to the affirmative defense of the
statute of limitations. If it is shown that an action would otherwise be
time-barred, a plaintiff wishing to avoid the statute of limitations bar may
rely on the delayed discovery rule. Such a plaintiff bears the burden of
proving its application. (Investors Equity Life Holding Co. v. Schmidt (2011)
195 Cal.App.4th 1519, 1533.) “In order to rely on the discovery rule for
delayed accrual of a cause of action, a plaintiff whose complaint shows on its
face that his claim would be barred without the benefit of the discovery rule
must specifically plead facts to show (1) the time and manner of discovery and
(2) the inability to have made earlier discovery despite a reasonable
diligence.” (Fox Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 808.) In assessing
the sufficiency of the allegations of delayed discovery, the court places the
burden on the plaintiff to “ ‘show diligence; ‘conclusory allegations will not
withstand demurrer.’” (Id.) Statutory claims and reclaims sounding in fraud
must be brought within 3 years. (CCP §338(a), (c), and (d). This includes
Plaintiffs’ claim for cancellation of instruments. (See Zakaessian v. Zakaessian
(1945) 70 Cal.App.2d 721, 725.) The statute of limitation for Plaintiffs’ UCL
claim is 4 years. (B&P Code §17208.)
Here, Plaintiffs allege that Chase created a forged
Assignment of DOT which was improperly recorded on December 12, 2008, and that
consequently, US Bank never acquired any rights, title, or interest to
Plaintiff’s DOT. (TAC ¶ 26.) Plaintiffs do allege that they were “unaware of
any wrong doings by Defendants until the title documents were requested from
the title company in an [sic] around December, 2022.”(TAC ¶ 22.) However,
Plaintiffs do not make a showing on how they could not have made an earlier
discovery as they could have requested the title documents at an earlier time.
As indicated, facts must be alleged—unsupported conclusory statements do not
suffice.
The demurrer to the first through fifth causes of action
based on the statute of limitations is properly SUSTAINED without leave to
amend as to Chase. The demurrer to the second cause of action based on the
statute of limitations is properly SUSTAINED.
First Cause of Action – Wrongful Foreclosure
“The elements of a wrongful foreclosure cause of action
are: (1) the trustee or mortgagee caused an illegal, fraudulent, or willfully
oppressive sale of real property pursuant to power of sale in a mortgage or
deed of trust; (2) the party attacking the sale was prejudiced or harmed; and
(3) in cases where the trustor or mortgagor challenges the sale, the trustor or
mortgagor tendered the amount of the secured indebtedness or was excused from
tendering.” (Sciarratta v. U.S. Bank Natl. Assn. (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 552,
562.)
Plaintiffs’ wrongful foreclosure claim is based on their
contention that Chase lacked authority to foreclose because the Assignments are
void. (FAC §54 (d)-(i).) However, Plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge
the assignments. Yvanova v. New Century Mortg. Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919 held
that a borrower has standing to challenge an assignment post-foreclosure only
where the defect in the assignment renders the assignment void rather than
voidable. In Saterbak v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 808,
815, the court held that such an assignment is merely voidable, not void, and
that the borrower lacks standing to challenge the assignment. “Yvanova
expressly offers no opinion as to whether, under New York law, an untimely
assignment to a securitized trust made after the trust's closing date is void
or merely voidable. (Id. at pp. 940–941, 199 Cal.Rptr.3d 66, 365 P.3d 845.) We
conclude such an assignment is merely voidable. (See Rajamin v. Deutsche Bank
Nat'l Trust Co. (2d Cir.2014) 757 F.3d 79, 88–89 [“the weight of New York
authority is contrary to plaintiffs' contention that any failure to comply with
the terms of the PSAs rendered defendants' acquisition of plaintiffs' loans and
mortgages void as a matter of trust law”; “an unauthorized act by the trustee
is not void but merely voidable by the beneficiary”].) Consequently, Saterbak
lacks standing to challenge alleged defects in the MERS assignment of the DOT
to the 2007–AR7 trust.” (Id.)
Moreover, to the extent Plaintiffs are attempting to allege
that the Assignments are void because they were robo-signed by MERS—
allegations regarding “robo-signing” would render the assignment voidable and
not void. (See Maynard v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 2013 WL 4883202, at *9 (S.D.
Cal. 2013).
Based on the allegations of the TAC and the judicially
noticeable documents, it is unclear how the assignments are void. The demurrers
to the first cause of action are SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
Second Cause of Action – Cancellation of
Instruments
The elements of a cause of action for instrument
cancellation are (1) a written instrument; (2) a reasonable apprehension that
it may cause serious injury to someone; (3) as to whom it is void or voidable.
(Cal. Civ. Code §3412.)
The demurrers to the second cause of action are SUSTAINED
without leave to amend for the same reasons noted in the Court’s analysis under
the First Cause of Action. Plaintiffs have not successfully alleged that the
Assignments at issue are void.
Third Cause of Action – Quiet Title
The elements for a quiet title action are: (1) a
description of the property; (2) Plaintiff’s title or interest and the basis;
(3) defendant is asserting an adverse claim or antagonistic property interest;
(4) date as of which the determination is sought; and (5) prayer for
determination of title. (CCP §761.020.) “[A]s a general matter an action to
quiet title cannot be maintained by the owner of equitable title as against the
holder of legal title.” (Warren v. Merrill (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 96, 113.)
However, where a party acquires legal title through fraud, that party may hold
the property “as a constructive trustee for the defrauded party, and the
defrauded party would “based on the equities, [hold] superior title.” (Ibid.) The
demurrers to the third cause of action are SUSTAINED without leave to amend. As
indicated, Plaintiffs do not sufficiently allege an equitable interest in the
subject property via fraud.
Fourth Cause of Action – Violation of Cal. Civ.
Code §2923.5
“A borrower may state a cause of action under [Civil Code]
section 2923.5 by alleging the lender did not actually contact the borrower or
otherwise make the required efforts to contact the borrower despite a contrary
declaration in the recorded notice of default. (Rossberg v. Bank of America,
N.A. (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1481, 1494.) However, for violation of Cal. Civ.
Code §2923.5, “the sole available remedy is ‘more time’ before a foreclosure
sale occurs. After the sale, the statute provides no relief.” (Stebley v.
Litton Loan Servicing, LLP (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 522, 526.) Here, the
foreclosure sale has already occurred. Therefore, a remedy under Cal. Civ. Code
§2923.5 is not available.
The demurrers to the fourth cause of action are SUSTAINED
without leave to amend.
Fifth Cause of Action – Unfair Competition
To state a claim under §17200, Plaintiffs must allege
whether the conduct complained of is a fraudulent, unlawful or an unfair
business practice. To bring a claim under the fraud prong, Plaintiffs must
allege an affirmative misrepresentation, conduct or business practice on the
part of a defendant; or an omission in violation of defendant’s duty to
disclose; and that is likely to deceive members of the public. (Buller v.
Sutter Health (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 981, 986.) To state a claim under the
unfairness prong, Plaintiffs must allege that one or more of Defendant’s business
practices are unfair, unlawful or fraudulent; and the remedy sought is
authorized by law. (Paulus v. Bob Lynch Ford, Inc. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 659,
676; see also Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court (2011) 51 Cal.4th 310, 337.) To
state a claim under the unlawful prong, Plaintiffs must allege a violation of
law and cite that law. (Graham v. Bank of America, N.A. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th
594, 610 [demurrer to SAC which failed to allege violation of a law was
properly sustained without leave to amend].)
In light of the Court’s rulings above, the demurrers to the
fifth cause of action are SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
Motions to Strike
The Motions to Strike Portions of Plaintiffs’ Third Amended
Complaint are rendered MOOT by the Court’s ruling on the Demurrers above.
Leave to Amend
Leave to amend is allowed where there is a reasonable
probability that the defects can be cured by amendment. However, “[t]he burden
of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on [Plaintiffs].” (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) Here, there is no indication that Plaintiffs
would be able to cure the deficiencies in the Third Amended Complaint with
further leave to amend.  The demurrers to
the First and Second Amended Complaints were sustained on the merits, and the
Third Amended Complaint is not materially different from the previous
ones.
