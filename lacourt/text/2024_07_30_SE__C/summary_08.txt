Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the case and has determined that the Demurrer filed by Cross-Defendants Theodora McKenna and Maribel Alvarenga is MOOT. This is because the Defendant/Cross-Complainant American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees District Council 36 filed an Amended Cross-Complaint on May 30, 2024, and an Answer was received on the same date. As a result, the hearing on the Demurrer is taken off calendar.
