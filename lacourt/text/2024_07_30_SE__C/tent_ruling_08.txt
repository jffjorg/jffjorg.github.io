Tentative Ruling 
Cross-Defendants Theodora McKenna and Maribel
Alvarenga’s Demurrer is MOOT. 
Cross-Complainant to give notice. 
 
Background 
On September 26, 2023, Plaintiff Phillips & Rickards, a
law firm, filed a complaint for damages against Defendant American Federation
of State, County and Municipal Employees District Council 36 alleging (1)
Breach of Contract; (2) Quantum Meruit; and (3) Declaratory Relief.
On December 15, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees District Council 36 filed a Cross-Compliant against
Cross-Defendants Theodorah McKenna, Letecia Munguia, and Maribel Alvarenga.  
On April 23, 2024, Cross-Defendants McKenna and Alvarenga
filed the instant Demurrer. 
On May 30, 2024, Defendant/Cross-Complainant American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees District Council 36 filed
an Amended Cross-Complaint. 
Legal
Standard 
When an amended complaint is filed in response to a
demurrer before the hearing on the demurrer, that hearing should be taken off
calendar because the amended complaint supersedes the complaint to which the
demurrer was directed. (People ex rel Strathmann v Acacia Research Corp. (2012)
210 Cal.App.4th 487, 505–506.)
Discussion

On April 23, 2024, Cross-Defendants filed the Demurer
without a Motion to Strike. On May 30, 2024, Cross-Complainant field an Amened
Cross-Complaint. On the same date, Cross-Defendants filed an Answer to the
Cross-Complaint.  
Since an amended Cross-Complaint has been filed and an
answer has been received the Court finds that this hearing is MOOT and taken
off-calendar.
