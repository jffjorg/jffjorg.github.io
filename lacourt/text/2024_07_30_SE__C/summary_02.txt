And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the personal injury lawsuit brought by plaintiff Derek Perez against defendants Nicholas Joseph Gutierrez and the County of Los Angeles. The County demurred to the complaint, arguing that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. The Court has sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action, alleging negligence, with 20 days' leave to amend. The Court finds that the complaint does not identify a statutory basis for the County's liability and that the alleged violations of Vehicle Code sections 21954 and 21956 are not sufficient to establish liability. The Court has also sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action, alleging violation of the Bane Act, with 20 days' leave to amend. The Court finds that the complaint does not plead any facts to illustrate how the County or its employees violated the Bane Act or threatened, intimidated, or coerced the plaintiff. The Court has granted leave to amend both causes of action, but the plaintiff must identify a statutory basis for the County's liability and plead specific facts to support the allegations.
