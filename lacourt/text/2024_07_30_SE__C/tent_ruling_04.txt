TENTATIVE RULING
Defendant Gilbert Rios’s Motion to Set Aside Judgment
is CONTINUED to August 27, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Department SE-C.  Defendant is ORDERED to file and serve a

Defendant to give notice. 
 
Background
On March 15, 2023, Plaintiff Corrine Perez (“Plaintiff”)
filed suit against Defendant Gilbert Rios (“Defendant”) requesting partition of
real property by sale for the Subject Property located at 14619 Robert St.,
Bellflower, CA 90706. The parties are siblings who allegedly inherited the
property from a family trust on June 25, 2020. (See Complaint, ¶ 8, Ex. 2.) An
issue arose when Defendant Rios allegedly moved into the property with promises
to buy out Plaintiff, but now refuses to pay rent or buy out Plaintiff. (Complaint,
¶¶ 10-11.) Plaintiff wishes to partition the property and obtain funds for
property taxes lost rental profits. 
Default was entered against Defendant on June 8, 2023.  Judgment was entered on September 21, 2023.  Defendant moves to set aside judgment
pursuant to CCP § 473, subd. (b).
Legal Standard 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application
for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading
proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted,
and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months,
after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” (CCP § 473,
subd. (b).) 
Timeliness
 
The instant motion was filed on February 13, 2024, within six
months of entry of judgment on September 21, 2023.  Thus, the motion is timely.
Merits
Defendant represents that on April 11, 2023, he retained former
counsel Ronen Zargarof. (Rios Decl., ¶ 3.) Defendant contends that Zargarof
provided updates and reassurances that the case was progressing, and Defendant
believed him. (Rios Decl., ¶ 11.) Eventually, Zargarof ceased communicating
with Defendant. (Rios Decl., ¶ 19.) In December 2023, Defendant learned for the
first time that default had been entered against him. (Rios Decl., ¶ 20.) Defendant
has attached text message exchanges with Zargarof as evidence. (Mot., Exhibits A-I.)
From April 11, 2023 to July 31, 2023, Defendant paid Zargarof a total of
$50,957.28. (Rios Decl., ¶ 4.)    
The Court is inclined to grant the motion.  The policy of hearing cases on their merits
is well-established. (See, e.g., Berman v. Klassman (1971) 17 Cal.App.3d
900.) Given the liberality associated with Motions to Set Aside Defaults, the
Court finds Defendant’s declaration sufficient to warrant relief. The law
favors trials on the merits. (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th
975, 980.) 
However, subdivision (b) of CCP §473 requires Defendant to
attach an Answer or other responsive pleading to the motion.  This was not done. The terms of CCP §473(b)
are mandatory, compliance is not optional.  Accordingly, this matter is CONTINUED as
indicated above to enable Defendant the opportunity to cure the procedural
defect so that this matter may proceed on the merits. Defendant is ORDERED to
file and serve a proposed answer or other responsive pleading by August 16,
2024.
