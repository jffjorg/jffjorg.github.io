And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The defendants, Nicholas Joseph Gutierrez and the County of Los Angeles, argue that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for negligence and violation of the Bane Act. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action for negligence, finding that the complaint does not adequately plead a statutory basis for liability against the County. The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action for violation of the Bane Act, finding that the complaint fails to plead any facts to illustrate how the County or its employees violated the Bane Act. The judge has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint to address these defects.
