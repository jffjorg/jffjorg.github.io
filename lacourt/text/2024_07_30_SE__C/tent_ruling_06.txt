TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Victor A. Batres’s Motions to Compel
Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for
Production, Set One, are CONTINUED to Tuesday, October 8th, 2024 at 9:30 a.m.
in Department SE-C. 
Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
This lemon law action alleges that Defendant General
Motors, Inc. (“Defendant”) violated the California Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act (“Song-Beverly Act”) by failing to repair Plaintiff Victor A.
Batres’s (“Plaintiff”) 2021 GMC Yukon XL vehicle (the “Subject Vehicle”).
During the warranty period, the Subject Vehicle contained or developed numerous
defects that Defendant’s authorized repair facility was unable to conform to
warranty.
On July 27, 2023, Plaintiff served his first set of
Requests for Production and Special Interrogatories upon Defendant. (Decl. Chae
¶11, Ex. 6.) On August 25, 2023, GM served its unverified responses to
Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories and Request for Production. (Decl. Chae
¶12, Ex. 7). Verifications were subsequently electronically served on September
21, 2023. (Id. at ¶15, Ex. 9). Plaintiff contends the responses were
insufficient. 
On May 14, 2024, the Court determined that the parties had
not exhausted their meet and confer efforts and ordered the parties to file a
joint statement by July 23, 2024. 
(Minute Order, May 14, 2024.)  
Plaintiff’s counsel timely filed a declaration regarding
the meet and confer efforts. Plaintiff’s counsel states Defendant has not
responded to Plaintiff’s requests to meet and confer regarding the discovery
sought, but the parties are near settlement. 
Plaintiff’s counsel requests an additional continuance of 30 days to
further settlement discussions. (Chae Decl., ¶ 9.) 
Accordingly, the motions are CONTINUED to Tuesday, October 8th,
2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.  The
parties are ORDERED to file a JOINT STATEMENT regarding the status of
settlement negotiations and/or a detailed outline of the remaining disputed
discovery issues no later than September 26, 2024.
