And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Martina A. Silas's motion to quash and/or modify subpoenas issued by defendants Ace Hardware Corporation and The Grommet. The Plaintiff has moved to quash 8 subpoenas seeking her medical records, arguing that defendants failed to oppose a previous motion to quash and failed to file a motion for relief. The Court has denied the Plaintiff's motion to quash in its entirety, but has granted her motion to modify the subpoenas to add instructions to redact sensitive information.

The Court has also ruled that defendants have good cause to seek the medical records, and that the Plaintiff has waived her physician-patient privilege with respect to the medical conditions she has put in issue. The Court has found that the subpoenas are not identical to the previously quashed subpoenas, and that defendants have demonstrated good cause for the records sought.

The Court has denied both parties' requests for sanctions, and has ordered that the parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court indicating their intention to submit.
