  - The concealed hazard exception in Kinsman v. Unocal Corp. (2005) 37 Cal.4th 659 does not apply unless the hirer as landowner knew or reasonably should have known of a concealed, preexisting hazardous condition on its premises.
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendants, Bacon Family Trust and Kevin Bacon, to the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The demurrer challenges the plaintiff's claims for negligence and premises liability, arguing that the plaintiff is an independent contractor and therefore not entitled to damages.

The court finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to support the control exception to the Privette rule, which allows a hirer to be liable to an independent contractor's employee if the hirer retained control over the safety conditions of the worksite. The court also finds that the plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to establish the concealed hazard exception, which allows a hirer to be liable to an independent contractor's employee if the hirer knew or reasonably should have known of a concealed, preexisting hazardous condition on its premises.

The court therefore overrules the defendants' demurrer and allows the plaintiff's claims to proceed.
