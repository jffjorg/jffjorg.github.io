And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash a subpoena issued to David Welch, the attorney for Advanced Labs, Inc. The subpoena seeks communications between Welch and Advanced Labs, Inc. related to the breach of lease and breach of guaranty claims brought by Lynwood Santa Fe, LLC.

The judge finds that the attorney-client privilege does not apply in this case because Welch's alleged breach of duty is at issue. The judge also finds that the privilege was impliedly waived because Advanced Labs, Inc. has placed into issue the matter of Welch's advice and state of mind.

The judge grants the motion to compel further responses to discovery requests from Lynwood Santa Fe, LLC, but only to the extent that the requests seek information relevant to determining whether Welch represented and/or defrauded any Maywood tenants. The judge denies the motion to quash the subpoena and orders Welch to produce the requested documents within 20 days.

The judge also denies the motion to compel further responses to discovery requests from Advanced Labs, Inc. in all other respects, finding that the requests are too broad and seek information that is not relevant to the case.
