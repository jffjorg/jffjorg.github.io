And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Fernando Barajas-Salomon v. 101 Granite Countertop LLC, et al. The case involves a product liability action filed by Mr. Barajas-Salomon against various defendants, including Prestwick Management Corporation.

The judge has sustained Prestwick's demurrer with leave to amend to allege the specific products required by the Bockrath standard. The judge found that the complaint fails to identify the specific products attributable to Prestwick, and that the complaint cannot be amended to cure this defect.

The judge has also granted Prestwick's motion to strike as to punitive damages with leave to amend and denied as to the historical facts. The judge found that the complaint does not adequately plead fraud and that the allegations of punitive damages are insufficient.

The judge has given the parties leave to amend their pleadings to cure the defects identified in the ruling. The hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike is set for September 25, 2024.
