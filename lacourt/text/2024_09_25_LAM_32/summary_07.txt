And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the defendant's motion to disqualify the plaintiff's counsel due to a potential conflict of interest. The court finds that the defendant has failed to demonstrate a substantial relationship between the prior and current representations, as required by the standards set forth in Jessen and Khani. As a result, there is no basis for disqualification. Additionally, the court finds that the plaintiff's counsel, Drake Law Firm, has satisfied the requirements of Rule 1.10(a)(2) and has properly screened the associate attorney, Logan Hensley, from cases involving the defendant. Therefore, the court denies the defendant's motion to disqualify counsel and allows Drake Law Firm to continue representing the plaintiff.
