  Case Number:  23AVCV00204    Hearing Date:   April 2, 2024    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This is a lemon law action. Plaintiff
Maria Salas (“Plaintiff”) alleges that she purchased a 2017 Honda Pilot with
VIN: 5FNYF5H56HB031880 (the “Subject Vehicle”) on August 29, 2017 and entered
an express written contract with Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.
(“Defendant”) by which Defendant undertook to preserve or maintain the utility
or performance of the Subject Vehicle or provide compensation if there was a
failure in such utility or performance. Plaintiff presents that throughout the
United States, Defendant manufactured hundreds of thousands of vehicles with
defective transmissions, including all 2014-2019 Honda Pilot Vehicles. Plaintiff
further presents that, at the time of the sale of the Subject Vehicle, (1) Defendant
was aware or should have been aware of the transmission defect in the Subject
Vehicle before it sold the Subject Vehicle due to various issued Technical
Service Bulletins (“TSBs”) and complaints; and (2) Defendant had a duty to
disclose the transmission defect and did not do so. Plaintiff alleges that,
after purchase of the Subject Vehicle at a car dealership in Mission Hills, she
delivered the Subject Vehicle to Defendant’s Robertson Palmdale Honda approximately
eight times. Of the eight times four times related to repeated complaints of
the vehicle’s transmission not shifting properly. Plaintiff contends that Defects
and nonconformities to warranty manifested themselves within the applicable
express warranty period. The nonconformities substantially impaired the use,
value and/or safety of the Subject Vehicle, Defendant was unable to conform the
Subject Vehicle to the applicable express warranty after a reasonable number of
repair attempts, and Defendant did not make restitution in accordance with the
Song-Beverly Act. 
 
On February 21, 2023, Plaintiff
filed her Complaint alleging two causes of action for (1) Violation of
Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty, and (2) Fraudulent
Inducement-Concealment. 
 
On April 14, 2023, Defendant
filed its Answer.
On January 03, 2024, the parties
entered a stipulation to allow Plaintiff leave to file her First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”).
 
On January 31, 2024, Plaintiff
filed her FAC alleging the same two causes of action. 
 
On February 08, 2024, Defendant
filed this Demurrer with Motion to Strike. 
 
On March 19, 2024, Plaintiff
filed her Oppositions.
 
On March 25, 2024, Defendant
filed its Replies.

Legal Standard
 
Standard for Demurrer – A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of
action.¿ (Hahn v.¿Mirda¿(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) ¿When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context.¿ (Taylor
v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th
1216, 1228.)¿ In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the
face of the pleading or by proper judicial notice.¿ (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
430.30(a).)¿A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters.¿ (SKF Farms v. Superior Court¿(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.)¿
Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or
are judicially noticed.¿¿(Ibid.)¿¿The only issue involved in a demurrer
hearing is¿whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous
matters, states a cause of action.¿ (Hahn,¿supra,¿147 Cal.App.4th
at 747.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
A general demurrer admits the truth of all
factual, material allegations properly pled in the challenged pleading,
regardless of possible difficulties of proof.¿¿(Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿ Thus, no matter how unlikely or improbable, plaintiff’s
allegations must be accepted as true for the purpose of ruling on the
demurrer.¿¿(Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.¿(1981) 123
Cal.App.3d 593, 604.)¿ Nevertheless, this rule does not apply to allegations
expressing mere conclusions of law, or allegations contradicted by the exhibits
to the complaint or by matters of which judicial notice may be taken.¿¿(Vance
v. Villa Park¿Mobilehome¿Estates¿(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 698, 709.)¿A general
demurrer does not admit contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the complaint; facts impossible in law; or allegations contrary to
facts of which a court may take judicial notice.¿¿(Blank,¿supra,
39 Cal.3d at p. 318.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Pursuant to¿Code Civ. Proc.¿§430.10(e), the
party against whom a complaint has been filed may object by demurrer to the
pleading on the grounds that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.¿ It is an abuse of discretion to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend if there is a reasonable probability that the
defect can be cured by amendment.¿¿(Schifando¿v. City of Los Angeles¿(2003)
31 Cal.4th 1074, 1082,¿as modified Dec. 23, 2003.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿

¿ 
Standard for a Motion to Strike – The court may, upon a motion, or at any time
in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
436(a).) The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (Id., § 436(b).) The grounds for a motion to strike are that
the pleading has irrelevant, false, or improper matter, or has not been drawn
or filed in conformity with laws. (Id. § 436.) The grounds for moving to
strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Id.
§ 437.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
-----¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
Meet and Confer Requirement – Before filing a demurrer or a motion to strike, the demurring or moving
party is required to meet and confer with the party who filed the pleading
demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for the
purposes of determining whether an agreement can be reached through a filing of
an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be raised in the
demurrer. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41 and 435.5.) The Court notes that this
requirement has been met. (See Decl. Leanna L. H. Vault ¶¶ 2-3.)

Discussion
 
Application – Defendant
demurs only to the Second Cause of Action (Fraudulent Inducement –
Concealment).
 
As a preliminary matter, Defendant’s
argument regarding the Supremacy Clause is unavailing. It is well known that fraudulent
inducement and/or fraudulent concealment are causes of action. TSBs are
routinely cited to in lemon law cases as evidence of a defendant’s exclusive
knowledge. Defendant concedes it provided such data to the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) and, as such, Defendant concedes that
it has the knowledge alleged. (See Demurrer 8:26-27.) While Defendant believes
that disclosure of a transmission defect would stand as an obstacle to the
accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of Congress and NHTSA, the
statement is unsupported. 
 
The Court also notes that while
Defendant has a section titled “Plaintiff’s Fraudulent Inducement Claim Lacks
the Requisite Factual Specificity and is Therefore, Uncertain, Ambiguous, and
Unintelligible,” the argument provided does not indicate how the Complaint
uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. Rather, it appears to only indicate
that Plaintiff did not plead the Second Cause of Action with the requisite
specificity. 
 
Defendant argues that for
Plaintiff to adequately plead Second Cause of Action, there must be a
relationship which could give rise to a duty to disclose and, here, there is
none as Plaintiff did not engage in a direct transaction with Defendant but
with Galpin Honda, an authorized Honda dealer. Defendant contends that while
Galpin Honda is an authorized dealer, it is not an agent. Defendant next argues
that Plaintiff alleges public disclosure through NHSTA, contradicting the
exclusive knowledge allegation, and that Plaintiff fails to allege active
concealment or plead with specificity. Defendant further argues that
Plaintiff’s Second Cause of Action is barred by statute of limitations as she
purchased the Subject Vehicle on or about August 29, 2017, but did not file the
FAC until February 21, 2023. Defendant believes that accrual began on the
purchase date and that any tolling theory alleged in the FAC fails as the
underlying allegations are conclusory. Defendant also presents that Mobayen
v. American Honda Motor Co., et al, Los Angeles County Superior Court Case
No. 19STCV33467 (“Mobayen”) was never certified and dismissed on July
20, 2023. Defendant contends that as the request for punitive damages which
derives from the Second Cause of Action must fail for the same reasons.
 
Plaintiff presents that Defendant
had a duty to disclose concealed facts as they knew about the transmission
defects through sources not available to consumers including: Defendant’s own
design expertise; Defendant’s own records of customers’ complaints, dealership
repair records, records from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA), warranty and post-warranty claims, and internal pre-sale durability testing
and technical service bulletins. (See Opp. 4:17-20 [citing to FAC ¶¶16, 22.)
Plaintiff cites to Dhital v. Nissan North America, Inc. (2022) 84
Cal.App.5th 828 (“Dhital”)].). Plaintiff presents that her FAC
specifically alleges facts constituting each element of Defendant’s concealment
and meets the requisite specificity as it is alleged that as early as 2012, the
fleet of vehicles including the 2017 Honda Pilot, experienced the same or
similar transmission defect as the Subject Vehicle, Plaintiff presents that she
has met the elements for her Second Cause of Action, citing to portions of the
FAC. Plaintiff emphasizes that the specificity requirement is relaxed when the
allegations indicate that a defendant must necessarily possess full information
concerning the facts of the controversy or when the facts lie more in the
knowledge of the opposite party. As to tolling, Plaintiff presents (1) she
reasonably relied on representations by Defendant indicating that the Subject
Vehicle had been repaired, (2) the discovery rule and the doctrines of
fraudulent concealment apply to toll Plaintiff’s causes of action, (3)
Plaintiff has alleged the precise time and manner of discovery (i.e., repair
visit on November 27, 2020), (4) the attempts at service show diligence, (5)
the American Pipe [ and Cost. Co. v. Utah (1974) 141 U.S. 538 (“American
Pipe”)] rule applies and Mobayen is ongoing, and (6) equitable
tolling applies.
 
In Reply, Defendant has provided
new evidence in a Request for Judicial Notice. It is unclear why the Request
for Judicial Notice was not brought with the moving papers as Defendant’s
arguments included the the transmission of aggregate data to NHTSA which allows
the public to review such information and a discussion of Mobayen. “The
salutary rule is that points raised in a reply brief for the first time will
not be considered unless good cause is shown for the failure to present them
before.” (Balboa Ins. Co. v. Aguirre (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 1002, 1010.)
This applies to new evidence as well – “[t]he general rule of motion practice …
is that new evidence is not permitted with reply papers.” (Jay v. Mahaffey
(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537.) “This rule is based on the same solid logic
applied in the appellate courts, specifically, that ‘[p]oints raised for the
first time in a reply brief will ordinarily not be considered, because such
consideration would deprive the respondent of an opportunity to counter the
argument.’ ” (Id. at 1538 [citing American Drug Stores, Inc. v. Stroh
(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1446, 1453; Browne v. County of Tehama (2013) 213
Cal.App.4th 704, 720, fn. 10].) As such, the Court does not consider Defendant’s
new evidence submitted in the Reply brief. 

 
Defendant’s Reply arguments
include the following: (1) Plaintiff has not met her burden to show that the
claims are timely as the delayed discovery rule is misapplied as Plaintiff
alleged that “on the November 21, 2020 repair visit, Plaintiff brought her
vehicle in to an authorized repair facility for repeated transmission concern”
(see FAC ¶¶ 54-58) creating an awareness in Plaintiff that there were issues
with the transmission and an investigation would have revealed the TSBs; (2) Plaintiff’s
argument requests the Court to overlook that for the American Pipe
tolling, a class certification must have been denied, not simply filed, Plaintiff’s
understanding of China Agritech v. Resh (2018) 138 S.Ct. 1800 is
incorrect, and Plaintiff has not addressed whether the class action
sufficiently put Defendant on notice of the substance and nature of Plaintiff’s
claims in the individual suit; and (3) Plaintiff is not entitled to equitable
tolling as Mobayen did not provide Defendant notice of the claims in the
case such that it could identify or preserve evidence as the Mobayen
case was focused on Plaintiff Khosrow Mobayen’s lease of a specific 2017 Honda
Pilot and its repair history, not Plaintiff’s Subject Vehicle. Defendant
reiterates its exclusive knowledge and clarity arguments. 
 
The Court notes that Dhital
is pending review by the California Supreme Court. (See Dhital v. Nissan
North America, Inc. (2023) 304 Cal.Rptr.3d 82. Plaintiff did not disclose
this in her citations to Dhital. (See Cal. Rules of Court, Rules
8.1105(e)(1)(B), 8.1115(e)(1).) As such, the Dhital holding may be cited
only for persuasive value. (See Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 8.1115(e)(1).) Defendant,
too, has failed to include such information in its Reply when discussing Dhital.
(See Reply 10:21-11:6.) 
 
The Court first addresses statute
of limitations. 
 
Plaintiff’s Second Cause of
Action is governed by the three-year statute of limitations under Cal. Civ.
Code § 338(d).
 
Plaintiffs purchased the Subject
Vehicle on “August 19, 2017” but did not file suit until February 21, 2023. (FAC
¶ 8.) 
 
"[W]here class action status
has been denied solely because of failure to demonstrate that the class is so
numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, the commencement of the
original class suit tolls the running of the statute for all purported members
of the class who make timely motions to intervene after the court has found the
suit inappropriate for class action status." (American Pipe, supra,
414 U.S. 538, 553.) Under limited circumstances, if class certification is
denied, the statute of limitations is tolled from the time of commencement of
the suit to the time of denial of certification for all purported members of
the class who either make timely motions to intervene in the surviving
individual action or who timely file their individual actions. (Falk v.
Children's Hospital of Los Angeles (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 1454, 1463 ["Tolling
lasts from the day a class claim is asserted until the day the suit is
conclusively not a class action—which may be because the judge rules adversely
to the plaintiff."])
 
Paragraph 75 alleges that the Mobayen
class action is still ongoing. However, Plaintiffs fail to allege that class
certification was denied. (See American Pipe, supra, 414 U.S.
538, 552-53; Chardon v. Fumero Soto (1983) 462 U.S. 650, 654; see also Crown,
Cork & Seal Co., Inc. v. Parker (1983) 462 U.S. 345, 354; China
Agritech, supra, 138 S.Ct. 1800, 1804.) Indeed, the “watchwords of
American Pipe are efficiency and economy of litigation,” and extending American
Pipe tolling where class certification has not been denied does not serve that
purpose. (China Agritech, supra, 138 S.Ct. 1800, 1804.)
 
However, it appears that the
delayed discovery rule may apply. Under the section titled “Plaintiff’s
Experiences,” Plaintiff alleges facts surrounding several attempts to deliver
the Subject Vehicle to authorized repair facilities of Defendant and rectify
the situation. While Plaintiff alleges in the FAC that “Plaintiff could not
have reasonably discovered facts giving rise to Plaintiffs claims until 23
November 21, 2020, at the earliest” (FAC ¶¶ 70, 75, 84), Plaintiff alleges (1)
on or around August 23, 2019, she delivered the Subject Vehicle in with
complaints which include that the transmission was inoperative (FAC ¶ 54); (2)
on October 04, 2019, she delivered the Subject Vehicle with complaints that the
transmission does not shift properly (FAC ¶ 56); (3) on March 05, 2020, she
delievered the Subject Vehicle with complaints that the Subject Vehicle was
jerking and Defendant’s authorized repair facility performed transmission
service on the Subject Vehicle ; and (4) on August 25, 2020 she delivered the
Subject Vehicle with complaints that the gears were not shifted properly and
that a diagnostic system was used to review transmission operation (FAC ¶ 58).
“[U]nder the delayed discovery rule, a cause of action accrues and the statute
of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff has reason to suspect an injury
and some wrongful cause, unless the plaintiff pleads and proves that a
reasonable investigation at that time would not have revealed a factual basis
for that particular cause of action.” (Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.
(2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 803.) Thus, it appears that the Second Cause of Action
may have began to accrue on either March 05, 2020 or August 25, 2020. Three
years from the earliest date, March 05, 2020 is March 05, 2020 and Plaintiff
filed her action on February 21, 2023, within the three years. 
 
The Court turns next to the
elements which can be applied to fraudulent concealment and inducement.  
 
“The elements of fraud that will
give rise to a tort action for deceit are: “ ‘(a) misrepresentation (false
representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or
‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable
reliance; and (e) resulting damage.’ ” (Engalla v. Permanente Medical Group,
Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 974 [internal quotation marks omitted].) “[T]he
elements of an action for fraud and deceit based on a concealment are: (1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent
to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact
and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed
fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact, the
plaintiff must have sustained damage.” (Boschma v. Home Loan Center, Inc.
(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 230, 248.)
 
The material fact alleged is the transmission
defect. 
 
The TSBs themselves are not
alleged to have been disclosed to the public; however, Plaintiff’s FAC states
that Defendant had knowledge from consumer complaints to the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA"). (See FAC ¶ 16.) Thus, Plaintiff
could have known or discovered the alleged defects and Defendant did not
actively prevent plaintiffs from discovering the facts. Thus, an issue exists as
to concealment of the transmission defect and Defendant’s intent. 
 
Thus, on its face, there is a
deficiency within the FAC as to Second Cause of Action (Fraudulent Inducement-Concealment).

 
Accordingly, the Demurrer is
SUSTAINED.
 
Defendant’s Motion to Strike
concerns the striking of punitive damages and is encompassed by the Demurrer as
the punitive damages stem from the Second Cause of Action. Accordingly,
Defendant’s  Motion to Strike is now
MOOT. 
 
-----
 
Leave to Amend
 
Leave to amend must
be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman
v. Kennedy¿(1976), 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) While under California law leave to amend is
liberally granted, “leave to amend should not be granted where, in
all probability, amendment would be futile.” (Vaillette v. Fireman's Fund
Ins. Co. (1993), 18 Cal. App. 4th 680, 685).¿ “A trial court does not abuse
its discretion when it sustains a demurrer without¿leave to amend¿if
either (a) the facts and the nature of the claims are clear and no liability
exists, or (b) it is probable from the nature of the defects and previous
unsuccessful attempts to plead that the plaintiff cannot state a claim.” (Cantu
v. Resolution Trust Corp.¿(1992)¿4 Cal.App.4th 857, 889.)¿ 
 
An amendment to the FAC to rectify the
deficiencies would mean discarding the allegations in the current pleading.
This subjects any amendment to the sham pleading doctrine. Plaintiff cannot
disregard her current factual allegations. Thus, it appears that leave to amend
would not lead to a successful amendment.
 
Accordingly, the Court declines to allow
leave to amend.

Conclusion
 
Defendant American Honda’s
Demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
 
Defendant American Honda’s Motion to Strike is MOOT.
