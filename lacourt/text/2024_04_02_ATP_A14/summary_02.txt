Summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge intends to grant the motion for leave to amend the complaint, pending the filing of a new proposed Second Amended Complaint that addresses the current deficiencies in the attached proposed SAC. The proposed claims may be rectified by amendment, and there is a potential basis for punitive damages as the punitive damages are derivative of the proposed causes of action. The judge notes that the claims may be unclear, and the proposed SAC should be rewritten to address these deficiencies.
