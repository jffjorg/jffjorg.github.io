```

Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the defendant's demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state a cause of action for breach of express warranty and fraudulent concealment. The Judge finds that the plaintiff has not met the burden of showing that the claims are timely and that the delayed discovery rule may apply. The Judge also finds that the defendant had knowledge of the transmission defect and failed to disclose it to the public, which may have led to the plaintiff's reliance on the vehicle. The Judge declines to allow leave to amend, finding that it would likely be futile.
