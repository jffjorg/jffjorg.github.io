Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Good Seed CDC. The court finds that the complaint is uncertain and may be rectified by an amendment. The court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend. The plaintiff, Amarilla Perez Pivara, is allowed to file an amended pleading within 30 days of this order. The court notes that the complaint raises questions as to this demurrer, particularly regarding the contractual relationship between the parties and the basis for the alleged duties owed by the defendant. The court also finds that the defendant's new argument concerning foreseeability, submitted in the reply brief, is not considered as it was raised for the first time in the reply brief.
