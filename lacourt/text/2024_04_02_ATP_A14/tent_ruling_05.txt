Plaintiff refers to the Los Angeles County Housing Authority as “HACLA.” HACLA stands
for Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles. (See https://www.hacla.org/en.) There is another
entity, Los Angeles County Development Authority that subsidizing housing. As
the Court is unclear as to which entity Plaintiff is referencing due to the use
of the full form of the housing authority entity as county while the acronym
implies the city, the Court will refer to the housing authority as alleged in
full form, “Los Angeles County Housing Authority.”
