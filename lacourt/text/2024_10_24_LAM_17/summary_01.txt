And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on David Rojas's motion to tax costs sought by the City of Los Angeles. The motion is denied in part and granted in part. The Court taxes a total of $2,159 in claimed costs. The costs that are being taxed include deposition costs of $6,697.71, court ordered transcript costs of $77.00, and court reporter costs of $2,082.00. The Court agrees to tax the deposition costs, but not the court reporter costs for the first day of trial, as the trial was denied due to a prior ruling. The Court also denies Rojas's request to tax the costs of transcribing the City's motion for summary judgment, as Rojas was not a party to the motion.
