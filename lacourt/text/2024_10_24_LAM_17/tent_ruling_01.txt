  vs.
 
DAVID ROJAS, et al.

 


 Case
  No.:  20STCV30229
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: October 24, 2024



 
 
Rojas’s
motion to tax costs is DENIED IN PART, GRANTED IN PART. The Court taxes $2,159
in claimed costs.
 
On 8/11/2020, Plaintiff Janet Baggett, Preston Sertich by
and through his guardian ad litem Michael Sertich, Jr., Michael Sertich, Jr.
and Estate of Elizabeth Baggett, by and through representatives Janet Baggett
and Preston Sertich filed suit against David Rojas and the City of Los Angeles
(COLA), alleging (1) invasion of privacy; (2) intentional infliction of
emotional distress; (3) negligence; (4) mishandling of human remains; (5)
violation of human remains; (5) violation of Civil Code section 1708.85; (6)
intrusion into private affairs; and (7) violation of mandatory statutory
duties. 
 
            On
8/29/2024, David Rojas moved to tax costs sought by Cross-Defendant City of Los
Angeles. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Rojas
moves to tax the following costs:
 
-        
Item No. 4: Deposition costs of
$6,697.71. 
-        
Item No. 9: Court ordered transcript
costs of $77.00
-        
Item No. 11: Court reporter costs of
$2,082.00. 
 
As for Item
No. 4., Rojas objects to this amount “because all these depositions dealt with
the basis of Plaintiffs’ Complaint against the City and Cross-Complainant. If
there was any information obtained that is relevant to the Cross-Complaint, it
was a miniscule amount compared to the exploration of Plaintiffs’ underlying
complaint.”  (Motion, 1: 4-7.) 
 
In Opposition,
the City argues that “[t]he information derived during discovery, regardless of
how much or little is derived, is necessary to prepare for trial. The amount of
information derived is not determinative of recovery nor does it negate the
need for ordering these items.” (Opp., 4: 19-21.) The Court agrees, and
determines this cost was reasonably incurred.
 
As for Item
No. 9, a prevailing party can seek to recover for transcripts of court
proceedings ordered by the court or mandated by statute, pursuant to CCP
section 1033.5(a)(9). However, here David Rojas was not a party to the City’s
motion for summary judgment, and therefore the costs of transcribing that
hearing should not be borne by Rojas. Accordingly, the Court taxes $77.00 in
Item 9 costs.
 
Finally, as
for Item No. 11, CCP section 1033.5(c)(4) provides that “[i]tems not mentioned
in this section and items assessed upon application may be allowed or denied in
the court’s discretion.” Here, Rojas was not a party to Plaintiff’s motion for
summary adjudication, or (as mentioned above) the City’s motion for summary
judgment. Accordingly, the Court agrees that the amounts incurred to transcribe
those hearings--$782.00 and $650.00 respectively—should be taxed here.
Moreover, the Court also strikes the $650 in court reporter fees for the first
day of trial. As noted by Rojas, prior to trial, the ruling denying Rojas’s
motion for leave to amend the Cross-Complaint had been received and thus it was
clear that trial could not proceed as a result of that ruling. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Rojas’s motion to tax costs is denied in part, granted in part. The
Court taxes $2,159 in claimed costs. 
 
It is so ordered.
