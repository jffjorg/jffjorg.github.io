  vs.
 
AVIS COPELIN, et al.

 


 Case
  No.:  24STCV09012
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  October 22, 2024



 
            After
review, the Court has identified the following deficiency with Plaintiff’s
default judgment packet:
 
 
-        
Plaintiff seeks $52,112.10 in attorney
fees. CRC rule 3.207 provides that attorney fees awarded on default must be
determined in accordance with Local Rule 3.214. 
 
-        
Plaintiff must submit legal authority
to confirm that the Court can award default judgment based on allegations made
only on “information and belief.”  Plaintiff must also better explain why
corroborating evidence of its allegations cannot be submitted (as opposed to relying
only on information and belief.)
