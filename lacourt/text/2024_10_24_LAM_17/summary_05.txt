And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the default judgment packet submitted by the City of West Hollywood against Avis Copelin and others. The judge has identified two deficiencies in the packet. First, the City seeks $52,112.10 in attorney fees without providing the required legal authority, as specified in California Rules of Court rule 3.207 and Local Rule 3.214. Second, the City must explain why it cannot provide corroborating evidence to support its allegations, instead relying on "information and belief." The judge is requiring the City to address these deficiencies before the hearing on October 24, 2024.
