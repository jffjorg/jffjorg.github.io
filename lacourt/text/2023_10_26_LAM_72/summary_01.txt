Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Cross-Defendants' demurrer to Part Four's cross-complaint alleging violation of the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (15 U.S.C. §1125(d)). The judge finds that the allegations in the cross-complaint establish that Cross-Defendants registered domain names for the benefit of Part Four and with bad faith intent to profit from them. The judge also denies Cross-Defendants' motion to strike the punitive damages claim, finding that the allegations support a finding of malice and oppression and that Sly Spectrum is liable for punitive damages based on the acts of its employee, Dortch.
