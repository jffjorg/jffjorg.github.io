And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, CDC Restaurant Group, Inc. d/b/a Chick-fil-A Restaurants and Jeremiah Cillpam, have moved to compel arbitration of the plaintiff, Bianca Ball's, individual claims under the Private Attorneys' General Act of 2004 (PAGA) and to dismiss her representative claims. The court has not made a tentative ruling and instead will continue this matter to November 30, 2023, at 9:30 a.m. The parties are ordered to file simultaneous briefs of no more than 10 pages by November 20, 2023, on two issues: (1) what is the proper resolution of this motion in light of the California Supreme Court decision in Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104, and (2) does the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) apply to this case, and if not, should the court deny this motion? The court notes that the inapplicability of the FAA was the plaintiff's lead argument in her opposition, but the defendants were silent on this issue in their reply. The court will entertain argument today if either party feels it would be helpful, and will defer argument to the November 30, 2023 hearing if both parties agree.
