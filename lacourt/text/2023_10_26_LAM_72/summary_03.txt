And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting Plaintiff Markus Pinon's motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production (RFPs) Nos. 16-21, which seek documents related to the Engine Defect in Plaintiff's 2021 GMC Sierra 1500 AT4. The RFPs pertain to internal investigations, communications, customer complaints, and other information related to the Engine Defect. The judge finds that the RFPs demonstrate good cause for production and that the requested documents could reasonably lead to admissible evidence regarding Defendant General Motors LLC's knowledge of the Engine Defect and its willful failure to abide by its obligations under the Song Beverly Act.

The judge orders Defendant to produce responsive documents, including recall notices and technical service bulletins, and limits the scope of the requests to avoid imposing an undue burden on Defendant. The judge also requires Defendant to file a protective order executed by Plaintiff's counsel to address concerns regarding trade secrets and confidential information involving third parties.

The judge notes that Plaintiff's claims under the Song Beverly Act are based on allegations that Defendant failed to repair or replace the vehicle and willfully failed to abide by its obligations under the Act, and that the requested documents could provide evidence to support these claims. The judge's ruling is subject to change after hearing arguments from the parties at the scheduled hearing on October 26, 2023.
