TENTATIVE RULING
 



BIANCA BALL, 
 
                                  Plaintiffs,
  
         v.
 
 
CDC RESTAURANT GROUP, INC. d/b/a CHICK-FIL-A RESTAURANTS,
  et al.
 
                                  Defendants.
 


 Case No:  22STCV29951 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  October 26, 2023
 Calendar
  Number:  3



 
 
 
Defendants CDC Restaurant Group, Inc. d/b/a Chick-fil-A
Restaurants, and Jeremiah Cillpam (collectively, “Defendants”) move pursuant to
the Federal Arbitration Act to compel arbitration of the Plaintiff Bianca
Ball’s individual claims pf Plaintiff Bianca Ball (“Plaintiff”) under the
Private Attorneys’ General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”) and dismissal of Plaintiff
Ball’s representative claims.  
 
The Court issues no tentative.  Instead, the Court continues this matter to
November 30, 2023 at 9:30 a.m. and orders that the parties file simultaneous
briefs of no more than 10 pages by November 20, 2023 on the following two
issues:
 
1.     What is the proper resolution of this motion in
light of the California Supreme Court decision in Adolph v. Uber
Technologies, Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104? 
The case was decided after Plaintiff filed her last brief on this
motion.
2.     Does the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) apply
to this case, and if it does not should the Court deny this motion?  The Court notes that the inapplicability of
the FAA was Plaintiff’s lead argument in her opposition, but Defendants were
silent on this issue in their reply.
 
The Court will entertain argument today if
either party feels it would be helpful. 
To the extent that both parties agree, the Court will defer argument to the
November 30, 2023 hearing.
