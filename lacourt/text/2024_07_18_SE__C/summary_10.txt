And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside a dismissal filed by plaintiff Jennifer Tu. The motion was unopposed, but the judge denied it without prejudice because it failed to comply with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). Specifically, the motion did not include a copy of the proposed pleading or amended complaint. The judge ordered the plaintiff to file and serve a proposed first amended complaint by July 19, 2024, and continued the hearing to July 25, 2024.
