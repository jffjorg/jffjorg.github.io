ADD ON
 
Plaintiff IDALIA ESPINOZA DEL CID’s Motion to Set Aside
Dismissal under CCP §473(b) is DENIED without prejudice. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
No Opposition filed as of July 15, 2024.  
 
This premises liability action was filed by Plaintiff on
August 7, 2023. On March 26, 2024, Plaintiff’s Complaint was dismissed without
prejudice due to Plaintiff’s Counsel’s failure to appear for a Case Management
Conference and OSC Re: Dismissal of the Entire Action for Plaintiff’s Failure
to Appear on 02/27/2024. (See 03/26/24 M.O.) 
 
Plaintiff moves to set aside the dismissal under CCP
§473(b). 
 
On June 13, 2024, this matter was CONTINUED to July 11, 2024
due to Plaintiff’s failure to attach a copy of a proposed pleading or amended
complaint as required by CCP §473(b). Plaintiff was given leave to file an
amended Motion. 
 
The Amended Motion filed on June 17, 2024 still does not
have attached to it a proposed pleading or a copy of Plaintiff’s proposed
amended complaint. The Court notes that Exhibit B to the Motion does not state
that it is a Proposed First Amended Complaint. Consequently, at the hearing on
July 11, 2024, the Court issued the following Order:  “At the hearing, Plaintiff requested, and
Defendant did not oppose, a brief continuance to lodge a First Amended
Complaint.  Accordingly, Plaintiff is
ORDERED to lodge a First Amended Complaint by July 15, 2024.  The hearing is CONTINUED to July 18, 2024 at
9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.  If lodged by
July 15, 2024, the First Amended Complaint will be deemed filed on July 18,
2024.” (Order, 07/11/24)
 
As of July 16, 2024, no First Amended Complaint has been
filed/lodged with this Court. 
 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted….” (emphasis
added.) (CCP §473(b).) 
The Motion is DENIED without prejudice for failure to comply
with the express terms of CCP §473(b). 
 
The Motion is DENIED without prejudice due to Plaintiff’s
failure to attach a copy of a pleading proposed to be filed therein as required
by CCP §473(b). The terms of the code are mandatory; compliance is not
optional.
