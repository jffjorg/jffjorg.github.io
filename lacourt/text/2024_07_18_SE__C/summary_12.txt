The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to Defendant Sunbeam Products, Inc.'s ex parte application to advance the hearing for its Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Request for Admissions, and Special Interrogatories. The motions were originally scheduled for April 2, 2025, but the Judge has GRANTED the Defendant's application and advanced the hearing to September 19, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. The Defendant argues that it needs the information sought in the discovery requests in order to seek removal to federal court, and the Judge has taken this into consideration in granting the application. The Judge orders the moving party to give notice of the new hearing date.
