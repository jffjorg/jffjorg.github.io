And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is issued by the judge regarding the case 23NWCV03491, Guttalu v. Pye. The defendant, Marisela Yaneth Diaz Pacheco, has filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint, but it is now moot as the plaintiff has filed a First Amended Complaint on February 22, 2024, before the deadline for the opposition. Additionally, the defendant's motion to strike portions of the complaint is also moot as no motion to strike has been filed or lodged with the court. The judge notes that a party may amend its pleading once without leave of court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before the demurrer or motion to strike is heard. Therefore, the demurrer and motion to strike are placed off-calendar as moot.
