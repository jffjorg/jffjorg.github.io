(Khoury v. Maly's of Calif. Inc.)
  - "The basic elements of unlawful detainer for nonpayment of rent contained in CCP ยง1161(2) are: (1) the tenant is in possession of the premises; (2) that possession is without permission; (3) the tenant is in default for nonpayment of rent; (4) the tenant has been properly served with a written three-day notice; and (5) the default continues after the three-day notice period has elapsed." (Kruger v. Reyes)

Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the unlawful detainer action brought by PIP 4221 BANDINI, LLC and CLINE B INDUSTRIAL HOLDINGS against SCREAMLINE INVESTMENT CORPORATION, ADW, INC., AUL PIPE & TUBING, INC., and DOES 1 through 10. The Defendant, SCREAMLINE INVESTMENT CORPORATION, had filed a demurrer to the Complaint, arguing that the pleading is fatally uncertain and that the Plaintiff failed to incorporate sufficient facts in the pleading. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the pleading is clear and that the Defendant understands what the Plaintiff is alleging. The judge has also found that the Complaint sufficiently alleges the elements of unlawful detainer, including that the Defendant is in possession of the premises, possession is without permission, the Defendant is in default for nonpayment of rent, the Defendant was properly served with a written three-day notice, and the default continues after the three-day notice period has elapsed. The Defendant is ordered to answer the Complaint within five days.
