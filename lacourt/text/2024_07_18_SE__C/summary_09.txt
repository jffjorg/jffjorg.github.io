The Plaintiff's Counsel failed to appear for a Case Management Conference, resulting in the dismissal of the Complaint. The Plaintiff then moved to set aside the dismissal, but failed to comply with the requirements of CCP §473(b) by not attaching a copy of the proposed pleading or amended complaint to the Motion. The Judge has ordered the Plaintiff to lodge a First Amended Complaint by July 15, 2024, and the hearing has been continued to July 18, 2024. The Motion is denied without prejudice due to the Plaintiff's failure to comply with the requirements of CCP §473(b).
