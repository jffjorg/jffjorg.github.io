Plaintiff JENNIFER TU’s unopposed Motion to Set Aside
Dismissal under CCP §473(b) is CONTINUED to Thursday, July 25, 2024
at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
No Opposition filed as of July 15, 2024.  
 
This personal injury action was filed by Plaintiff on August
21, 2023. On May 30, 2024, Plaintiff’s Complaint was dismissed without
prejudice due to Plaintiff’s Counsel’s second failure to appear without good
cause for a Case Management Conference and OSC Re: Dismissal of the Entire
Action for Plaintiff’s Failure to Appear on 03/28/24. (See 05/30/24 M.O.) 
 
Plaintiff moves to set aside the dismissal under CCP
§473(b). 
 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted….” (emphasis
added.) (CCP §473(b).) 
The Motion is DENIED without prejudice for failure to comply
with the express terms of CCP §473(b). 
 
There is no proposed pleading or proposed amended complaint
attached to subject Motion. 
 
The Motion is CONTINUED as indicated above due to
Plaintiff’s failure to attach a copy of a pleading proposed to be filed therein
as required by CCP §473(b). The terms of the code are mandatory; compliance is
not optional. Plaintiff is ORDERED to file and serve a Proposed First Amended
Complaint by no later than July 19, 2024.
