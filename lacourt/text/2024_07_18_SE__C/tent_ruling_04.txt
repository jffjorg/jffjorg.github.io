Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
WILLIAM BROTHERS BUILDING & CONSTRUCTION’s Demurrer to
Defendant/Cross-Complainants’ Cross-Complaint is OVERRULED. 
 
 
Opposing
Party to give notice. 
 
This
action for breach of contract was filed by Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant WILLIAM
BROTHERS BUILDING & CONSTRUCTION (“Cross-Defendant”) on March 16, 2023. 
 
On
September 15, 2023, the subject Cross-Complaint was filed by
Defendants/Cross-Complainants RATHA ENG and MARCUS MCGRATH.
(“Cross-Complainants”) 
 
Cross-Defendant’s
request for judicial notice of the Complaint, which attaches the Home
Improvement Contracts and Settlement Agreement, is GRANTED with respect to the
existence and legal effect of these documents. However, the Court does not take
judicial notice of the reasonably disputable assertions of fact contained
therein. 
 
Cross-Defendant
generally demurs to each cause of action contained in
Defendants/Cross-Complainants’ Cross- Complaint on the ground that
Cross-Complainants released their right to enforce any causes of action against
Cross-Complainants pursuant to a Settlement Agreement that contains a Covenant
not to Sue, entered into on or about December 2022. Cross-Defendant argues that
Cross-Complainants claims are barred under the Settlement Agreement. 
 
The
demurrer is OVERRULED. Cross-Complainants allege that they signed the
Settlement Agreement under duress, and were “forced to sign [the] settlement.”
(XC ¶¶34-36.) Whether the settlement agreement serves to extinguish all of
Cross-Complainants’ claims requires factual proof. Although Cross-Defendant is
free to assert the Settlement Agreement as an affirmative defense, it does not
bar the action, on demurrer, as a matter of law.
