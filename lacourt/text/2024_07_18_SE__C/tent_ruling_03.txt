Moving party to give notice. 
 
This manufacturing
defect action was filed on August 17, 2022. Plaintiff moves to compel
Defendant’s further responses to RFA (set three) and SI (set three). 
In Opposition,
Defendant argues that no meaningful meet and confer occurred over supplemental
responses served sometime in November 2023.  
The Court
is not persuaded that counsel have exhausted their meet and confer obligations
pursuant to the Code. Counsel are advised that their meet and confer efforts
should go beyond merely sending letters stating their respective positions.
(See Townsend v. Superior Court (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1431, 1439.) “A
determination of whether an attempt at informal resolution is adequate…involves
the exercise of discretion. The level of effort at an informal resolution which
satisfies the ‘reasonable and good faith attempt’ standard depends upon the
circumstances. In a larger, more complex discovery request, a greater effort at
informal resolution may be warranted. In a simpler, or more narrowly focused
case, a more modest effort may suffice. The history of the litigation, the
nature of the interaction between counsel, the nature of the issues, the type
and scope of the discovery requested, the prospects for success and other
similar factors can be relevant. Judges have broad powers and responsibilities
to determine what measures and procedures are appropriate in varying
circumstances.” (Obregon v. Sup. Ct. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.) 
 
Counsel are
instructed to further meet and confer on the issues outlined in the subject
Motions. 
 
Counsel are
ORDERED to make further efforts to
resolve the issues presented. If, after exhausting those efforts, court
intervention is needed, counsel may appear and argue the merits on the
continued hearing date. If counsel are unable to informally resolve their
discovery disputes, then counsel are instructed to submit a JOINT STATEMENT
outlining the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is required. The
joint statement must be FILED on or before Friday, October 11, 2024. 
 
The Court
notes that there are 4 additional Motions to Compel Further scheduled to be
heard on September 4, 2024. Counsel are encouraged to make good faith efforts
to meet and confer in an effort to informally resolve the outstanding discovery
disputes.
