The judge noted that the information to be derived from the outstanding discovery is important to the plaintiff's opposition and that the motion is potentially dispositive against the moving party. The judge also noted that the parties agree that the motion is potentially dispositive against the moving party and that the interests of justice favor adjudicating the matter on the merits. The judge ordered that a supplemental opposition and supplemental reply may be filed and served per code in accordance with the new hearing date.
