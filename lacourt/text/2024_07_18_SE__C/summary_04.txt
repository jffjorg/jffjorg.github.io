And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

In this case, William Brothers Building & Construction (Cross-Defendant) filed an action for breach of contract against Ratha Eng and Marcus McGrath (Cross-Complainants). Cross-Complainants filed a Cross-Complaint in response. Cross-Defendant argued that the Cross-Complaint was barred by a settlement agreement that contains a covenant not to sue, which was signed by Cross-Complainants in December 2022. However, the court ruled that the settlement agreement does not bar the action as a matter of law, and that whether it extinguishes all of Cross-Complainants' claims requires factual proof. The court granted Cross-Defendant's request for judicial notice of the existence and legal effect of the settlement agreement and related documents, but did not take judicial notice of reasonably disputable assertions of fact. The demurrer to the Cross-Complaint was therefore overruled, and Cross-Complainants will be given notice.
