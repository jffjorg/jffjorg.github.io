[1] Plaintiff’s counsel states that
Mr. Shah has held himself out as Defendants’ attorney.  However, beyond Plaintiff’s counsel’s
assertion, Plaintiff does not provide evidence of Mr. Shah’s request for
extension on Defendants’ behalf.  


[2] Code of Civil Procedure section
283 states, “An attorney and counselor shall have authority: 1. To bind
his client in any of the steps of an action or proceeding by his agreement
filed with the Clerk, or entered upon the minutes of the Court, and not
otherwise.”  (CCP, § 283(1).)  Code of Civil Procedure section 284 provides:
“The attorney in an action or special proceeding may be changed at any time
before or after judgment or final determination, as follows: 1. Upon the
consent of both client and attorney, filed with the clerk, or entered upon the
minutes; 2. Upon the order of the court, upon the application of either
client or attorney, after notice from one to the other.”  If Defendants have obtained new counsel,
Defendants should be prepared to explain why the appropriate filings have not
been submitted to the court.
