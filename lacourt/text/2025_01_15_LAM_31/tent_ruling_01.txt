I.          BACKGROUND
 
Leland Regent Properties (“Leland”) is the owner of the real
property commonly known as 6731 Leland Way, Los Angeles, California, 90028 (the
“Property”).   On or about March 8, 2023,
Leland entered into a written Purchase Agreement with Custom Design Fur
Corporation dba LAApartments.Biz (“CDF”) for the Property.  Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, CDF, by
way of an advance on its behalf by CDF’s sister company LA Brea AP, LLC,
deposited money into escrow to be applied to the purchase price.  Wilshire Escrow Company (“Wilshire Escrow”)
was the escrow holder.  However, the sale
was not completed.  CDF did not approve
certain contingency items under the Purchase Agreement within the specified
time.  Leland did not approve the return
of CDF’s deposit which is still being held by Wilshire Escrow.  
 
Leland filed its Complaint against CDF (erroneously sued as
La Brea AP, LLC) for Breach of Contract. 
CDF, in turn, filed its Cross-Complaint against Leland and Wilshire
Escrow for Breach of Contract and Damages to Recover Monies Held in Escrow.  
 
The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  The court heard argument on the cross-motions
on April 29, 2024.  After argument, the
court found in favor of CDF.  The court
adopted its tentative ruling granting CDF’s Motion for Summary Judgment.  Judgment was entered in CDF’s favor on
September 12, 2024.
 
On October 31, 2024, Leland filed a Notice of Appeal of the
court’s April 26, 2024 order.  
 
On November 8, 2024, CDF filed this Motion to Fix Attorney’s
Fees As Costs pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1702, and Civil Code section 1717.
 
The motion is unopposed.
 
II.        DISCUSSION
& LEGAL STANDARD
 
             CDF moves the court
for an order fixing attorney’s fees as costs in the amount of $95,987.50, plus
$4,650.00 for the costs incurred in filing this motion and preparing a reply
brief.  
 
A motion for attorney fees is not premature despite the
filing of a notice of appeal.  (Korchemny v. Piterman (2021) 68
Cal.App.5th 1032, 1052.)  In any event, an award of attorney fees as costs
is a collateral matter which is embraced in the action but is not affected by
the order from which an appeal is taken.  (Id.)  Consequently,
filing a notice of appeal does not stay any proceedings to determine the matter
of costs and does not prevent the trial court from determining a proper award
of attorney fees claimed as costs.  (Id.)
            
Given the foregoing, and the lack of opposition filed, the
court finds CDF’s request for attorney fees in the amount of $95,987.50, plus
$4,650.00 for the costs the filing of this motion were reasonably
incurred.  
            
III.       CONCLUSION 
 
Accordingly, CDF’s Motion to Fix Amount of Attorney’s Fees As
Costs is GRANTED. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
