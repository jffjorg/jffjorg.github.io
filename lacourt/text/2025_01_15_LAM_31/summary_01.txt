And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion filed by Custom Design Fur Corporation dba LAApartments.Biz (CDF) to fix the amount of attorney's fees as costs in the amount of $95,987.50, plus $4,650.00 for the costs incurred in filing the motion and preparing a reply brief. The motion is unopposed.

The court notes that a motion for attorney fees is not premature despite the filing of a notice of appeal. An award of attorney fees as costs is a collateral matter that is not affected by the order from which an appeal is taken.

Given the lack of opposition and the reasonable amount of attorney fees claimed, the court finds that CDF's request for attorney fees is reasonable and should be granted.

Accordingly, CDF's Motion to Fix Amount of Attorney's Fees As Costs is GRANTED.
