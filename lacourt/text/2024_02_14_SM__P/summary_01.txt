```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling dismisses Gabriel Justin Smith's cross-complaint with leave to amend within 10 days. The cross-complaint is devoid of factual allegations, making it impossible for the court to determine the basis for Smith's causes of action. The plaintiff, Robert Chun, demurred to the cross-complaint and moved to strike Smith's request. Since the entire cross-complaint is subject to demurrer, the motion to strike damages requests is moot.
