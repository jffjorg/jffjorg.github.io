Robert Chun v.
Gabriel Justin Smith, Case No. 22SMCV01932
Hearing Date February
14, 2023
Demurrer to
Gabriel Justin Smith’s Cross-Complaint (UNOPPOSED)
 
Plaintiff Chun
alleges defendant Smith and unnamed Doe defendants approached him outside a
friend’s residence. Chun alleges Smith “swung his hand at [Chun’s] face.” Complaint
pg. 1. The form complaint is vague as to whether Smith actually struck Chun. 
 
Smith filed a
cross-complaint including causes of action for indemnification, apportionment
of fault, declaratory relief, and “intentional tort.” Chun demurs and moves to
strike Smith’s request. On February 7, 2024 Chun filed a notice of non-receipt
of opposition, and no papers opposing the motion have been filed with the
court.
 
 The cross-complaint is devoid of any factual
allegations. The court cannot determine the basis for any of the causes of
action alleged. A demurrer to the entire pleading is therefore proper.
 
SUSTAINED with ten
days leave to amend. 
 
Since the entire
cross-complaint is subject to demurrer, the motion to strike damages requests
is MOOT.
