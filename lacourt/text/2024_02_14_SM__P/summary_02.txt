Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies defendants' motion to maintain a stay pending appeal and grants plaintiffs' motion to clarify that no stay is in effect. The court concludes that the new legislation (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §1294) does not impose new liability for past conduct and does not substantially affect existing rights and obligations. The court finds that the statute establishes new rules for the conduct of litigation going forward and can be applied to existing cases without violating the presumption against retroactivity. The court also concludes that the statute does not deprive defendants of their substantive right to attempt to pursue arbitration. The court lifts the stay pending appeal and declines to impose a discretionary stay, as doing so would foil the purpose of the statute.
