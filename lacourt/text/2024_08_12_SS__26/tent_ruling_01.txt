ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff Toby Lee Jones (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for motor vehicle negligence against Defendants Maya
Kuriel, Yaacov Kuriel, and Jee Kuriel (“Defendants”) on March 18, 2020. The
case was not at issue until Defendants filed an answer on May 10, 2023. On
February 20, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ motions to compel Plaintiff’s
initial responses to discovery requests. (Minute Order, 02/20/24.) The Court
also granted Defendants’ Motion for Order Compelling Further Responses to
Requests for Production, Set One, and Request for Sanctions on March 25, 2024.
(Minute Order, 05/25/24.) Plaintiff was ordered to serve further responses and
pay sanctions within 20 days’ notice of the ruling. (Ibid.) 
 
Defendants filed the instant Motion for Evidentiary Sanctions on June 6,
2024. No opposition to the instant Motion has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Where a party willfully
disobeys a discovery order, courts have discretion to impose terminating,
issue, evidence or monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subds.
(d), (g); R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) Here, Defendants request evidence sanctions with respect
to the discovery requests to which Plaintiff was required to respond.
Specifically, Demand for Identification and Inspection of Documents, Set One,
No. 3 asked Plaintiff to produce “Any and all WRITING(s) which support or tend
to support your claim that you suffered property damage which you allege is a
result of the incident which gives rise to the above-captioned lawsuit,
including, but not limited to, repair estimates, appraisals, expert witness
reports, or evidence of payment for repair of any claimed property damage.”
(Motion, Rickett Decl., Exh. A, p. 8:20-25.) Notice of the Court order
compelling Plaintiff’s further response was served on April 1, 2024. (Motion,
Rickett Decl., ¶9 and Exh. B.) Plaintiff has failed to serve a further response
as ordered, despite a meet and confer effort by defense counsel. (Id. at
¶¶10-11 and Exhs. C-D.) 
 
The Court finds Plaintiff’s non-compliance to be willful and
subject to the requested evidence sanctions. Despite notice of the Court’s
ruling, Plaintiff failed to serve responses as ordered. Nor has Plaintiff filed
an opposition to this noticed motion. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants Maya
Kuriel, Yaacov Kuriel, and Jee Kuriel’s Motion for Evidentiary Sanctions is
GRANTED. DOCUMENTATION RESPONSIVE TO DEMAND FOR IDENTIFICATION AND INSPECTION
OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE, NO. 3, SERVED ON PLAINTIFF TOBY LEE JONES ON MAY 16,
2023, IS EXCLUDED FROM  TRIAL.
