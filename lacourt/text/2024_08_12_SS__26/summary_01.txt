And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion for evidentiary sanctions, excluding documentation from trial. The defendants had requested sanctions due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with a discovery order. The plaintiff was ordered to serve further responses to discovery requests, but failed to do so despite a meet and confer effort by defense counsel. The judge finds the plaintiff's non-compliance to be willful and subject to evidence sanctions. The judge grants the motion and orders the documentation responsive to demand for identification and inspection of documents, served on the plaintiff on May 16, 2023, to be excluded from trial.
