And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Maurice Leiter in a case between plaintiff Peter Raspudic and defendants Buxbaum & Chakmak, Buxbaum Chakmak & Wynder PC, and Charles Lyon Zetterberg. The case involves allegations of breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, intentional misrepresentation, and fraud.

The defendants demurred to the first and second causes of action, arguing that they are barred by the one-year statute of limitations for attorney malpractice actions. The plaintiff argues that the claims are not barred because the underlying action was not settled until November 30, 2022. The court finds that the claims are not clearly and affirmatively barred by the statute of limitations and therefore overrules the demurrer.

The defendants also demurred to the fraud causes of action, arguing that the plaintiff has failed to allege any intentional misrepresentation. The plaintiff alleges in detail that the defendants concealed deadlines, discovery obligations, sanctions, and conflicts of interest, which is sufficient to allege intentional misrepresentation and/or concealment. The court finds that the demurrer is overruled.

The defendants moved to strike the claim for punitive damages, arguing that the plaintiff has failed to allege fraud, malice, or oppression. The court finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged fraud and therefore denies the motion to strike.

The court orders the defendants to file and serve answers to the first amended complaint within 30 days of notice of ruling.
