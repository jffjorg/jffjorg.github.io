And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Bye Bye Bye Bye House, Inc.'s Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens. The motion was granted because the plaintiff, Peter Sjostrand, failed to meet his burden to establish the probable validity of his real property claims. The court found that the plaintiff's claims for "Cancelation of a written instrument" and quiet title were not supported by evidence, and that the plaintiff had failed to rebut Bye Bye's claim to be a bona fide purchaser.

The court also granted Bye Bye's Request for Judicial Notice, and sustained Bye Bye's objections to the declaration of Peter Sjostrand. The court ordered the plaintiff to pay attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $5,440, as provided in California Code of Civil Procedure section 405.38.

The judge's ruling is based on the following reasoning: the plaintiff's lis pendens failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure sections 405.20 and 405.22, and the plaintiff had failed to establish the probable validity of his real property claims. The court also found that Bye Bye had established that it was a bona fide purchaser, and that the plaintiff had failed to meet his burden to rebut this claim.
