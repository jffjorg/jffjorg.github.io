And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees and costs in part. The plaintiff, Omar Valdivia, brought a lawsuit against General Motors, LLC for defects in a 2018 Chevrolet Equinox. The judge has awarded the plaintiff $28,176.50 in attorney fees and $2,320.01 in costs, for a total of $30,496.51.

The judge disagrees with General Motors' argument that the motion is untimely, as the settlement agreement between the parties explicitly provides that the plaintiff shall file a request for dismissal once the issue of outstanding attorney fees and costs is resolved.

The judge has reduced the amount of attorney fees sought by the plaintiff, finding that some of the hours billed are duplicative or excessive. The judge has also reduced the amount of costs sought by the plaintiff, finding that some of the costs are unreasonable.

The judge has awarded attorney fees to the plaintiff's counsel, Robert Aguilar, Jessica Anvar, Jordan Cohen, Diana Rivero, and Lara Rogers, at the following hourly rates: $200, $550, $525, $490, and $415, respectively. The judge has also awarded costs to the plaintiff, including filing fees associated with the plaintiff's motions to compel and proofs of service.

The judge has denied General Motors' request to cut the plaintiff's costs as unreasonable, finding that any motion to strike or tax costs must be filed and served 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. In this case, General Motors failed to file and serve its motion challenging the plaintiff's cost memorandum in a timely manner.
