BACKGROUND
 
This case arises in the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
Plaintiff Omar Valdivia alleges he purchased a 2018 Chevrolet Equinox
manufactured and/or distributed by Defendant General Motors, LLC. The complaint
alleges Plaintiff’s vehicle contained several defects including defective
condition system, electrical system, body system, transmission system, ignition
system, and defective engine which Defendant failed to repair or repurchase
despite knowledge of the vehicle suffering from those defects. 
 
Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant on September 8,
2022.

Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney Fees and
Costs is GRANTED, in part. 
 
evidentiary OBJECTIONS
 
In Reply, Plaintiff submits objections
to the declaration of Ryan Kay submitted in support of Defendant General
Motors, LLC’s opposition. 
 
Plaintiff’s objections 1 – 9 are
OVERRULED. 
 
discussion
 
Plaintiff moves the court for an order awarding Plaintiff attorney
fees and costs in the sum of $38,994.51. Plaintiff makes the motion on the
grounds that Plaintiff is the prevailing party on the Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act claim at issue in this lawsuit and as a result, is entitled to an
award of attorney fees, costs and expenses. 
 
Under the Song-Beverly Act, Civil Code section 1794(d) “If the
buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by
the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate
amount of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees based on actual time
expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer
in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” The
lodestar method of calculating fees is appropriate in motions for attorney’s
fees under Civil Code section 1794. (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers
of California, Inc (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 818.) 
 
Plaintiff seeks $38,994.51 in attorney fees and costs for 76.6
hours spent by their attorneys litigating this case through this instant motion,
an anticipated six hours or $2,940.00 for the anticipated fees incurred in
litigating Plaintiff’s fee motion, and $2,320.01 in costs. Plaintiff contends
Counsel’s efforts in this matter were necessary given GM’s denial of liability.
Counsel seeks this amount for the following attorney/paralegal hours and rates:

 
            Robert Aguilar –
Paralegal - $200/hr – 13.2 hours – Total: $2,640.00
            Jessica Anvar –
Sr. Associate - $550/hr – 1.3 hours – Total: $715.00
            Jordan Cohen –
Partner - $525/hr – 0.3 hours – Total: $157.50
            Diana Rivero –
Partner - $490/hr – 61 hours – Total: $29,890.00 
            Lara Rogers –
Attorney - $415 – 0.8 hours – Total: $332.00
 
GM opposes the motion on several grounds. GM first argues the
court should deny Plaintiff’s motion as untimely. GM contends when Plaintiff
accepted GM’s settlement offer, the time limits for Counsel to file this
instant fee motion started to run and pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1702, a fee motion must be served and filed within 60 days after notice of
entry of judgment or 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is first. (CRC
Rule 3.1702(b)(1); 8.104(a)(1)). 
 
The court disagrees. While a settlement may be deemed a judgment
in certain instances, the Settlement Agreement here explicitly provides that
“[o]nce the issue of outstanding attorneys’ fees and costs is resolved by way
of settlement or court order, plaintiff shall file a Request for Dismissal[.]”
None of the legal authority provided by GM address this issue of interpreting
the word “judgment” and Rule 3.1702 and rather, are inapposite or not on point.
To deny this motion would then essentially allow GM to withdraw from the
obligations of the instant Settlement Agreement.  Moreover, the stipulation filed by the parties
on June 6, 2024 included a stipulation by defendant that plaintiff is “entitled
to attorney’s fees,” and that plaintiff could not bring that motion for fees
until the action had been dismissed. 
Defendant cannot now take a position contrary to the language it
consented to as part of that stipulation. 

 
Next, GM argues the fees incurred are unreasonable and excessive.
GM asserts, for example, from September 2023 to September 2024, Counsel has filed
a total of 97 fee motions against GM. However, most of those motions are
templates and have fundamentally remained the same. GM contends it should not
have to continue to pay for the same “work” time and time again. Moreover, many
of the hours billed are clearly unnecessary, padded, and unsupported. For
example, Counsel seeks 13.2 hours ($2,640.00) of paralegal work that was for
clerical work and not even recoverable. Another example includes duplicative
work where Counsel had multiple attorneys perform the same tasks, which amount
of 3.1 hours or $1,464.50 of the attorney fees sought. 
 
The court agrees some of the attorney fees sought are either
duplicative or excessive. The court notes GM misstates the footnote in Missouri
v. Jenkins by Agyei (1989) 491 U.S. 274, 288. GM states that clerical work
completed by a paralegal is not recoverable as attorney fees. In Missouri,
however, the court noted clerical or secretarial tasks should not be billed at
a paralegal rate. Rather, such non-legal work may just command a lesser rate. Moreover,
this federal case is non-binding. 
 
Upon reviewing Plaintiff’s billing records, the court reduces the
amount of requested attorney fees as follows:
 
The court strikes $620 of the $2,640.00 sought for work done by
Paralegal Robert Aguilar. The court finds the work duplicative. 
 
The court strikes $2,940.00 of the $29,890.00 sought for work by
Attorney Diana Rivero on discovery. The court notes while discovery in lemon
law actions involve different vehicles and each action is particularized by
each vehicle and the issues presented, billing this many hours for repetitive
work is excessive. 
 
The court strikes 2.7 of the 9.7 hours spent drafting the motions
to compel, as excessive and unreasonable given the boilerplate nature of most
of the documents presented, for a further reduction of $1323.   
 
The court also found the attorney time spent on the memorandum of
costs to be duplicative, excessive and unnecessary.  There is no justification for having an
attorney and a paralegal (billing collectively at nearly $700 per hour) to bill
 5.1 hours for this simple task.  The court 
will not grant fees to counsel for work that could and should have been
done by the paralegal, or 2.4 hours at $490 per hour, for a further reduction
of $1176.
 
The court finds the rest of the work performed by Jessica Anvar,
Jorden G. Cohen, and Lara Rogers reasonable. 
 
Hourly Rate
 
GM also opposes the motion on the grounds Counsel failed to show
the reasonableness of its rates. GM contends Counsel does not present any
evidence that their declared hourly rates—Ms. Anvar ($550), Ms. Rogers ($415),
Mr. Cohen ($525), and Ms. Rivero (490)—are “reasonable rates in the local community.”
Moreover, the hourly rates approved for Counsel in 2023 were consistently
lower, when this action took place in 2022 and 2023. 
 
The court disagrees. The hourly rates sought are reasonable. Generally,
a reasonable hourly rate is prevailing in the community where the case is
litigated for similar work. (PLCM Group v. Dexter (2000) 22 Cal.4th 15
1084, 1095 ["PLCM"]; MBNA America Bank, N.A. v. Gorman (2006)
147 16 Cai.App.4th Supp. 1, 13.) Plaintiff has submitted evidence of hourly
rates charged consistent with what Counsel seeks based on the same level of
experience. The fact that the rates charged during the previous years were less
when Plaintiff first initiated this action does not make the request
unreasonable. 
 
Costs
 
GM also seeks to cut Plaintiff’s costs as unreasonable including
filing fees associated with Plaintiff’s motions to compel, proofs of service,
case management statements and so on. 
 
The court finds the challenge to the costs to be too late. Any
motion to strike or tax costs must be filed and served 15 days after service of
the Cost Memorandum plus any additional days for the manner of service. (Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).) In this case, GM needed to file and serve its
motion challenging Plaintiff’s Cost Memorandum 17 days after June 6, 2024 (15
days plus 2 for electronic delivery), i.e., June 24, 2024. GM never did so. As
no timely challenge was made, the sought costs must be entered as a judgment.
(Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(4).)  
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorney Fees and Costs is GRANTED in the REDUCED AMOUNT of $28,176.50
plus costs of $2,320.01 for a TOTAL of $30,496.51.
