And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to transfer the trial to the Santa Monica Courthouse. The plaintiff argued that the trial should be moved to Santa Monica because the jurors would be more familiar with the location of the incident and have a greater interest in the outcome of the case. The plaintiff also argued that the convenience of witnesses would be promoted by moving the trial to Santa Monica, as some of the witnesses would be from the area where the incident occurred. However, the judge found that the plaintiff failed to make a showing that the venue is improper. The judge noted that the incident occurred within the City of Los Angeles, which includes the Van Nuys area, and that there would likely be more jurors from the City of Los Angeles who would be familiar with the area. The judge also found that the convenience of witnesses is not a factor to consider under Code of Civil Procedure section 397. As a result, the judge denied the motion and ordered that the trial will proceed in the Van Nuys Courthouse.
