And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The reasons for the denial include: 1) the partnership agreement is in Spanish and no translation has been provided, 2) the Doe defendants have not been dismissed, 3) there is no provision in the agreement for attorney fees, and 4) the plaintiff has not provided evidence or explanation of the damages claimed. The plaintiff is seeking $89,000 in damages, but the evidence provided is insufficient to support this claim. The court will require more evidence and a clearer explanation of the damages before considering the application again.
