And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal. The plaintiff's counsel failed to calendar the final status conference and trial dates, leading to the dismissal. The plaintiff argues that January 21, 2024 fell on a Sunday and thus was entitled to file the motion on Monday, January 22, 2024. However, the court disagrees, stating that the plaintiff should have filed the motion earlier to avoid being late. The court rules that the six-month time limit for filing the motion has expired, and the plaintiff's late filing is not excusable. The court denies the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal.
