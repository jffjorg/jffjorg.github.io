Here is the English-text summary:

The court has reviewed the petition to approve the compromise of a disputed claim made on behalf of a minor, Maya Benshalom, who is represented by a guardian ad litem. The court finds the settlement reasonable but has not granted the petition due to the lack of attached reduction agreements or final medical bills and the failure to serve the defendant, Ralphs Grocery Company, with the petition. As a result, the court continues the hearing for 30 days and orders the parties to file a supplemental document attaching the missing documents and proof of service on the defendant.
