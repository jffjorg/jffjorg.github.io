  Case Number:  22STCV30669    Hearing Date:   April 19, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiffs
Douglas Knight and Vicki Knight’s Motion for Leave to File Second Amended
Complaint
Plaintiffs Douglas Knight and Vicki Knight
move for leave to file a second amended complaint.  Courts have
discretion to permit an amendment to any pleading “in furtherance of justice,
and on any terms as may be proper.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(a)(1).)  “This discretion should be
exercised liberally in favor of amendments, for judicial policy favors
resolution of all disputed matters in the same lawsuit.”  (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court
(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.)  
No party has opposed plaintiffs’
motion.  Century Rooter and Jetting
Service, Inc., the plaintiff in related case No. 22STCV33976, filed a nominal “opposition”
that agrees plaintiffs should be permitted to file the second amended
complaint.
Plaintiffs Douglas Knight and Vicki Knight’s
motion for leave to file second amended complaint is granted.  Plaintiffs Douglas Knight and Vicki Knight
shall file the proposed second amended complaint attached as exhibit 2 to their
motion forthwith.
