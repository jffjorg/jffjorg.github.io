And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to enforce the settlement agreement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The agreement was reached through a series of letters between the plaintiff's counsel and the defendants' insurance carrier, in which the carrier accepted a settlement proposal. However, the judge notes that the agreement does not meet the requirements of section 664.6, as the acceptance was signed by a representative of the insurance carrier rather than either of the defendants. Therefore, the judge denies the motion to enforce the settlement agreement under the summary procedure of section 664.6. The defendants may still seek to enforce the agreement through other means, such as a separate civil action or a motion for summary judgment.

## English Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to enforce a settlement agreement under Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6. While the parties engaged in settlement negotiations and the defendants' insurance carrier accepted plaintiff's proposal, the agreement lacks the necessary signatures for enforcement under the statute. Specifically, the acceptance letter was not signed by either defendant, nor by their attorney, preventing it from satisfying the statutory requirements for a binding agreement.

The judge acknowledges that the settlement agreement may be enforceable through other legal means, but this ruling specifically addresses the defendants' motion under Section 664.6 and denies it.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the Defendants' motion to enforce a settlement agreement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 is GRANTED. The settlement agreement was made between the Plaintiff and the Defendants' insurance carrier, and the Defendants are seeking to enforce it. However, the judge has determined that the settlement agreement does not comply with the requirements of section 664.6, as it was not signed by both parties and their attorneys. The judge has therefore denied the motion to enforce the settlement under the summary procedure of section 664.6. The settlement agreement may or may not be enforceable through other means, and a party seeking to enforce it must proceed through other means, such as a separate civil action or a motion for summary judgment.

In this tentative ruling, the Judge grants Defendants Shahrokh Javidzad and Laleh Javidzad's Motion to Enforce Settlement in the case 21STCV36319. The Judge's decision is based on the information presented before today regarding a motor vehicle collision that occurred on or about July 27, 2020, on or near Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. Plaintiff Cahleb Cartier filed a Complaint against Defendants and Does 1 through 50, asserting one cause of action for negligence. Defendants filed their answers on October 28, 2021, and March 14, 2022. Plaintiff's counsel sent a settlement proposal on April 24, 2023, which was accepted by Defendants' insurance carrier two days later. However, Plaintiff has refused to sign the release and dismissal, taking the position that the case is not settled. Defendants filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, which the Judge grants. The Judge denies the motion due to non-compliance with the statutory requirements, but notes that the settlement agreement may or may not be enforceable through other means.
