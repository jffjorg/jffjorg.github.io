And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to enforce the settlement agreement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The agreement was reached through a series of letters between the plaintiff's counsel and the defendants' insurance carrier, in which the carrier accepted a settlement proposal. However, the judge notes that the agreement does not meet the requirements of section 664.6, as the acceptance was signed by a representative of the insurance carrier rather than either of the defendants. Therefore, the judge denies the motion to enforce the settlement agreement under the summary procedure of section 664.6. The defendants may still seek to enforce the agreement through other means, such as a separate civil action or a motion for summary judgment.
