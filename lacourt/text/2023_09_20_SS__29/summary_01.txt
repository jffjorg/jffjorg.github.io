And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion of Defendant Adriatica International, Inc. for a determination of good faith settlement. The causes of action in Plaintiff's complaint against Adriatica are dismissed pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement between the parties. The causes of action in the Cross-Complaint of the City of Redondo Beach against Adriatica are dismissed pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6, subdivision (c).

The court finds that the parties entered into the settlement in good faith, considering the factors set forth in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, 499, including the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of nonsettling defendants. The court also notes that Adriatica has a strong argument that its potential liability is minimal, and the agreed to settlement amount of $15,000.00 is fair and reasonable.
