English text:
The tentative ruling in Case Number 21STCV00584, scheduled for a hearing on September 20, 2023 in Dept 29, grants the motion of Defendant Adriatica International, Inc. (“Adriatica”) for a determination of good faith settlement. The causes of action in Plaintiff’s complaint against Adriatica are dismissed pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement between the parties. The causes of action in the Cross-Complaint of the City of Redondo Beach against Adriatica are dismissed pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6, subdivision (c). The ruling is based on the complaint filed by Plaintiff Rosenda Ramirez Clark on January 7, 2021, against Defendants City of Redondo Beach, Rudolfo Garcia Muro, Magdalena Garcia, Maderos Cocina Mexicana Restaurant, Adriatica International Inc., Jesus Manuel Gonzalez Cornejo, Martha Coronel, and Santiago Coronel, alleging premise liability and motor vehicle negligence. The City filed a cross-complaint against Muro, Garcia, the Restaurant, Adriatica, the Coronels, and Cornejo, alleging causes of action for total equitable indemnity, partial equitable indemnity, declaratory relief, and express indemnification. Adriatica filed a cross-complaint against Cornejo and Martha Coronel, alleging causes of action for total equitable indemnity, comparative indemnity and contribution, negligence, and declaratory relief. Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed Muro, Garcia, and the Restaurant from her complaint, and City dismissed these same parties from its cross-complaint. Adriatica filed a motion for summary judgment, which Plaintiff failed to oppose. When the matter came for a hearing on July 11, 2023, Plaintiff and Adriatica represented that they had reached an agreement resolving the dispute between them. Adriatica filed the instant motion for good faith settlement determination, which is unopposed. The court's determination is based on the legal standard set forth in Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 877.6(a)(1), which provides that any party to an action wherein it is alleged that two or more parties are joint tortfeasors or co-obligors on a contract debt shall be entitled to a hearing on the issue of the good faith of a settlement entered into by the plaintiff or one or more alleged tortfeasors or co-obligors. A determination by the court that the settlement was made in good faith shall bar any other joint tortfeasor or co-obligor from any further claims against the settling tortfeasor or co-obligor for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault. Although a determination that a settlement was in good faith does not discharge any other party from liability, it shall reduce the claims against the others in the amount stipulated by the settlement. The party asserting the lack of good faith shall have the burden of proof on that issue. The court considered the factors identified in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, including a rough approximation of plaintiffs' total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and a recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial, the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling defendants, as well as the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of nonsettling defendants. The court found that the settlement amount is fair and reasonable, and there is no evidence of the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of nonsettling defendants.

## Case Summary: 21STCV00584

**Case Number:** 21STCV00584
**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023
**Department:** 29

* **Plaintiff:** Rosenda Ramirez Clark
* **Defendant:** Adriatica International, Inc. ("Adriatica")
* **Other Named Parties:** City of Redondo Beach, Rudolfo Garcia Muro, Magdalena Garcia, Maderos Cocina Mexicana Restaurant, Jesus Manuel Gonzalez Cornejo, Martha Coronel, Santiago Coronel

**Facts:**

* This is a wrongful death case stemming from an incident where Decedent George Arthur Clark was struck by a vehicle while leaving Maderos Cocina Mexicana Restaurant in Redondo Beach, California.
* Plaintiff alleged premise liability against Adriatica, arguing that Adriatica created a dangerous condition by obstructing the view of exiting vehicles.
*  Adriatica filed a motion for summary judgment, which Plaintiff did not oppose, leading to a dismissal of Plaintiff's claims against Adriatica.
* Subsequently, Plaintiff and Adriatica reached a settlement agreement for $15,000.00.

**Legal Issues:**

* **Good Faith Settlement:** Adriatica moved for a determination that the settlement was made in good faith under California Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6.
* **Burden of Proof:** The burden of proof for lack of good faith lies with the party asserting it.

**Judge's Reasoning:**

* The court found that the settlement amount of $15,000.00 was reasonable in light of Adriatica's potential liability, which was minimal due to evidence suggesting the driver's view was not obstructed.
*  No evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed at harming non-settling defendants was presented.
* The motion was unopposed.

**Ruling:**

* The court granted Adriatica's motion for a determination of good faith settlement.
* The causes of action against Adriatica in Plaintiff's complaint and the City of Redondo Beach's cross-complaint were dismissed.


## English Summary

The judge ruled that the settlement agreement between Plaintiff Rosenda Ramirez Clark and Defendant Adriatica International, Inc. was made in good faith.  

The judge found that the $15,000 settlement amount was reasonable considering Adriatica's limited liability in the case. There was little evidence suggesting Adriatica was responsible for the accident, and the settlement did not seem disproportionate to Adriatica's potential responsibility.  Since no one opposed the settlement, the judge granted Adriatica's request and dismissed the related lawsuits against them.
