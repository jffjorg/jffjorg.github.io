 Case Number:  21STCV22177    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
 
The motion is DENIED without
prejudice.
 
Background 
 
On June 14, 2021, Plaintiffs Lourdes Juarez Acatitla and
Ruben Tapia Rincon filed a complaint against Defendants Brandon Ladd Pritzkat,
Cosme Eliseo Coj, and Does 1 through 50 (“Defendant”) stemming from an automobile
accident that occurred on February 7, 2020, at or near the intersection of
South Mariposa Avenue and West 11th Street in Los Angeles,
California. 
 
On February 22, 2022, Plaintiffs amended their complaint
to name Steven Diethelm as Doe 1.
 
On April 6, 2022, Defendants Pritzkat and Diethelm filed
their answer to the complaint.
 
Defendant Coj has not answered the complaint or otherwise
appeared in this action.
 
Plaintiffs noticed the deposition of Defendant Coj for
December 7, 2022; July 17, 2023; and then July 24, 2023.  Coj did not appear, and on July 24 Plaintiffs
took a certificate of non-appearance.
 
On July 31, 2023, Plaintiffs moved for an order
compelling Defendant Coj to appear for his deposition.  No opposition to the motion has been filed.
  
Legal
Standard 
 
Any party may obtain discovery …
by taking the oral deposition of any person, including any party to the action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.)
Where a party objects to the deposition, the
proper remedy is an objection under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410.
If such an objection is made within three calendar days before the deposition
date, the objecting party must make personal service of that objection. (Code
Civ. Proc. 2025.410, subd. (b).) 
CCP section¿2025.450(a)
provides:¿“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . .
. , without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any
document . . . described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document . . . described in the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.450(a).) 
 
CCP section¿2025.450(b) provides:¿“A
motion under subdivision (a)… shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the
deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or
things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”¿ (Id.,
§ 2025.450(b).) 
  
Discussion 
 
Plaintiffs’ motion
is denied.  Defendant Coj has never appeared
in this action.  He was not served with a
subpoena or deposition notice.  And he
was not served with notice of this motion.
 
Plaintiffs have a right to take
his deposition, of course, but first they must properly serve him with notice
of the deposition (and a subpoena if he has not appeared).  And if he does not appear, and Plaintiffs
move to compel, they must properly serve him with notice of the motion.  Accordingly, the motion is denied without
prejudice.
 
Finally, the Court also notes
that a motion to compel a deposition of a party must be accompanied by a
declaration showing that the moving party has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.
 
Conclusion 
 
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel the deposition of Defendant
Coj is DENIED without prejudice. 
 
Moving parties are ordered to give notice.
