## English Summary

This tentative ruling by the Judge denies Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendant Coj's deposition without prejudice. 

The Judge explains that Plaintiffs have the right to take Defendant Coj's deposition. However, they must first properly serve him with notice of the deposition and, if he fails to appear, with notice of the motion to compel.  Because Defendant Coj was not properly served with either notice, the motion is denied. 

The Judge also notes that a motion to compel a deposition must be accompanied by a declaration showing that the moving party contacted the deponent to inquire about the non-appearance.
