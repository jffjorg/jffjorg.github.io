 Case Number:  21STCV36319    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
 
Defendant
Shahrokh Javidzad and Laleh Javidzad’s Motion
to Enforce Settlement is GRANTED. 
 
Background 
 
On October 1, 2021, Plaintiff
Cahleb Cartier (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants Shahrokh
Javidzad, Laleh Javidzad (collectively, “Defendants”), and Does 1 through 50,
inclusive, asserting one cause of action for negligence, arising out of a motor
vehicle collision that occurred on or about July 27, 2020, on or near Wilshire Boulevard
in Los Angeles, California.
 
Defendants filed their answers on
October 28, 2021, and March 14, 2022.
 
On April 24, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel sent a letter to Defendants’ insurance carrier containing a detailed
settlement proposal.  (Hillier Decl., ¶ 3
& Exh. A.)  Two days later, on April
26, a representative of the insurance carrier responded by letter and accepted
the proposal.  (Id., ¶ 4 &
Exh. B.)  That same day, Defendants’
counsel sent Plaintiff’s counsel a draft release and dismissal.  (Id., ¶ 5 & Exh. C.)  The next day, Defendants took two discovery
motions off calendar.  (Id., ¶ 6
& Exh. D.)  Plaintiff has refused to
sign the release and dismissal, however, and has taken the position that the case
is not settled.  (Id., ¶¶ 7-10.) 
 
On August 15, 2023, Defendants filed this motion to enforce the
parties’ settlement agreement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.  Plaintiff filed an opposition on September 6,
and on September 12 Defendants filed a reply.
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides: 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement. 
(b) For purposes of this section, a
writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the following:
(1) The party.
(2) An attorney who represents the party.
(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is authorized in writing by the
insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf. 
Because of the
summary nature of a proceeding to enforce a settlement agreement under section
664.6, and because settlement of a lawsuit implicates a substantial right of a
litigant, strict compliance with the statutory requirements is required. 
(J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985; Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37.)  Before the Legislature amended the statute effective
as of January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6
meant the litigants themselves, not their attorneys.  (See Levy v.
Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.)  In any event, however,
for a settlement agreement to be enforceable under section 664.6, all “parties”
(as that term is defined in the statute) must sign, including the party seeking
to enforce the agreement and the party against whom enforcement is
sought.  (J.B.B. Investment Partners, supra, 232 Cal.App.4th at p. 985.) 
 
If the settlement leaves material terms wanting, or confusing, the
settlement cannot be enforced through the section 664.6 summary
proceeding.  (Compare Terry v. Conlan (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1445
[finding parties never agreed to the means that were material to the
settlement, including what role an independent manager was to play regarding
management of a trust property, and whether the trust should be qualified as a QTIP,
thereby indicating that there was no meeting of the minds as to the material
terms] with Osumi v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355 [holding trial
court’s decision to extend closing date for vendor’s agreement to repurchase
house did not create a material term and was within court’s power because the
closing date had passed by the time the motions came on for hearing and a new
closing date was necessary to grant the relief sought by both parties].)  Nonetheless, when the “parties intend that an agreement be
binding, the fact that a more formal agreement must be prepared and executed
does not alter the validity of the agreement.” (Blix St.
Records, Inc. v. Cassidy (2010)
191 CA4th 39, 48.)  
 
It is possible that the parties may have an
enforceable settlement agreement that is not subject to the summary enforcement
proceedings of section 664.6 (including, for example, an
enforceable oral agreement to settle or an agreement that is signed by an
authorized representative who has the power to bind the party but is not listed
in subdivision (b) of the statute).  In
those circumstances, a party seeking to enforce the agreement must proceed
through other means, such as a separate civil action, an amendment to the
answer to add a new affirmative defense, and/or a motion for summary judgment,
rather than through the summary procedures of section 664.6.  (See generally Weddington Productions v.
Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809.)
 
Discussion
 
Defendants move to enforce a settlement
agreement with Plaintiff under the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6.  Defendants contend that
the exchange of letters between Plaintiff’s counsel and their insurer, taken together,
establish an offer and an acceptance, and therefore an enforceable
contract.  (See Hillier Decl., Exhs. A-B.)
 
A review of the exhibits does not, however, show compliance with the
requirements of section 664.6.  Under
subdivision (b) of the statute, there are three options regarding who may sign
a settlement agreement: (1) the party; (2) the attorney for a party; or (3) if
the insurance carrier is a party, an authorized representative of the insurer.
 
Here, the offer (Exhibit A) is signed by Plaintiff’s attorney.  That meets the requirements of section 664.6,
subdivision (b)(2).
 
The acceptance (Exhibit B), however, is signed by Austing Gorban, a
member of the claims department of the insurance carrier.  It is not signed by either Defendant (much
less both of them), and so subdivision (b)(1) of the statute is not satisfied.  It is not signed by Defendants’ attorney, and
so subdivision (b)(2) is not satisfied.  And
the insurance company is not a party, and so subdivision (b)(3) does not apply.
 
Absent strict compliance with the requirements of the statute, the
Court cannot grant enforcement of the settlement agreement under Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6.  (J.B.B.
Investment Partners, supra, 232
Cal.App.4th at p. 985.)
 
The
settlement agreement may or may not be enforceable through other means, but Defendants’
motion to enforce the settlement under the summary procedure of section 664.6
is denied.
 
Conclusion 
 
The Court DENIES Defendants’ motion. 
 
Moving parties
are ordered to give notice.
