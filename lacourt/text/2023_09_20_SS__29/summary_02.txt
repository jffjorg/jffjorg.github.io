Summary:
The tentative ruling by the Judge is that defendant's motions to compel responses to discovery requests are granted in part, and defendant's request for sanctions is granted in part. The defendant served discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production, on the plaintiff, and the plaintiff never responded. The plaintiff had health issues, but there was enough time to respond. The discovery cutoff is based on the initial trial date, but the discovery deadlines were extended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The plaintiff argues that the discovery is unduly burdensome, but the court finds nothing excessive in the discovery requests. The court strikes one request for documents related to the plaintiff's legal status. Monetary sanctions are awarded against the plaintiff in the amount of $1,080 ($360 per motion multiplied by three motions). The plaintiff is ordered to provide verified, code-compliant responses to the defendant's discovery requests within 30 days of notice of this order.
