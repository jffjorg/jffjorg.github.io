## Case Summary:

**Case Number:** 21STCV10256
**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023
**Department:** 29

**Plaintiff:** Tova Fagan, Barry Fagan, Noah Fagan
**Defendant:** Paul Nichole Lawry 

**Background:**

* The Plaintiffs allege they were injured in a car accident on December 11, 2020, caused by the Defendant.
* The Defendant served discovery requests (interrogatories and requests for production) on the Plaintiffs on September 14, 2022.
* The Plaintiffs failed to respond to these requests.

**Motions:**

* The Defendant filed three motions to compel responses to discovery:
    * Form Interrogatories (Set One)
    * Special Interrogatories (Set One)
    * Request for Production (Set One)
* The Defendant also requested monetary sanctions against the Plaintiffs.

**Plaintiff's Arguments:**

* The Plaintiffs cited illness for themselves and their attorney as a reason for the late responses.
* They argued that the discovery cutoff date had passed based on an initial trial date in September 2022.
* They claimed the discovery requests were unduly burdensome.

**Court's Ruling:**

* **Motions to Compel:** GRANTED in part. The Court found the Plaintiffs' arguments insufficient and ordered them to provide responses to the discovery requests.
* **Request for Production No. 12:** STRUCK by the Court on its own motion. This request sought information about the Plaintiff's legal status, which the Court deemed irrelevant, prejudicial, and an invasion of privacy.
* **Sanctions:** GRANTED in part. The Court awarded monetary sanctions against the Plaintiffs in the amount of $1,080 ($360 per motion) due to their unsuccessful opposition to the motions to compel and lack of substantial justification.

**Orders:**

* The Plaintiffs are ordered to provide verified, code-compliant responses to the Defendant's discovery requests within 30 days of notice of the ruling.
* The Plaintiffs are ordered to pay the Defendant monetary sanctions of $1,080 within 30 days of notice of the ruling.

**Significant Statements:**

* The Court emphasized that the discovery cut-off date was extended due to the COVID-19 pandemic and continuance of the trial date.
* The Court found the discovery requests to be reasonable and not unduly burdensome.


## English Summary:

The judge largely granted the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiff to respond to discovery requests.  The judge found the plaintiff's reasons for not responding to be insufficient and awarded the defendant monetary sanctions for the plaintiff's failure to comply.  However, the judge struck one discovery request that asked for information about the plaintiff's legal status, finding it irrelevant and an invasion of privacy.
