The Court grants the motions to compel, ordering Plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant responses to the discovery requests within 30 days. The Court also strikes Defendant's Request for Production No. 12, which asks for documents related to Plaintiff's legal status, as it is an unwarranted invasion of privacy.

As for sanctions, the Court grants Defendant's request in part, ordering Plaintiff to pay Defendant monetary sanctions in the total amount of $1,080. The Court finds that Plaintiff has not acted with substantial justification and that the imposition of sanctions would not be unjust. The Court awards sanctions of $360 per motion, calculated based on counsel's billing rate and the filing fee.
