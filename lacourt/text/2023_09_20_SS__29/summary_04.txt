The motion was filed by Cross-Complainants Variel Villa Apartments LLC and Property Management Associates Inc. and is unopposed. The court found that the two cases are not related and are pending in different departments, which is a requirement for consolidation. The court also noted that the motion was not filed in the Muniz Action, as required. The court's decision is based on the California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a), which defines related cases, and Los Angeles Superior Court rule 3.3(g)(1), which prohibits consolidation unless the cases are in the same department.

## English Summary:

The judge is denying a motion to consolidate two lawsuits, the Boukhanian Action (21STCV26832) and the Muniz Action (22STCV01081). Both cases stem from the same fire that occurred in December 2020. Although all parties agree that the cases involve common questions of law and fact, the judge cannot consolidate them because they are assigned to different court departments. The judge previously denied a request to relate the cases and assign them to the same department, and the motion to consolidate does not comply with local court rules by not being filed in both cases.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to consolidate the Boukhanian Action (Case No. 21STCV26832) and the Muniz Action (Case No. 22STCV01081). The motion was filed by Cross-Complainants Variel Villa Apartments LLC and Property Management Associates Inc., who argued that the two cases arise out of the same fire and involve much of the same evidence, documents, and witnesses. However, the judge found that the cases are not in the same department, and therefore cannot be consolidated. The judge also noted that the motion to consolidate was not filed in the Muniz Action, as is required. Despite the parties' stipulation for consolidation, the judge rejected it on the ground that the cases have not been determined to be related.

English text:
The motion to consolidate cases 21STCV26832 and 22STCV01081 was denied by the Judge in Department 29 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The two cases involve Plaintiff David Boukhanian, Defendants Variel Villa Apartments LLC, Property Management Associates Inc., and DOES 1 through 50, and other people named Kathryn Muniz and Stephen Thompson. The cases arise out of a fire that occurred on December 11, 2020. On July 21, 2021, Plaintiff David Boukhanian filed a Complaint for negligence and premises liability against Defendants. In response, Defendants filed a Cross-Complaint against David Boukhanian for breach of contract and negligence. On August 1, 2023, Plaintiff David Boukhanian filed a Request for Dismissal of the complaint in the Boukhanian Action with prejudice, which was granted by the Court. The Cross-Complaint in the Boukhanian Action remains pending. On August 21, 2023, Cross-Complainants Variel Villa Apartments LLC and Property Management Associates Inc. filed a Motion to Consolidate the Boukhanian Action and the Muniz Action, which was denied by the Court. The motion did not comply with the requirement to file it in both cases. The cases cannot be consolidated unless they are in the same department, and the Court previously considered and denied a request to relate the cases and assign them to the same department.
