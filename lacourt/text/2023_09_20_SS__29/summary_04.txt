And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

On September 20, 2023, the court issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to consolidate the Boukhanian Action (Case No. 21STCV26832) and the Muniz Action (Case No. 22STCV01081). The motion was filed by Cross-Complainants Variel Villa Apartments LLC and Property Management Associates Inc. and is unopposed. The court found that the two cases are not related and are pending in different departments, which is a requirement for consolidation. The court also noted that the motion was not filed in the Muniz Action, as required. The court's decision is based on the California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a), which defines related cases, and Los Angeles Superior Court rule 3.3(g)(1), which prohibits consolidation unless the cases are in the same department.
