The motion was filed by Cross-Complainants Variel Villa Apartments LLC and Property Management Associates Inc. and is unopposed. The court found that the two cases are not related and are pending in different departments, which is a requirement for consolidation. The court also noted that the motion was not filed in the Muniz Action, as required. The court's decision is based on the California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a), which defines related cases, and Los Angeles Superior Court rule 3.3(g)(1), which prohibits consolidation unless the cases are in the same department.

Although all parties agree that the cases involve common questions of law and fact, the judge cannot consolidate them because they are assigned to different court departments. The judge previously denied a request to relate the cases and assign them to the same department, and the motion to consolidate does not comply with local court rules by not being filed in both cases.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to consolidate the Boukhanian Action (Case No. 21STCV26832) and the Muniz Action (Case No. 22STCV01081). The motion was filed by Cross-Complainants Variel Villa Apartments LLC and Property Management Associates Inc., who argued that the two cases arise out of the same fire and involve much of the same evidence, documents, and witnesses. However, the judge found that the cases are not in the same department, and therefore cannot be consolidated. The judge also noted that the motion to consolidate was not filed in the Muniz Action, as is required. Despite the parties' stipulation for consolidation, the judge rejected it on the ground that the cases have not been determined to be related.

**Case Number:** 21STCV26832

**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023

**Dept:** 29

**Tentative Ruling:** The motion to consolidate is DENIED.

### Background

* July 21, 2021: Plaintiff David Boukhanian filed a Complaint against Defendants Variel Villa Apartments LLC, Property Management Associates Inc., and DOES 1 through 50 for negligence and premises liability due to a fire on or about December 11, 2020 (the "Boukhanian Action").
* September 22, 2021: Variel Villa Apartments LLC and Property Management Associates Inc. (Cross-Complainants) filed a Cross-Complaint against David Boukhanian for breach of contract and negligence.
* January 11, 2022: Plaintiffs Kathryn Muniz and Stephen Thompson filed a Complaint against Defendants Property Management Associates Inc., Variel Villa Apartments, LLC, and Does 1 through 20 in Case No. 22STCV01081 (the "Muniz Action") for various claims relating to the same fire.
* Cross-Complainants filed a Cross-Complaint against David Boukhanian and Roes 1 through 25 for indemnity and declaratory relief.
* August 25, 2022: Cross-Complainants filed a Notice of Related Case regarding the Boukhanian Action and the Muniz Action.
* November 2, 2022: The Court entered an order finding the cases were not related.
* August 1, 2023: Plaintiff David Boukhanian filed a Request for Dismissal of the Complaint in the Boukhanian Action with prejudice.
* August 21, 2023: Cross-Complainants filed a Motion to Consolidate the Boukhanian Action (Case No. 21STCV26832) and the Muniz Action (Case No. 22STCV01081).

### Legal Standard

* A pending civil case is related to another if the cases (1) involve the same parties and are based on the same or similar claims, (2) arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact, (3) involve claims against, title to, possession of, or damages to the same property, or (4) are likely for other reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a)).

### Discussion

* The motion to consolidate is denied because the Boukhanian Action and the Muniz Action are not in the same department and the motion was not filed in the Muniz Action as required.

### Conclusion

* The motion to consolidate is DENIED.

**Moving parties to give notice.**
