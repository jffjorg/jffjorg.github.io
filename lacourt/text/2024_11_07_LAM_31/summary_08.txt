And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for reconsideration of the order dismissing her appeal. The defendant's motion is procedurally deficient because the Second Appellate District issued the order dismissing her appeal, and this court lacks jurisdiction to reconsider that order. The defendant's appeal was dismissed for failure to cure the default, and she has not filed a reply to the plaintiff's opposition. The judge is denying the motion for reconsideration and order the plaintiff to give notice.
