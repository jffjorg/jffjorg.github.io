MOTION
FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
The Regents of the University of California
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Arami
Cheyenne Walker
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This case
arises from the alleged unauthorized use of photographic images.  On March 2, 2023, Plaintiff, Arami Cheyenne
Walker,[1]
filed a Complaint against Defendant, The Regents of the University of
California (erroneously sued as Board of Regents, University of California),
alleging causes of action for: (1) Appropriation (Civil Code section 3344); (2)
Breach of Contract; and (3) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress.¿ 
 
As alleged, Plaintiff was a student University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA).  On May
28, 2015, Plaintiff was approached by a photographer at UCLA to take images of
her.  Plaintiff agreed and the
photographer, Elena Zhukova, took a few images and asked for Plaintiff to sign
a release. The release authorized use of the images so long as they were not
defamatory. Years later, on March 20, 2020, Plaintiff learned that UCLA Giving was
using her photographic image as part of a funding campaign in response to Covid-19.
 Plaintiff claims this use of her
likeness was unauthorized and defamatory within the meaning of the release.
 
            Defendant
demurred to all three causes of action in the Complaint.  On September 12, 2023, the Court sustained
the demurrer in its entirety with leave to amend.
 
            On September
26, 2023, Plaintiff timely filed the First Amended Complaint (FAC).  
Defendant demurred to the FAC.  On December 15, 2023, the court sustained
Defendant’s demurrer.  The court granted
leave to amend as to Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim.  Leave to amend was denied as to Plaintiff’s appropriation
and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims.
 
            On January
3, 2024, Plaintiff timely filed the Second Amended Complaint (SAC).  The SAC asserts causes of action for Breach
of Contract (Promissory Estoppel), and an “Appropriation and Invasion of
Privacy 2022” claim. 
 
            On February
5, 2024, Defendant filed a Demurrer to the SAC and concurrently filed a Motion
to Strike the “Appropriation and Invasion of Privacy 2022” claim in the SAC.
            
On April 10, 2024, the court overruled the demurrer and
granted the motion to strike without leave to amend.  
 
On April 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed the Third Amended
Complaint (TAC) alleging causes of action for Promissory Estoppel and Unjust
Enrichment.
 
On May 8, 2024, Defendant filed a Motion to Strike the
TAC.  
 
On July 31, 2024, the court granted the motion to strike the
TAC.  Plaintiff was directed to serve and
file an amended pleading which conformed with the court’s April 10, 2024,
order.
 
On July 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative Fourth
Amended Complaint which alleges the sole cause of action for Promissory Estoppel.
 
On August 29, 2024, Defendant filed a Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings.
 
On October 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.
 
On October 31, 2024, Defendant filed a reply.
 
II.           LEGAL STANDARD
 
“A motion for judgment on the
pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks
only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be
judicially noticed.  [Citations.]”  (Burnett v. Chimney Sweep
(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1057 1064.)  The court must assume the truth of all
properly pleaded material facts and allegations, but not contentions or
conclusions of fact or law.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318; Wise v. Pacific Gas and Elec. Co. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 725,
738.)  “A judgment on the pleadings in favor of the defendant is
appropriate when the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(3)(B)(ii).)”  (Kapsimallis
v. Allstate Ins. Co. (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 667, 672.)  “Presentation
of extrinsic evidence is therefore not proper on a motion for judgment on the
pleadings. [Citation.]”  (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp.
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.)  “The common law ground for a motion for
judgment on the pleadings is identical to the statutory ground[.]” (Korchemny
v. Piterman (2021) 68 Cal.App.5th 1032, 1055.)  Allegations are to be liberally
construed.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.)   
 
If the motion for judgment on the
pleadings is granted, it may be granted with or without leave to amend. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (h)(1).)  “Where a demurrer is sustained or
a motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted as to the original complaint,
denial of leave to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion if the pleading
does not show on its face that it is incapable of amendment.”  (Virginia
G. v. ABC Unified School Dist. (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1848, 1852
(emphasis added).) 
 
III.         DISCUSSION
Plaintiff’s
promissory estoppel claim is barred as a matter of law. “Promissory
estoppel cannot be asserted against a public entity to bypass rules that
require contracts to be in writing or be put out for bids, rules which reflect
a public policy to preclude oral contracts or other exposures to liability,
including claims of promissory estoppel.” 
(Ponte v. County of Calaveras (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 551, 556; see
also Poway Royal Mobilehome Owners Assn. v. City of Poway (2007) 149
Cal.App.4th 1460, 1476 (“promissory estoppel may not be raised against a public
entity when it would defeat the public policy of requiring adherence to
statutory procedures for entering into contracts”]; First Street Plaza
Partners v. City of Los Angeles (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 654, 669 (“No case
has ever held that a city may be bound to a contract by estoppel.”); Dynamic
Industries Co. v. City of Long Beach (1958) 159 Cal.App.2d 294, 299 (“When
the charter provision has not been complied with, the city may not be held
liable in quasi contract, and it will not be estopped to deny the validity of
the contract.”); see also Kajima/Ray Wilson v. Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (2000) 23 Cal.4th 308, 316 (“‘neither
the doctrine of estoppel nor any other equitable principle may be invoked
against a governmental body where it would operate to defeat the effective
operation of a policy adopted to protect the public’”).
Here,
Defendant is a public entity.  “‘Public
entity’” includes the state, the Regents of the University of
California, the
Trustees of the California State University and the California State
University, a county, city, district, public authority, public
agency, and any other political subdivision or public corporation in the
State.”  (Gov. Code, § 811.2.)  Plaintiff cannot maintain her promissory
estoppel claim against Defendant.  Further,
having so concluded, it is clear from the face of the pleading
that Plaintiff cannot successfully amend her pleading.  (See Virginia
G., supra, 15 Cal.App.4th at p. 1852.) 
IV.        CONCLUSION
            
Based on the foregoing, the Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings is GRANTED.  Leave to amend is
DENIED.
 
Defendant to give notice.
