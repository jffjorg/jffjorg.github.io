And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and denied the Plaintiff's request for leave to amend. The Plaintiff has alleged a promissory estoppel claim against the Defendant, The Regents of the University of California, alleging that the Defendant used her photographic image without permission and that she suffered emotional distress as a result.

The court has ruled that the Plaintiff's promissory estoppel claim is barred as a matter of law because the Defendant is a public entity and cannot be held liable under promissory estoppel. The court has also ruled that the Plaintiff cannot successfully amend her pleading to assert a viable claim.

The Defendant is a public entity and is not liable for the unauthorized use of the Plaintiff's photographic image. The court has granted the Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings and denied the Plaintiff's request for leave to amend.
