MOTION
FOR RECONSIDERATON



 
MOVING PARTY:                   Defendant
Billie Lee Sgroi-Proffitt
 
RESPONDING PARTY:      Plaintiff
Nicholas Butta
 
 
I.          FACTUAL AND
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 
 
            On August 30,
2018, Plaintiff, Nicholas Butta, filed the instant action against Defendant,
Billie Lee Sgroi-Proffitt (Defendant) and Does 1 through 50.  On October 30, 2020, Plaintiff filed the
Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”), which added Karen Proffitt and Annette
Proffitt Productions as defendants and reduced the number of Doe defendants to
20.  The SAC asserts causes of action for
(1) Defamation, (2) Public Disclosure of Private Facts, (3) Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress, (4) Conversion, (5) Unjust Enrichment, (6) Declaratory
Relief, (7) Declaratory Relief, (8) Money Had and Received, and (9) Mistaken
Receipt.  Defendant is self-represented.
 
On February 27, 2024, the court entered default judgment
against Defendant and in favor of Plaintiff. 

 
On April 22, 2024, Defendant filed a Notice of Appeal from
the order entering default judgment. 
 
On June 4, 2024, the clerk of the court issued a Notice of
Default to Defendant. 
 
On October 3, 2024, the Second Appellate District dismissed
Defendant’s appeal for failure to cure the default.
 
On October 15, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for
reconsideration of the October 3, 2024, order dismissing her appeal.
 
On October 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.
 
Defendant did not file a reply.
 
II.           DISCUSSION & LEGAL STANDARD
 
            Defendant’s
motion is procedurally deficient.  “When
an application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and
refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms,
any party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the
party of written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different
facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court
that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the
prior order.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1008, subd. (a), emphasis added.)  
 
            Here, the
Second Appellate District issued the October 3, 2024, order dismissing
Defendant’s appeal.  Accordingly, this
court lacks jurisdiction to reconsider the October 3, 2024 order.
 
III.       CONCLUSION
            The
motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
Plaintiff to give notice.  
 
Dated:   November 7,
2024
