I.          BACKGROUND
 
This is a landlord-tenant
habitability case regarding the Units 6 and 7 at 111 W. Del Amo Blvd., Long
Beach, California. On August 7, 2024, defendants Lynwood Del Capri, L.P., and
Positive Investments, Inc. (hereafter, Moving Party) filed this motion for
leave to file a cross-complaint against defendants Icehouse Ventures V, LLC,
and Mashcole Property Management, Inc. (hereafter Proposed Cross-Defendants). Moving
Party seeks to assert causes of action for express indemnity, equitable
indemnity, contribution, breach of contract, and declaratory relief against
Proposed Cross-Defendants.  
 
The motion is unopposed.
 
II.          DISCUSSION & LEGAL STANDARD
A defendant must file a
permissive cross-complaint against the plaintiff at the time the defendant
files an answer to the complaint.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 426.50(a).) All other permissive cross-complaints may be filed at
any time before the first trial date is set. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 428.50(b).) When a cross-complaint is not filed
within these time frames, leave of court is required.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 428.50(b).)
The court may grant leave
to file a permissive cross-complaint in the interest of justice at any time
during the course of the action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 428.50(c).) Thus, the
court may grant leave to file a cross-complaint at any time until judgment is
entered.  (City of Hanford v. Superior
Court (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 580, 587; see also Orient Handel v. United
States Fid. and Guar. Co. (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 684, 701.) Permission to
file a permissive cross-complaint is solely within the trial court’s
discretion.  (Crocker Nat. Bank v.
Emerald (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 852, 864.) 
Here, Moving Party is entitled to leave to file the proposed
cross-complaint.  It is undisputed that
their claims arise out of the same transaction and involve the same property or
controversy.  Accordingly, it would serve
the interests of justice and promote judicial economy to allow Moving Party to
file the proposed cross-complaint.  
 
III.       CONCLUSION
 
            The unopposed
motion is GRANTED.  The cross-complaint
is deemed filed as of this date.  Defendants
Lynwood Del Capri, L.P., and Positive Investments, Inc. are directed to
separately file the cross-complaint within 5 court days of this order.
 
            Moving
party to give notice, unless waived.
