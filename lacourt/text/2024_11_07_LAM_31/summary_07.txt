And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff argues that the defendant's opposition to the motion to compel discovery demands indicates that the defendant has served responses. However, the court finds that the defendant's opposition to the court does not indicate that responses were served, and that the defendant may have served two different oppositions. The court also rejects the plaintiff's contention that the ICA is a qui tam action, as qui tam actions require a private individual to share a portion of any recovered civil penalty with the government, which is not the case here. The court will not grant the requested discovery on other grounds.
