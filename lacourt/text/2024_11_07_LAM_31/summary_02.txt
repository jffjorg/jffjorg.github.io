And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District, to quash and/or modify subpoenas issued to Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital, Concentra Urgent Care, and Kaiser Permanente-Central ROI Unit. The subpoenas seek medical documents from the plaintiff, Jane Doe C.L., related to her alleged injuries.

The judge has granted the motion in part, modifying the subpoenas to seek only records related to the plaintiff's alleged injuries, including depression, severe anxiety, and feelings of mistrust and frustration, sadness, social anxiety, grief, and sleep issues. The court has also denied the motion in part, finding that the subpoenas are not overly broad.

The judge's ruling is based on the plaintiff's privacy and overbreadth arguments against the subpoenas. The court has balanced the plaintiff's privacy interests against the defendant's need for the information and has determined that the records sought are relevant to the litigation. The court has also taken into account the unique facts of the case, including the plaintiff's age at the time of the alleged abuse and the twenty-year time period covered by the subpoenas.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is a significant development in the case, as it allows the defendant to continue its investigation into the plaintiff's alleged injuries while also protecting the plaintiff's privacy to some extent.
