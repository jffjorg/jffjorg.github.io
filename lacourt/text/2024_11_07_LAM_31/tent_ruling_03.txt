As the Court stated in Williams,“Courts must [] place the burden on the
party asserting a privacy interest to establish its extent and the seriousness
of the prospective invasion, and against that showing must weigh the
countervailing interests the opposing party identifies, as Hill requires. What suffices to justify an
invasion will, …, vary according to the context. Only obvious invasions of
interests fundamental to personal autonomy must be supported by a compelling
interest. (Williams, supra, 3 Cal.5th
531, 557.)
