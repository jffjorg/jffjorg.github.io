And here is the summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of A. U. C. v. Aroldo Marroquin, regarding a motion to compel compliance with a November 30, 2023 order. The court has denied the motion to compel and also denied the request for terminating sanctions against the defendant.

The motion was filed by the plaintiff, A. U. C., seeking to compel the defendant, Aroldo Marroquin, to provide objection-free responses to discovery requests. The defendant had previously served responses with objections, but the plaintiff claimed that these responses were not sufficient.

The court found that the defendant had already complied with the discovery requests by serving responses with objections, and that the plaintiff's motion to compel was untimely. The court also found that the plaintiff had not made a sufficient showing to support a request for terminating sanctions.

The court did note that the defendant had raised legitimate third-party privacy concerns, which were unknown to the court when it issued the November 30, 2023 order. Therefore, the court did not impose terminating sanctions.

The court did not order any additional relief, but instead ordered the parties to brief certain issues regarding the scope of discovery and the limits of the discovery process.
