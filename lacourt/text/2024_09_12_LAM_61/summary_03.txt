And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Caesarstone Ltd.'s Motion to Strike Portions of the First Amended Complaint. The court grants the motion to strike language regarding "other stone products to be identified during discovery" because it is improper and does not comply with California law. However, the court denies the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages because it is adequately set forth and meets the requirements for pleading fraud with specificity. The court notes that the allegations of fraudulent concealment and failure to disclose information are similar to those upheld in a previous case, Jones v. ConocoPhillips, and provide sufficient notice to the defendant. The motion to strike is therefore granted as to the language regarding "other stone products to be identified during discovery" and denied as to the prayer for punitive damages.
