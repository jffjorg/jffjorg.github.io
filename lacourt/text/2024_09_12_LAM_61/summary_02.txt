And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is a continuation of a motion for summary adjudication filed by 21326 Ventura, LLC (Plaintiff) against Summitridge Realty, LLC (Defendant). The motion seeks to partition the real property at issue, but the judge finds that the parties have already agreed to sell the property through a letter of intent, which is not a binding commitment. The judge agrees with the Defendant's argument that the motion is moot and that the parties have waived their right to judicial partition. However, the judge also agrees with the Defendant's argument that the motion should be continued pending the resolution of the sale, as it would be a waste of judicial resources to proceed with the partition proceedings.
