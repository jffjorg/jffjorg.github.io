B.)  The latter two dates—January 23, 2024 and April 8, 2024 were dates provided by Plaintiff’s counsel and were dates mutually agreed upon by the parties.  (Jordan Decl., ¶4, Ex. C.)On January 23, 2024, Plaintiff failed to appear for his properly noticed deposition.  Contact was made with Plaintiff’s counsel in order to ascertain the reason for Plaintiff’s failure to appear. Plaintiff’s counsel advised that we would not appear and he has not had contact with Plaintiff. Counsel for Defendants advised Plaintiff’s counsel that she would move forward with the deposition and obtain a Certificate of Non-Appearance.  (Jordan Decl., ¶5, Ex. D.)Plaintiff’s deposition noticed for April 8, 2024, was taken off calendar by mutual agreement of the parties.  (Jordan Decl., ¶6, Ex. E.)On May 21, 2024, Defendants filed the instant motion to compel deposition of Plaintiff.  As of June 14, 2024, no opposition has been filed. Motion to Compel Deposition Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (a), provides: “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”¿Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 subdivision (b) requires that any motion under subdivision (a) set forth specific facts showing good cause and a meet and confer declaration or, when a deponent fails to attend the deposition, a declaration stating the moving party contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.¿The Court shall impose sanctions on the party that unsuccessfully makes or opposes the motion unless it finds that the losing party acted with substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., §2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)DiscussionOn December 6, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel’s office provided available deposition dates, including January 23, 2024, at 2:00 p.m.  (Jordan Decl., ¶4, Ex. C.)  Based on this email correspondence, the December 8, 2023 Notice of Deposition provided Plaintiff’s deposition to be taken on January 23, 2024.  (Jordan Decl., ¶3, Ex. B.)  Plaintiff failed to appear at the scheduled start time for the January 23, 2024 deposition.  (Jordan Decl. ¶5.)  Consequently, Defendants’ counsel called opposing counsel to ascertain more information regarding Plaintiff’s absence; Plaintiff’s counsel advised that neither counsel nor Plaintiff would appear and that counsel has not had contact with Plaintiff.  (Jordan Decl., ¶5.)  Defendants’ counsel moved forward with the deposition and obtained a Certificate of Non-Appearance.  (Jordan Decl., ¶5; Ex. D.)  Defendants request monetary sanctions of $1,843.00 against Plaintiff.  This amount represents 3 hours preparing this motion, 1.5 hours reading Plaintiff’s opposition and preparing a reply, and 1.5 hours preparing for and appearing at the hearing, for a total of 6 hours at the hourly rate of $230, plus court reporter’s fees and Certificate of Non-Appearance cost of $463.00. (Jordan Decl., ¶7.) Based on the foregoing, the Court grants Defendants’ motion pursuant to section 2025.450 and orders Plaintiff’s appearance and testimony at deposition within 30 days of this Court’s ruling. The request for sanctions in granted in the amount of $1,153.00 for 3 hours of work at the reasonable hourly rate of $230, plus court reporter’s fees and Certificate of Non-Appearance cost of $463.00.  The request for sanctions is reduced due to the simplicity of the motion and because no opposition was filed and therefore no reply. Conclusion Defendants’ motion is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is to appear for deposition within 30 days of this ruling.  Defendants’ request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,153.00, within 30 days of this ruling. Moving party is ordered to give notice.
