Here is the English text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has denied the Defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment entered on July 21, 2023. The Defendant, Great Host International, Inc., failed to file an answer to the complaint and was subsequently sued by the Plaintiff, Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith LLP, for attorneys' fees in excess of $100,000. The Defendant's president, Ali Zeini, claims to have learned of the default judgment on August 1, 2023, but waited until January 18, 2024, to file the first motion to set aside the default judgment. This motion was denied on February 21, 2024, and the Defendant filed a second motion on May 10, 2024. The Court has denied the second motion, finding that the Defendant failed to demonstrate diligence in pursuing relief and that the delays in filing the motions were unreasonable.
