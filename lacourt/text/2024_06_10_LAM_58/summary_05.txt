And here is the English-text summary:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration, ruling that the arbitration provision in the Acquisition and Release Agreement is enforceable. The plaintiff, Stephen Snyder, had argued that the agreement was unenforceable due to fraudulent inducement, lack of consideration, and unconscionability. However, the court found that the plaintiff had failed to meet his burden of showing the agreement was unenforceable. The court also rejected the plaintiff's arguments that the agreement was procedurally and substantively unconscionable. The court granted the motion to compel arbitration and stayed the matter pending the outcome of arbitration.
