Host International, Inc.  
Case No.:                    23STCV04046
Motion:                       Motion
to Set Aside and Vacate Default Judgment 
Moving Party:             Defendant Great Host International 

Opposing Party:          Plaintiff
Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith LLP

Tentative Ruling:      The
Motion to Vacate and Set Aside Default pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure sections 473, subdivision (d) and 473.5 is denied.  

             
Plaintiff Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard
& Smith LLP (Plaintiff), a law firm, brought this
action against their former client, Defendant Great Host International, Inc.
(Defendant) for failure to pay attorneys’ fees in excess of $100,000.00. 
After Defendant failed to file an Answer, default
was entered against Defendant on May 26, 2023. The Court entered default
judgment on July 21, 2023. 
On January 18, 2024,
Defendant moved to set aside the entry of default
judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (b). Plaintiff opposed the motion. On February 21, 2024,
the Court denied the motion to set aside and vacate the default and default
judgment.
 
         Now, Defendant moves to
set aside and vacate the default and default judgment pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure sections 473, subdivision (d) and 473.5. Plaintiff again opposes the
motion.
 
         The Motion to Vacate and
Set Aside Default is denied. 
         
         Plaintiff’s objections to Defendant’s declaration of Ali Zeini are
ruled as follows: Nos. 1, 6, 9 are sustained, No. 2-3 are overruled, No. 4-5,
7-8 are sustained as to “nor any other officer of Great Host”. 
 
         Further, the Court
sustains Plaintiff’s objection to Defendant’s Supplemental Declaration of Ali Zeini, submitted with Defendant’s reply. The declaration is neither signed
under penalty of perjury nor does it state the place and date of execution. It
is thus not competent evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2015.5; People v.
United Bonding Ins. Co. (1969) 272 Cal.App.2d 441, 446 [rejecting purported
declaration lacking place or date of execution]; Dodge v. Free (1973) 32
Cal.App.3d 436, 444 [undated declaration invalid].)
 
Analysis
 
         Defendant seeks relief
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 473, subdivision (d) and 473.5.
 
         Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (d) provides that the Court may “set aside any void
judgment or order.” Section 473.5, subdivision (a) provides that a party may
serve and file a notice of motion to set aside the default or default judgment
and for leave to defend when “service of a summons has not resulted in actual
notice to a party to defend the action.”
 
            As noted in the prior
motion to set aside, Defendant’s president, Ali Zeini, represents that he
learned that a default judgment in this action had been entered against
Defendant Great Host International, Inc. on August 1, 2023. (Def.’s RJN Ex. A [Zeini
Decl., ¶ 3.) He further states Defendant never received service of the
complaint and summons in this action, and he never authorized Sam Palacios to
accept any documents on behalf of Defendant for the purposes of service. (Def.’s
RJN Ex. A [Zeini Decl., ¶¶ 3-4].) 
            In opposition, Plaintiff argues the
motion to set aside based on Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(d) and 473.5 are untimely. This argument is well taken. 
 
            As a preliminary matter, the motion
to set aside is based on improper service; Defendant does not argue the judgment
is void on its face – at least until reply. However, although the reply asserts the
default judgment is “void on its face” Defendant does not make any argument
challenging the judgment except as to service. 
 
To be sure, a
motion to set aside a judgment void on its face may be brought at any time. (Pittman
v. Beck Park Apartments Ltd. (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1009, 1021.) “In
determining whether an order is void for purposes of section 473, subdivision
(d), courts distinguish between orders that are void on the face of the record
and orders that appear valid on the face of the record but are shown to be
invalid through consideration of extrinsic evidence. ‘This distinction may be
important in a particular case because it impacts the procedural mechanism
available to attack the judgment [or order], when the judgment [or order] may
be attacked, and how the party challenging the judgment [or order] proves that
the judgment [or order] is void.’ [Citation.]” (Pittman, supra, 20
Cal.App.5th at pp. 1020-1021.) Here, Defendant relies on the extrinsic evidence
that “Sam Palacios is a general office employee with no authority to receive
any communications on behalf of Great Host.” (Zeini Decl., ¶ 5.) By relying on
a extrinsic evidence to show the default judgment is invalid, Defendant cannot
claim the default judgment is void on its face. Thus, Defendant’s motion
to set aside is subject to the time limits of Sections 473, subdivision (d) and
473.5.
 
            First, under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, “a party can make a motion
showing a lack of actual notice not caused by avoidance of service or
inexcusable neglect, but such motion must be made no later than two years after
entry of judgment, and the party must act with diligence upon learning of
the judgment.” (Trackman v. Kenney (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 175, 180
[emphasis added]; Code Civ. Pro., § 473.5, subd. (a).) 
 
            Similarly,
“[w]here a party moves under section 473, subdivision (d) to set aside “a judgment
that, though valid on its face, is void for lack of proper service, the courts
have adopted by analogy the statutory period for relief from a default
judgment” provided by section 473.5, that is, the two-year outer limit.” (Trackman
v. Kenney (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 175, 180.) This includes the two-year
outer time limit. (Ibid.) It also includes the “reasonable time” limit.
(Schenkel v. Resnik (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 3-4.) Because the same “reasonable time” language
requiring diligence in the filing of the set-aside motion is found in both
sections 473 and 473.5, courts have held that “the same interpretation should
be given to the reasonable time requirement set forth in both sections.” (Schenkel
v. Resnik, supra, 27 Cal.App.4th Supp. at 4.)
 
            There
is no dispute that this second motion for relief was brought within two years
of the entry of default judgment. Thus, the Court considers only whether the
motion was brought in a “reasonable time” after discovery of the default
judgment. 
 
The determination of a reasonable
time depends upon the circumstances of each case. (Caldwell v. Methodist
Hospital (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1521, 1524 [finding that a three-month
delay in seeking to set aside dismissal of action is unreasonable].)
 
            In
this case, Defendant has not met its burden of showing that it brought this
second motion within a reasonable time. (Younessi v. Woolf (2016) 244
Cal.App.4th 1137, 1145 [a ‘ “moving party ... must show diligence in
making the motion after discovery of the default.” ’]”.) 
 
             Here, as the opposition notes, default judgment
was entered on July 21, 2023. Defendant admitted that it first learned of the
default judgment on August 1, 2023 and filed its first motion under Section 473,
subdivision (b), on January 18, 2024 – 5 months and 18 days or 170 days later.
The motion was denied on February 21, 2024 and, although represented by
counsel, Defendant waited until May 10, 2024 to file the instant motion – an
additional 79 days. 
 
            Despite
this being the second attempt to set aside the default judgment, the moving
papers contain no explanation for this delay in bringing either motion. In
fact, it is only in reply that Defendant attempts to provide some explanation. The
Court sustained the objection to Zeini’s supplemental declaration, and
therefore, the purported explanation is inadmissible.  But even if the Court considered it, Zeini’s declaration
is suspiciously vague and conclusory.[1]
Zeini states that after discovering the default judgment on August 1, 2023, he
travelled abroad on a pre-planned vacation to Lebanon from August 15, 2023 to September
15, 2023. (Zeini Suppl. Decl., ¶ 5.) Then, without providing a specific date,
Zeini states that “Shortly after [his] return, [he] was screened and diagnosed
with skin cancer, for which [he] started receiving treatment on January 3,
2024.” (Id. ¶ 6.) Further, he suggests that no one else in the company
was able to address this default judgment because Great Host’s other corporate
officers, Salim Zeini and Zack Zeny, are Zeini’s children, “so [his] cancer
diagnosis and treatment were disruptive to all of Great Host’s upper
management.” (Id. ¶ 7.) Finally, Defendant asserts that it was also preparing
for trial in the JSS Almonds Matter, which was set for October 2, 2023 – but
notes that on September 29, 2023 the trial was continued to January 2, 2024. (Id.
¶ 8.) 
 
            None
of this reply evidence – even if the Court considered it and credited it – demonstrates
diligence in pursuing relief. Zeini’s supplemental declaration fails to show
that the described incidents significantly interfered with Defendant’s ability
to file a motion, justifying the delay. There are also weeks that are simply
unaccounted for when Defendant had ample time to take action, such as the time
between the discovery of the default judgment and Zeini’s vacation. Far shorter
delays have been held to be unreasonable when there was no satisfactory
explanation for them. (Younessi v. Woolf, supra, 244 Cal.App.4th
at p. 1145 [seven weeks]; Mercantile Collection Bureau v. Pinheiro
(1948) 84 Cal.App.2d 606, 607-609 [two months].)
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion to set aside the entry of default
and default judgment based on Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(d) and 473.5 is denied. 


Conclusion
 
            The motion to set aside the default
judgment is denied.
