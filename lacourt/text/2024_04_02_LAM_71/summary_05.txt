And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment and has instead set a hearing to determine why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel sanctioned. The hearing is scheduled for May 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. The reason for this decision is that the declarant did not provide an adequate, authenticated foundation for the exhibits supporting the amount of damages claimed.
