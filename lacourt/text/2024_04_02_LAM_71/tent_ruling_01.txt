total reduced amount of $25,431.50. 
Plaintiff’s requests for costs is granted in the amount of 3,603.52. 

Plaintiffs Raymundo Flores Silva aka
Raymundo A. Silva (“Silva”) and Mercedes Casillas Pina (“Pina”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
move for an order awarding their attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses pursuant
to a settlement with Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (“AHM”)
(“Defendant”) in the total amount of $41,750.77, comprised of $25,431.50 in
attorneys fees, including a 0.5 lodestar enhancement in the amount of $12,715.75,
for a total of $38,147.25 in attorneys’ fees, and costs in the amount of
$3,603.52.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 1; Civ. Code §1794(d).)  
 
Evidentiary Objections
Plaintiffs’ 3/25/24 evidentiary
objections to the Declaration of Bryan Reynolds (“Reynolds”) are sustained as
to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
 
Background
This is a lemon law action
brought under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“Song-Beverly Act”).  On July 24, 2023, the parties entered into a
Settlement Agreement, whereby the Subject Vehicle would be repurchased for
$52,500.00, and attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses would be decided by motion.  (See Decl. of Kirnos ¶20.)  The parties agreed that attorney’s fees and
costs would be cut off after March 30, 2023 (the date Defendant’s 998 Offer to
Plaintiffs expired) other than time for a motion for attorney’s fees and costs
should one be required (as the time for that motion would have been incurred
even if Plaintiffs accepted the CCP 998 Offer).  (Id.)  The Settlement Agreement included full
restitution of payments made on the Subject Vehicle, and some civil penalties.  (Id.)
On
March 1, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this motion for attorneys’ fees and a
memorandum of costs.  Defendant filed its
opposition on March 20, 2024.  Plaintiffs
filed their reply on March 25, 2024.
 
Discussion
Civil Code §1794(d) provides that a
buyer who prevails in an action under that section, “shall be allowed by the
court to recover as a part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount
of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and the prosecution of such action.” 
Here, Plaintiffs are the prevailing
party per parties’ Settlement Agreement and are entitled to attorneys’ fees.  (See Decl. of Kirnos ¶20.)  Defendant does not contest that Plaintiffs
are the prevailing party.
 
Reasonable
Fees
To calculate
a lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by the Plaintiffs’ counsel. The Supreme Court of California
has concluded that a reasonable hourly lodestar rate is the prevailing rate for
private attorneys “conducting non-contingent litigation of the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1133, emphasis added.)
Roger Kirnos
declares the following hourly rates for attorneys of Knight Law Group: (1)
Roger Kirnos ($550.00/hour); (2) Amy Morse ($350.00-$450.00/hour); (3) Chris
Swanson ($375.00-$500.00/hour); (4) Evelina Chang ($375.00/hour); (5) Elvira
Kamosko ($295.00/hour); (6) Heidi Alexander ($325.00-$350.00/hour); (7) Jacob
Cutler ($425.00-$450.00/hour); (8) Maite Colón ($300.00-$425.00/hour); (9)
Maxwell Kreymer ($200.00-$350.00/hour); (10) Melissa Melero
($225.00-$395.00/hour); (11) Thomas Dreblow ($250.00-$350.00/hour); (12)
Timothy Lupinek ($375.00/hour); and (13) Thach Tran ($350.00-$395.00/hour).  (Decl. of Kirnos ¶¶2, 25-38, Exh. A.)  This rate is appropriate given each the
attorney’s relative experience and qualifications.  (See id.)  Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated their
counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable in their community of practice in their
specialized area of law.
Defendant challenges
Plaintiffs’ counsel’s hourly rates as unreasonable but does not challenge with
the necessary particularity. 
(Opposition, pgs. 5-7.)  The Court
finds Plaintiffs’ counsel’s rates to be reasonable and do not warrant reductions.
 
Billed
Hours
The party
seeking fees and costs bears the burden to show “the fees incurred were
allowable, were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.”  (Nightingale
v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) 
Plaintiffs’ counsel’s
fee recovery is based on the 66.2 hours spent by their litigating this case for
a total of $25,431.50.  (Decl. of Kirnos
¶2, Exh. A at pg. 7.)  Defendant argues
Plaintiffs’ counsel’s billed hours were not reasonably incurred, were block
billed, vague, and duplicative, and therefore should be cut.  (Opposition, pgs. 7-8.)  The Court has reviewed Defendant’s objections
to Plaintiffs’ counsel’s billed hours and does not find Defendant met its
burden in the argument presented in its motion and attempts to expand its
motion by referring to a spreadsheet attached to an exhibit, which the Court
will not review.
Defendant
does not cite to specific examples in its motion of hours that were excessive,
unreasonable and unnecessary, duplicative. Therefore, Defendant did not meet
its burden to challenge these fees.  
Second,
Defendant’s objection to Plaintiffs’ counsel’s block billing refers only to
block billing entries rather than particular dates for particular billing
entries that are block billed. 
Therefore, Defendant did not meet its burden to challenge these
fees.  
Finally,
Defendant’s objection to Plaintiffs’ number of attorneys billing on this case
for “create[ing] additional inefficiencies” is unavailing, as three of the
twelve attorneys who billed on this matter, Jacob Cutler (13.1 hours), Thach
Tran (21.2 hours), and Maxwell Kreymer (10 hours) completed 44.3 of the total
66.2 hours billed in this matter. 
Therefore, Defendant did not meet its burden to challenge these fees.
Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ request for attorneys’ fees is granted in the amount of $25,431.50.
 
Final
Lodestar Determination
The Court
denies Plaintiffs’ request for a 0.5 lodestar multiplier.  Given the routine work done in this case and
the results obtained in this lemon law area, a multiplier is not appropriate.
Any contingency risk factor is already accounted for in the hourly rates, which
the Court has found to be reasonable.
 
Costs
Plaintiffs’
memorandum of costs requests a total of $3,603.52.  Defendant only challenges Plaintiffs’ request
for the costs of deposing Defendant’s PMQ for the amount of $598.65.  (Decl. of Reynolds ¶15, Exh. H.)  However, Plaintiffs’ request for costs of
deposing Defendants’ PMQ is for the March 15, 2023, notice of non-appearance of
Defendant’s PMQ, and is therefore appropriate.
Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ memorandum of costs is granted in the total amount of $3,603.52.
 
Conclusion
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ request
for attorneys’ fees is granted in the amount of $25,431.50. 
Plaintiff’s request for costs is granted in the amount of 3,603.52. 
Plaintiffs’ motion is granted in the reduced total amount of
Moving Party to give notice.
