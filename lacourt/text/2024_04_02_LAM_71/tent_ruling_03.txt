Information Regarding Procedures in Department 71, which requires that “[p]arties
seeking to compel further responses to discovery, must schedule an Informal Discovery
Conference (IDC) before the Court will hear their motions. The Court may deny a
motion to compel further responses to discovery if parties fail to schedule and
complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on the motion.”  (Information Regarding Procedures, pg. 4.)
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion and request for sanctions is denied.
