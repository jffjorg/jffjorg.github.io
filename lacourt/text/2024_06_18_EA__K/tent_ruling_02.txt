[1]              The motion was filed on May 7, 2024
(mail-served May 6, 2024) for a June 18, 2024 hearing. On May 14, 2024,
Defendant’s counsel Douglas Borthwick (“Borthwick”) filed (and mail-served) a
second declaration. On May 24, 2024, Borthwick filed (and mail-served) a third
declaration; this declaration, while timely filed, was not timely served, as pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure § 1005, subdivision (b). On May 28, 2024, Borthwick
filed (and mail-served) an untimely fourth declaration. On June 5, 2024,
Defendant untimely filed (and mail-served) a second declaration. The court will
consider Borthwick’s May 24, 2024 declaration as it was referenced in the
opposition, but will not consider Borthwick’s May 28, 2024 declaration or
Defendant’s June 5, 2024 declaration. The court also declines to consider
Defendant’s June 6, 2024, June 7, 2024 and June 10, 2024 declarations (none of
which were filed concurrently with the June 11, 2024 reply brief) on this
basis. 
 


[2]              Section § 1008, subdivision (b)
provides that “[a] party who originally made an application for an order which was
refused in whole or part, or granted conditionally or on terms, may make a
subsequent application for the same order upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, in which case it shall be shown by affidavit what
application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions
were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed
to be shown. . .”


[3]              As an aside, the court rejects
Plaintiff’s contention that the instant motion was not timely filed under
Section 1008, inasmuch as subdivision (b) does not contain a time limitation.


[4]              If Defendant is seeking
discretionary relief under Section § 473(b) in this instant motion, Defendant’s
failure to comply with Section § 1008 requirements is fatal. (Defendant’s
initial motion was necessarily predicated on discretionary grounds, inasmuch as
it was not accompanied by an attorney affidavit of fault). As well, the court
notes that the motion would be untimely, as it has been filed in excess of 6
months from the August 17, 2023 entry of default.


[5]              In Standard Microsystems Corp.
v. Winbond Electronics Corp. (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 868 (disapproved of by Even
Zohar, supra, 179 Cal.App.4th 868 with respect to its discussion finding a
conflict between Sections 473(b) and 1008), the court held that Section 1008
did not apply to the defendant’s application for mandatory relief under
section 473(b) because the application did not seek reconsideration or renewal
of the defendant’s earlier, failed application for discretionary relief.
Thus, if Defendant were able to show that she is entitled to relief in this
instant motion pursuant to an attorney affidavit of fault, Section 1008 would
not apply inasmuch as her initial motion was made pursuant to the discretionary
relief part of Section 473(b).
