 Case Number:  24PSCV00420    Hearing Date:   June 18, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiffs Adriana Moreno Borrayo
and Jose Ruben Moreno Mojica’s Application for 
Default Judgment is DENIED without
prejudice.
Background   
Plaintiffs Adriana Moreno Borrayo and
Jose Ruben Moreno Mojica (together, “Plaintiffs”) allege as follows:
Plaintiffs’
sister, Elsa Armida Moreno Mojica (“Elsa”), falsified Plaintiffs’ mother’s
signature on a quitclaim deed involving the property located at 1295 Cornelia
St. in Pomona (“subject property”). On January 25, 2024, Elsa sold the subject
property. 
On February 9, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a complaint, asserting
a cause of action against Elsa for:
1.                 
Fraud 
On April 17, 2024, Elsa’s default was entered.
A Case Management Conference is set for June 18, 2024.
Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
Plaintiffs’ default prove-up application is comprised of a
Judicial Council Form CIV-100 “Request for Court Judgment,” a Judicial Council
Form JUD-100 proposed judgment and a six-page “Declaration in Support of
Default Judgment” (“Declaration”). The Declaration reflects non-compliance with
Code of Civil Procedure § 2015.5. Further, Plaintiffs provide no evidence to
the court in support of their assertion that Elsa “falsified signatures of
[their] late mother and sold the property.” (Decl., 1:18-19). Plaintiffs have
not authenticated Exhibits 1 and 2.
