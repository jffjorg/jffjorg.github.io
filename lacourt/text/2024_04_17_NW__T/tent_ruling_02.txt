[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  The Special Motion to Strike the Complaint is
DENIED. The Request for Judicial Notice is GRANTED. The factual discussion here
pertains solely to the pending motion.
The court takes judicial notice
as requested by moving parties but not as to any hearsay contained within those
documents.
Introduction 
Defendants Stephen T. Holzer and
Lewitt, Hackman, Shapiro, Marshall & Harlan, a law corporation (the
"Lewitt Hackman Defendants") move the court for an order striking the
Complaint for Malicious Prosecution filed by Plaintiffs Reuven Justin Cypers
aka Rory Cypers ("Cypers") and Residual Income Opportunities, Inc.
("RIO")(collectively, "Plaintiffs").  
Discussion
The operative Complaint comprises
of a sole cause of action for malicious prosecution. As to Plaintiffs' sole
cause of action, an action for malicious prosecution satisfies the first prong
of standard for an Anti-SLAPP motion. (Citizens of Humanity, LLC v. Ramirez
(2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 117, 127.) Accordingly, the Court focuses on whether
Plaintiffs meet the second prong; e.g., the probability of prevailing on the
merits of their malicious prosecution action and whether Plaintiffs can show
that Lewitt Hackman Defendants (1) commenced the prior action that was
prosecuted to a legal termination in Plaintiffs' favor; (2) was brought (or
continued) without probable cause; and (3) initiated with malice. (Marijanovic
v. Gray, York & Duffy (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 1262, 1270-1271.)
As to probable cause, the
allegations in Plaintiffs' malicious prosecution action and the evidence
submitted in opposition to Lewitt Hackman Defendants' Anti-SLAPP motion contend
and show: 
On October 16, 2017, Joseph R.
Granatelli ("Granatelli"), represented by Lewitt, Gurnick, and
Holzer, filed the complaint for declaratory relief in the related action Case
No. LC106344 well after Lewitt Hackman Defendants' learned the LC016344 case
and an earlier action filed August 24, 2017 (the "LC106120 case")
were premised on an attached the putative contract with Cypers' forged
signature.  Namely, before the
LC106344 case was filed, Plaintiffs provided evidence to Granatelli's attorneys
that Cypers' signature was forged.  On
February 22, 2018, Lewitt Hackman Defendants substituted out the LC106344 case
and LC106120 case as Granatelli's attorneys. 
 Lewitt Hackman Defendants were
aware of the forgery.  
On January 28, 2019, Granatelli
pleaded no contest to a criminal charge of felony identity theft in violation
of Penal Code § 530.5 in connection with Cypers' forged signature on the
putative contract and was ordered to pay restitution to Cypers. Accordingly,
Plaintiffs' made a prima facie showing that Lewitt Hackman Defendants lacked
probable cause in filing and continuing to prosecute the LC106344 case
after learning that the putative contract upon which it was based had been
forged.
As to favorable termination,
Plaintiffs' allegations in their complaint and evidence submitted in opposition
to this present Anti-SLAPP motion showcases: On December 13, 2019, Granatelli's
initial Complaint filed in the LC106120 case was stricken with leave to amend.
However, on September 29, 2020, Plaintiffs' demurrer to Granatelli's First
Amended Complaint filed on December 19, 2019 in LC106120 case was sustained
without leave to amend based on Granatelli's failure to explain why the forged
putative contract attached to his original complaint was omitted from the FAC.
Consequently, the Court in its November 9, 2020, Order Denying Granatelli's Motion
for Consideration stated that it was clear the original filing contained a
deliberate and admitted forgery. Thus, on December 16, 2020, the LC106120 case
was dismissed with prejudice. Likewise, on December 17, 2021, Plaintiffs
entered into a settlement agreement with Granatelli in which the parties agreed
to settle and release the LC106344 case and LC106120 case and Granatelli's
Appeal in exchange for Granatelli taking nothing in relations to those cases
and pay Plaintiffs' $200,000.00 in addition to $80,000.00 in restitution in the
Criminal Action court ordered. As such, Lewitt Hackman Defendants' arguments
that dismissal of the action was based on a sham pleading and ultimately
resulted in settlement do not negate that the overall outcome was favorable to
Plaintiffs. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' made a prima facie showing that they
obtained a favorable termination of the LC106344 case. 
As to malice, the Court infers
malice from Lewitt Hackman Defendants' lack of probable cause in continuing to
prosecute an action they knew was initiated based on a forged signature.  (Cole v. Patricia A. Meyer & Associates,
APC (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1095, 1113-1114; Nunez v. Pennisi (2015) 241
Cal.App.4th 861, 877.)  Specifically, the
allegations in Plaintiffs' malicious prosecution action and the evidence
submitted in opposition to Lewitt Hackman Defendants' Anti-SLAPP motion
demonstrate that: (1) on September 6, 2017, Plaintiffs' provided Lewitt Hackman
Defendants' with substantial evidence proving that the LC106344 case was
premised on a putative contract with a Cypers' forged signature; (2) Lewitt
Hackman Defendants' were aware that the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department had
opened a criminal investigation against Granatelli as to his forgery; and (3)
Lewitt Hackman Defendants' continued to prosecute the case despite the December
6, 2017 Court Order Staying the Action. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' have met their
minimal burden showing that this action is likely to prevail on the
merits.  De Havilland v. FX  Networks, LLC (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 845, 856
(De Havilland).
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE
