And here is the English-text summary:

The tentatively ruling judge granted the motion to strike portions of the First Amended Complaint, including paragraphs 1, 31, 43, and 45 and paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Prayer for Relief, as well as the claims for declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and punitive damages. The judge found that the request for declaratory relief was unfounded because the declaratory relief COA was withdrawn, and that injunctive relief was not an express remedy under the Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA). The judge also found that the allegations of willful and grossly negligent violations of the ICRAA were insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge denied the request for leave to amend, finding that the pleading defects could not be cured.
