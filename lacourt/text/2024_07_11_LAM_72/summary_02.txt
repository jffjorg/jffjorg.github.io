And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication in this breach of contract case. The plaintiff, GCIU-Employer Retirement Fund, and its Board of Trustees, are seeking to recover $7 million in withdrawal liability assessments that were not collected due to the defendant's failure to comply with the withdrawal liability procedures. The defendant, Management Applied Programming, LLC, was required under the contract to follow and abide by the administrative procedures adopted by the plaintiff board, including identifying when an employer has withdrawn from the plan and informing the actuary of the liability calculations. The defendant failed to do so, and the plaintiff has shown that this failure was a breach of the contract. The judge has found that the undisputed facts support the plaintiff's claim and that the defendant has not raised a triable issue of fact in response. Therefore, the judge grants the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication.
