Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) seeks

Corp. (“Defendant”) to add a prayer for treble damages.
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion.  Plaintiff shall file its amended complaint
within 10 days.
 
Background
 
This is a collection case relating to an insurance policy
obtained by Defendant. Plaintiff is a collection agency that has been assigned
this matter by State Compensation Insurance Fund (“SCIF”). 
 
SCIF issued two worker’s compensation insurance policies to
Defendant. One policy (the “2021 Policy”) covered the period of June 10, 2021
through June 10, 2022. The second policy (the “2022 Policy”) covered the period
of June 10, 2022 through June 10, 2023. Both policies were issued with premiums
based on an initial quote, with the premiums subject to revision based on a
physical audit of the insurance operation and relevant payroll records. Each
policy includes terms and conditions explaining the audit process.
 
Plaintiff contends that Defendant failed to complete
required audits for the 2021 Policy and the 2022 Policy. As a result, SCIF had
to issue estimated invoices for both policies. Plaintiff contends that
Defendant then failed and refused to make payments towards either of the
estimated invoices, leading SCIF to assign the account balance to Plaintiff for
collection purposes.
 
The 2022 Policy was canceled effective September 28, 2022. SCIF
cancelled the 2022 Policy due to Defendant’s alleged failure to complete
audits. Because of Defendant’s alleged failure to complete audits for the 2021
Policy, SCIF did not make the required number of audit requests under the
governing statute allowing for treble damages in connection with the 2022
Policy.
 
Plaintiff filed this action on February 5, 2024, raising
claims for (1) breach of contract; (2) open book account; (3) account stated;
and (4) reasonable value.
 
Defendant answered on March 19, 2024.
 
On June 7, 2024, Plaintiff moved for leave to amend the
Complaint. The hearing was scheduled for July 11, 2024. Plaintiff seeks to add
a prayer for treble damages under Insurance Code, section 11760.1 on the basis
that Defendant allegedly failed to complete a physical audit for the 2021
Policy.
 
On June 27, 2024, Defendant filed a Notice of Opposition and
Request for Continuance, stating that on July 11, 2024, Defendant would request
a 30-day continuance to file its opposition to Plaintiff’s motion.
 
On July 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.
 
Legal Standard
 
A complainant may obtain leave from the trial court to amend
their pleading beyond the number of amendments allowed under Code of Civil
Procedure section 472 (a) by filing a noticed motion. (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1324.) The motion must be accompanied by a declaration stating: (1) the
effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3)
when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4)
why the request was not made earlier.¿(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324 (b).)
 
“Any judge, at any time before or after commencement of
trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may
allow the amendment of any pleading or pretrial conference order.”¿(Code Civ.
Proc., § 576.) In the absence of a showing of prejudice from the opposing side,
the trial court ordinarily lacks discretion to deny a motion to amend a
pleading. (Honig v. Financial Corp. of America (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 960,
965.)            
 
Discussion
 
“If an employer fails to provide for access by the insurer
or its authorized representative to its records, to enable the insurer to
perform an audit to determine the remuneration earned by the employer's
employees and by any of its uninsured subcontractors and the employees of any
of its uninsured subcontractors during the policy period, the employer shall be
liable to pay to the insurer a total premium for the policy equal to three
times the insurer's then-current estimate of the annual premium on the expiration
date of the policy. The employer shall also be liable, in addition to the
premium, for costs incurred by the insurer in its attempts to perform an audit,
after the insured has failed upon the insurer’s third request during at least a
90-day period to provide access, and the insured has provided no compelling
business reason for the failure. This section shall only apply if the insurer
elects to comply with the conditions set forth in subdivision (d).” (Ins. Code,
§ 11760.1, subd. (a).)
 
“‘Access’ shall mean access at any time during regular
business hours during the policy period and within three years after the policy
period ends. “Access” may also include any other time mutually agreed upon by
the employer and insurer.” (Ins. Code, § 11760.1, subd. (b).)
 
“The insurer shall have and follow regular and reasonable
rules and procedures to notify employers of their duty to provide for access to
records, and to contact employers to make appointments during regular business
hours for that purpose.” (Ins. Code, § 11760.1, subd. (c).)
 
“Upon the employer's failure to provide access after the
insurer's third request during at least a 90-day period, the insurer may notify
the employer through its mailing of a certified, return-receipt, document of
the increased premium and the total amount of the costs incurred by the insurer
for its attempts to perform an audit as described under subdivision (a). Upon
the expiration of 30 days after the delivery of the notice, collection by the
insurer of the amount of premium and costs described under subdivision (a),
less all premiums previously paid by the employer for the policy, shall be
fully enforceable and executable.” (Ins. Code, § 11760.1, subd. (d).)
 
Plaintiff sent Defendant a demand for compliance on March
11, 2023, requesting the treble damages. (Freed Decl., Ex. 1.)
 
Plaintiff sent a certified letter to Defendant on March 27,
2024 seeking payment of the treble damages under section 11760.1(a). (Freed
Decl., Ex. 2.) The letter was delivered on March 28, 2024. (Freed Decl., Ex.
2.) More than 30 days have passed since that time.
 
Counsel for Defendant subsequently contacted SCIF and
communicated that Defendant might cooperate with the audit requirement. (Jao
Decl. ¶ 9.) SCIF sent a letter to Defendant on April 9, 2024 stating what
records and information were required and how to submit them. (Jao Decl., Ex.
5.) SCIF followed up by sending a similar letter on April 23, 2024. (Jao Decl.,
Ex. 8.)
 
In its opposition, Defendant requests a continuance of this
motion so that it can produce evidence that will show that the audits required
under the 2021 Policy were completed. If Defendant believes that its records
foreclose any dispute that it is liable for treble damages, its remedy is to
seek summary adjudication under Code of Civil Procedure, section 438c, subd.
(f)(1). However, Plaintiff may permissibly plead its entitlement to treble
damages despite the existence of evidence to the contrary.
 
This is a factual issue not proper for resolution at the
pleading stage. Furthermore, an opposition is not a proper vehicle to request
continuance.
 
The Court therefore grants Plaintiff’s motion.
