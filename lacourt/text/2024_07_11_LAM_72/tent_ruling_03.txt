Plaintiff Golden Dragon Group LLC (“Plaintiff”) seeks leave
to amend his Complaint against Defendant Jonathan Valdez (“Defendant”)
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion.  The Court sets aside the default entered
January 11, 2024.  Plaintiff shall file
his amended complaint within 10 days.
 
Background
 
This is a breach of contract case.
 
In 2020 and 2021, Plaintiff and Defendant made a series of
agreements (the “Loan Agreements”) whereby Plaintiff loaned Defendant certain
amounts of money and further obtained a loan and a line of credit on
Defendant’s behalf to be used exclusively for Defendant’s business. 
 
Defendant thereafter failed to make monthly loan and credit
card payments pursuant to the Loan Agreements in a timely manner. 
 
On January 15, 2022, Plaintiff and Defendant agreed to a
repayment agreement (the “First Repayment Agreement”). From March 2022 to June
2022, Defendant ignored Plaintiff’s communications and failed to make payments
on the First Repayment Agreement. On July 12, 2022, the parties entered into a
second repayment agreement (the “Second Repayment Agreement”). From August 2022
to December 2022, Defendant ignored Plaintiff’s communications and failed to
make payments on the Second Repayment Agreement.
 
On December 21, 2022, Plaintiff served Defendant with a
demand notice requesting that Defendant fulfill his repayment obligations.
However, Defendant did not comply with the notice.
 
Plaintiff filed this action on February 9, 2023, seeking
recovery on Defendant’s breaches of the Loan Agreements, the First Repayment
Agreement, and the Second Repayment Agreement. The Complaint seeks the recovery
of a total of $81,000.00 under the various agreements.
 
On March 14, 2023, the parties reached an agreement on the
dispute in the form of a promissory note (the “Promissory Note”). Plaintiff
filed the Promissory Note with the Court on March 17, 2023. The Promissory Note
purports to settle the controversy in this action. However, no party sought
dismissal of the action pursuant to the settlement in the Promissory Note. This
action is consequently still pending.
 
Defendant was defaulted on January 11, 2024.
 
On January 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for default
judgment against Defendant, seeking recovery on the Promissory Note.
 
On May 13, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiff’s request for
default judgment on the basis that Plaintiff’s Complaint did not plead the
existence or breach of the Promissory Note and that Plaintiff sought damages on
default in excess of the damages demanded in the Complaint.
 
Plaintiff moved for leave to amend on June 11, 2024. No
party has filed an opposition.
 
Legal Standard
 
A complainant may obtain leave from the trial court to amend
their pleading beyond the number of amendments allowed under Code of Civil
Procedure section 472 (a) by filing a noticed motion. (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1324.) The motion must be accompanied by a declaration stating: (1) the
effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3)
when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4)
why the request was not made earlier.¿(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324 (b).)
 
“Any judge, at any time before or after commencement of
trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may
allow the amendment of any pleading or pretrial conference order.”¿(Code Civ.
Proc., § 576.) In the absence of a showing of prejudice from the opposing side,
the trial court ordinarily lacks discretion to deny a motion to amend a
pleading. (Honig v. Financial Corp. of America (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 960,
965.)            
 
Discussion
 
 Plaintiff seeks to
amend his complaint to add allegations that the parties entered the Promissory
Agreement, under which Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiff the amount of $83,741,
and that Defendant has not made any payments to date. Plaintiff also seeks to
add demands for damages, attorney’s fees, and costs.
 
The Court previously denied Plaintiff default judgment on
the grounds that Plaintiff had not pleaded the existence and breach of the
Promissory Agreement, which is the latest agreement stating the parties’
obligations to each other with respect to the Loan Agreements. Plaintiff now
seeks to amend his complaint to fix that defect. The Court finds that such
amendment is in the interest of justice.
 
The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion.
