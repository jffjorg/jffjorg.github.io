Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Gabriel Guzman, has filed a motion for terminating and monetary sanctions against the defendant, Gloria Moreno. The defendant has failed to comply with a discovery order, and the court has ordered the defendant to respond to the plaintiff's interrogatories and pay sanctions of $875.00. The defendant has not complied with these orders, and the plaintiff is seeking additional sanctions.

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions, as there has been no previous noncompliance with a rule or order. However, the court has granted the plaintiff's motion for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,110.00. This amount is in addition to the previous sanctions of $875.00.

The court has ordered the defendant to pay the monetary sanctions to the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days of the issuance of this order. The court has also ordered the plaintiff to comply with its previous order requiring the plaintiff to provide responses to the defendant's discovery requests.

The court has noted that it will consider granting heightened sanctions against the defendant if the defendant continues to abuse the discovery process.
