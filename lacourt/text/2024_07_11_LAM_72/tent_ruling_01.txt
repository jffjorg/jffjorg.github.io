Plaintiff Gabriel Guzman (“Plaintiff”) moves for terminating
sanctions against Defendant Gloria Moreno (“Defendant”). Plaintiff additionally
seeks monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,110.00.
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion for terminating
sanctions.
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for monetary sanctions
in the amount of $1,110.00. This amount is in addition to previous sanctions. Defendant
shall pay this amount to Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 days of the issuance of
this order.
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to comply with the Court’s August
15, 2023 order. Defendant shall provide responses to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories – General (Set No. One) and pay the sanctions set forth in the
August 15, 2023 order of $875.00 to Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 days of the
issuance of this order. If Defendant fails to do so, the Court will consider
granting heightened sanctions against Defendant.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff filed this action on April 8, 2019. The operative
complaint is now the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), which raises claims for
(1) civil assault; (2) civil battery; (3) intentional infliction of emotional
distress (“IIED”); (4) negligent and/or reckless infliction of emotional
distress; (5) negligence per se; (6) slander; and (7) slander per se.
 
On August 15, 2023, the Court ordered Defendant to respond
to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories – General (Set No. One) and to pay
sanctions of $875.00 (the “August 15 Order”).
 
Defendant has not provided the discovery responses as
ordered or paid the sanctions. (Vartanian Decl. ¶ 7.) 
 
Plaintiff filed this motion for terminating sanctions on May
28, 2024. Defendant did not file an opposition.
 
Legal Standard
 
Where a party misuses the discovery process, courts have
discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence, or monetary sanctions. (Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 2023.010(g), 2030.290(c); R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative
Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) Misuse of the discovery
process includes failure to respond to an authorized method of discovery or
disobeying a court order to provide discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2023.010(d), (g).)        
 
Monetary sanctions may be imposed “ordering that one engaging in
the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or
both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone
as a result of that conduct…unless [the Court] finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code of Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.030, subd. (a).) 
 
Issue sanctions may be imposed “ordering that designated facts
shall be taken as established in the action in accordance with the claim of the
party adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery process. The court may
also impose an issue sanction by an order prohibiting any party engaging in the
misuse of the discovery process from supporting or opposing designated claims
or defenses.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (b).) 
 
Evidence sanctions may be imposed “by an order prohibiting any
party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from introducing
designated matters in evidence.” (Code of Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.030, subd. (c).) 
 
In more extreme cases, the Court may also impose terminating
sanctions by “striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings,” “staying
further proceedings,” “dismissing the action, or any part of the action,” or
“rending a judgment by default” against the party misusing the discovery
process. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(d).) The court should look to
the totality of the circumstances in determining whether terminating sanctions
are appropriate.  (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77¿Cal.App.4th 1225,
1246.) Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a
willful discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules. (Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A] penalty as
severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with
discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad
faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) Further,
preventing parties from presenting their cases on the merits is a drastic
measure; terminating sanctions should only be ordered when there has been
previous noncompliance with a rule or order, and it appears a less severe
sanction would not be effective. (Link v. Cater (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th
1315, 1326.) 
 
Before any sanctions may be imposed the court must make an
express finding that there has been a willful failure of the party to serve the
required answers. (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County
(1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.) Lack of diligence may be deemed willful where
the party understood its obligation, had the ability to comply, and failed to
comply. (Deyo v. Killbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 787.) The party
who failed to comply with discovery obligations has the burden of showing that
the failure was not willful. (Id. at 788.) 
 
Discussion
 
Terminating Sanctions
 
As discussed above, terminating sanctions are justified
where there is a willful discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and
evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
discovery rules. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert, supra, 196 Cal.App.4th at
p. 1516.) Furthermore, terminating sanctions should only be ordered when there
has been previous noncompliance with a rule or order, and it appears a less
severe sanction would not be effective. (Link v. Cater, supra, 60
Cal.App.4th at p. 1326.) 
 
 
“[T]he trial court may impose terminating sanctions as a
first measure in extreme cases, or where the record shows lesser sanctions
would be ineffective. (Department of Forestry & Fire Protection v.
Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 154, 191–192.) In Department of Forestry
& Fire Protection v. Howell, the trial court found that “[plaintiff’s]
willful, repeated and egregious misuses of the discovery process permeated
nearly every single significant issue in this case to an extent that threatened
the integrity of the judicial process and made it implausible that defendants
could ever receive a fair trial. (Id. at 197 [internal quotations
omitted].)
 
Defendant has failed to comply with a discovery order, and
sanctions are therefore warranted. Here, however, there has been no previous
noncompliance with a rule or order. This is not the kind of “willful, repeated
and egregious misuses of the discovery process” “permeat[ing] every single
significant issue in this case” to which terminating sanctions are intended to
respond. (Department of Forestry & Fire Protection v. Howell, supra,
18 Cal.App.5th at 197.)
 
The Court therefore denies terminating sanctions. However,
if Defendant continues to abuse the discovery process, the Court would consider
heightened sanctions such as evidentiary, issue, or terminating sanctions,
depending on the conduct in question.
 
Monetary Sanctions
 
            Monetary
sanctions are appropriate due to Defendant’s failure to comply with a discovery
order.
 
            Plaintiff
requests an hourly rate of $350.00 for Varand Vartanian. The Court finds this
rate to be reasonable based on Vartanian’s 14 years of experience. Plaintiff
requests 3.0 hours of time for Vartanian. The Court finds this time expenditure
to be reasonable. The Court awards $1,050.
 
            Plaintiff
requests $60.00 for the filing fee for this motion. The Court finds this
request reasonable.
 
            The
Court awards a total of $1,110.00 in new sanctions.
