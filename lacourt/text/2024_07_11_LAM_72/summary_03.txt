And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to amend their complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add allegations and demands related to a promissory note that was entered into by the parties. The court previously denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment because the complaint did not plead the existence and breach of the promissory note. The plaintiff now seeks to amend the complaint to fix this defect. The court finds that such amendment is in the interest of justice and grants the motion. The court also sets aside the default entered on January 11, 2024, and requires the plaintiff to file their amended complaint within 10 days.
