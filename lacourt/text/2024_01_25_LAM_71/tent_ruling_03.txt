[1] The Court notes Moving Defendants do not demur to the
5th cause of action for conversion.


[2] Moving Defendants’ notice of motion indicates that it
intends to move on the basis of C.C.P. §430.10(c), that there is another action
pending between the same parties on the same cause of action.  However, Moving Defendants’ motion does not
substantively argue this ground.


[3] Moving Defendants filed a motion to strike on the
same date as the demurrer and provided a notice on December 20, 2023, that the
motion to strike has been taken off calendar. Therefore, the Court does not
rule on the motion to strike.
