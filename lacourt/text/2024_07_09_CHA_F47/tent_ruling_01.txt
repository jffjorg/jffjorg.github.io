Case #21STCV21293
 
MOTION FOR
PROTECTIVE ORDER
 
Motion filed on 1/9/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Phyllis R. Ginolfi, by and
through her Conservator, Christin C. Solis
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant HDL, Inc. dba Pacoima Adult
Day Care 
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: A protective
order preventing and continuing the deposition of key fact witness, Miriam Muwummuza.
 
RULING: The motion is placed off calendar.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
 
This action arises out of an alleged fall that occurred
while Plaintiff Phyllis Ginolfi (Plaintiff) attended
Defendant/Cross-Complainant HDL, Inc. dba Pacoima Adult Day Care’s (HDL) adult
day care facility on 8/20/19. On 8/20/19, Plaintiff was transported to and from
HDL’s facility by a paratransit van operated by Defendant/Cross-Defendant
Keolis Transit America, Inc. (Keolis). 
 
On 6/7/21, Plaintiff filed this action against HDL and
Defendant/Cross-Defendant Right Choice In-Home Care, Inc. for: (1) Dependent
Adult/Elder Abuse and (2) Negligence. Keolis was later named in place of Doe 1.
 
On 1/9/24, Plaintiff filed and served the instant motion
seeking a protective order preventing and continuing the deposition of key fact
witness, Miriam Muwummuza, which was scheduled for 1/11/24.  No opposition or other response to the motion
has been filed. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff seeks the subject protective order due to the
unavailability of Plaintiff’s counsel on 1/11/24, the date of the deposition
due to being engaged in trial in another matter on that date.  (See Gambardella Decl. ¶3).
 
Plaintiff’s attorney notes that the instant motion was set
for the earliest available date, 7/9/24, and then states: “Plaintiff
subsequently make an ex parte application to advance the hearing date so that
this important discovery can be taken in a timely manner and well before the
MSC on April 18, 2024.”  (Gambardella
Decl. ¶3).  
 
Plaintiff never made an ex parte application to advance
the hearing date on this motion.  Given
that the date of the deposition has long since passed, the requested relief is
moot.  
 
CONCLUSION
The motion is placed off calendar.
