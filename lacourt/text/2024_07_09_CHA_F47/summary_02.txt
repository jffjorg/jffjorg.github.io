And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint filed by Defendant Hanna Margaret Eva Perlstein. The motion seeks to allow Defendant to file a cross-complaint against Cadillac of Beverly Hills for indemnification, apportionment of fault, and declaratory relief. The Judge finds that the proposed cross-complaint is not compulsory, as it is not alleged against the Plaintiff, and that a trial date has not been set. Therefore, Defendant was not required to obtain leave of court to file the cross-complaint. The Judge grants the motion, but notes that Defendant must separately file the cross-complaint.
