```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge denies Defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The Judge finds that Defendant has not provided any evidence to show that Plaintiff agreed to arbitrate. The Judge concludes that the box did not contain the Arbitration Agreement, and therefore, Plaintiff did not agree to arbitrate. The Judge also finds that Defendant's argument that Plaintiff necessarily agreed to Tracfone's customer Agreement, including the Arbitration Provision, by receiving a copy of the Agreement and by activating his service with Tracfone Wireless, is not supported by competent evidence. The Judge holds that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) does not require the Court to invent special arbitration-preferring procedural rules. The Judge concludes that Defendant cannot bootstrap its way into arbitration by claiming, without evidence, that Plaintiff agreed to arbitrate threshold issues.
