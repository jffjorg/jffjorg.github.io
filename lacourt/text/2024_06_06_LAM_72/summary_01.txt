Significant Statements:

- The PAGA waiver in the arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable
- The arbitration agreement is not severable due to an explicit clause disclaiming severability
```

The judge's tentative ruling is that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable due to unconscionability, specifically procedural unconscionability and substantive unconscionability. The court finds that the arbitration agreement is procedurally unconscionable because it was presented to the plaintiff on a "take it or leave it" basis without allowing him to negotiate the terms. The court also finds that the arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable because it waives the plaintiff's right to pursue PAGA claims in court. The court denies TBC's motion to compel arbitration and instead allows the plaintiff to continue pursuing his claims in court.
