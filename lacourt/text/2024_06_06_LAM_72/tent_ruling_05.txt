RULING
 



JASTON ARCHIE, 
 
                                  Plaintiff,
  
         v.
 
 
TRACFONE WIRELESS, INC.,
 
                                  Defendant.
 


 Case No: 
  24STCV04323
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  April 25, 2024
 Calendar Number:  8



 
 
 
Defendant Tracfone Wireless Inc. (“Defendant”) moves for an
order compelling Plaintiff Jaston Archie (“Plaintiff”) to arbitrate his claims
against Defendant and staying this action pending arbitration.
 
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion.
 
Background
 
This case concerns Defendant’s alleged theft of Plaintiff’s debit
card information, money, and other private information when Plaintiff called
Defendant, a cellular service provider, to activate a cellular phone on
December 21, 2023.
 
Defendant then allegedly used the information that it
obtained from Plaintiff to fraudulently withdraw funds from Plaintiff’s bank
account through a hacking technique called “skimming.”
 
Plaintiff filed this action on February 21, 2024. The
operative complaint is now the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), which raises
claims for (1) negligence; (2) violations of California Consumer Privacy Act
(Civ. Code, § 1798.100, et seq.); and (3) unjust enrichment.
 
Default was entered against Defendant on March 27, 2024.
 
Defendant moved to compel arbitration on April 2, 2024.
 
On April 25, 2024, the Court relieved Defendant from default
and ordered that Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration would serve as its
response to the Complaint.
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion to compel
arbitration and Defendant filed a reply.
 
Legal Standard
 
Under both the
Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and California law, arbitration agreements are
valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, except on such grounds that exist at law
or equity for voiding a contract. (Winter
v. Window Fashions Professions, Inc. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 943, 947.) 
 
The party moving to
compel arbitration must establish the existence of a written arbitration
agreement between the parties. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.) In ruling on a
motion to compel arbitration, the court must first determine whether the
parties actually agreed to arbitrate the dispute, and general principles of
California contract law help guide the court in making this determination. (Mendez v. Mid-Wilshire Health Care Center
(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 534, 541.) 
 
“A petition to
compel arbitration or to stay proceedings pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 1281.2 and 1281.4 must state, in addition to other required
allegations, the provisions of the written agreement and the paragraph that
provides for arbitration. The provisions must be stated verbatim or a copy must
be physically or electronically attached to the petition and incorporated by
reference” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1330.) “With respect to the moving
party's burden to provide evidence of the existence of an
agreement to arbitrate, it is generally sufficient for that party to present a
copy of the contract to the court. Once such a document is presented to the
court, the burden shifts to the party opposing the motion to compel, who may
present any challenges to the enforcement of the agreement and evidence in
support of those challenges.” (Baker v.
Italian Maple Holdings, LLC (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 1152, 1160 [internal
citations omitted].) 
 
Discussion
 
            Defendant
contends that Plaintiff purchased the phone in question from Best Buy. Defendant
contends that the phone was a Nokia N151DL Tracfone Wireless phone. Defendant
contends that the box in which the telephone was packaged had an overwrap with
certain text on it. 
 
Defendant provides a copy of the alleged overwrap, which
states, among other things, that “[b]y purchasing this package or by purchasing
any Tracfone phone, you agree to the latest Terms and Conditions of Service
available at Tracfone.com…” (Friedman Decl., Ex. A.)
 
            Defendant
provides a copy of the Terms and Conditions of Service (the “Terms and
Conditions”). (Friedman Decl., Ex. B.) The Terms and Conditions contains a
clause labeled “Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes” (the “Arbitration Agreement”).
The Arbitration Agreement states, in part, as follows:
 
I. AGREEMENT TO
ARBITRATE DISPUTES
 
Important
Notice: Many customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction
by contacting the Customer Care Department, at 1-800-867-7183. If we are unable
to resolve your dispute, then you and we agree to resolve all disputes in
arbitration or small claims court as described below.
 
YOU
UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS AGREEMENT YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM
IN COURT OR IN FRONT OF A JURY. WHILE THE PROCEDURES IN ARBITRATION MAY BE
DIFFERENT, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF, AND MUST
HONOR THE SAME TERMS IN THIS AGREEMENT, AS A COURT WOULD, SUBJECT TO THE LIMITS
ON ARBITRATOR AUTHORITY SET FORTH BELOW. . . . WE ALSO BOTH AGREE THAT:
 
(1)
THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT APPLIES TO THIS AGREEMENT. EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS
COURT CASES OR AS SPECIFICALLY NOTED BELOW, ANY DISPUTE THAT IN ANY WAY RELATES
TO OR ARISES OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE VALIDITY, ENFORCEABILITY, OR
SCOPE OF ANY PORTION OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE)
EXCEPT AS NOTED BELOW, OR FROM ANY EQUIPMENT, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES YOU RECEIVE
FROM US, OR FROM ANY ADVERTISING FOR ANY SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR FROM OUR
EFFORTS TO COLLECT AMOUNTS YOU MAY OWE US FOR SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES,
INCLUDING ANY DISPUTES YOU HAVE WITH OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS, WILL BE RESOLVED
BY ONE OR MORE NEUTRAL ARBITRATORS BEFORE THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION
(“AAA”). . . . THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE CONTINUES TO APPLY EVEN AFTER YOU
HAVE STOPPED RECEIVING SERVICE FROM US.
 
(Friedman Decl., Ex. B. at p. 1.)
 
            There
is one problem with Defendant’s motion: Defendant does not provide any evidence
which could lead the Court to believe that Plaintiff entered into the
Arbitration Agreement with it.
 
            Friedman’s
declaration fails to establish foundation for Friedman’s statements that the
phone Plaintiff purchased was a Nokia N151DL Tracfone Wireless (or any other
type of Tracfone phone) or that it came in packaging with the overwrap or Terms
and Conditions of Service of which Friedman provides copies. Although Friedman
states that she relies on business records of Defendant, the only “relevant”
(Friedman Decl. ¶ 3) business records that she provides are the overwrap and
the Terms and Conditions. (Friedman Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5-6.) Neither of these business
records indicate whether Plaintiff purchased a Tracfone phone or indicate what
materials were or were not in the box that Plaintiff received the phone in.
 
            In
fact, Plaintiff flatly contradicts these assertions. Plaintiff declares that
the Nokia phone he purchased was not a Tracfone, nor did it come in a Tracfone
box. (Archie Decl. ¶ 6.) Plaintiff declares that the phone was an unlocked
phone – i.e., that it was not associated with any particular cellular service
provider, such as Tracfone. (Archie Decl. ¶ 1.) Plaintiff declares that there
was no set of Tracfone Terms and Conditions in the box, nor was there a
Tracfone arbitration agreement on the box. (Archie Decl. ¶ 7.) Plaintiff
provides an example photograph of the type of box the phone came in. (Archie
Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. A.) The box is a simple brown Nokia box that does not contain
Tracfone branding. (Archie Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. A.) The Court is compelled, by the
only competent evidence in front of it, to conclude that the box did not
contain the Arbitration Agreement, or any information by which Plaintiff could
have found the Arbitration Agreement.
 
            Defendant
contends that Plaintiff “necessarily agreed to Tracfone Wireless’s customer
Agreement, including the Arbitration Provision when he called to activate
Tracfone Wireless service” (Reply at p. 1:10-13) because he “expressly agreed
to all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, including the Arbitration
Provision, by receiving a copy of the Agreement, and by activating his service
with Tracfone Wireless.” (Motion at p. 8:7-9.) The parties do not dispute that
the Terms and Conditions state that activating cellular service with Tracfone
results in acceptance of the Arbitration Agreement, but this still does not
equate to a showing that Plaintiff received those terms and conditions
in the first place. And of course, without even constructive notice that
activation of service with Tracfone constituted assent to the Arbitration
Agreement, Plaintiff could not possibly have assented to it. 
 
The same is true of Defendant’s argument that “[a] voluntary
acceptance of the benefit of a transaction is equivalent to a consent to all
the obligations arising from it, so far as the facts are known, or ought to be
known, to the person accepting.” (Civ. Code, § 1589.) Without actual or
constructive knowledge – as required by the statute – that the Arbitration
Agreement was a part of the obligations arising from Tracfone service, Plaintiff
cannot be bound it. The fact that a Tracfone arbitration agreement existed out
in the ether at the time when Plaintiff activated Tracfone service is not
enough, on its own, for that agreement to then descend from the ether and latch
onto Plaintiff.
 
            Defendant
contends that, because the Arbitration Clause provides that issues of validity,
enforceability, and scope of the Arbitration Clause will be decided by an
arbitrator, the Court must compel this case to arbitration to resolve those
issues.
 
            The
United States Supreme Court has stated that “parties can agree to arbitrate
‘gateway’ questions of ‘arbitrability,’ such as whether the parties have agreed
to arbitrate or whether their agreement covers a particular controversy.” (Rent-A-Center,
West, Inc. v. Jackson (2010) 561 U.S. 63, 68–69.) “If a party challenges
the validity under … of the precise agreement to arbitrate at issue, the
federal court must consider the challenge before ordering compliance with that
agreement[.]” (Id. at p. 71.)
 
            The
Court has no difficulty determining that the precise agreement to submit to an
arbitrator threshold questions of arbitrability was never formed. Defendant has
provided no competent evidence indicating that Plaintiff purchased a phone that
was packaged with Tracfone’s overwrap, Terms and Conditions, or Arbitration
Agreement. Plaintiff has provided substantial affirmative evidence to the
contrary. Plaintiff has therefore shown that he did not agree to arbitrate
threshold questions of arbitrability, nor did he agree to arbitrate any of his
claims against Tracfone.
 
The FAA “does not
authorize federal courts to invent special, arbitration-preferring procedural
rules[;]” rather, the policy is intended “to overrule the judiciary's
longstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate and to place such
agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.” (Morgan v. Sundance,
Inc. (2022) 596 U.S. 411, 418. “[A]rbitration is a matter of contract and a
party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not
agreed so to submit.” (AT & T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications
Workers of America (1986) 475 U.S. 643, 648.)
 
Defendant cannot bootstrap its way into arbitration by
claiming, without evidence, that Plaintiff agreed to arbitrate threshold issues.
There are no terms to an arbitration agreement that a party can allege that
will carry its burden without the provision of actual evidence that the
agreement was ever entered in the first place. Nor does Rent-A-Center
relieve it of this burden – the existence of a contract is a matter of state
contract law. (AT & T
Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers of America, supra, 475
U.S. at p. 648.)
 
            The
Court denies Defendant’s motion.
