Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on two Pitchess Motions filed by the parties. The Plaintiff's Pitchess Motion is granted, allowing the Plaintiff to discover the personnel records of LAPD Commander Al Neal, which are relevant to the Plaintiff's claims of retaliation. The Defendant's Pitchess Motion is also granted, allowing the Defendant to discover the audio recordings of witness interviews in the matter of CF No. 21-000124.

The Judge has considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and has determined that the Plaintiff has established good cause for the disclosure of the requested records. The Judge will review the records in chambers to determine what information is relevant to the pending litigation and will disclose that information to the Defendant.

The Judge has also noted that the Defendant's argument that certain records should not be disclosed due to the ongoing investigations is not sufficient to deny the motion. The Court will not deny the motion on these grounds.

Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's Pitchess Motion and allows the Plaintiff to discover the personnel records of LAPD Commander Al Neal, and grants the Defendant's Pitchess Motion and allows the Defendant to discover the audio recordings of witness interviews.
