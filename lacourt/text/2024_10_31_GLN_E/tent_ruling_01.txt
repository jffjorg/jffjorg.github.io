  Case Number:  19GDCV00388    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2024    Dept:  E The Court’s tentative is to make the following findings:
 

The most reasonable
     interpretation of the executed lease--putting aside any parol evidence--is
     that defendants signed as guarantors.  The absence of signatures on
     the guarantor page is not dispositive, as the document must be considered
     as a whole.

 

Assuming the lease is
     ambiguous, the testimony of defendant is simply unpersuasive. Defendants
     claim that they had the opportunity to review the lease and thereafter
     signed it but that they were somehow “rushed.” The lease is clear, on the
     first page, and on the guarantor page, which defendants initialed, that
     the defendants were signing/approving a document that named them
     personally as guarantors.

 

A tentative is not a
     final order of the Court and has no precedential value. Defendants’
     arguments regarding the specter of forum-shopping are unpersuasive.

 

Defendants’ arguments
     regarding defenses to enforcement of the lease are unclear and suffer from
     a general incoherence and lack of persuasiveness in the defendants’
     testimony and evidence.

 
The Court will hear argument.  
 
Counsel should be advised that the Court is aware of the
arguments that have been made previously. Counsel are advised to avoid simply
repeating arguments made in previous hearings or briefing.
