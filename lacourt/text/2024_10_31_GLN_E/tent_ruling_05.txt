Meet and Confer
A party filing a
demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)  “The
parties shall meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive
pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least five
days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party
shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a
responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a
demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a
good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why
the parties could not meet and confer.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).) 
Failure
to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(4).)
Here,
Defendant’s counsel alleges that a meet and confer occurred. (Petersen Decl. ¶
4.)
LEGAL STANDARDS FOR DEMURRERS
Demurrer
– Sufficiency
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)  When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of
Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  The court “treat[s]
the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and
not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at
747.)  
The
general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not
evidentiary facts.  (Doe v. City of
Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) 
“All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter of pleading … is that
his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable
precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the
nature, source and extent of his cause of action.”  (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp.
(1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)  
On
demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not
the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any
legal theory.”  (Das v. Bank of
America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.)  Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” 
(Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,
119.)  “Generally
it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.”  (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)
TENTATIVE
RULING
Plaintiff filed its original Complaint on
4/2/2024.
On 9/30/2024,
Defendant filed a demurrer to the original Complaint on the grounds that
Plaintiff’s first cause of action for breach of written contract fails to state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
On 10/21/2024,
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC).
“A party may amend its pleading once without leave of
the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed,
or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before the demurrer or
motion to strike is heard if the amended pleading is filed and served no later
than the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike. A
party may amend the pleading after the date for filing an opposition to the
demurrer or motion to strike, upon stipulation by the parties. The time for
responding to an amended pleading shall be computed from the date of service of
the amended pleading.” (CCP § 472(a).)
Plaintiff here presumably filed and served its FAC on
10/21/2024 without leave of court and without stipulation by the parties under
the theory that this filing would moot the demurrer to the original Complaint because
it filed and served the FAC before the hearing on the demurrer.
However, under CCP § 472(a), and as Defendant’s notice
of non-opposition pointed out, Plaintiff should have filed and served the FAC no
later than the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer.
Here, since the instant hearing is for 10/31/2024, the
latest date for filing an opposition would have been 10/18/2024; therefore,
Plaintiff should have filed and served its FAC on or before 10/18/2024.
Plaintiff did not do that here; Plaintiff filed and served its FAC on 10/21/2024.
Defendant thus argues that since Plaintiff did not
obtain leave of Court, or stipulation of the parties, and since the FAC was
filed and served after the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer, the
filing of the FAC is improper and untimely. 
Defendant argues that since the demurrer remains
unopposed, this Court should sustain Defendant’s demurrer to the first cause of
action in the Complaint without leave to amend. 
Here, although Defendant’s argument is correct as to
Plaintiff’s FAC being untimely, the Court finds that this argument focuses on
form over substance.
Further, even upon reviewing Defendant’s demurrer, the
Court could still sustain the demurrer to the first cause of action and grant
leave to amend. 
Therefore, although the FAC is untimely by one court
day, the Court treats this demurrer as moot in light of the filing of the FAC.
Plaintiff is admonished for the untimely filing, and
in the future Plaintiff is ordered to comply with all applicable statutes,
rules, and filing deadlines.
The parties are ordered to fully comply with their
meet and confer obligations under CCP § 430.41 in connection with any further
challenges to the pleadings.
