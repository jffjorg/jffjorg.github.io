And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court will hear argument on the motion to compel responses from Defendant Ford Motor Company to Plaintiff Jose Membreno's Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two. The motion was filed because Defendant failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests. The Court finds that Defendant waived its objections to the discovery requests and that the motion to compel responses is not moot. The Court is considering three options: compelling initial responses without objections, denying the motion to compel responses as moot, or striking the objections in the current responses. The Court is also considering the parties' arguments regarding sanctions and the motion for relief from waiver of objections, which is scheduled for December 11, 2024.
