And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the executed lease agreement and the testimony of the defendants. The judge finds that the most reasonable interpretation of the lease is that the defendants signed as guarantors, despite the absence of signatures on the guarantor page. The judge also finds that the defendants' testimony and evidence are unpersuasive, as they claimed to have reviewed the lease but were somehow "rushed" while signing it. The judge notes that a tentative ruling has no precedential value and that counsel should avoid repeating previous arguments in the upcoming hearing. The judge will hear further argument on the matter.
