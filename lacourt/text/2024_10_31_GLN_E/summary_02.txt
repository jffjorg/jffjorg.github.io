Roles:
  - Plaintiff: Bettina Haddad
  - Defendant: Federal Express Corporation
Significant Statements:
  - The Court is still entirely confused on Plaintiff's basis for recovery in the instant case.
  - Plaintiff's attempt to avoid the exclusive remedy of workers' compensation by trying to frame a workplace injury as a breach of contract, declaratory relief, and promissory estoppel cause of action.
  - The Court fails to see how Plaintiff's claims arise from anything other than a workplace injury.
  - Plaintiff's attempt to simultaneously rely on Edward Carey (a case involving denial of workers' compensation benefits), while Plaintiff also tries to argue that this case has nothing to do with workers' compensation (and instead deals with breach on contract/UMBI) seems to be a direct contradiction.
```

Summary:

The tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action in the Third Amended Complaint (TAC) is sustained. The Court finds that the Plaintiff, Bettina Haddad, is attempting to avoid the exclusive remedy of workers' compensation by framing a workplace injury as a breach of contract, declaratory relief, and promissory estoppel cause of action. The Court concludes that the Plaintiff's claims are barred by the exclusive remedy of workers' compensation and that the Defendant, Federal Express Corporation, has no duty to inform the Plaintiff of the declination of Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (UM/UMBI) coverage. The Court grants the Defendant's unopposed request for judicial notice of Exhibits 1-6 and will hear argument as to leave to amend.
