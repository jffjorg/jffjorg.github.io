  Case Number:  21SMCV01029    Hearing Date:   December 3, 2024    Dept:  I The motion to set aside the dismissal is GRANTED.  The court has reviewed the settlement
agreement and it appears that the intention was to have the court retain
jurisdiction pursuant to CCP section 664.6. 
The dismissal did not include such a term due to an error by the moving
party.  The dismissal is therefore
VACATED.  Plaintiff may file a new and
different order seeking dismissal or file a motion to enforce the settlement
agreement.  The court will set a status
conference for about 60 days from now. 
Plaintiff ought to give notice to whomever it can.
