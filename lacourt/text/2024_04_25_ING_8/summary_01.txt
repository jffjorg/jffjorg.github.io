Here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The Plaintiff, Salvador Chavez, had brought claims against the Defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., for Violation of Song-Beverly Act - Breach of Express Warranty and Fraudulent Inducement - Concealment. The Defendant demurred to the Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, arguing that the Plaintiff's claims failed to state a cause of action. The judge found that the Plaintiff's claims were insufficient to state a cause of action for Fraudulent Inducement - Concealment, and that the Defendant's demurrer was sustained without leave to amend. The judge also found that the Plaintiff's allegations were insufficient to state a cause of action for punitive damages. The judge tentatively denied further leave to amend the Plaintiff's claims.
