And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a collection action case. The plaintiff, AG Arcadia, LLC, is seeking to recover unpaid nursing home bills from the defendant, Rebecca Schasa. The plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and is seeking monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,018.50.

The plaintiff's motion is unopposed, and the defendant failed to provide verified and substantive responses to the special interrogatories. The court finds that the defendant's failure to respond justifies the imposition of sanctions and grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the special interrogatories.

The court also awards monetary sanctions in the amount of $887.50 against the defendant. The defendant is ordered to pay the sanctions within 20 days of the order. The plaintiff is to give notice.

The court's decision is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure, which requires parties to respond to discovery requests and verify their responses. The court also cites various case law, including Sexton v. Superior Court and Appleton v. Superior Court, to support its decision.
