The Judge, Jared D. Moses, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Maria Davidson, Trustee of the Maria Lynn Davidson 2022 Trust, against Ashot Sandoyan, Rodeo Construction and Management, Cal Land Engineering, Inc., and GR Martinez, Inc. The case arises from allegations of property damage and interference with property rights stemming from construction activities at a site adjacent to the Plaintiff's property.

The Plaintiff filed a complaint on May 7, 2024, and the Defendant Cal Land filed a demurrer on July 26, 2024. The Court found that Cal Land failed to comply with the meet-and-confer requirements under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41.

The Court sustained the demurrer as to the second and third causes of action, which alleged private and public nuisance, respectively, with 20 days leave to amend. The Court sustained the demurrer as to the fourth cause of action, which alleged trespass, without leave to amend.

The Court found that the Plaintiff failed to sufficiently plead a cause of action for public nuisance and trespass, and that the Defendant Cal Land's conduct was not a substantial factor in the alleged interference. The Court also found that the Plaintiff's allegations of property damage and interference with property rights were not sufficient to state a valid cause of action against Cal Land.
