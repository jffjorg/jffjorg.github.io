 Case Number:  24NNCV01444    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING DEFENDANT
CAL LAND ENGINEERING INC’S DEMURRER TO THE COMPLAINT I.         INTRODUCTION
This case arises from allegations
of property damage and interference with property rights stemming from
construction activities. Plaintiff Maria Davidson, Trustee of the Maria Lynn
Davidson 2022 Trust (“Plaintiff”), owns property adjacent to a construction
site where Defendants Ashot Sandoyan, Rodeo Construction and Management, a
California Corporation, Cal Land Engineering, Inc., a California Corporation,
dba Quartech Consultants (“Cal Land”), and GR Martinez, Inc., a California
Corporation, allegedly conducted or facilitated activities that caused harm to
Plaintiff’s property.
Plaintiff initiated this action on
May 7, 2024. On July 26, 2024, Defendant Cal Land filed a demurrer to the
Complaint. Plaintiff filed an opposition on December 2, 2024, and Cal Land
submitted a reply on December 6, 2024.
Meet and Confer
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41, subdivision (a), the demurring party is required to meet and
confer with the party who filed the pleading at least five days before the
responsive pleading is due. This must occur in person, telephone or by video
conference with the aim of resolving any objections raised in the demurrer.
Additionally, the demurring party must file and serve a declaration detailing
the meet and confer efforts. It should be noted, however, that the failure to
meet and confer is not itself grounds for sustaining or overruling a demurrer
or granting or denying a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, subd.
(a)(4), 435.5, subd. (a)(4).)
Here, on July 19, 2024, Cal Land’s
counsel sent Plaintiff’s counsel a meet-and-confer letter. On July 25, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel responded. (Sanders Decl., ¶¶ 3-6) However, as no meeting
occurred in person, by telephone, or via video conference, the Court finds that
counsel failed to comply with the meet-and-confer requirements under section
430.41.
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of a complaint. Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. A plaintiff’s allegations
must be accepted as true for purposes of demurrer, no matter how “improbable”
they are. (Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del E. Webb).) Allegations need not be
accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474.) 
Pleadings are to be broadly
construed (Code Civ. Proc., § 452) and demurrers are to be overruled where the
facts are sufficient to state any cause of action. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart
Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.)
Pursuant to CCP § 335.1, an action
for injury to an individual cause by the neglect of another must be filed
within two years. 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (f) provides for a demurrer where a pleading is uncertain. Demurrers
for uncertainty are disfavored and are only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible
a defendant cannot reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors,
Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) 
III.      ANALYSIS
Cal Land demurs to the second,
third, and fourth causes of action—Private Nuisance, Public Nuisance, and
Trespass—arguing that Plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts to state a
valid cause of action against Cal Land.
 
Second cause of action: Private Nuisance
To establish an action for private
nuisance, (1) “the plaintiff must prove an interference with his use and
enjoyment of his property”; (2) “the invasion of the plaintiff’s interest in
the use and enjoyment of the land must be substantial, that is, that it causes
the plaintiff to suffer substantial actual damage”; (3) “the interference with
the protected interest must not only be substantial, but it must also be
unreasonable, i.e., it must be of such a nature, duration, or amount as to
constitute unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the
land.”  (Mendez v. Rancho Valencia Resort Partners, LLC (2016) 3
Cal.App.5th 248, 262-263)
Cal Land demurs to this cause of
action, asserting that Plaintiff fails to allege specific facts demonstrating
how Cal Land’s conduct caused substantial and unreasonable interference with
her property (Demurrer, p. 3). Cal Land further contends that its geotechnical
report and related activities were merely advisory and did not involve control
or oversight of the construction methods allegedly responsible for the harm
(Demurrer, pp. 7-8). Moreover, Cal Land argues that the alleged interference,
including vibrations and noise, is inherently associated with permitted
construction activities and, therefore, cannot constitute a nuisance (Demurrer,
p. 8).
In opposition, Plaintiff maintains
that they sufficiently allege a cause of action for private nuisance. Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant’s negligent preparation of the geotechnical report
failed to account for known soil conditions, directly leading to property
damage (Opposition, pp. 3) Plaintiff further argues that Cal Land report
enabled improper construction methods by other parties, causing substantial and
unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of Plaintiff’s property
(Opposition pp.5-6)
In reply, Cal Land argues the lack
of proximate causation, asserting that Plaintiff has not shown a direct
connection between the report and the alleged interference. (Reply, pp. 2-3)
Cal Land distinguished its role as an advisory party, not a direct participant
in the construction activities responsible for the alleged harm (Reply
pp.3-4) 
The Court has reviewed the
Complaint and finds that Plaintiff alleges interference due to constant noise,
vibrations, and other noxious conditions (Complaint, ¶ 33). Plaintiff also
claims an inability to enjoy her backyard and worries about structural damage
to her property (Complaint, ¶¶ 40(a), 40(c)). While these allegations describe
interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her property, the connection
between Cal Land’s conduct and the alleged interference is too attenuated to
sustain a claim for private nuisance.
For substantial actual damage,
Plaintiff alleges physical damage, including structural and cosmetic cracking
(Complaint, ¶¶ 35(A), 40(b)), as well as emotional and mental distress caused
by the interference (Complaint, ¶ 39). However, Plaintiff fails to sufficiently
allege how Cal Land’s geotechnical report proximately caused these damages.
For unreasonableness, Plaintiff
claims Defendants failed to implement reasonable construction measures, such as
monitoring activities or accounting for known unstable soil conditions
(Complaint, ¶¶ 35(B)-(D)), and alleges that Defendants' conduct exceeded the
scope of their construction permits (Complaint, ¶ 36). While Plaintiff asserts
that Cal Land’s report inadequately addressed known soil conditions, this claim
lacks the specificity needed to establish that Cal Land’s actions were a
substantial factor in the alleged interference. At the pleading stage, the
Court assumes the truth of all properly pled factual allegations; however,
Plaintiff fails to sufficiently allege how Cal Land’s geotechnical report
proximately caused these damages. 
Accordingly, the Court SUSTAINS
this cause of action with leave to amend. 
Third cause of action: Public Nuisance
Public nuisances are “substantial
and unreasonable” “offenses against, or interferences with, the exercise of
rights common to the public.”  (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 305.)
Cal Land demurs to this cause of
action, arguing that the Complaint fails to allege how their conduct had any
involvement or control to constitute public nuisance (Demurrer, p. 6; Reply
p.4). In opposition, Plaintiff contends that Cal Land’s geotechnical report
facilitated construction activities that created widespread conditions,
including noise and dust pollution, which affected the surrounding community
(Opposition, p. 7). In reply, Cal Land emphasizes the absence of allegations
demonstrating how their specific actions resulted in interference with public
rights (Reply, p. 5).
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s
allegations primarily address private property damage and fail to establish how
Cal Land’s conduct interfered with a right common to the public. Although
Plaintiff alleges that “this condition affected a substantial number of people,
including Plaintiff and the properties located at 837 and 843 Monte Verde
Drive, Arcadia, California 91007” (Complaint, ¶ 49), this statement lacks
sufficient detail to demonstrate a substantial and unreasonable interference
with public rights. Therefore, Plaintiff fails to sufficiently plead a cause of
action for public nuisance.
Given this, the Court SUSTAINS the
demurrer as to this cause of action with leave to amend. 
Fourth cause of action: Trespass
To set forth a cause of action for
trespass, a plaintiff must allege (1) the plaintiff’s lawful possession or
right to possession of real property; (2) the defendant’s wrongful,
intentional, reckless, or negligent act of trespass on the property; (3) the
plaintiff did not give permission for the entry or scope of permission was
exceeded; and (4) damage to the plaintiff caused by the trespass.  (Ralphs
Grocery Co. v. Victory Consultants, Inc. (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 245,
262.)  
            Cal Land demurrers
to this cause of action arguing that Plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts
to constitute a trespass. Specifically, Cal Land argues that Plaintiff fails to
allege that Cal Land engaged in any physical entry onto Plaintiff’s property
(Demurrer, p. 7). The Complaint does not establish how Cal Land’s
actions—limited to preparing a geotechnical report—constituted an unauthorized
or wrongful intrusion (Demurrer, p. 9). And Vibrations and debris resulting
from construction activities performed by others cannot support a trespass
claim against Cal Land (Demurrer, p. 10)
In opposition, Plaintiff argues
vibrations and debris caused by construction activities facilitated by Cal
Land’s geotechnical report constitute a trespass (Opposition, p. 9). And
Plaintiff asserts that Cal Land knew or should have known its report would lead
to harmful activities, resulting in an invasion of Plaintiff’s property
(Opposition, pp. 9-10)
In reply, Cal Land argues that
trespass requires a direct and physical intrusion, which Plaintiff fails to
allege against Cal Land (Reply, p. 5). Further, Cal Land emphasizes its role
was advisory and did not involve participation in or control over construction
activities alleged to have caused the harm (Reply, pp. 5-6).
The Court finds that Plaintiff has
not sufficiently pleaded a cause of action for trespass against Cal Land.
Plaintiff fails to allege a direct or tangible intrusion onto the property by
Cal Land, as required to sustain this claim. Given Cal Land’s role in providing
geotechnical reports, as Plaintiff alleges, the Court sustains this claim
without leave to amend, as Cal Land was not directly involved in the
construction activities that allegedly caused the harm.
The Court SUSTAINS this cause of
action without leave to amend. 
IV.       ORDER
The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer as
to the second and third causes of action, with 20 days leave to amend.
The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer as
to the fourth cause of action, without leave to amend.
Cal Land to give notice.
