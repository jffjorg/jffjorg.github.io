  Case Number:  24NNCV00253    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2024    Dept:  P  [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF'SMOTION TO
COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES - SET ONE and
GRANTING MONETARY SANCTIONSI.         INTRODUCTION
This is a collection action for recovery of unpaid nursing home bills.
Plaintiff, AG Arcadia, LLC, a California Limited Liability Company doing
business as Huntington Drive Health and Rehabilitation Center (“Plaintiff”),
filed this action against Defendant Rebecca Schasa, also known as Rebecca
Rodriguez, individually and as trustee of the Abraham Rodriguez and Stella
Rodriguez Trusts (“Defendant”), seeking damages for the unpaid balance of
nursing home services provided to Defendant’s mother, Stella Rodriguez.
On March 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed the original complaint, and on
November 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint (FAC).
On November 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel
further responses to Special Interrogatories - Set One. On December 6, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a notice of non-opposition, noting that Defendant failed to
oppose the motion.
 
Meet and confer
A motion to compel further discovery responses must be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration stating, “facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(2); 2016.040.)
Here, On October 28, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed a meet-and-confer
letter to Defendant’s counsel addressing the deficiencies in Defendant’s
responses. Plaintiff’s counsel requested that Defendant provide verified,
code-compliant responses by November 7, 2024, or Plaintiff would proceed with
this motion. Despite this effort, Defendant’s counsel failed to respond or
provide any further responses (Wilson Decl., ¶ 7).
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
A motion to compel a further
response to interrogatories or production of documents must be noticed within
45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing.  (Cal. Code of Civ.
Proc. §§ 2030.300(c), 2031.310(c); see also Sexton v. Superior Court
(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1409; Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 685).) Otherwise, the propounding party waives any
right to compel further responses. (Id.) The 45-day time limit is
mandatory and jurisdictional.  (Sexton, supra,58 Cal. App. 4th at
1410.)   
            An
unverified response is tantamount to no response at all. (See Appleton v.
Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  However, objections
to interrogatories and requests for production are not required to be verified
because “objections are legal conclusions interposed by counsel, not factual
assertions by a party.” (Blue Ridge Insurance Co. v. Superior Court
(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 339, 345.)
III.      ANALYSIS
            Plaintiff
moves the court to compel Defendant to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s
Special Interrogatories to Rebecca Schasa - Set One and for an award of
monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,018.50. 
Plaintiff propounded the Special
Interrogatories on August 20, 2024. After granting Defendant multiple
extensions, the responses were due by October 22, 2024. However, Defendant’s
responses were incomplete, unverified, and contained meritless objections.
Additionally, Defendant failed to provide any substantive responses to Special
Interrogatory Nos. 9 through 25. (Motion, p. 3; Wilson Decl.¶ 6)
Specifically, Plaintiff argues that
Defendant failed to respond entirely to Special Interrogatory Nos. 9 through
25. Defendant’s failure to respond constitutes a violation of California Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.250(a), which mandates that responses be
verified under oath. Unverified responses are tantamount to no response at all
(Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636). Moreover,
by failing to timely provide substantive responses, Defendant waived all
objections to these interrogatories, including those asserted in her deficient
responses (CCP § 2030.290(a); see also Leach v. Sup. Ct. (Markum) (1980)
111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906) (Separate Statement, pp. 6–8)
The Court finds that Plaintiff is
entitled to an order compelling verified, code-compliant responses to
Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories to Rebecca Schasa - Set One. Given that
this motion is unopposed, Defendant’s failure to provide substantive answers to
these interrogatories, coupled with her failure to verify the responses,
establishes grounds for granting Plaintiff’s motion. 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further response to Special Interrogatories to
Rebecca Schasa - Set One.
Sanctions
Code of Civil Procedure §2023.030
grants the court discretion to impose sanctions against any party engaging in a
misuse of the discovery process. Misuse includes the failure to respond to
authorized discovery methods or disobeying a court order to provide discovery.
(Code Civ. Proc., §2023.010, subds. (d), (g).) Further, CCP §2030.300(d)
mandates that the court impose monetary sanctions against any party who
unsuccessfully opposes a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories,
unless that party acted with substantial justification or if imposing sanctions
would be unjust.
Here, the motion is unopposed, and
Defendant has provided no substantial justification for her failure to respond
to Plaintiff’s discovery requests or to verify her responses. Defendant’s
conduct constitutes misuse of the discovery process under CCP sections
2023.010(d) and 2023.030(a).
Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions in the amount of $1,018.50 for attorney’s fees and costs incurred in
bringing this motion. Plaintiff’s counsel declares that Plaintiff has incurred
2.7 hours of attorney time at $355.00 per hour and a filing fee of $60.00, for
a total of $1,018.50 (Wilson Decl., ¶ 9). Additionally, Plaintiff anticipates
spending another 2.5 hours to review any opposition, prepare a reply, and
attend the hearing, and therefore requests an additional $887.50 in sanctions
if the motion is opposed, for a total of $1,906.00 (Wilson Decl., ¶ 9).
The Court finds that Defendant’s
failure to provide verified, substantive responses and her failure to oppose
this motion justify the imposition of sanctions. Accordingly, the Court reduces
the requested sanctions and finds that $355 per hour is a reasonable hourly
rate. The Court awards 1.5 hours for drafting this motion and an additional 1
hour for attending the hearing, along with the $60 filing fee, for a total of
$887.50 in sanctions.
Since this motion is unopposed, the
Court declines to grant Plaintiff’s additional request for sanctions. Defendant
Rebecca Schasa is ordered to pay $887.50 to Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 days
of this order.
            IV.       CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
            The Court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to Special
Interrogatories to Rebecca Schasa - Set One. Defendant is to provide verified,
code-compliant responses, without objections, within 20 days of this order.
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff monetary
sanctions in the amount of $887.50 against Defendant. Defendant is ordered to
pay the sanctions within 20 days of this order.
            Plaintiff
is to give notice.
