The judge also noted that the defendants failed to comply with the meet and confer requirements when filing the motion, but this failure did not affect the ruling.

## English Text Summary

In this tentative ruling, Judge T. Megna grants Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings in the case of Megna Real Estate Management Inc. vs. Milestone Financial LLC and William R. Stuart.

The court found that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring the action because it no longer owns the property at the center of the dispute. The property's title was transferred to Megna Bell Gardens Office Complex, Inc. in February 2022, while the alleged wrongful foreclosure by Defendants occurred in November 2022.  Therefore, Plaintiff, who filed the lawsuit in March 2023, does not have the legal right to pursue this claim.

Despite Plaintiff's arguments and attempts to amend the Complaint, the court determined that the pleading defects were significant enough to warrant dismissal without the opportunity for further revision.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend. The defendants, Milestone Financial LLC and William R. Stuart, argued that the plaintiff, Megna Real Estate Management Inc., lacks standing to bring the action because the title ownership of the property was transferred from the plaintiff to non-party Megna Bell Gardens Office Complex, Inc. on February 3, 2022. The plaintiff alleged that it had title ownership of the property on July 2, 2020, when the defendants allegedly committed misconduct in taking steps to foreclose on the property. However, the plaintiff's contentions are belied by the allegations in the complaint, which show that the alleged wrongful conduct occurred when the property was owned by Bell, not the plaintiff. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's opposition to the motion was filed late, infringing upon the defendants' due process rights to timely file a reply.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings without leave to amend. The Plaintiff, Megna Real Estate Management Inc., lacks standing to file the instant action because the property's title ownership was transferred to Megna Bell Gardens Office Complex, Inc. on February 3, 2022. The Plaintiff's allegations in the Complaint are belied by the fact that they entered into a Loan Modification Agreement in May 2022, after the title ownership was transferred, and made payments commencing on June 1, 2022. The alleged wrongful conduct by the Defendants occurred when Megna Bell Gardens Office Complex, Inc. held title to the property, and therefore the Plaintiff does not have standing to bring this action. The Judge has considered the untimely opposition filed by the Plaintiff and has granted the Defendants' Request for Judicial Notice, but not as to hearsay or facts in dispute. The motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted without leave to amend.

English Summary:
The tentative ruling is for Case Number 23VECV01007, heard on September 20, 2023 by Dept T MEGNA REAL ESTATE v MILESTONE. The Judge grants Defendants Milestone Financial LLC and William R. Stuart’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings without leave to amend, and grants their Request for Judicial Notice but not as to hearsay or facts in dispute. The Judge found that Defendants failed to comply with the meet and confer requirements, but it was not grounds to grant or deny the motion. Plaintiff Megna Real Estate Management Inc.’s opposition was filed 9 days late, but because Defendants addressed the substance of the opposition, the Court considered it. The Judge found that Plaintiff lacked standing to file the action as the property’s title ownership was transferred to Megna Bell Gardens Office Complex, Inc. on February 3, 2022. Plaintiff’s argument that the COAs are sufficiently alleged was insufficient to save the Complaint from the motion’s issue related to standing.
