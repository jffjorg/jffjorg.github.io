And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted without leave to amend. The defendants, Milestone Financial LLC and William R. Stuart, argued that the plaintiff, Megna Real Estate Management Inc., lacks standing to bring the action because the property's title ownership was transferred to a non-party, Megna Bell Gardens Office Complex, Inc., on February 3, 2022. The plaintiff alleged that it had title ownership of the property on July 2, 2020, but the allegations in the complaint contradict this claim. Despite the plaintiff's untimely opposition, the judge considered the substance of the opposition and found that the plaintiff does not have standing to bring the action. The judge also noted that the defendants failed to comply with the meet and confer requirements when filing the motion, but this failure did not affect the ruling.
