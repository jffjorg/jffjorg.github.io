And here is the English summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Air Malibu Canyon LLC (Plaintiff) against Donte Bell (Defendant). The Defendant demurred to the Plaintiff's Complaint, arguing that the 3-day notice was defective because it did not give an alternative to stopping legal matters. However, the Judge found that the Plaintiff provided a 30-day notice to pay or quit, which sufficed to show that the Defendant was given an option to either pay or quit. The Judge also noted that the action is grounded on the Defendant's failure to pay rent, and therefore the Defendant's reliance on Code of Civil Procedure section 1161(3) is irrelevant. As a result, the Judge has overruled the Defendant's demurrer and ordered the Defendant to file an Answer within 5 days.
