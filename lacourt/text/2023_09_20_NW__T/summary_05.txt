## English Summary:

In this case, Air Malibu Canyon LLC (Plaintiff) filed an unlawful detainer action against Donte Bell (Defendant) for failing to pay rent. Defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that the 3-day notice to vacate was defective because it didn't offer an alternative to stopping legal proceedings. 

However, the Judge overruled the demurrer. The Judge reasoned that the 30-day notice to pay or quit served by Plaintiff sufficiently provided Defendant with an option to either pay rent or vacate the property. The Judge also stated that Plaintiff is not obligated to give Defendant an option to "stop" legal actions in this case, as the basis for the unlawful detainer action is solely Defendant's failure to pay rent.  Defendant is now required to file an answer to the complaint within 5 days.
