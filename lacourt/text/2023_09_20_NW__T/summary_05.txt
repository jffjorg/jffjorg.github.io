## English Summary:

In this case, Air Malibu Canyon LLC (Plaintiff) filed an unlawful detainer action against Donte Bell (Defendant) for failing to pay rent. Defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that the 3-day notice to vacate was defective because it didn't offer an alternative to stopping legal proceedings. 

However, the Judge overruled the demurrer. The Judge reasoned that the 30-day notice to pay or quit served by Plaintiff sufficiently provided Defendant with an option to either pay rent or vacate the property. The Judge also stated that Plaintiff is not obligated to give Defendant an option to "stop" legal actions in this case, as the basis for the unlawful detainer action is solely Defendant's failure to pay rent.  Defendant is now required to file an answer to the complaint within 5 days.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the Defendant's demurrer to the Complaint is overruled. The Defendant had argued that the 3-day notice to vacate was defective because it did not give an alternative option to "stop" legal matters. However, the judge found that the notice attached to the Complaint provided a 30-day option to pay or quit, which sufficiently showed that the Defendant was given an option to either pay or quit. Since the action is grounded on the Defendant's failure to pay rent, the judge found that the Defendant's reliance on Code of Civil Procedure section 1161(3) is irrelevant. The judge has therefore ordered the Defendant to file an Answer within 5 days.
