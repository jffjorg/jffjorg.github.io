* **Defendant:** GM

**Issues:**

This case involves a dispute over a vehicle battery model. Plaintiff Khalili is seeking documents from Defendant GM regarding this specific battery model.

**Specific Findings:**

* **Monetary Sanctions:** Denied. No amount was specified in the motion.
* **Overbroad/Burdensome/Oppressive Objections:** Overruled by the judge for several requests. GM must produce documents relating to the specific battery model in question.
* **Vague/Ambiguous Objections:** Overruled by the judge for several requests. GM must provide clearer and more complete responses.
* **Improper Discovery:**  The judge sustained objections regarding requests for pre-trial discovery of financial condition for potential punitive damages, citing Civil Code section 3295(c) and specific case law (Santana and Donlen).
* **Requests for Explanation:** The judge requires plaintiff's counsel to clarify a reference to "Zagarian" in their request for a declaration.

**Next Steps:**

GM is required to provide a "Code compliant" response and production of documents with a compliance statement and privilege log within 20 days for the identified requests. The judge will hear arguments on certain remaining requests.
