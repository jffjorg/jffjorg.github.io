  Case Number:  22STCV26908    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2023    Dept:  T 22STCV26908 Fouad v Jones[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Defendant Jones & Jones Management Group, Inc’s Motion to Strike
Punitive Damages is GRANTED WITH 20 DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND. Leave to amend is to
correct the pleading deficiency and not to add any new causes of action.

Introduction 

Defendant Jones & Jones Management Group, Inc.
(Defendant) moved to strike Plaintiff Kinda Fouad’s (Plaintiff) request for
punitive damages.          

Discussion  

Defendant argued that the request for punitive damages
failed to allege specific facts to show malice and failed to allege specific
facts to show that the misconduct was authorized or ratified by an officer,
director or managing agent or that there was prior knowledge.  Because Plaintiffs alleged that they notified
Defendant about the uninhabitable conditions and Defendant failed to remedy the
conditions for over two years (Compl. par. 14,) there are sufficient facts
plead to support the element of malice and/or reckless disregard for
Plaintiffs’ rights or safety.  However,
the facts are insufficiently alleged to show that the reckless disregard was by
a director, officer, or managing agent or was ratified by such a person.  Plaintiffs’ reliance upon Complaint paragraph
2 alleging that Defendant was the managing agent of the property is
insufficient.  Sufficient pleading
requires that the misconduct was either attributed to or ratified by
Defendant’s director, officer, or managing agent.  Being a managing agent of the property is not
the same as a corporate director, officer, or managing agent.

The motion to strike is GRANTED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.  Leave to amend is to correct the pleading
deficiency and not to add any new causes of action.

IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
