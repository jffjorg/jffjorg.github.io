The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's motion to strike the Plaintiff's request for punitive damages. The Judge grants the motion, but with 20 days' leave for the Plaintiff to amend the pleading. The Judge finds that while the Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to show malice and/or reckless disregard for their rights or safety, the pleading is deficient in that it fails to specify that the misconduct was authorized or ratified by a director, officer, or managing agent of the Defendant. The Judge holds that being a managing agent of the property is not the same as a corporate director, officer, or managing agent. The Plaintiff will have the opportunity to correct the pleading deficiency, but not to add new causes of action.

## English Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of *Fouad v Jones*.  The Defendant, Jones & Jones Management Group, Inc., moved to strike the Plaintiff's request for punitive damages. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's complaint adequately alleged facts showing malice on the part of the Defendant due to their failure to remedy known uninhabitable conditions for over two years. However, the complaint was lacking in demonstrating that this recklessness was specifically attributable to a director, officer, or managing agent of the company. Therefore, the Judge granted the motion to strike the punitive damages claim but gave the Plaintiff 20 days to amend their complaint and correct this pleading deficiency. The amendment should only address the existing claim and not introduce new causes of action.

The Judge grants Defendant Jones & Jones Management Group, Inc.'s motion to strike Plaintiff Kinda Fouad's request for punitive damages with a 20-day leave to amend. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's request for punitive damages fails to allege specific facts to show malice and fails to allege specific facts to show that the misconduct was authorized or ratified by an officer, director, or managing agent or that there was prior knowledge. However, the Judge acknowledges that there are sufficient facts pleaded to support the element of malice and/or reckless disregard for Plaintiffs’ rights or safety. However, the facts are insufficiently alleged to show that the reckless disregard was by a director, officer, or managing agent or was ratified by such a person. Plaintiffs’ reliance upon Complaint paragraph 2 alleging that Defendant was the managing agent of the property is insufficient. Sufficient pleading requires that the misconduct was either attributed to or ratified by Defendant's director, officer, or managing agent. Being a managing agent of the property is not the same as a corporate director, officer, or managing agent. The order is to correct the pleading deficiency and not to add any new causes of action.

**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023
**Department:** T

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Kinda Fouad
* **Defendant:** Jones & Jones Management Group, Inc.

**Significant Statements:**

* The Court **grants** Defendant's motion to strike Plaintiff's request for punitive damages **with 20 days leave to amend**. 
* Plaintiff's complaint fails to sufficiently allege that the misconduct was committed by or ratified by a director, officer, or managing agent of the Defendant corporation.

**Facts and Disputes:**

* Plaintiff alleges Defendant failed to remedy uninhabitable conditions at a property for over two years after being notified.
* Defendant argues Plaintiff's complaint fails to allege specific facts showing malice necessary for punitive damages.

**Legal Analysis:**

* The Court finds Plaintiff's allegations of Defendant's two-year delay in addressing uninhabitable conditions are sufficient to support a finding of malice.
* However, Plaintiff's reliance on a general allegation that Defendant was the managing agent of the property is insufficient to show that the misconduct was attributed to or ratified by a corporate director, officer, or managing agent.

**Actions:**

* Plaintiff has 20 days to amend their complaint to correct the pleading deficiency and sufficiently allege the involvement of a corporate director, officer, or managing agent in the alleged misconduct.


## English Summary

The judge granted the Defendant's request to remove Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages from the lawsuit.  The judge found that the Plaintiff's complaint did not sufficiently explain how the Defendant corporation acted with malice, specifically by a corporate director, officer, or managing agent. While the judge acknowledged that the Plaintiff's allegations of the Defendant ignoring uninhabitable conditions for two years could demonstrate malice, they needed to provide more detailed information about who within the corporation was responsible for this inaction.  The Plaintiff has 20 days to revise their complaint and provide the necessary details.

---

In this tentative ruling, the judge grants Defendant Jones & Jones Management Group, Inc.'s motion to strike Plaintiff Kinda Fouad's request for punitive damages. The ruling is granted with 20 days leave to amend, allowing Plaintiff to correct the pleading deficiency but not add any new causes of action. The judge finds that there are sufficient facts pleaded to support the element of malice or reckless disregard for Plaintiff's rights or safety. However, the facts are insufficiently alleged to show that the reckless disregard was by a director, officer, or managing agent or was ratified by such a person. Plaintiff's reliance on Defendant being the managing agent of the property is insufficient, as it does not establish a connection to a corporate director, officer, or managing agent.
