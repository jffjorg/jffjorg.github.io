And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's motion to strike the Plaintiff's request for punitive damages. The Judge grants the motion, but with 20 days' leave for the Plaintiff to amend the pleading. The Judge finds that while the Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to show malice and/or reckless disregard for their rights or safety, the pleading is deficient in that it fails to specify that the misconduct was authorized or ratified by a director, officer, or managing agent of the Defendant. The Judge holds that being a managing agent of the property is not the same as a corporate director, officer, or managing agent. The Plaintiff will have the opportunity to correct the pleading deficiency, but not to add new causes of action.
