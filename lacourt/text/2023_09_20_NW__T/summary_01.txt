The Judge grants the motion, but with 20 days' leave for the Plaintiff to amend the pleading. The Judge finds that while the Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to show malice and/or reckless disregard for their rights or safety, the pleading is deficient in that it fails to specify that the misconduct was authorized or ratified by a director, officer, or managing agent of the Defendant. The Judge holds that being a managing agent of the property is not the same as a corporate director, officer, or managing agent. The Plaintiff will have the opportunity to correct the pleading deficiency, but not to add new causes of action.

## English Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of *Fouad v Jones*.  The Defendant, Jones & Jones Management Group, Inc., moved to strike the Plaintiff's request for punitive damages. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's complaint adequately alleged facts showing malice on the part of the Defendant due to their failure to remedy known uninhabitable conditions for over two years. However, the complaint was lacking in demonstrating that this recklessness was specifically attributable to a director, officer, or managing agent of the company. Therefore, the Judge granted the motion to strike the punitive damages claim but gave the Plaintiff 20 days to amend their complaint and correct this pleading deficiency. The amendment should only address the existing claim and not introduce new causes of action.

---

The Judge grants Defendant Jones & Jones Management Group, Inc.'s motion to strike Plaintiff Kinda Fouad's request for punitive damages with a 20-day leave to amend. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's request for punitive damages fails to allege specific facts to show malice and fails to allege specific facts to show that the misconduct was authorized or ratified by an officer, director, or managing agent or that there was prior knowledge. However, the Judge acknowledges that there are sufficient facts pleaded to support the element of malice and/or reckless disregard for Plaintiffs’ rights or safety. However, the facts are insufficiently alleged to show that the reckless disregard was by a director, officer, or managing agent or was ratified by such a person. Plaintiffs’ reliance upon Complaint paragraph 2 alleging that Defendant was the managing agent of the property is insufficient. Sufficient pleading requires that the misconduct was either attributed to or ratified by Defendant's director, officer, or managing agent. Being a managing agent of the property is not the same as a corporate director, officer, or managing agent. The order is to correct the pleading deficiency and not to add any new causes of action.
