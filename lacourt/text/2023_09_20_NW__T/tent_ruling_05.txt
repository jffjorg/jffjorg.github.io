 Case Number:  23VECV03177    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2023    Dept:  T 23VECV03177 AIR MALIBU V BELL
[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Defendant Donte Bell’s Demurrer to the Complaint is OVERRULED.  Defendant shall file an Answer within 5 days.
Introduction 
Defendant Donte Bell (Defendant) demurred to Plaintiff Air
Malibu Canyon LLC’s (Plaintiff) Complaint. 
The demurrer placed into issue the Complaint’s single cause of action
(COA) for unlawful detainer.  Plaintiff
has not filed an opposition.  
Discussion  
Defendant argued that the 3-day notice was defective because
it only ordered Defendant to vacate without giving an alternative of stopping
any legal matters.  Defendant’s argument
is unpersuasive because Plaintiff provided a 30-day notice to pay or quit.  The notice attached to the Complaint
sufficiently showed that Defendant was given the option to either pay or
quit.  (Code Civ. Proc. sec.
1161(2).)  Plaintiff alleged that this
unlawful detainer action is grounded on Defendant’s failure to pay rent.    Plaintiff is not required to give Defendant
an option to “stop” legal matters. 
Defendant’s reliance on Code of Civil Procedure section 1161(3) is
irrelevant because the action is grounded on a failure to pay rent.  Defendant’s demurrer is unpersuasive.
The demurrer to the Complaint is OVERRULED.  
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
