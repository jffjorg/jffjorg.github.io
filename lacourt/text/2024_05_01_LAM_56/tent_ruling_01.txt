BACKGROUND
This action arises
out of alleged mishandling of Plaintiffs’ investment property.  The currently operative second amended
complaint (the “SAC”) alleges: (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) California
financial elder abuse; (3) Illinois financial elder abuse; (4) breach of
contract; (5) breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing; (6) aiding
and abetting breach of fiduciary duty; (7) negligence; (8) violation of
Business & Professions Code sections 17200 and 17500; (9) common law fraud;
and (10) negligent misrepresentation.  
 
On March 22, 2024,
Defendant filed a motion to quash Deposition Subpoena for Production of
Consumer Records to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC
Subpoena”).
 
DISCUSSION
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.1
authorizes courts to quash a subpoena entirely, modify it, or direct compliance
with it upon the court’s own terms and conditions, including protective orders.
In addition, the court may take other appropriate means to protect parties or
nonparties “from unreasonable or oppressive demands, including unreasonable
violations of the right of privacy.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (a).)
Discovery devices are meant to facilitate litigation, not wage it. (Calcor
Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216,
221.) 
 
Where privacy rights are at stake,
“[t]he party asserting a privacy right must establish a legally protected
privacy interest, an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the given
circumstances, and a threatened intrusion that is serious. The party seeking
information may raise in response whatever legitimate and important
countervailing interests disclosure serves, while the party seeking protection
may identify feasible alternatives that serve the same interests or protective
measures that would diminish the loss of privacy. A court must then balance
these competing considerations. . . . Courts must instead place the burden on
the party asserting a privacy interest to establish its extent and the
seriousness of the prospective invasion, and against that showing must weigh
the countervailing interests the opposing party identifies. . . . What suffices
to justify an invasion will . . . vary according to the context. Only obvious
invasions of interests fundamental to personal autonomy must be supported by a
compelling interest.” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal. 5th 531,
552-557 (internal citations omitted).) In instances in which the interests at
stake are fundamental to personal autonomy, the party seeking discovery must
demonstrate that the information is directly relevant to the issues in the action,
and that there is a compelling public interest in the disclosure of the
information that outweighs the right to privacy  (Board of Trustees v.
Superior Court (1981) 119 Cal.App.3d 516, 525.)

Defendant argues that the SEC subpoena
is excessively broad and seeks documents that could include privileged,
confidential, or irrelevant information without any direct connection to the
case. Defendant asserts that the SEC subpoena covers a wide range of documents
concerning Centaurus and other entities over the past fifteen years. Defendant
states: “[t]he law
recognizes the important public policy interest served by shielding information
disclosed as between FINRA-member firms such as Centaurus and securities
industry regulators such as the SEC, to preserve and promote full disclosure
between FINRA-member firms and regulators, including the interests in
‘encouraging witness cooperation and maintaining the integrity of [regulators’]
investigative techniques and files,’ which is needed to maintain effective
industry self regulation. (Ross v. Bolton, 106 F.R.D. 22, 23 (S.D.N.Y.
1985).” (Id.) In the alternative, Defendant requests an order modifying
the SEC Subpoena to require that any documents produced by the SEC be produced
to Defendant first to review for privilege/confidentiality.
 
In opposition, Plaintiffs assert the
SEC Subpoena seeks relevant information that directly pertains to their claims
against Defendant. They allege that CFI breached its fiduciary duty by failing
to disclose negative information about Tony Thompson and TNP-affiliates,
including prior lawsuits, foreclosures, and regulatory investigations,
information that Defendant knew or should have known. Plaintiffs contend that
the documents requested in the SEC Subpoena will provide essential insights
into Defendant’s knowledge and actions, particularly concerning due diligence
and potential misrepresentations about investment risks.
 
Plaintiffs assert that Defendant’s
confidentiality arguments were rejected in Kirkland v. Sup. Ct. (2002)
95 Cal.App.4th 92, where the court found similar documents to be discoverable
and rejected claims that such information, unless made public, should be
treated as confidential according to California law. Specifically, the
plaintiff in Kirkland sought “all testimony, complaints, reports, and
other documents regarding the SEC’s investigation of PLB, Western, and Pacific
[defendant and certain non-party entities].” (Kirkland, supra, 95
Cal.App.4th at 95.) There, the defendant objected to the plaintiff’s requests
on the grounds that they called for the production of confidential documents
relating to a private SEC investigation. (Id.) The court disagreed and
stated there is “no law to support [defendant’s] claim that the SEC testimony
and documents should as a matter of policy be treated as private or
confidential, and the law that does exist supports the opposite conclusion.” (Id.
at 98.) Similarly here, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant fails to substantiate with
evidence the confidentiality of the documents in question. Furthermore, Plaintiff
points out that Defendant has not even clarified the nature of the alleged
trade secrets or confidential information supposedly disclosed to the SEC, nor
is there any demonstrated agreement that enforces such confidentiality.
 
In reply, Defendant argues that
Plaintiffs’ reliance on Kirkland is misplaced because the circumstances
differ significantly from those in the current case. There, the discovery
requests were directed to a party directly involved in the litigation, and the
documents requested were specifically related to investigations and
transactions that were directly relevant to the claims in that litigation. Further,
the documents sought were already in the possession of the party being
subpoenaed and pertained directly to allegations of fraud in which the party
was implicated. In contrast, Defendant asserts that here, Plaintiffs seek all
documents related to Defendant from the SEC, without tailoring their requests
to specifically relevant investigation documents concerning the particular
investments or Plaintiffs themselves. Defendant points out that there is no SEC
investigation specifically involving Plaintiffs or the particular investment
product in question.
 
The Court finds that the requested
documents are relevant to the issues of this case, specifically in determining
whether Defendant conducted adequate due diligence and disclosed all material
facts to Plaintiffs regarding the investments in question. These documents,
which include communications, complaints, disciplinary actions and SEC
investigation transcripts, would assist Plaintiffs in assessing the extent of Defendant’s
knowledge of any prior misconduct, regulatory investigations and legal issues
involving Tony Thompson and the TNP-affiliates. Such information would further
assist Plaintiffs in developing their claims of fraud and breach of fiduciary
duty. 
 
The Court does not find that the
information sought by the SEC Subpoena contains sensitive information and
implicates privacy concerns. The Court notes that while the time period
specified in the SEC Subpoena is for a considerable period of time, namely
January 1, 2008 to the present, the time period alleged in the SAC goes back to
2008, such that information regarding Defendant’s communications with the SEC–
at least to the time period for which documents are sought by the SEC Subpoena
– is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
 
Accordingly, the Motion is DENIED as
to the SEC Subpoena.
 
DEFENDANT is ordered to give notice of
this ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
