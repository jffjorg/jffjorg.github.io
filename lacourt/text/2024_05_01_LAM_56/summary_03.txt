And here is the summary in English text:

The Court has considered the motion for summary adjudication filed by the City of Monterey Park (Plaintiff) against Center Int'l Investments, Inc. (Defendant). The Court has granted the motion with respect to three affirmative defenses: the first, fourth, and sixth affirmative defenses. The Court has found that these affirmative defenses are meritless as a matter of law.

The first affirmative defense, which asserts that the complaint does not state a cause of action, is meritless because the Defendant has conceded that the pleadings sufficiently state a cause of action for eminent domain.

The fourth affirmative defense, which asserts that the use of eminent domain is improper, is meritless because the City's resolution of necessity was adopted after a noticed public hearing and is supported by substantial evidence.

The sixth affirmative defense, which asserts that the City failed to plan in a manner most compatible with the greatest public good and least private injury, is meritless because the City's resolution of necessity provides a presumption of entitlement to take the subject property by eminent domain.

The Court has declined to address the Defendant's alternative arguments for summary adjudication.
