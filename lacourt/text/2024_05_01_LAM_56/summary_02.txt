And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to quash the deposition subpoenas. The judge finds that the requested documents are relevant to the issues in the case and that the plaintiff's need for the information outweighs the defendant's privacy concerns. The judge also notes that the defendant's claims of privilege are limited to tax returns and related documents, and that the plaintiff already possesses some of the requested information. The judge orders the defendant to produce some of the requested documents, but not tax returns or other confidential financial information. The judge also denies the defendant's request for monetary sanctions.
