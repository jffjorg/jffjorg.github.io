## English Summary:

The judge is considering a case where Lee Ouye is suing Ronald Hegge and William J. Beverly for damages related to their actions within a partnership called Mertz-Del Amo (MDA). Ouye alleges Hegge interfered with his partnership rights and that Beverly misappropriated partnership funds. 

The judge overruled Hegge's demurrer to Ouye's claims because they found Ouye presented enough evidence to suggest Hegge was a party to the partnership agreement, even if it wasn't explicitly stated.  

However, the judge sustained Beverly's demurrer regarding Ouye's conversion claim. The judge found that Ouye didn't sufficiently allege that Beverly directly converted money belonging to him personally, but rather that he mismanaged funds belonging to the partnership. Ouye has 20 days to amend his complaint to strengthen his argument.

significant\_statements:
- "At this stage, plaintiff may allege claims against Hegge on the basis that he is a party to the contract."

- "Plaintiff may allege breach of contract on the theory that Hegge was a party to the contract because Hegge ‘purports to be’ one."
- "Plaintiff ultimately might not succeed in his contention that appointing Hegge as a managing partner was invalid."
- "The tort cause of action for interference with contract does not lie against a party to the contract."
- "Plaintiff does not allege Beverly converted specific identifiable sums of money held in trust for plaintiff’s benefit."
- "Diminishing “the value of Plaintiff’s shares” is not exercising dominion over plaintiff’s personal property."
- "Plaintiff does not allege Beverly took his shares."
- "These allegations are equivalent to any breach of fiduciary duty that harms a partnership."
- "That Beverly allegedly harmed the partnership by taking money from it does not suffice to constitute a viable conversion claim by one of the partners."
- "Plaintiff’s reliance on SP Investment is misplaced."
- "Plaintiff also does not allege facts showing he had ownership of or the right to possess the money Beverly allegedly converted."

Summary:
The tentative ruling overrules Defendant Ronald Hegge's demurrer to the second amended complaint for the first, second, and eighth causes of action. The ruling finds that plaintiff Lee Ouye alleges sufficient facts for these causes of action, including Breach of Partnership Agreement, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, and Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations. The ruling also sustains Defendant William J. Beverly's demurrer to the second amended complaint's third cause of action for Conversion, with 20 days' leave to amend. The ruling finds that plaintiff does not allege sufficient facts to constitute conversion, as plaintiff does not allege ownership or right to possession of property, and the allegations are equivalent to any breach of fiduciary duty that harms a partnership.
