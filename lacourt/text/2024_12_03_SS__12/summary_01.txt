* "A party requesting that a record be filed under seal must file a motion or an application for an order sealing the record. The motion or application must be accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify the sealing."
* "The court must not permit a record to be filed under seal based solely on the agreement or stipulation of the parties."

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Defendant's unopposed motion to file a confidential settlement agreement and declaration under seal is denied. The Judge found that the Defendant's declaration did not provide sufficient facts to support the requested sealing order. The Judge noted that the public has an interest in ensuring that a plaintiff is not taking monies that fairly belong to the class in a class action settlement, and that the court's decision on this issue should be subject to public scrutiny. The Judge also found that the Defendant did not make a specific showing of serious injury that would result from the public filing of the settlement agreement and declaration, and therefore the motion must be denied.
