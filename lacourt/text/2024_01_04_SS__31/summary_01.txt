```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies Plaintiff Sandra Salvador's motion to compel further production of documents, specifically exterior bus video footage, from Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The judge finds that Plaintiff's contention that Defendant is concealing existing footage is without support. The judge notes that Defendant has already produced its entire DVR bus videos, which consisted of 7 cameras, and that the inoperable camera was a right curbside directed camera. The judge also finds that Plaintiff received verified responses regarding the videos by way of Defendant's production on September 29, 2020 in response to Plaintiff's Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. As a result, the judge denies the motion and also denies Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions.
