January 1, 2010] and an outdated proposed order on MC-351 [Rev. January 1, 2010] for both Claimants. Petitioner must use the most current versions, namely MC-350EX [Rev. January 1, 2021] and MC-351 [Rev. January 1, 2021].   Further, Petitioner does not provide the reasons for the apportionment of the settlement payments between the claimant and each other plaintiff or claimant named on Attachment 13, and does not identify the other party whom the attorney is representing in this matter and explain the relationship in Attachment 19a. The Court notes that the itemization numbers between the 2010 and 2021 forms are different. For any items marked by Petitioner in the new form that requires an Attachment, Petitioner must provide the corresponding requisite information.   Petitioner must reserve a new date and file a new petition curing the above-noted defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
