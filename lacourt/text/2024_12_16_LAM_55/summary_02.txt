And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Plaintiffs' Motion to Exonerate Undertaking. The Plaintiffs brought the case against the Defendants in relation to a loan and deed of trust for a property in Tarzana, California. The Court granted a preliminary injunction enjoining the foreclosure sale of the deed of trust and required the Plaintiffs to post an undertaking (bond). The Court later granted summary judgment in favor of the Defendants. The Plaintiffs argued that the bond should be exonerated because the preliminary injunction was automatically lifted upon adjudication in favor of the Defendants and there is no longer any basis to maintain the litigation bond. However, the Court disagrees and finds that the bond remains necessary because the Defendant's appeal of the Court's judgment is still pending in the Court of Appeal, and the Defendants cannot recover damages caused by the preliminary injunction until the appeal is finally determined.
