LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part: 
“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party
to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party,
or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored

 “(g) (1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. 
“(2) On motion of any other party who, in person or by
attorney, attended at the time and place specified in the deposition notice in
the expectation that the deponent’s testimony would be taken, the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
in favor of that party and against the deponent or the party with whom the
deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .”

Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (a), (b), (g).) 
DISCUSSION 
On
February 7, 2024, Resort filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition and
for sanctions.   On April 24, 2024,
Resort filed a supplemental declaration stating that the parties had agreed to
conduct Plaintiff’s deposition on May 17, 2024.  Resort agreed to waive monetary sanctions.  Resort’s supplemental declaration asked the Court to
order Plaintiff to appear for the May 17, 2024 deposition. 
It has been more than one month since May 17,
2024.  Resort has not informed the Court whether the May 17, 2024 deposition took place.  The Court will assume the
deposition took place and take this motion off calendar. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court takes off calendar Defendant Kelly Mac dba
Diamond Valley RV Resort’s motion to compel Plaintiff Rosa Reyes’s deposition and for sanctions. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
