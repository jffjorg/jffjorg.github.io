             Defendant demurrers to Plaintiff’s
complaint. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Marisela
Fernandez’s claim that she suffered injuries as a result of a trip and fall
incident that occurred on October 13, 2021, at a Trader Joe’s store located at
3035 E. Huntington Dr. Pasadena 91107. Plaintiff filed this complaint on May
25, 2023. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED
with 20 days leave to amend.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
A general
demurrer may be taken to a complaint where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).) A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial
notice.  (Code Civ. Proc. section
430.30(a).)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or
other extrinsic matters.  (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is
whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.  (Hahn v.
Mirda, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Additionally, a
special demurrer to a complaint may be brought on the ground the pleading is
uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. Code Civ. Proc section 430.10(f); Beresford Neighborhood Assn. v. City of
San Mateo (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1180, 1191.) A demurrer based
on uncertainty is disfavored and will be strictly construed even when the
pleading is uncertain in some respects. (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) A demurrers based on uncertainty are “granted only if
the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably
respond.” (Lickiss v. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (2012) 208
Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Defendant demurrers to Plaintiff’s complaint on the ground that Plaintiff
fails to plead factual allegations sufficient to state a claim.
 
“The elements of a cause of action
for negligence are duty, breach, causation, and damages.” (Melton v.
Boustred (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 521, 529.) “The
elements of a cause of action for premises liability are the same as those for
negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages.” (McIntyre v. The
Colonies-Pacific, LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 664, 671.)  
 
In her complaint, Plaintiff alleges
that she feel “as a result of dangerous conditions on Defendants’ property”.
(Complaint at p. 4.) Later she again alleges that she was “injured as a result
of dangerous conditions”. (Complaint at p. 5.) She also alleges she “sustained
serious injuries and incurred damages as a direct result of the negligence of
Defendants in maintaining, inspecting, repairing, managing, supervising,
controlling, and/or operating the premises located at 3035 E. Huntington Dr.,
Pasadena 91107; including but not limited to fixtures and appliances, entrance
and exit ways, surrounding parking lots and alleys, aisles, floors, stairs,
steps, gates and any other surfaces and areas upon which individuals may move
about negligently hiring, training, supervising, controlling, and/or monitoring
employees and agents responsible for the maintenance, inspections, repairing,
supervision, control, and operations; failing to provide a safe, suitable, and
adequate premises for individuals using said premises.” 
 
“As against a general demurrer,
plaintiff need only plead facts which, liberally interpreted, disclose that he
is entitled to some relief.” (Cameron v. Wernick (1967) 251 Cal.App.2d
890, 892.) “ ‘[T]he complaint ordinarily is sufficient if it alleges ultimate
rather than evidentiary facts.’ [Citation.] ‘However, distinguishing “
‘[u]ltimate facts’ ” from “evidentiary” facts and “ ‘legal conclusion[s]’ ” can
be difficult.’ ” (Thomas v. Regents of University of California (2023)
97 Cal.App.5th 587, 641.) 
 
“Material facts alleged in the complaint are treated as true for
the purpose ruling on the demurrer. [Citation.] Also taken as true are facts
that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged. [Citation.]
However, contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the
complaint are not considered in judging its sufficiency.” (Kisesky v.
Carpenters’ Trust for So. California. (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d, 228.)
 
            Here,
Plaintiff’s statements that she fell was a result of dangerous conditions are neither
evidentiary nor ultimate facts but statements of legal conclusion. Plaintiff’s
long list of possible ways Defendant failed to maintain various aspects of the
premises fails to remedy her deficient pleading. Plaintiff has failed to allege
that Defendant breached a duty owed to her. Thus, her first two causes of
action fail to state a claim.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED
with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
