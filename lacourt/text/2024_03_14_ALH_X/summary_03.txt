And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Trader Joe's Company, has demurred to the plaintiff, Marisela Fernandez's, complaint alleging that she suffered injuries in a trip and fall incident on October 13, 2021, at one of their stores. The plaintiff claims that the defendant failed to maintain the premises in a safe condition, which led to her injuries. The defendant argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for negligence and premises liability.

The court has reviewed the complaint and finds that it does not plead factual allegations sufficient to state a claim. The plaintiff's allegations are based on legal conclusions rather than ultimate or evidentiary facts. The complaint fails to allege that the defendant breached a duty owed to the plaintiff.

The court sustains the defendant's demurrer with 20 days leave to amend. The plaintiff has failed to plead a cause of action and must re-plead to state a claim.
