And here is the English text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has granted Defendant Daniel Koes' motion for determination of good faith settlement. The motion was filed in response to the settlement agreement between Koes and Plaintiffs Paul and Malgorzata Vangelisti for $80,000. The Judge considered the relevant Tech-bilt factors, including the amount of the settlement, the parties' proportionate liability, and the estimation of plaintiff's total recovery. Although the parties failed to provide an estimate of plaintiff's total recovery, the Judge noted that Koes' attempt to settle the case weighs in his favor. The Judge also considered the City's evidence, which failed to establish that Koes bears greater or sole liability. The City's evidence only showed that its employees believe the title to the sidewalk is vested in Koes, but did not provide additional evidence to support this claim. The Judge concluded that the City has failed to meet its burden of proof and that Koes' motion for determination of good faith settlement is granted.
