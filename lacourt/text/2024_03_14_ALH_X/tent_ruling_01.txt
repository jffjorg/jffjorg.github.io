RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Plaintiff moves for a new trial. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            This
case arises out of Plaintiff Gustavo V. Garcia’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that he is
the sole owner of property located at 8239 Bleeker Ave., Rosemead, California
(“Subject Property”). Plaintiff alleges his son, Defendant Gustavo Garcia Jr.
(“Defendant”), is incorrectly claiming an interest in the Subject Property.
Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint (“SAC”) on April 7, 2023, alleging
four causes of action for (1) fraud, (2) quiet title, and (3) accounting.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
             
Plaintiff’s motion for a new
trial is DENIED. 
 
DISCUSSION
            
            On December
5, 2023, a court trial was held for this case. The court granted Defendant’s
motion for nonsuit. On January 29, 2024, judgment was entered in Defendant’s
favor. Plaintiff now moves for a new trial. 
 
            “A new trial is a re-examination of an issue of fact in the same court after a trial and decision by a jury, court, or referee.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 656.)
 
            “The
verdict may be vacated and any other decision may be modified or vacated, in
whole or in part, and a new or further trial granted on all or part of the
issues, on the application of the party aggrieved, for any of the following
causes, materially affecting the substantial rights of such party: [¶] 1. Irregularity in the
proceedings of the court, jury or adverse party, or any order of the court or
abuse of discretion by which either party was prevented from having a fair
trial. [¶] 2. Misconduct
of the jury; and whenever any one or more of the jurors have been induced to
assent to any general or special verdict, or to a finding on any question
submitted to them by the court, by a resort to the determination of chance,
such misconduct may be proved by the affidavit of any one of the jurors. [¶] 3. Accident or surprise,
which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against. [¶] 4. Newly discovered
evidence, material for the party making the application, which he could not,
with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the trial. [¶] 5. Excessive or inadequate
damages. [¶] 6.
Insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict or other decision, or the
verdict or other decision is against law. [¶] 7. Error in law, occurring at the trial and
excepted to by the party making the application.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 657.) 
 
            In
his motion, Plaintiff fails to clearly identify sufficient grounds to grant a
new trial or establish that a new trial is warranted. Plaintiff’s motion for a
new trial is denied. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff’s motion for a new
trial is DENIED.
