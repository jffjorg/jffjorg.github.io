And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a new trial. The plaintiff had requested a new trial after a court trial was held on December 5, 2023, and a judgment was entered in the defendant's favor on January 29, 2024. The plaintiff had alleged fraud, quiet title, and accounting, but the defendant's motion for nonsuit was granted, and the judgment was entered in their favor. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient grounds to grant a new trial, and the motion was denied.
