And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for protective order filed by the defendant and cross-complainant, Lisa Marie Vernola Salas, individually and as trustee of the Vernola Family Trust. The defendant seeks to prevent the plaintiff, Urban Soccer 5 Center LLC, from demanding or filing further discovery motions against the defendant, or from propounding additional written discovery. The defendant also requests that the court appoint a discovery referee to oversee the discovery process.

The judge denies the motion for protective order, finding that the defendant's request is not supported by the law. The judge notes that Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010, 2030.090, and 2031.060 do not permit the court to grant the relief requested by the defendant.

The judge also denies the defendant's request to appoint a discovery referee, finding that the discovery dispute is not extraordinary or exceptional. Instead, the judge will rule on any pending discovery motions and impose sanctions as appropriate.

The judge does, however, decline the plaintiff's request for sanctions in connection with the opposition to the motion, finding that the plaintiff's counsel failed to engage in meaningful participation in the attempt to resolve the discovery dispute.
