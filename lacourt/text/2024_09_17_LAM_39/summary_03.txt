Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Jamilh Roque, who is seeking to dismiss Plaintiff Princess Hodges' claims of sexual harassment and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge has reviewed the evidence presented by both parties and has concluded that Defendant has met his burden of showing that there is no triable issue of material fact regarding Plaintiff's claims.

With respect to the claim of sexual harassment, the judge finds that Defendant's behavior, while unprofessional, was not severe or pervasive enough to create an abusive work environment. The judge also notes that Plaintiff failed to advance evidence of harassment by Defendant that would have "seriously affected the psychological well-being of a reasonable employee . . . ."

Regarding the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, the judge finds that Plaintiff failed to raise triable issues of material fact and failed to advance evidence that Defendant engaged in extreme or outrageous conduct.

Based on the evidence presented, the judge grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment and orders Defendant to give notice of the court's order and to file proof of service of same.
