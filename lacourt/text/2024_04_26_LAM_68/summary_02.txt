And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a decision by the judge in a case between Chan Sook Kim and Jane Choi. The case involves a dispute over the ownership and use of a common driveway between two adjacent properties. Kim owns and occupies 116 S. Berendo St, while Choi acquired 108 S. Berendo St in January 2024. The disputed area has been used for parking by Kim, but Choi has blocked the driveway and constructed a fence without a permit. Kim has filed a complaint for Quiet Title to an Implied Easement, Quiet Title to a Prescriptive or Equitable Easement, and Nuisance. The court has granted a temporary restraining order and a renewed ex parte application.

The judge has considered the likelihood of Kim prevailing on the merits and the balance of equities. The judge finds that the circumstances support a finding for consideration of an equitable easement. The court also finds that the disputed easement supports a finding of interim harm requiring injunction, due to impacts on the ingress and egress of vehicles to the property.

The judge grants the motion for preliminary injunction and orders that no further action blocking the driveway be taken. The judge also declines to consider any injunction barring the parking of cars under any purported violation of the Los Angeles Municipal Code. The parties may attempt to negotiate potential solutions in the interim. The case is set for a Case Management Conference on June 11, 2024.
