SUMMARY OF ACTION
Petitioner, Mohammad Yekrangi alleges entry into contract
with Respondent, Hamed Hugh Farzaneh dba Hugh Construction and Development on May
30, 2019 for the provision of certain contractor services and materials for
real property located at 12137 Oro Way, Granada Hills. Respondent abandoned the
project “sometime prior to May 4, 2020.” Respondent recorded a mechanics lien
on May 12, 2020 for $54,715.
 
On December 23, 2020, Plaintiff filed a petition for
release of the mechanics lien and recovery of attorney fees. On December 30,
2020, the court granted the ex parte motion and advanced the hearing from May
18, 2021 to February 5, 2021.
 
RULING: Granted.
Petitioner
seeks to expunge the mechanic’s lien. 
 
“(a) The claimant shall
commence an action to enforce a lien within 90 days after recordation of the
claim of lien. If the claimant does not commence an action to enforce the lien
within that time, the claim of lien expires and is unenforceable.
 
“(b) Subdivision (a)
does not apply if the claimant and owner agree to extend credit, and notice of
the fact and terms of the extension of credit is recorded (1) within 90 days
after recordation of the claim of lien or (2) more than 90 days after recordation
of the claim of lien but before a purchaser or encumbrancer for value and in
good faith acquires rights in the property. In that event the claimant shall
commence an action to enforce the lien within 90 days after the expiration of
the credit, but in no case later than one year after completion of the work of
improvement. If the claimant does not commence an action to enforce the lien
within that time, the claim of lien expires and is unenforceable.” 
 
(Civ. Code, § 8460.)
 
The lien was recorded on October 18, 2023. Petitioner
represents that no action was commenced within 90 days of the recordation of
the lien. The 90-day period expired on January 16, 2024. Petitioner demanded a
release of the lien on February 29, 2024 before filing the subject petition. [Petition,
Ex. B.] (Civ. Code, § 8482.) Service was completed by certified mail 30 days
before the hearing date. Petitioner offered to settle the claim at a discounted
amount, but no response was presented.
 
The petition lacks any request for attorney fees. (Civ.
Code, § 8488.) 
 
The petition is granted. 
 
Petitioner to
provide notice.
