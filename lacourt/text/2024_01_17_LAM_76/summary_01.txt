And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a motion to deem requests for admission against defendant Jasmine Fajardo. The court ordered Fajardo to provide further responses to certain requests for admission, but she failed to do so. Despite serving supplemental responses, those responses were not verified. The court has granted the motion to deem the requests for admission against Fajardo, but only as to the specific requests listed. The court has also granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions against Fajardo in the amount of $1,245. The court has denied the plaintiff's request for an evidentiary hearing regarding Fajardo's reappearance, but the plaintiff may bring a noticed motion for terminating sanctions if they wish to do so.
