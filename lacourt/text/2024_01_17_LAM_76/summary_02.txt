And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the petitioners' motion for a protective order and request for sanctions in this case. The petitioners, Mohsen Amjadi and Saeid Amjadi, are seeking to compel Farmers Insurance to arbitrate and to obtain a protective order regarding phone records. However, the court finds that the petitioners have not demonstrated good cause for a protective order, and that they have failed to conduct the Hill balancing test to determine the seriousness of the privacy invasion and the strength of the countervailing interest. The court also notes that the petitioners have not submitted a sufficient meet and confer declaration regarding this protective order motion, as required by Civil Procedure Code § 2017.020(a). As a result, the court has denied the petitioners' motion for a protective order and request for sanctions.
