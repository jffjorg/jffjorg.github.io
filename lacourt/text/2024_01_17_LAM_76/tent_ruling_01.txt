Admitted Requests For Admission 
Discussion
            On April 10,
2023, the Court ordered Defendant Jasmine Fajardo to provide further responses
to requests for admission as to Nos. 1, 14-22, 24-28, 31 and 32 but not as to
No. 7.
            Civ. Proc.
Code, § 2033.290(e) provides:
(e) If a party then fails to obey
an order compelling further response to requests for admission, the court may
order that the matters involved in the requests be deemed admitted. In lieu of,
or in addition to, this order, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).
 
Although Defendant purportedly
served supplemental responses prior to the hearing on this motion, such responses
were not verified. (Reply Decl. of Cory D. Gould, ¶ 6; Opp Decl. of Robert A.
Orozco, Exh. 1.) “Unsworn responses are tantamount to no responses at all.
(Citation omitted.)” (Appleton v.
Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 635-36.)
 As such, the motion to deem requests for admission against
Defendant Fajardo is GRANTED as to responses
to requests for admission as to Nos. 1, 14-22, 24-28, 31 and 32 only.
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
against Defendant Jasmine Fajardo only is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $1,245
(3 hours at $395/hour plus $60 filing fee—see Gould Decl., ¶ 10.) Sanctions
are to be paid to Plaintiff’s counsel within 20 days.
 
Plaintiff’s request that the Court
call an evidentiary hearing regarding Fajardo's reappearance is DENIED. If Plaintiff
wishes to seek terminating sanctions due to Fajardo’s conduct, Plaintiff may
bring a noticed motion.
