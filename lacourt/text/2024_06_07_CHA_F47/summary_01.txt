And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to deem Requests for Admissions, Set 1, admitted and the motion for sanctions. The court denied the request to deem the Requests for Admissions, Set 1, admitted, as the service of responses to the requests on 6/2/24, prior to the hearing on the motion, precludes the court from deeming the matters admitted. However, the court granted the request for sanctions against Plaintiff Jamal Salim Nasrallah and Plaintiff's counsel, Bryan Castorina, in the amount of $460.00. The court finds the sanctions reasonable and imposes them jointly and severally against Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel, payable within 30 days.
