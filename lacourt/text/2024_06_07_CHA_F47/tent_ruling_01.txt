SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a landlord tenant dispute
regarding property located at 13547 Osborne Street in Arleta, California. On
11/4/19, Plaintiff Jamal Salim Nasrallah (Plaintiff) filed this action alleging
causes of action for: (1) forcible entry and (2) forcible detainer against
Padita Ayana and Parawan Ayana. 
 
On 5/10/22, default was entered against Padita
Ayana.  Also on 5/10/22, Plaintiff filed
a Doe Amendment naming Padita Ayana as Trustee of the Parawan Ayana Living
Trust.  On 5/11/22, pursuant to
Plaintiff’s request, the Court entered a dismissal without prejudice of Parawan
Ayana. (See 5/11/22 Minute Order).  On
6/6/22, the Court entered an order pursuant to the stipulation of the parties
setting aside the default entered against Padita Ayana. 
 
On 12/7/22, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint
which again asserted causes of action for: (1) forcible entry and (2) forcible
detainer.  On 2/28/23, the Court
sustained, in part, Padita Ayana’s demurrer to the First Amended Complaint and
granted Padita Ayana’s motion to strike portions of the First Amended
Complaint, both with leave to amend. (See 2/28/23 Minute Order). On 4/4/23,
Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint for forcible entry against Padita Ayana,
individually (Padita), and as Trustee of the Parawan Ayana Living Trust
(Trustee) (collectively, Defendant).  On
7/25/23, Defendant’s motion to strike portions of the Second Amended Complaint
was denied.  
 
On 8/15/23, Trustee served Plaintiff with Requests for
Admissions, Set 1, making responses due 9/18/23.  (Petrosyan Decl. ¶¶4-5, Ex.A).  Despite being granted multiple extensions of
time to respond, Plaintiff has failed to serve responses to the subject
discovery.  (Petrosyan Decl. ¶¶6-11,
Ex.B-F).    
Therefore, on 11/7/23, Trustee filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order deeming Requests for Admissions, Set 1, served
on Plaintiff deemed admitted. 
Additionally, Trustee   seeks an order imposing sanctions against
Plaintiff and/or his attorney of record in the amount of $460.00.
 
On 6/3/24, Plaintiff filed (served 6/2/24) an opposition to
Padita’s motion to deem requests for admissions admitted which was scheduled
for hearing on 6/4/24.  While the
opposition only lists the 6/4/24 hearing date, responses to the requests for
admissions served by Trustee are also attached to the opposition.  (See Opposition filed 6/3/24, Ex.2).  On 6/6/24, Plaintiff filed an opposition
specifically addressing the instant motion which also attaches the responses to
the subject Requests for Admissions served on Trustee on 6/2/24.  (See Opposition filed 6/6/24, Ex.2).
 
ANALYSIS
 
The service of responses to the subject Requests for
Admissions on 6/2/24, prior to the hearing on the motion, precludes the Court
from deeming the matters admitted.  CCP
2033.280(c); St. Mary (2014) 223 CA4th 762, 775-776.  However, the imposition of sanctions on
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel is still mandatory due to their failure to
comply with their discovery obligations. 
CCP 2033.280(c); See also CCP 2023.010(d).  The Court finds that the $460.00 in sanctions
requested against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, Bryan Castorina, to be
reasonable.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The request to deem Requests for Admissions, Set 1, is
denied.  The  request for sanctions is granted.  Sanctions are imposed jointly and severally
against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s attorney, Bryan Castorina, in the amount of
$460.00.  Sanctions are payable within 30
days.
