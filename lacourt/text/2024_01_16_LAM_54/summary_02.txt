And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Maurice A. Leiter in the case of O Y K Properties, LLC v. Main Tec USA, Inc., et al. (Case No. 23STCV27510). The case involves a demurrer to a commercial unlawful detainer complaint filed by the plaintiff on November 8, 2023. The defendants demurred on the ground that the plaintiff overstated the amount of rent due in the 3-day notice to pay rent or quit. However, the court has overruled the demurrer, finding that the inclusion of late fees in the notice does not render it defective. The court also notes that the defendants' argument that the late fees are impermissible liquidated damages cannot be determined on demurrer. The court orders the defendants to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 30 days of notice of the ruling.
