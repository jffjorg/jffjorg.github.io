The Honorable Judge Teresa A. Beaudet has issued a tentative ruling regarding the case of Lowell Jack Pollard vs. General Motors, LLC, et al. Judge Beaudet has disclosed her personal experience with a pickup truck that developed electrical problems approximately 24 years ago. She and her husband purchased the truck, and after multiple visits to the dealer for repairs, the manufacturer and dealer agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price. Judge Beaudet does not believe that this experience will cause her to be biased in favor of or against either party. However, she is allowing the parties to file a verified statement of disqualification if they believe otherwise. The deadline for filing such a statement is January 31, 2024. The Case Management Conference has been continued to March 12, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file a statement of disqualification.
