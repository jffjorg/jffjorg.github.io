[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
PLAINTIFF’S
  MOTION FOR STATUTORY APPELLATE ATTORNEY’S FEES UNDER C.C.P. § 425.16, SUBD. (c)(1)




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Background
Plaintiff Curtis R. Olson (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on December
23, 2019 against a number of defendants, including Vidala Aaronoff, Gloria P.
Martinez-Senftner, and the Martinez Law Group, P.C. 
Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) on
November 17, 2020, alleging ten causes of action.
On August 29, 2023, Jane Doe filed a Cross-Complaint in this action
against, inter alia, Plaintiff. The Cross-Complaint alleges nine causes
of action. 
On July 23, 2021, the Court issued an Order concerning Defendants
Vidala Aaronoff, Gloria Martinez-Senftner, and Martinez Law Group, P.C.’s
(collectively “Defendants”) special motion to strike Plaintiff’s SAC. The
Court’s July 23, 2021 minute order provides, inter alia, that “the
anti-SLAPP motions to the initial Complaint and the FAC are denied as moot.
Accordingly, the Court only considers the anti-SLAPP motion to the SAC.” (July
23, 2021 minute order at p. 4.) The July 23, 2021
minute order further provides that “Defendants’ special motion to strike is
denied. Defendants have 30 days from the date of this Order to answer the SAC.”
(Id. at p. 8.) 
Plaintiff indicates that “Defendants appealed the denial of their
anti-SLAPP motions to the Second District Court of Appeal…in appellate case no.
B315237.” (Kennedy Decl., ¶ 8.) On February 24, 2023, the Court of Appeal,
Second Appellate District, Division Two issued an opinion in Case No. B315237.
(Kennedy Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. C.) The Court of Appeal’s February 24, 2023 opinion provides,
inter alia, that “Aaronoff, Martinez-Senftner, and MLG filed a special
motion to strike Olson’s suit under the anti-SLAPP…statute…which the trial
court denied. In challenging that order, they point to two constitutionally
protected activities they contend are endangered by Olson’s suit: (1)
litigation funding and (2) religious expression. Because Aaronoff,
Martinez-Senftner, and MLG have not made the requisite showing for striking a
suit under the anti-SLAPP statute, we affirm the order.” (Kennedy Decl., ¶ 8,
Ex. C, pp. 2-3.) On June 1, 2023, a Remittitur was filed in this action
providing, inter alia, that “the attached is a true and correct copy of
the original order, opinion or decision entered in the above-entitled cause on
February 24, 2023 and that this order, opinion or decision has now become
final.” 
Plaintiff indicates that Defendants sought review by the California
Supreme Court. (Kennedy Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. D.) On May 31, 2023, the California
Supreme Court denied the petition for review. (Ibid.)

Plaintiff now moves “for
a statutory award of attorneys’ fees as the prevailing plaintiff who
successfully prevailed against the appeals by Defendants Vidala Aaronoff,
Gloria Martinez-Senftner, and the Martinez Law Group, P.C…” The motion is
unopposed. 
Discussion
In the memorandum of points and authorities in support of the motion, Plaintiff
states that he “seeks to recover not less than $64,941.50 in reasonable
fees he incurred defending against Defendants’ appeals from the denials of
their…anti-SLAPP motions, not less than $7,126.50 in reasonable
fees preparing and defending this fee motion, for a total award of $72,068.”
(Mot. at pp. 5:27-6:2). Plaintiff asserts that he “should be
awarded his appellate attorney’s fees as the prevailing plaintiff-respondent
under section 425.16, subdivision (c)(1).” (Mot. at
p. 10:19-20.) 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16, subdivision (c)(1), “[i]f the
court finds that a special motion to strike is frivolous or is solely intended
to cause unnecessary delay, the court shall award costs and reasonable
attorney’s fees to a plaintiff prevailing on the motion, pursuant to Section 128.5.” (Emphasis added.) “The imposition of
sanctions for a frivolous anti-SLAPP motion is therefore mandatory.” ((Foundation
for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights v. Garamendi (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1375, 1388.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5,
subdivision (a) provides, “[a] trial court may order a party,
the party’s attorney, or both, to pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by another party as a
result of actions or tactics, made in bad faith, that
are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.” Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, subdivision (b)(2)
defines “frivolous”
as “totally and completely without merit or for the sole purpose of harassing
an opposing party.” In addition, “[a] motion is totally and completely without
merit for purposes of a finding of frivolousness under section 425.16, subdivision (c)(1) or section 128.5 only if any reasonable attorney would
agree that the motion is totally devoid of merit. This is an
objective standard. Whether the sole purpose of the motion is to harass an
opposing party or the motion is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay, in
contrast, concerns the subjective motivation of the moving defendant. The
moving defendant’s subjective motivation can be inferred from the absence of
any arguable merit.” ((Chitsazzadeh v. Kramer & Kaslow (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 676, 683–684 [internal
citations omitted].) 
Plaintiff cites to City of
Alhambra v. D'Ausilio (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1303-1304, where “Appellant Robert D’Ausilio sued respondent City of Alhambra (City) for civil rights violations and then settled
the case with the City. The City then sued appellant for breach of the
settlement agreement and declaratory relief. Appellant moved to strike the
declaratory relief claim under Code of Civil Procedure
section 425.16, the ‘anti-SLAPP’ statute…The trial court denied the motion
and awarded the City its
attorney fees.” The Court of Appeal “agree[d] that appellant failed to
demonstrate that the declaratory relief claim arose from activity protected
under the statute,” and therefore “affirm[ed] the order denying the motion.” (Id. at p. 1304.) the Court of Appeal also “grant[ed]
the City’s request for attorney fees
on appeal, the amount of which [was] to be determined by the trial court.” The City of Alhambra Court noted as follows: 
 
“The City requests
attorney fees on appeal. It argues that because appellant’s appeal ‘raises no
new permissible arguments that change the result, his appeal [like his motion]
is frivolous and was only intended to cause further delay of this litigation.’
We agree. ‘The right to attorney fees extends to attorney fees on appeal
as well.’ (Morrow v. Los Angeles Unified School
Dist. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1446 [57 Cal. Rptr. 3d 885];…see
also Carpenter v. Jack in the Box Corp.
(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 454, 461 [59 Cal. Rptr. 3d 839] [‘The trial
court’s authority to award fees and costs under section 425.16, subdivision
(c), includes authority to award fees incurred in responding to an appeal of an
order granting or denying a special motion to strike, or of an order awarding
attorney fees in connection with such motion.’].) The City is
awarded its attorney fees on appeal.” (City of Alhambra v. D'Ausilio, supra, at pages
1309-1310,
emphasis added.) 
Plaintiff asserts that
“[h]ere, this Court already determined that Defendants’ special motions
to strike were frivolous, and it accordingly awarded costs and reasonable
attorney’s fees to Olson after he successfully defeated their motions.” (Mot.
at p. 11:20-22.) 
On April 28,
2022, the Court issued an Order on a previous motion by Plaintiff for statutory
attorney’s fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16. As set forth in the April 28, 2022
Order, the Court continued the hearing on the motion to May 17, 2022, finding
that a supplemental declaration from Plaintiff’s counsel was necessary. On May
17, 2022, the Court issued an Order granting Plaintiff’s motion for
attorneys’ fees in the amount of $41,697.00. The Court’s May 17, 2022 Order
provides, inter alia, that “[a]s discussed in the Court’s April 28,
2022 Order, the Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated that Defendants’
anti-SLAPP motion was frivolous for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section
¿425.16, subdivision (c)(1)¿.” (May 17, 2022
Order at p. 2:13-15.)
Plaintiff asserts that “Defendants’ appeals [sic] were as frivolous as
their special motions to strike, and solely intended to cause unnecessary
delay.” (Mot. at p. 12:4-5.) 
The Court of Appeal’s February 24, 2023 opinion affirming the Court’s
order denying Defendants’ special motion to strike provides, inter alia,
that “[t]he theory behind defendants’ anti-SLAPP motion is that Olson is, in
essence, challenging their payment of legal fees to prevent defendants from
engaging in further litigation against him. Specifically, defendants argue,
without supporting citations to the record, that because the $800,000 secured
by the deed of trust was ‘necessary to maintain their current actions and
appeals and to perfect new actions against Olson,’ the transfer of the
condominium to Martinez-Senftner and MLG is protected as litigation funding.
‘Gathering the money was inseparable from Aaronoff and [the] ATW Trust’ for
existing and future litigation, they argue. Defendants’ thinking is flawed for
two reasons: First, the $800,000 payment secured by the conveyance did not
constitute litigation funding. Second, Olson’s claims do not arise from the
payment.” (Kennedy Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. C, p. 10.) Plaintiff notes that the Court of
Appeal further found that “[h]ere, contrary to defendants’ unsubstantiated
arguments in their briefs, the purported funding was not obtained for the
purpose of litigation.” (Id. at p. 12.) 
The Court of Appeal also noted in its February 24, 2023 opinion that
“Defendants contend Olson’s claims arise from protected activity because the
Ancient Temple of Wings is a religious entity. They do not, however, coherently
describe the basis for this theory.” (Kennedy Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. C, p. 13.) The
February 24, 2023 opinion also provides that “[i]n our decision in Aaronoff
v. Olson, supra, B295388, a related
case, we concluded the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction by amending an
earlier order awarding attorney fees to Olson after Aaronoff had timely
appealed from that order.” (Id. at p. 15.)
Plaintiff notes that the Court of Appeal found that “[t]o the extent they can
be understood, defendants’ contentions are that our B295388 decision means
Olson cannot name the ATW Trust as a defendant in his second amended complaint
and, without the Trust, Olson cannot allege a conspiracy theory. Defendants’
position fails for two reasons. To begin, defendants hold a marked
misperception of our B295388 decision and the law…” (Ibid.)

Plaintiff thus asserts, as set forth above, that “Defendants’ appeals
[sic] were as frivolous as their special motions to strike…” (Mot. at p.
12:4-5.) Based on the foregoing, and in light of the lack of any opposition by
Defendants, the Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated that Defendants’ subject
appeal
was frivolous for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure
section 425.16, subdivision (c)(1).
Next, “[i]t is well established that the amount of an attorney fee award
under the anti-SLAPP statute is computed by the trial court in accordance with
the familiar lodestar method.” ((569 East County Boulevard LLC v.
Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 432
[internal quotations and brackets omitted].) Under the lodestar method, the court tabulates the
attorney fee lodestar by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by
the reasonable hourly rate prevailing in the community for similar work.” (Ibid.)
With regard to the number of hours reasonably expended, “the verified
time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to
credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.” ((Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132
Cal.App.4th 359, 396.) In
determining the reasonable hourly rate, the “burden is on the successful party
to prove the appropriate market rate to be used in calculating the lodestar.” ((MBNA
America Bank, N.A. v. Gorman (2006) 147 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 13.) The trial court may reduce the
award where the fee request appears unreasonably inflated, such as where the
attorneys’ efforts are unorganized or duplicative. ((Serrano
v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635, fn. 21.)
In his supporting declaration, Plaintiff’s counsel states that his hourly rate “during the relevant course of events leading
up to and including filing this declaration was $510-600/hour.” (Kennedy Decl.,
¶ 11.) Plaintiff’s requested hourly rate for associate Nina Moreno is
$445/hour, and Plaintiff’s requested hourly rate for “of counsel” Robert M.
Dato is $550/hour. (Kennedy Decl., ¶¶ 13-14.) The Court finds that the requested hourly
rates are reasonable. “The
courts repeatedly have stated that the trial court is in the best position to
value the services rendered by the attorneys in his or her courtroom, and this
includes the determination of the hourly rate that will be used in the lodestar
calculus.” ((569 East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against
the Dump, Inc., supra, 6
Cal.App.5th at pp. 436-437 [internal citations omitted].) “In making
its calculation, the court may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with
the legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and reputation of the
attorney requesting fees…” ((Id. at p. 437.)
However, the Court notes that it is unclear what the requested
hourly rate is for attorney Robert Little. Plaintiff’s counsel
states that “Mr. Little has an hourly rate of $845, which has been discounted
in this matter to $590-$625.” (Kennedy Decl., ¶ 12.) However, Plaintiff’s
counsel then states that “Mr. Little’s current discounted rate is $680.” (Kennedy
Decl., ¶ 18.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel also states that “in connection with Defendants’
frivolous anti-SLAPP motions, Olson has incurred at least about [sic]
$64,941.50 in fees for at least 108.1 hours of combined attorney time
successfully defending against her [sic] multiple (three) anti-SLAPP motions
and defeating them. This required significant analysis and opposition briefing
involving a protracted and unwieldy procedural history, supplemental briefing
caused by Defendants, and preparing for and attending multiple court hearings.”
(Kennedy Decl., ¶ 17.) But the instant motion concerns fees sought by Plaintiff
for “defending against Defendants’ appeals [sic] from the denials of their
frivolous anti-SLAPP motions” as well as fees for “preparing and defending [the
instant] fee motion.” (Mot. at p. 5:28-6:1.) In light of paragraph 17 of
Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration, it is unclear whether Plaintiff purportedly
incurred $64,941.50 in connection with Plaintiff’s defense of Defendants’
appeal, or in connection with other matters that are not the subject of the
instant motion. 
Accordingly,
the Court will require a supplemental declaration from Plaintiff’s counsel more
clearly setting forth the fees incurred by Plaintiff in responding to
Defendant’s appeal. In addition, the Court will require additional information
concerning Mr. Little’s requested hourly rate. 
 Plaintiff also estimates he will
incur an additional $7,126.50 in connection with the instant motion, which
includes “7.8 hours of Nina Moreno’s time drafting this motion; 1.3
hours of Robert C. Little’s time reviewing and revising the motion; plus an
anticipated 4.7 hours of Nina Moreno’s time reviewing the opposition and
preparing the reply brief in support of the motion; and 1 hour of Robert C.
Little’s time appearing at the hearing…” (Kennedy Decl., ¶ 18.) As set forth
above, it is unclear what Mr. Little’s requested hourly rate is. (Compare Kennedy
Decl., ¶¶ 12, 18.) In addition, no opposition or reply¿was¿filed in
connection with the motion. Thus, the Court finds that the requested “4.7
hours of Nina Moreno’s time reviewing the opposition and preparing the reply
brief in support of the motion” shall be deducted from the total amount
requested. (Kennedy Decl., ¶ 18.) 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the Court
continues the hearing on the instant motion to _________________,  at
10:00 a.m. in Dept. 50.  
The Court sets the following
briefing schedule:  
Plaintiff’s supplemental
declaration to be filed and served by _________________, with a courtesy copy
delivered to Dept. 50.  
Defendants’ response, if any, to
be filed and served by _________________, with a courtesy copy delivered to
Dept. 50.  
The argument and evidence in the
supplemental papers are limited to the requested additional information, as
discussed above, and the response thereto. The parties may not include any
argument or evidence on any other issue.   
Plaintiff is to provide notice of
this ruling.
