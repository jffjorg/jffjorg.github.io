And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Teresa A. Beaudet regarding a case management conference in a lawsuit between Alba M. Rupert (Plaintiff) and General Motors, LLC et al (Defendant). The Judge discloses that approximately 24 years ago, she and her husband purchased a pickup truck that developed electrical problems, and the manufacturer and dealer eventually agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price. The Judge believes this experience will not bias her, but if either party disagrees, they can file a verified statement of disqualification by January 31, 2024. The hearing on the case management conference is continued to March 12, 2024, unless both parties waive their right to file a statement. The Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this disclosure to any new parties added to the case.
