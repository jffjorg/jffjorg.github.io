And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most qualified (PMQ) to testify on issues related to the plaintiff's claims. The defendant had objected to the deposition notice and failed to provide alternative dates, despite the plaintiff's requests. The judge found that the defendant's opposition was late, but considering the strong policy favoring disposition of the case on the merits, the judge decided to consider the late opposition. The judge noted that the parties had allegedly agreed to hold the deposition on October 24, 2024, but this was not supported by a declaration or documentary evidence. The judge ordered the defendant to produce its PMQ for deposition and document production within 10 calendar days as requested by the plaintiff.
