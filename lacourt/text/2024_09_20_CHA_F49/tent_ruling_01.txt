RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Normajean Yamashita
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order from this Court to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Form Interrogatories,
Set One, and to impose monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and her attorney of
record, in the amount of $980.00.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from alleged injuries that Plaintiff
sustained in a vehicle accident on June 26, 2021.
 
On May 25, 2023, Plaintiff Normajean Yamashita (“Plaintiff”
or “Yamashita”) filed a Complaint against Defendant Ahmed Helmy (“Defendant” or “Helmy”) and Does 1 to 10, alleging one
cause of action for Motor Vehicle Liability. Subsequently, Defendant filed an
Answer to the Complaint on December 6, 2023.
 
On August 15, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One (the “Motion”).
Additionally, Defendant requests monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and her
attorney of record.  
 
Subsequently, Plaintiff filed a Declaration in response to
the Motion on September 11, 2024. No Opposition has been received by the Court.
Defendant filed a Reply on September 13, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
If a party to whom interrogatories
are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion
to compel where no responses have been served. All that needs to be shown in
the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the
opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of
any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d
902, 905-906.)
 
Additionally, the party whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to
exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any
objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One
 
Defendant’s counsel attests
that on December 21, 2023, Plaintiff was served with multiple sets of written
discovery, including the Form Interrogatories, Set One, to which responses were
due on January 22, 2024. (Ahdoot Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. “A.”) Subsequently, on
multiple occasions in June and July of 2024, Defendant followed up with
Plaintiff in writing, and via telephone, requesting that Plaintiff provide
responses as soon as possible. (Id. ¶ 5.) Despite these efforts, no
responses had been received by the time of the filing of this Motion. (Id.
¶ 6.)
 
Based on the above, the Court
determines that Defendant failed to serve a timely response, waiving any right
to exercise the option to produce writings under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product. 
 
Given that no Opposition papers
have been filed by Plaintiff, the Court GRANTS the unopposed Motion. 
 
A.   
Monetary
Sanctions
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c), “[t]he Court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust....” Additionally, California Rules
of Court rule 3.1348(A) further provides, “The Court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed.” (Underlines added.)
Although Plaintiff’s counsel
submitted declarations attesting that he has reviewed the responses with
Plaintiff on September 12, 2024, and will be submitting responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, without objection, the Court finds the monetary sanctions
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c)
are still applicable in this case. 
 
Accordingly, the Court determines the
total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work
performed in connection with the Motion to be $520.00, calculated based on a
reasonable hourly rate of $230.00 for 2 hours reasonably spent, in addition to
a $60.00 filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS
IN PART Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant Ahmed
Helmy’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff Normajean
Yamashita is ordered to serve responses, without objection, to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, within 15 days.
 
Defendant
Ahmed Helmy’s Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. 
 
Plaintiff
Normajean Yamashita and her attorney of record are ordered to jointly and
severally pay $520.00 to Defendant’s attorney of record within 20 days.
