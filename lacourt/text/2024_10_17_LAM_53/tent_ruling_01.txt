  Order RE:
 
motion to be relieved as counsel for
  defendant
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Roland R. Tijerina
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Roland R. Tijerina (“Defendant’s Counsel”) moves to be relieved as
counsel for defendant Cali One Services, Inc. (“Defendant”). 
“The question of granting or denying an application of an attorney to
withdraw as counsel (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. 2) is one which lies within
the sound discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind whether such withdrawal
might work an injustice in the handling of the case.’”¿ (People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations omitted].)¿ The court
should also consider whether the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished
without undue prejudice to the client’s interests.”¿ (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
For a motion to be relieved as counsel under Code of Civil Procedure
section 284, subdivision (2), California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires
(1) a notice of motion and motion directed to the client (made on the Notice of
Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (2) is brought instead of filing a
consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil
form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration,
and proposed order on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in
the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order
Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form
(MC-053)).¿¿¿ 
First, the court finds that Defendant’s Counsel has not given
Defendant sufficient notice of the hearing on this motion. 
“[A]ll moving and supporting papers shall be served and filed at least
16 court days before the hearing.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)  “[A]ny
period of notice . . . shall be extended . . . 10 calendar days if either the
place of mailing or the place of address is outside the State of California but
within the United States . . . .”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1013, subd. (a).) 
Defendant’s Counsel has submitted a proof of service establishing that
counsel served Defendant with the notice of motion, motion, and supporting
declaration on September 16, 2024, by mail at Defendant’s Texas address.  (MC-051, pp. 3-4 [proof of service of mailing
at the address 17619 Olde Oaks Estates Court, Cypress, Texas, 77433].)  However, for a hearing date of October 17,
2024, Defendant’s Counsel was required to serve Defendant by mail at its Texas
address by at least September 13, 2024 (16 court days + 10 calendar days for
mailing outside of the State of California). 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1005, subd. (b), 1013, subd. (a).)
The court therefore finds that Defendant’s Counsel did not provide
Defendant with sufficient notice of this motion. 
Second, Defendant’s Counsel did not file a proof of service
establishing that counsel served plaintiff Samuel Betesh with this motion as
required.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule
3.1362, subd. (d) [“The notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and the proposed
order must be served on the client and on all other parties who have
appeared in the case”] [emphasis added]; MC-051, pp. 3-4 [proof of service of
mailing only on Defendant].) 
Third, Defendant’s Counsel did not lodge with the court a proposed
“Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” made on
Judicial Council form MC-053 as required. 
(Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1362, subd. (e) [proposed order must be
prepared on Judicial Council form MC-053 “and must be lodged with the court
with the moving papers”].) 
            The court therefore denies
Defendant’s Counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant, without
prejudice to Defendant’s Counsel’s filing a new motion to be relieved as
counsel that (1) provides Defendant with sufficient notice, and (2) complies
with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.
ORDER
            The court denies, without prejudice,
Roland R. Tijerina’s motion to be relieved as counsel.
            The court orders Roland R. Tijerina to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
