And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to be relieved as counsel for defendant CP Electric, filed by Zuli Ali. The motion was unopposed and was filed with all the required forms. However, the court finds that Zuli Ali did not follow the rules by not filing a proof of service with the motion, which shows that the defendant and other parties were served with the motion. Additionally, the court notes that Zuli Ali did not file a proof of service of the notice of continuance of the hearing. Therefore, the court denies the motion, but allows Zuli Ali to re-file the motion with the necessary proof of service.
