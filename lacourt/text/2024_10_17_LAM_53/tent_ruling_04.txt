The court notes that Plaintiffs have alleged that defendant Kim received a
total of $585,00 in loans that she has not paid back, and that “[t]he Trust needs
these funds back.”  (Compl., p. 40, ¶ 129
[emphasis added].)  While Plaintiffs appear
to have alleged that they are co-trustees of Decedent’s trust, they have
brought this action in their capacities as individuals, and not as
trustees.  (Compl., p. 6, ¶ 25; Compl.,
p. 2:5 [defining Plaintiffs to be “Pastor Victor Chey and Timothy Chey”].)
