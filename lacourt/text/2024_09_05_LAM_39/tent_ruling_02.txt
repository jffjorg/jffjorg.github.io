CASE NUMBER:


19STCV12070B




MOTION:  


Motion to Compel Discovery Responses




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Muranaka Farm




OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff Miguel Magdaleno



 MOTION
            Defendant
Muranaka Farm (“Defendant”) moves to compel responses from Plaintiff Miguel
Magdaleno (“Plaintiff”) to Form Interrogatories, set two (“FROG”).  After Defendant filed the motion on June 21,
2024, Plaintiff served responses to the FROG on August 14, 2024.     Such responses were due on or before April 25,
2024.   As such, the motion is moot, except as to Plaintiff’s
request for further responses to FROG Nos. 8.1 and 8.7 and Defendant seeking sanctions
in connection with the motion.  
In his opposition to the motion. Plaintiff primarily
recites Defendants’ failures in responding to discovery Plaintiff propounded on
Defendants rather than provide an explanation as to why sanctions should not be
awarded against Plaintiff for his failure to timely respond to the discovery subject
of this motion.  (Plaintiff Miguel
Magdaleno’s Opposition to Defendant Muranaka Farm’s Motion (filed August 14, 2024).)
First, the Court finds Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond to the FROG an
abuse of the discovery process and awards sanctions, noting Plaintiff provides no
substantial justification for such failure. 
Second, given the procedural posture of this case, including a jury
trial set to begin on October 1, 2024, the Court finds good cause to order
Plaintiff to provide code-compliant further responses to FROG Nos. 8.1 and 8.7,
as requested by Defendants.  
Therefore, the Court imposes sanctions
against Plaintiff and his counsel of record, Brett L. Francisco, in the amount
of $1,845, which represents three hours of attorney time to prepare the motion
and attend the hearings concerning it at $595 per hour, plus the filing fee.  Plaintiff and his counsel of record, jointly
and severally, are to pay $1,845 to Defendant, by and through counsel, within
30 days of notice of this order.  The
Court also orders Plaintiff to provide code-compliant further responses to FROG
Nos. 8.1 and 8.7 within 10 days of notice of this order.
Defendant is ordered to provide notice of
this order and to file proof of service of same.
