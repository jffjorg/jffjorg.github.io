And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants, Muranaka Farm, Harry Toshiaki Muranaka, Roy Muranaka, Janie Muranaka, and Carolyn Muranaka, and has denied the motion. The court finds that the plaintiff, Miguel Magdaleno, has raised triable issues of material fact as to whether he can prevail on his claims against the defendants.

The court notes that the defendants have presented evidence that the plaintiff asked for a regular salary and benefits, which were paid to him. However, the plaintiff has presented evidence that he agreed with Harry Toshiaki Muranaka that he would receive 50% of the profits of Muranaka Farm while he worked as its general manager. The court finds that this raises a triable issue of fact as to whether the defendants promised the plaintiff employment in exchange for 50% of the profits of Muranaka Farm.

The court also notes that the plaintiff has raised triable issues of material fact as to whether the defendants breached their oral agreement with him and whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for breach of contract. The court finds that the defendants have not met their burden to show that the statute of frauds bars the plaintiff's claim.

The court has also considered the defendants' motion for summary adjudication of the issue of whether the individual defendants, Harry Toshiaki Muranaka, Roy Muranaka, Janie Muranaka, and Carolyn Muranaka, are liable as the alter egos of Muranaka Farm. The court finds that this is not a proper issue for summary adjudication and has denied the motion.

In conclusion, the court has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication and has found that the plaintiff has raised triable issues of material fact as to whether he can prevail on his claims against the defendants.
