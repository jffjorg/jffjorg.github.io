MOTION
Plaintiffs James
Wahl and Timothy James Wahl (“Plaintiffs”) move to compel Defendant American
Broadcasting Companies, Inc. (“Defendant”) to produce documents Defendant
withheld as privileged.  
In their notice of
motion, Plaintiffs cite no authority under which the Court could compel
Defendant to produce these documents.  As
such, the Court cannot grant this relief. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 1010; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110, subd.
(a); People v. American Sur. Ins. Co. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 719,
726.)  Plaintiffs likewise cite no
authority in the memorandum of points and authorities in support of their
motion under which the Court could compel Defendant to produce withheld
documents.  
The pertinent
authority under which Plaintiffs could move to compel Defendant to produce
documents it withheld based on privilege is Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.310.  However, Plaintiffs have not
complied with the procedural requirements for a motion brought under this statute.  (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345 [requiring,
among other things, the service and filing of a separate statement]; Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2016.040 [requiring a meet and confer declaration], 2031.310, subd. (b)(2) [same].)  
Accordingly, the
Court continues the matter for hearing on October 24, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.  Plaintiffs are to personally serve and file their
moving papers under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 no later than
October 2, 2024.  Defendant’s opposition
and Plaintiffs’ reply, if any, are due pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure,
section 1005, subdivision (b).  
Plaintiffs are
ordered to give notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
