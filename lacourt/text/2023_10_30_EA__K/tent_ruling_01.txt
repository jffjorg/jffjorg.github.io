Background   
Plaintiff EBF
Holdings, LLC dba Everest Business Funding (“Plaintiff”) alleges as
follows:
On July 21, 2022,
Plaintiff purchased $308,000.00 worth of Future Receipts from Topix Group US
Corporation (“Company”) for $220,000.00 (“Purchase Price”). In consideration
for the Purchase Price, Company executed a series of documents, including a
Revenue Based Financing Agreement, an Agreement for Direct Deposits (ACH
Credits) and Direct Collections (ACH Debits), an Addendum to the Agreement, and
Bank Login Information (collectively, “Purchase Agreement”). 
 
Bradley Richard
Mantha (‘Mantha”) executed a guaranty of the Purchase Agreement. As part of the
Purchase Agreement, Company, through Mantha, represented in writing that (1)
its monthly average sales for its business were $482,699.72 and its annual
sales were $5,792,396.64 (2) Company was not insolvent (3) Company did not have
any intention to close the business or cease operating (4) Company would use
its best efforts to maintain and grow its business and (5) Company would use
the funds from Plaintiff solely for business purposes. Per the Purchase
Agreement, Company authorized Plaintiff to debit from its bank account, by
means of an automated clearing house (ACH) debit, 15% of Company’s
accounts-receivable (the “Specified Percentage”), an initial fixed, agreed-upon
amount from its bank account as a good faith approximation of the Specified
Percentage (the “Initial Daily Installment”) until such time as the Purchase
Amount of Future Receipts realized were remitted in full. Commencing October
20, 2022, Plaintiff began receiving NSF (“non-sufficient funds”) notifications
from Company’s bank. Plaintiff received four NSF notifications. Plaintiff has
demanded repayment of money paid under the Purchase Agreement, but Company
refuses.

possession of the Future Receipts as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. (See Proposed
Judgment, ¶¶ 6 and 7). Plaintiff is requested to brief this issue in a subsequent application.
