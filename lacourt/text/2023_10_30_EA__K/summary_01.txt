The Plaintiff, EBF Holdings, LLC dba Everest Business Funding, alleges that the Defendant, Topix Group US Corporation, breached the Purchase Agreement, which was executed on July 21, 2022. The Plaintiff claims that the Defendant failed to use the funds for business purposes and refused repayment after the Plaintiff received NSF notifications. The Plaintiff has demanded repayment, but the Defendant refuses. The Judge denies the Plaintiff's Application for Default Judgment without prejudice due to defects in the proposed judgment, including the issue of how the Plaintiff would be entitled to $142,656.29 and possession of the Future Receipts as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The Judge requests that the Plaintiff brief this issue in a subsequent application. A Case Management Conference is set for October 30, 2023.
