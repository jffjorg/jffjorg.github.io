Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that evidence of the plaintiff's prior lawsuit against his former employer Fendi should be excluded from the current lawsuit. The judge agrees with the plaintiff that the evidence is irrelevant, improper character evidence, and unduly prejudicial, confusing, and time-consuming. The judge cites Evidence Code § 1101 and Evidence Code § 352 to support the ruling. The judge also rules that the evidence is not probative of any "nervousness" on the plaintiff's part in confronting the situation that led to the accident. The judge notes that the plaintiff's prior lawsuit has no bearing on the claims and defenses in the current case. The judge concludes that even if there were some minimal probative value to be ascribed to the prior lawsuit, the evidence would still be excluded under Evidence Code § 352 because its relevance is outweighed by the prejudice the plaintiff would suffer.
