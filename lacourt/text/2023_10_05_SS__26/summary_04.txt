And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by defendant Farouque Mazra to the first amended complaint filed by plaintiff Suresh Pathak. The demurrer argues that the complaint does not adequately allege the material terms of the retainer agreement and the manner in which defendant breached the agreement. The court disagrees, finding that the complaint sufficiently alleges the existence of the agreement and the parties' obligations. The court also finds that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action for breach of contract and open book account. The demurrer is therefore overruled, and defendant is ordered to file an answer to the first amended complaint within 20 days of this order.
