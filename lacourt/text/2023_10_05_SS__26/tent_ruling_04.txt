 Case Number:  22STLC07941    Hearing Date:   October 5, 2023    Dept:  26  Pathak v. Mazra, et al.DEMURRER(CCP §§ 430.10, et seq.)
SUMMARY OF COMPLAINT: Action for breach of retainer agreement and
common counts.
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: Demur to the causes of action for failure to
allege sufficient facts and uncertainty. It cannot be determined from the
allegations how the alleged damages of $22,401.00 were caused, nor can it be
determined the date, terms, or conditions of any agreement or relationship
between the parties that would obligate Defendant to pay $22,401.00.
 
OPPOSITION: The
terms of the parties’ contract are clearly alleged according to its legal
effect, as is the manner in which Defendant breached the agreement. The
Complaint also alleges that Defendant became indebted to Plaintiff on an open
book account for work and services rendered. The demurrer is vague, uncertain
and ambiguous. 
 
REPLY: The
Complaint does not allege the material terms of the contract or attach a copy,
creating a hardship on Defendant to draft a response. The common count
allegations are improper because a written agreement is required for attorney
fees that exceed $1,000.00. Also, the allegations regarding services rendered
are conclusory. 
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
Defendant Farouque Mazra’s Demurrer to the First Amended
Complaint is OVERRULED. DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AN ANSWER TO THE FIRST AMENDED
COMPLAINT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On November 29, 2022, Plaintiff Suresh Pathak (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for breach of legal retainer agreement against
Defendant Farouque Mazra (“Defendant”). Plaintiff filed the First Amended
Complaint on August 21, 2023.
 
On September 6, 2023, Defendant filed the instant Demurrer
to the First Amended Complaint. Plaintiff filed an opposition on September 21,
2023 and Defendant replied on September 28, 2023. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) Breach
of Contract; and (2) Common Counts. The First Amended Complaint alleges that
Defendant engaged Plaintiff to represent him in Case # PC057214 at a rate of
$250.00 per hour. (FAC, ¶BC-1.) On August 21, 2020, Defendant breached the
agreement by failing to pay $22,401.00 incurred for legal services provided by
Plaintiff. (Id. at ¶BC-2.) As a result, Plaintiff incurred damages of
$22,401.00 plus interest. (Id. at ¶BC-3.) Within the last four years,
Defendant became indebted to Plaintiff on an open book account for work, labor,
services, and materials rendered at Defendant’s request and for which Defendant
promised to pay. (Id. at ¶CC-1.) The sum of the work, labor, services,
and materials rendered is $22,401.00. (Ibid.) 
 
The Demurrer is accompanied by a meet and confer declaration as required
by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. (Antonyan Decl., ¶¶3-5.) Defendant
demurs to each cause of action for failure to allege sufficient facts and
uncertainty under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivisions (e) and
(f). Special demurrers, however, are not permitted in a court of limited
jurisdiction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).) Therefore, the Court will not
rule on the demurrer for uncertainty. 
 
1st Cause of Action for Breach of Contract
 
The elements of a breach of contract cause of action are (1)
existence of contract; (2) plaintiffs’ performance or excuse for
nonperformance; (3) defendants’ breach (or anticipatory breach); and
(4) resulting damage. (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. N. Y.
Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.) Defendant demurs on the
grounds that the First Amended Complaint does not attach a copy of the written
contract, not allege its terms verbatim. In opposition, Plaintiff points out
that a contract can be alleged according to its legal effect.
 
A written contract may be pleaded either by its terms—set out verbatim in
the complaint or a copy of the contract attached to the complaint and
incorporated therein by reference—or by its legal effect. (Id., §§ 479, 480,
pp. 572–573.) In order to plead a contract by its legal effect, plaintiff must
“allege the substance of its relevant terms. This is more difficult, for it
requires a careful analysis of the instrument, comprehensiveness in statement,
and avoidance of legal conclusions.” (Id., § 480, p. 573.)
 
(McKell v.
Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489.) Like the case
on which Plaintiff relies--Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG
Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 199—the allegations in the
pleading could have been clearer but were sufficient to allege a prima facie
basis for relief. It sets forth what each party was obligated to do, the date
of execution of the agreement and the alleged date of breach. It is not clear
what additional information Defendant contends must be alleged at this time to
state a cause of action for breach of contract. Defendant argues it cannot
determine the statute of limitations, the dates, the parties, and conditions of
the agreement. As discussed, the parties, their obligations and relevant dates
are set forth. This is sufficient to allege a cause of action for breach of
contract and Defendant can obtain additional information through discovery. 
 
The Demurrer to
the first cause of action for breach of contract is overruled. 
 
2nd Cause of
Action for Open Book Account
 
First, Defendant
argues that an action for common counts is improper without a written contract
per Business & Professions Code section 6148. The First Amended Complaint,
however, does allege the existence of a written contract although it is not attached.
It is not clear, therefore, how Business & Professions Code section 6148
bars the action for open book account. Defendant also argues that the
allegations of the open book account are insufficiently alleged because
Plaintiff provides “no specification as to what specific work, labor,
services and materials were rendered, when the amounts for any specific work,
labor, services and materials came due, and how Plaintiff calculated damages in
the amount of $22,401.00.” (Demurrer, p. 9:13-15.) However, Defendant agrees
with Plaintiff’s authority that the only allegations required are “(1) the
statement of indebtedness in a certain sum, (2) the consideration, i.e., goods
sold, work done, etc., and (3) nonpayment…[Citation.]” (Farmers Ins.
Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 460.) As with the cause of
breach of contract, Plaintiff has sufficiently indicated that Defendant is
indebted in a stated amount, Plaintiff’s performance of legal services and,
nonpayment. 
 
The Demurrer to the second cause of action for open book
account is also overruled.
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Defendant Farouque Mazra’s Demurrer to the First
Amended Complaint is OVERRULED. DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AN ANSWER TO THE FIRST
AMENDED COMPLAINT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
