TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
Defendant Araksya Dulbenchyan’s Motion to Vacate Default and
Default Judgment and Motion to Quash Service is GRANTED. ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
RE: FAILURE TO FILE PROOF OF SERVICE OF SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT IS SET FOR

ANALYSIS:
 
On February 13, 2020, Plaintiff Prime Point Contracting,
Inc. (“Plaintiffs”) filed the instant action for motor vehicle negligence
against Defendant Araksya Dulbenchyan (“Defendant”). Plaintiff filed proof of personal
service of the Summons and Complaint on February 15, 2022. When Defendant
failed to file a responsive pleading, Plaintiff obtained their default on June
6, 2022. The Court set an Order to Show Cause re: Entry of Default or
Dismissal, which was continued multiple times. At the Order to Show Cause on
April 13, 2023, Defendant appeared and indicated they would move to vacate
default. 
 
On September 11, 2023, Defendant filed the instant Motion to
Vacate Default and Quash Service. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves to vacate the entry of default pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), section 473.5, or Code of
Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d). 
 
Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), an application for relief must be made
no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th
130, 143.) The motion must also be accompanied by a copy of the moving
defendant’s proposed pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This can be
corrected if Defendant submits a proposed responsive pleading by the hearing
date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.) 
 
The instant Motion was not timely filed within six months of
entry of default on June 6, 2022. The six-month deadline is jurisdictional and
not subject to tolling. (Manson, Iver & York v. Black (2009) 176
Cal.App.4th 36, 42.) Therefore, Defendant cannot obtain relief under Code of
Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). 
 
The Motion is also brought under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473.5, subdivision (a): 
 
When service of a summons has not resulted
in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a default or
default judgment has been entered against him or
her in the action, he or she may serve and file a
notice of motion to set aside the default or default judgment and for
leave to defend the action.  The notice of
motion shall be served and filed within a reasonable time, but in no event
exceeding the earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a default judgment
against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service on him or
her of a written notice that the default or default judgment has
been entered.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).)
Additionally, the motion “shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing under
oath that the party's lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was
not caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The party
shall serve and file with the notice a copy of the answer, motion, or other
pleading proposed to be filed in the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd.
(b).) Defendant’s Motion is timely under this statute and they contend they did
not receive actual notice in time to defend the action. (Motion, Dulbenchyan
Decl., ¶8.) However, the declaration does not state that Defendant’s lack of
actual notice was not caused by avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect,
nor is the Motion accompanied by a copy of Defendant’s proposed responsive
pleading. Both of these are required before the Court can grant relief under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5. 
 
Finally, Defendant moves to vacate the default on
grounds that it is void, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (d), which states that “[t]he court may, .... on motion of
either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or
order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (d).) The Motion points to Rogers v.
Silverman (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1114, 1116, which holds that the limitations
period contained in Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5 applies by analogy to
motions brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d). As
noted above, the Motion is timely under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5. Defendant
contends that the entry of default is void due to defective service, which was
the same ground raised in Rogers. In support, Defendant submits a
declaration disputing that service occurred as stated in the proof of personal
service filed on February 15, 2022. 
 
“When a defendant
challenges the court’s personal
jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process ‘the burden is on the
plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the
facts requisite to an effective service.’” (Summers
v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413; see also Lebel v. Mai
(2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160.) However, a proof of service
containing a declaration from a registered process server invokes a rebuttable presumption
affecting the burden of producing
evidence of the facts stated in the return. (Cal. Evid. Code, § 647; see American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383,
390.)
 
Here,
the challenged
proof of service is not attested to by a registered process server, and
therefore, is not entitled to a presumption of truth of its contents. (Proof
of Personal Service, filed 02/15/22 ¶7e.) The burden to prove the facts requisite to an effective service,
therefore, falls to Plaintiff. Since Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to
the instant Motion, it has not carried its burden to demonstrate proper service
of the Summons and Complaint. Furthermore, Defendant attests that they were
never served with this action, let alone personally served on February 14,
2022. (Motion, Dulbenchyan Decl., ¶8.) Defendant has demonstrated that the
entry of default was void and should be vacated under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (d). 
 
Defendant also moves to quash service of the
Summons and Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10. The
grounds to quash exist based on the defective service as demonstrated by
Defendant’s declaration. Regarding
the timing of the request to quash service, “[a] defendant, on or before the
last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court
may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more
of the following purposes: To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1),
emphasis added.) A defendant has 30 days after the service of the summons to
file a responsive pleading.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 412.20, subd. (a)(3).) To the extent that Plaintiff has not shown
proper service of the Summons and Complaint, the Court finds good cause for the
timing of the request to quash.  
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Araksya Dulbenchyan’s Motion to Vacate Default and
Default Judgment and Motion to Quash Service is GRANTED. ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
RE: FAILURE TO FILE PROOF OF SERVICE OF SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT IS SET FOR
JANUARY 4, 2024, AT 8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.
