And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the defendant's motion to vacate the default and default judgment, as well as the motion to quash service. The defendant, Araksya Dulbenchyan, has demonstrated that the proof of personal service filed by the plaintiff was defective and that they were never actually served with the summons and complaint. As a result, the Court finds that the entry of default was void and should be vacated. The Court has also set an Order to Show Cause for January 4, 2024, to address the failure to file proof of service of the summons and complaint.
