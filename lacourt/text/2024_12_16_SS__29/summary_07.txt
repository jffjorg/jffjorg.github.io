And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a civil case, Case Number 23STCV05748, involving Pinky Smith, the plaintiff, and Global Paratransit, Inc. and Esmeralda Herrera, the defendants. The defendants moved to compel the plaintiff to respond to discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The plaintiff failed to respond to these requests in a timely manner.

The court finds that the motions are denied as moot because the plaintiff has already served responses to the discovery requests. However, the court grants the defendants' requests for sanctions in part. The court sets sanctions on each motion in the amount of $525, calculated based on 1.5 hours of attorney work, multiplied by counsel's billing rate of $350 per hour. The total amount of sanctions is $1,575, which the plaintiff must pay to the defendants within 30 days of notice of this order.
