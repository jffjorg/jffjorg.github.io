And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to set aside the dismissal of their complaint. The complaint was filed against Linda Webster and others for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence arising from an alleged accident on October 12, 2022. The plaintiffs' counsel made a calendaring error, resulting in the failure to appear at the final status conference and trial, leading to the dismissal of the complaint. The judge finds that the dismissal was the result of the mistake and inadvertence of the plaintiffs' counsel, and therefore grants the motion to set aside the dismissal. The judge also orders the plaintiffs' counsel, Carla Green, to pay $250 to the State Bar Client Security Fund and sets an order to show cause regarding why monetary sanctions should not be imposed on the plaintiff and/or counsel for failure to serve the defendant within the time period set forth in California Rules of Court.
