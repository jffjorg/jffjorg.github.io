And here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Lee's motion to compel Plaintiff Magana to respond to Form Interrogatories, Set Two, and Special Interrogatories, Set Two. The Judge orders Plaintiff Magana to provide written, verified, code-compliant responses to the interrogatories within 10 days of notice. The request for sanctions is denied because Plaintiff Magana has not opposed the motion.

The Judge also denies Defendant Lee's motion for a deemed admitted order as to Defendant's Requests for Admission, Set Two, without prejudice. The request for sanctions in the motion for deemed admitted order is also denied without prejudice.

The Judge notes that Plaintiff Magana has not responded to Defendant's Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories, and that Defendant has served the interrogatories on Plaintiff Magana. The Judge finds that the motion to compel is granted because Plaintiff Magana has failed to respond to the interrogatories, and that the request for sanctions is denied because Plaintiff Magana has not opposed the motion.
