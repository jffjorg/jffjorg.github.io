Background
On

(“Schwartz”), U-Haul, U-Haul Co. of Arizona (“UHAZ”), U-Haul Co. of Arizona dba
U-Haul, U-Haul International, Inc., Amerco, and Does 1 through 50 for negligence
arising out of an alleged vehicle accident on May 30, 2022.
 
On
December 1, 2023, UHAZ filed an answer. 
 
On
June 10, 2024, Schwartz filed an answer. 
 
On
August 16, 2024, UHAZ filed a motion for summary judgment; the hearing on the
motion is scheduled for April 21, 2025. 
 
On
November 6, 2024, Schwartz filed a motion for summary judgment; the hearing on
the motion is scheduled for July 1, 2025.
 
When
the case was filed, the Court assigned a trial date of November 8, 2024.  In July 2024, the Court, on the stipulation
of the parties, continued the trial date to July 9, 2025.

Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a)(8), provides that the court has the power to amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The
power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the
discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of
calendar control including the granting or denying of continuances.” (Park
Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil
cases, the dates assigned for trial are firm. 
All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as
certain.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(a).)
“Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(c).)  “The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance.”  (Ibid.)  Circumstances that may support a finding of
good cause include:  
“(1) The
unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness,
or other excusable circumstances;  
(2) The
unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(3) The
unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(4) The
substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing
that the substitution is required in the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition
of a new party if: (A) The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had
a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard
to the new party's involvement in the case; 

(6) A party's
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts; or  
(7) A
significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of
which the case is not ready for trial.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)  
“In ruling on a motion or application for
continuance, the court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are
relevant to the determination.”  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)  California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that
the court may consider:  
“(1) The
proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether
there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to
any party;  
(3) The length
of the continuance requested;  
(4) The
availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the
motion or application for a continuance; 

(5) The
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;

(6) If the case
is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and
whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's
calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial; 

(9) Whether all
parties have stipulated to a continuance; 

(10) Whether the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the
matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other
fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) 
“A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
Discussion
Defendants request a trial continuance to accommodate the motion for summary judgment of
Schwartz, which is scheduled to be heard on July 1, 2025. (Lapidus Decl., ¶ 7.)

The Court of
Appeal has held that a party who files a timely motion for summary judgment has
a right to have the motion heard prior to trial.  (E.g., Cole, supra, 87
Cal.App.5th at p. 88; Sentry Ins. Co., supra, 207 Cal.App.3d at pp. 528-529.)
Here, Schwartz timely served and filed his motion for summary judgment.
In general, motions for summary judgment are heard at least 30
days before trial (although, for good cause shown, the Court may order that a
motion be heard less than 30 days before trial).  
Schwartz requests a 60-day continuance of the trial date but
does not provide adequate reason for the scope of this request.  A continuance of approximately 30 days would
allow for Schwartz’s summary judgment motion to be heard more than 30 days
before trial.
Accordingly, the
request to continue trial is granted in part.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS IN PART the motion of Defendants
to continue trial. 
The Court CONTINUES the trial to a date on or
after August 12, 2025.  The Final Status
Conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
Moving Party is ORDERED to give notice.
