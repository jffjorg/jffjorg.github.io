Background
On April 13, 2021, Plaintiffs Jaime
Rodriguez-Palos (“Rodriguez-Palos”), Rigoberto J. Magana (“Magana”), and Juana
Garcia Rolon (“Rolon”) filed a complaint against Henry Muyomba (“Muyomba”), The
Estate of Henry Muyomba (“Estate”), Susan Tamale Nantongo (“Nantongo”), Fook
Choon Lee (“Lee”), PV Holding Corp. (“PV”), and Does 1 to 100 for motor vehicle
negligence and general negligence arising from an alleged automobile accident
on May 26, 2019, on the I-5 Freeway in Pacoima,
California.
On May
11, 2022, the Court granted the request of Plaintiffs’ counsel Kyle Valero to
be relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs Magana and Rolon.  As subsequently clarified, counsel continued,
and continues, to represent Plaintiff Rodriguez-Palos.
On July 14, 2022, PV filed its
answer.
On
August 12, 2022, Lee and PV Holding Corp. filed an answer as well as a
cross-complaint against Muyomba, Estate, Nantongo, and Roes 1 through 20.
On
November 18, 2022, Nantongo filed an answer to the cross-complaint.
On
December 21, 2022, the Court, at the request of Plaintiffs, dismissed the
claims in the complaint against Nantongo.
On July
27, 2023, new counsel substituted in to represent Plaintiffs Magana and Rolon.
On November
13, 2023, Defendant Lee amended the cross-complaint to name Nantongo as the
executor of Estate as Roe 1.
On
December 7, 2023, the Court, at the request of Cross-Complainants, dismissed
the claim in the cross-complaint against Nantongo.
On December
22, 2023, the Court, at the request of Plaintiffs Magana and Rolon, dismissed
the claims in the complaint against PV.
On
December 27, 2023, counsel for Plaintiff Rodriguez-Palos filed a notice of
settlement of the entire case.  Counsel
subsequently clarified that the settlement related only to Plaintiff Rodriguez-Palos,
and not the other Plaintiffs.
On April
3, 2024, the Court granted the request of counsel for Plaintiff Magana to be
relieved.  
On April 4, 2024, the Court, at the
request of Plaintiff Rodriguez-Palos, dismissed his claims.
 
On June 5, 2024, the Court, at the
request of Plaintiff Rolon, dismissed her claims.
 
On November 8, 2024, Defendant Lee (“Defendant”)
filed the two discovery motions that are set for hearing on December 16: (1) a
motion to compel Plaintiff Magana (“Plaintiff”) to provide initial responses to
Form Interrogatories (Set Two) and Special Interrogatories (Set Two); and (2) a
motion for an order deeming Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters
specified in Requests for Admission (Set Two). 
In each motion, Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Motion to Compel Initial Responses to
Interrogatories
 
On June 18, 2024, Defendant served
Plaintiff with Special Interrogatories, Set Two; on August 28, 2024, Defendant
served Plaintiff with Form Interrogatories, Set Two. (Garber Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.) Responses
have not been received.
 
Defendant provides proof of service
for each of the interrogatories showing proper service on in pro per Plaintiff.
 
Defendant need show nothing more.
 
The motion to compel Plaintiff’s
responses to written interrogatories is granted.
 
The request for sanctions is denied.  Plaintiff has not opposed the motion, and
therefore the Court cannot find that he has unsuccessfully opposed the
motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
Motion for Deemed Admitted Order
 
Defendant’s counsel states that Defendant
served Requests for Admission (Set Two) on Plaintiff on August 28, 2024.  (Garber Decl., ¶ 3.)  Defendant does not, however, provide the
Court with the Requests for Admission: only the first page is attached to
counsel’s declaration, and no proof of service of the Requests for Admission on
Plaintiff is attached.
 
Accordingly, the motion for a deemed
admitted order is denied without prejudice. 
The request for sanctions is also denied without prejudice.
