And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Jose Tovar, filed a complaint against Brookfield Properties Retail Inc. and others for negligence and premises liability arising from a trip and fall on retail premises in Glendale. The defendant, Universal Protection Service, LP, argues that the complaint should be struck due to improper amendments, expiration of the statute of limitations, and unfair prejudice.

The judge finds that the plaintiff's amendments were proper and that the statute of limitations has not expired. The judge also finds that the plaintiff was ignorant of the true name of the defendant, Universal, when the complaint was filed, and therefore, the amendment relates back to the date the complaint was filed.

The judge denies the motion to strike and states that the ruling is without prejudice as to any motion by Universal for summary judgment based on the statute of limitations. The judge also notes that the trial date is scheduled for July 8, 2025, providing Universal with adequate time to conduct discovery and prepare for trial.
