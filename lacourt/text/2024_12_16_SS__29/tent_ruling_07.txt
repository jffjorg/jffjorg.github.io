Background
On March 15, 2023, Pinky Smith (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Global Paratransit, Inc., Esmeralda Herrera (collectively
“Defendants”), and Does 1 through 100 for motor vehicle negligence arising out
of an alleged accident on April 28, 2022.
 
On June 2, 2023, Defendants filed an answer. 
 
On November 8, 2024, Defendants filed
these three motions to compel Plaintiff to respond to discovery.  Plaintiff filed a single opposition on
December 3.  Defendants filed three
replies on December 9.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not
provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390,
411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party
moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party
moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
“[P]roviding untimely responses
does not divest the trial court of its authority [to hear a motion to compel
responses].”  (Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.)  Even if the untimely response “does not
contain objections [and] substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion
to compel responses … the trial court retains the authority to hear the
motion.”¿ (Id. at pp.
408-409.)¿ This rule gives
“an important incentive for parties to respond to discovery in a timely
fashion.”¿ (Id. at p.
408.)¿ If “the propounding
party [does not] take the motion off calendar or narrow its scope to the issue
of sanctions,” the trial court may “deny the motion to
compel responses as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just
impose sanctions.”¿ (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)
Discussion
In these three
motions, Defendants move for orders compelling Plaintiff to respond to Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for
Production of Documents (Set One). 
On June 12, 2024,
Defendants propounded the written discovery in question on Plaintiff. (Correia Decls.,
¶ 3; see also Exhs. A.) Plaintiff served responses on December 9, 2024, after the
opposition to these motions was filed. (Reply Correia Decls., ¶ 6; see also
Exhs. C.)
Accordingly, Defendants’
motions for orders compelling Plaintiff to provide written responses to the
form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production are
denied as moot.
The requests for
sanctions are granted in part.  Given the relatively
straightforward nature of a motion to compel initial responses, and the
economies of scale associated with filing multiple discovery motions, the Court
sets sanctions on each motion in the amount of $525, calculated based on 1.5
hours of attorney work, multiplied by counsel’s billing rate of $350 per
hour.  (See Correia Decls., ¶ 6.)
Conclusion
The
Court DENIES AS MOOT the Defendants’ motions for orders compelling Plaintiff Pinky
Smith to respond Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set
One), and Requests for Production (Set One).
 
The
Court GRANTS IN PART Defendants’ requests for sanctions.
 
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff Pinky Smith to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil
Discovery Act in the total amount of $1,575 ($525 per motion, multiplied by
three motions) to Defendants (through counsel) within 30 days of notice of this
order. 
 
Moving Party is to
provide notice.
