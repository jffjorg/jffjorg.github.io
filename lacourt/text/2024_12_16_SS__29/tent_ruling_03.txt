 Case Number:  22STCV23499    Hearing Date:   December 16, 2024    Dept:  29 Kolodziey v. Moonlight Rollerway, Inc.
22STCV23499
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary
Adjudication
 
Tentative
 
The Court will call this matter and hear from counsel.
Counsel should be prepared to address all issues, including, but in no way
limited to, the following:
 
First, Plaintiff requests a continuance of the
hearing so that certain discovery may be completed. Should the Court grant that
request? Would granting the request require a continuance of the trial date?
 
Second, Defendant has lodged a video of the
incident. For various technology and security reasons, the Court has not viewed
the video at this time. Defendant should be prepared, at the hearing, to
present the video for viewing in open court.
