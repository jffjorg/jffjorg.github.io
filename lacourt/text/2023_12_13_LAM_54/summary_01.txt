The Plaintiff had argued that the order should be reconsidered because Plaintiff did not act in bad faith, but the Court found that Plaintiff's arguments had already been rejected in the previous order. The Court further found that Plaintiff did not provide any new or different facts, circumstances, or law to support reconsideration. As a result, the motion is denied.
