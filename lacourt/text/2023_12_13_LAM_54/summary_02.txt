And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration in the case between Nomi Abadi (plaintiff) and Danny Elfman (defendant). The dispute arises from a breach of contract concerning a settlement agreement executed in 2018. The agreement contains an arbitration provision, which states that any disputes relating to the enforcement or interpretation of the agreement shall be subject to arbitration in Los Angeles, California. The plaintiff argues that the arbitration provision does not apply because the complaint seeks injunctive relief, but the Judge finds that the complaint is, in essence, a claim for recovery of money, which is governed by the arbitration clause.
