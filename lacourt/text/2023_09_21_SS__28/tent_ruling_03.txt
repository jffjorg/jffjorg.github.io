 Case Number:  20STCV08783    Hearing Date:   September 21, 2023    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
March 3, 2020, Plaintiffs Jose Adan Hernandez and Zoila Hernandez filed this
action against Defendants City of Los Angeles (“City”), Los Angeles Fire
Department, Francisco Martinez (“Martinez”), Cosme
Colon Fajardo ("Fajardo"), and Does 1-25 for negligence and loss of
consortium. 
On
April 3, 2020, Plaintiff Jose Adan Hernandez ("Plaintiff") filed a first amended complaint
removing Zoila Hernandez and the cause of action for loss of consortium. 
On
May 21, 2020, the City and Martinez filed answers. 
On
October 7, 2020, the City filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants
Fajardo and Roes 1-10 for indemnification, apportionment of fault, declaratory
relief, and motor vehicle negligence. 
On February 6, 2023, the clerk entered Fajardo’s default on
the cross-complaint at the City’s request. 
On
March 2, 2023, the City filed a statement of damages sought against Fajardo.  On March 24, 2023, the City filed a proof of
service showing the statement of damages was personally served on Liliana Funez
at Fajardo’s telephonic direction on March 21, 2023. 
On
August 7, 2023, the City filed a request for court judgment against Fajardo to
be heard on September 21, 2023. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Cross-Complainant City of Los Angeles requests that the Court enter a default judgment against
Cross-Defendant Cosme Colon Fajardo and award the City $660,000.00, consisting
of $560,000.00 in special damages, $100,000.00 in general damages, $0.00 in
prejudgment interest, $0.00 in attorney’s fees, and $0.00 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
          On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a cause of
action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence
establishing a prima facie case for damages.” 
(L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before
Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide: Procedure), citing
Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred
in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a
defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for
personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in
court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p.
493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of
the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at
p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide: Procedure, supra, ¶ 5:258, p. 5-70.) 
The
court “shall hear the evidence offered by the plaintiff, and shall render
judgment in the plaintiff’s favor for that relief, not exceeding the amount
stated in the complaint, in the statement required by Section 425.11, or in the
statement provided for by Section 425.115, as appears by the evidence to be
just. If the taking of an account, or the proof of any fact, is necessary to
enable the court to give judgment or to carry the judgment into effect, the
court may take the account or hear the proof . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (b).) 
“[T]he
court in its discretion may permit the use of affidavits, in lieu of personal
testimony, as to all or any part of the evidence or proof required or permitted
to be offered, received, or heard . . . . The facts stated in the affidavit or
affidavits shall be within the personal knowledge of the affiant and shall be
set forth with particularity, and each affidavit shall show affirmatively that
the affiant, if sworn as a witness, can testify competently thereto.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   The Court vacates the default because it was entered
before service of the statement of damages. 
The
purpose of the statement of damages is to ensure that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in
court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Becker, supra,
27 Cal.3d at p. 493.) 
“In
personal injury and wrongful death actions, the complaint must not state the
amount of damages sought [citations]. 
Therefore, before a default may be entered, plaintiff must serve
defendant with a statement of ‘the nature and amount of damages being sought.’
”  (Cal. Practice Guide: Procedure, supra,
¶ 5:82, p. 5-27, citing Code Civ. Proc., § 425.11.)  “Proof of service of a [statement of damages
under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11] must accompany any request for
entry of default to assure that defendants received actual notice of their
potential liability.”  (Ibid.) 
The
clerk entered Farjardo’s default on the City’s cross-complaint February 6, 2023.  The City did not serve a statement of damages
on Fajardo until March 21, 2023.  The
Court therefore vacates the default and denies the request for entry of default judgment.  
B.   Additional issues 
The
City has provided no evidence to support its request for $660,000 in damages.
The City states: "Plaintiff’s case had not settled. Therefore, City does
not know the exact amount of damages but has estimated that Plaintiff could ask
for as much as $600,000. City served Fajardo personally with a Statement of
Damages which has the estimated amount of $660,000." 
The City
does not explain the basis for its estimated damage amount or provide any evidence to
support it.  The City has not established
a prima facie case for damages. (See Cal.
Practice Guide: Procedure, supra, ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56.) In addition, the City has not dismissed the Roe Cross-Defendants. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court VACATES the default entered against
Cross-Defendant Cosme Colon Fajardo. 
The Court
DENIES the application for default judgment filed by Cross-Complainant City of
Los Angeles on August 7, 2023. 
The
Court sets an OSC re: Status of Entry of Default on November 8, 2023,
at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
