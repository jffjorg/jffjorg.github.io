PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court vacate the judgment of dismissal and enter judgment
against Defendant. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides in part:  
“(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement. 
“(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed
by a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
“(1) The party. 
“(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
“(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is
authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer’s behalf.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6,
subds. (a), (b).) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
and Defendant stipulated that, subject to the settlement agreement, the Court
would dismiss the action without prejudice and Defendant would pay Plaintiff
$15,000.00. Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiff $15,000.00 (the settlement
amount) in full settlement of the action as follows: Defendant's insurance
carrier, Alliance United Insurance, would make an initial payment of $10,000.00
by February 24, 2022. Then, beginning April 1, 2022, Defendant would begin
payment of $5,000.00 with monthly payments of $50.00 per month.  All subsequent payments were due on the same
day of each month afterwards until the settlement amount was paid in full.  Defendant’s failure to make a timely payment
would be a material breach. 
Under
the stipulation, if Defendant failed to make a timely payment, Plaintiff would
mail Defendant a letter advising that a payment was not received. If the
Defendant did not make the payment within 14 days, then Plaintiff would be
entitled to have any dismissal in this action set aside and to have judgment entered
for the settlement amount, minus credit for payments received, plus any costs
the Court requires to enter judgment or costs associated with any procedure to
have the judgment entered.  Plaintiff
would be entitled to entry of judgment upon submission of a declaration by
Plaintiff's counsel showing the breach and requesting that judgment be entered.
Plaintiff would provide written notice of the request that judgment be entered
to Defendant. Defendant could cure the default by bringing all payments current
prior to entry of judgment and submitting proof to Plaintiff's counsel and the
Court before entry of judgment. Otherwise, judgment would be entered against
Defendant. 
The
parties stipulated that the Court would retain jurisdiction under Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6 to enforce their agreement.  Based on the stipulation, the Court dismissed
the action. 
Plaintiff
states that Defendant made monthly payments according to the stipulation
totaling $350.00.  However, Defendant has
now defaulted on his remaining obligations under the parties’ stipulation.  Plaintiff sent a letter on or around May 16,
2023, informing Defendant of the missing payments. Defendant did not make
payment within fourteen days.  Therefore,
Plaintiff is entitled to have the dismissal vacated and judgment entered. The
Court grants the motion. 
Plaintiff’s
insurance company paid $10,000.00 in settlement and Defendant made $350.00 in
payments, leaving $4,650.00 owing on the settlement amount.  Plaintiff requests that the Court impose
costs of $584.50, consisting of a $435.00 filling fee, $89.50 service of
process fee and $60.00 filling fee. The Court declines to award reimbursement
of the $435 filling fee.  The Court grants the
request to add the $89.50 service of process fee and $60.00 motion filing fee to the judgment,
resulting in a total of $4,799.50. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s motion
to vacate dismissal and enter judgment against Defendant Jose Delgado Marchain. 
The
Court VACATES the judgment of dismissal entered on May 13, 2022.  
The
Court enters judgment against Defendant Jose Delgado Marchain in the amount of
$4,799.50, to be paid by Defendant to Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company within 30 days of the hearing on the motion. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
