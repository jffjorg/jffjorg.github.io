The Court has issued a tentative ruling in a case brought by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company against Jose Delgado Marchain. The case was initially dismissed in May 2022, but State Farm is seeking to vacate that dismissal and enter judgment against Marchain due to his failure to make timely payments under a settlement agreement. The settlement agreement required Marchain to make monthly payments of $50.00, with the total settlement amount of $15,000.00 to be paid in full by February 2022. However, Marchain defaulted on his payments, and State Farm is seeking to have the dismissal vacated and judgment entered against him. The Court has granted the motion, vacating the judgment of dismissal and entering judgment against Marchain in the amount of $4,799.50, which includes the unpaid settlement amount and costs.
