##  English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving the City of Los Angeles and Cosme Colon Fajardo.  

The City filed a cross-complaint against Fajardo and sought a default judgment for $660,000 in damages. However, the court vacated Fajardo's default because it was entered before the City properly served him with a statement of damages, which is required by law to give him notice of the potential liability.

Furthermore, the court denied the City's request for default judgment because they failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claim for damages. The City simply stated an estimate without explaining the basis for that amount.


The judge has scheduled a further hearing to address the status of the default and ordered the City to notify all parties of this ruling.
