##  English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving the City of Los Angeles and Cosme Colon Fajardo.  

The City filed a cross-complaint against Fajardo and sought a default judgment for $660,000 in damages. However, the court vacated Fajardo's default because it was entered before the City properly served him with a statement of damages, which is required by law to give him notice of the potential liability.

Furthermore, the court denied the City's request for default judgment because they failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claim for damages. The City simply stated an estimate without explaining the basis for that amount.


The judge has scheduled a further hearing to address the status of the default and ordered the City to notify all parties of this ruling.

Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).)
- "Where a cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages." (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide: Procedure), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361)

- "The court shall hear the evidence offered by the plaintiff, and shall render judgment in the plaintiff’s favor for that relief, not exceeding the amount stated in the complaint, in the statement required by Section 425.11, or in the statement provided for by Section 425.115, as appears by the evidence to be just. If the taking of an account, or the proof of any fact, is necessary to enable the court to give judgment or to carry the judgment into effect, the court may take the account or hear the proof . . . . (Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (b).)"

---

In this tentative ruling, the Court considers the City of Los Angeles' request for a default judgment against Cosme Colon Fajardo in the amount of $660,000.00. The Court finds that the default was entered before service of the statement of damages, which is a violation of due process. Therefore, the Court vacates the default and denies the application for default judgment. The City has also failed to provide evidence to support its damage claim or dismiss the Roe Cross-Defendants. The Court sets an OSC re: Status of Entry of Default on November 8, 2023.
