Summary:
The Judge has issued a tentative ruling that vacates the default entered against Fajardo and denies the City's request for default judgment. The Judge finds that the default was entered without service of the statement of damages, which is a requirement under California law. The City has also failed to establish a prima facie case for damages. The Judge sets a new hearing date to consider the status of entry of default.
