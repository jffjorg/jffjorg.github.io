 Case Number:  19STCV44000    Hearing Date:   September 21, 2023    Dept:  28 Claimant
Malaki Turner (“Claimant”) was left unsupervised while he was attending a

incident, Claimant suffered a lacerated upper lip and two broken teeth. 
This
is an expedited petition without a hearing, which is permitted under California
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5, if Petitioner Leslie Davis (“Petitioner”) uses
the required Judicial Council forms and meets certain conditions. The
settlement must not exceed $50,000. The conditions are: 
1. Petitioner is represented
by an attorney.
2. The claim is not for
wrongful death.
3. Settlement proceeds will
not be placed in a trust.
4. There are no unresolved
liens to be satisfied from the proceeds of the settlement.
5. Petitioner’s attorney did
not become involved at the request of Defendant or the insurance carrier.
6. Petitioner’s attorney is not
employed by or associated with a Defendant or insurance carrier in connection
with the petition.
7. If an action is filed, all
Defendants have appeared and are participating in the compromise OR the court
has determined that the settlement is in good faith.
8. The settlement, exclusive
of interests and costs, is $50,000 or less OR if greater than $50,000, the
amount payable is the insurance policy limits AND all proposed contributing
parties would be substantially unable to use assets other than the insurance
policy limits AND the court does not otherwise order. 
SETTLEMENT:
$50,000.00 
INJURIES:
Lacerated upper lip and broken teeth 
MEDICAL
EXPENSES PAID: $18,481.23 
COSTS:
$955.78 
ATTORNEY’S
FEES: $12,500.00 which is 25% of the gross settlement 
BALANCE
OF PROCEEDS: $18,062.99 
DISCUSSION: 
Section
13a(5) of the petition states that outstanding liens total $10,867.23.  Section 13e states that Petitioner has paid claimant’s
medical expenses to be reimbursed in the amount of $4,454.00.  (Section 15b(1), however, states that
Petitioner paid $18,481.23 for claimant’s medical expenses and is requesting
reimbursement of that amount, along with attorney fees and other expenses.)  Yet Section 13a(4) states that only $7,614.00
is to be paid or reimbursed from the proceeds. 
The
Court cannot approve a minor’s compromise unless it reimburses all medical
expenses that have not been reduced or waived. 
Petitioner should revise the petition to address the discrepancies noted
above and to make sure that all liens are resolved prior to seeking Court
approval. 
The
Court denies the application.
