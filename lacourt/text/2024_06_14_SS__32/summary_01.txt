```

And here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment/adjudication on the grounds that there are triable issues of fact regarding the existence of a duty of care and causation. The court finds that the defendant allegedly maintained a public nuisance on the property and encouraged gang presence, which increased the risk of harm to the plaintiff. The court also finds that the defendant's arguments regarding foreseeability and duty are insufficient. The motion for punitive damages is also denied as there is no clear and convincing evidence of malice, fraud, or oppression.
