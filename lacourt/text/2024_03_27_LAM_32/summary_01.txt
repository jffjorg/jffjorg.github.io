And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by the judge addresses the motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant Sammy Zablen. The plaintiff, Alexander Khazai, filed a lawsuit against numerous defendants, including Zablen, alleging that they failed to properly compensate him for his services. Zablen filed a motion to quash service of summons, arguing that the service was improper. The court previously granted a similar motion, finding that substitute service could not be effectuated by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint on the doorstep and mailing it to that address. In this case, the proof of service filed on January 25, 2024, indicates that the summons and complaint were taped to the door of Zablen's residence, which is considered improper service. The plaintiff admits that service was not properly effectuated and contends that he remedied the error with a later proof of service filed on March 1, 2024. The court grants the motion to quash, finding that the service was improper and that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate proper service.
