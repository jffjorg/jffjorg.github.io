HEATHER TOOMES,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
UHC OF CALIFORNIA, 
                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  23STCV18404
  Hearing Date:  March 27, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 3, 2023, Plaintiff Heather
Toomes filed this action against Defendant UHC of California, asserting causes
of action for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing. The complaint alleges that Defendant wrongfully refused
to authorize a needed surgery for Plaintiff based on surgery guidelines that
were biased and financially-driven. 
            On March 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to compel further responses to her requests for production.
Defendant filed a late opposition on March 15, 2024. Plaintiff filed her reply
on March 20, 2024. The Court does not find Defendant’s late opposition to be prejudicial
and proceeds on the merits. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Upon receiving responses to its discovery
requests, the propounding party may move for an order compelling further
responses if the responses are incomplete or evasive, or objections are without
merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a),
2033.290(a).) 
The party seeking production of documents
bears the initial burden of showing good cause through a fact-specific showing
of relevance. (Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.)
Once this showing is made, the burden shifts to the responding party to justify
any objections. (Ibid.) 
MEET AND CONFER
A motion to compel further must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to
resolve the matter informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1),
2031.310(b), 2033.290(b).) The Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the meet
and confer requirement. (See Davis Decl.)
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff moves to compel responses
to RFP Nos. 1-3, 6, and 8-16. In opposition, Defendant argues that only five of
the requests are really at issue because it has provided supplemental responses
to the remaining requests. The Court addresses these five requests below. The
adequacy of the supplemental responses is not the subject of this motion.  
            a. RFP Nos. 8 and 9
            RFP No. 8 seeks all documents
setting forth the procedures Defendant followed in researching, developing,
adopting, or updating the Medical Policies for various medical conditions,
including for the specific surgery Plaintiff required, from January 1, 2018 to
present. RFP No. 9 seeks all documents from January 1, 2018 to present
evidencing any activity of the Medical Technology Assessment Committee relating
to the research, development, adoption, or updating of the Medical Policy for
the specific surgery Plaintiff required. 
            Plaintiff has established good cause
for information relating to the Medical Policy tied her specific surgery
because she alleges that Defendant wrongfully adopted a biased policy that
favored profits over medical necessity. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s
process for adopting its medical policy did not comply with California law. Therefore,
the history of the policy leading up to Plaintiff’s rejection is relevant, not
just the policy itself. Plaintiff may inquire into records from January 1, 2019
to May 15, 2023, the date Plaintiff was rejected. However, Plaintiff has not
established good cause for records pertaining to other Medical Policies or for
documents from a time period after she was rejected. 
            The motion is granted as to RFP Nos.
8 and 9, limited to records pertaining to the specific type of surgery that
Plaintiff was rejected for, and limited to the time period from January 1, 2019
to May 15, 2023. To the extent Defendant has produced or will produce all such
documents, it must provide a code-compliant response to that effect. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.220.) To the extent Defendant cannot produce such documents,
it must provide a code-compliant response to that effect. (See Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.230.) 
            b. RFP Nos. 10 and 11
            RFP No. 10 seeks all documents from
January 1, 2018 to present evidencing any activity of persons outside the
Medical Technology Assessment Committee relating to the research, development,
adoption, or updating of the Medical Policy for the specific surgery Plaintiff
required. RFP No. 11 seeks all documents from January 1, 2018 to present
evidencing any research, investigation, or analysis Defendant performed
regarding the type of surgery Plaintiff requested. 
            These requests mirror the ones
discussed above and are subject to the same analysis. Therefore, the motion is
granted as to RFP Nos. 10 and 11, subject to the same limits and requirements
set forth above. 
            c. RFP No. 15
            RFP No. 15 seeks all agreements in
effect in 2023 between Defendant and the medical group to which Plaintiff was
assigned. Plaintiff argues that there is good cause because she is entitled to
discover whether and to what extent Defendant delegated the rejection decision
to Plaintiff’s medical group. 
However, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant,
not her medical group, was responsible for the rejection. Plaintiff does not
allege that Defendant delegated the decision or that any other entity
participated in the decision. The complaint alleges that Defendant rejected
Plaintiff’s surgery based on Defendant’s medical policy. Therefore, the motion
is denied as to RFP No. 15.    
            d. Remaining Requests
            The motion is granted as to the
remaining requests because Defendant’s responses failed to abide by the Code
requirements for statements of compliance or inability to comply. (See Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.220, 2031.230.) Defendant must also “[i]dentify with
particularity any document . . . falling within any category of item in the
demand to which an objection is being made” and “[s]et forth clearly the extent
of, and the specific ground for, the objection.” (Id., § 2031.240(a).)
To the extent Defendant has supplemented its responses, those supplemental
responses are not the subject of this motion. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses is GRANTED in part as set forth above.
