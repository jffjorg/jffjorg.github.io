And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production. The plaintiff filed this motion after the defendant failed to provide complete and adequate responses to the requests. The judge has granted the motion in part, ordering the defendant to provide additional responses to certain requests for production. The requests at issue relate to the development and adoption of the defendant's medical policy, which the plaintiff alleges was biased and financially-driven.

The judge has limited the scope of the requests to records pertaining to the specific type of surgery that the plaintiff was rejected for, and to the time period from January 1, 2019 to May 15, 2023. The judge has also ordered the defendant to provide a code-compliant response to the effect that it has produced or will produce all relevant documents, or that it is unable to produce such documents.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for further responses to one of the requests, which sought all agreements in effect in 2023 between the defendant and the plaintiff's medical group. The judge has ruled that this request is not relevant to the plaintiff's claims.

The judge has ordered the parties to meet and confer in an effort to resolve the dispute informally, and has scheduled a hearing on the matter for March 27, 2024.
