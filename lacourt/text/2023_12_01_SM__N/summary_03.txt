And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint is sustained with 30 days leave to amend. The defendant's motion to strike all claims for punitive damages is denied as moot. The plaintiff may amend her complaint only as authorized by the court's order and may not amend the complaint to add a new party or cause of action without permission.

The court's ruling is based on the legal sufficiency of the allegations in the complaint. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants' actions constitute medical battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. However, the specific nature of the defendants' conduct remains unclear, and the plaintiff's allegations do not provide sufficient details to support the claims.

The court has given the defendants 30 days to amend their demurrer, and the plaintiff may amend her complaint only as authorized by the court's order. The court has also denied the defendants' motions to strike as moot, as the court's ruling on the demurrer has rendered the motions unnecessary.
