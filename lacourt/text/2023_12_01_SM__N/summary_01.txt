And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The defendant, 817 Whittier, LLC, has filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking to dismiss the claims brought by the plaintiffs, Saule Bektayeva and Darina Denisova. The plaintiffs claim that the defendant is holding $380,000 of their funds, which represents rent and a security deposit, and that the defendant's actions are unjust and illegal. The defendant argues that the plaintiffs' claims are without merit and that the defendant has established that there is no triable issue of material fact.

The court finds that the defendant has met its burden of showing that the plaintiffs' claims are without merit. The plaintiffs have failed to oppose the motion, and the defendant's evidence establishes that there is no triable issue of material fact as to the plaintiffs' claims. Therefore, the court grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment and orders the defendant to prepare, serve, and submit a proposed judgment as per statute.
