Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of MMBA Ventura, LLC v. Sypien. The defendant, Sypien, filed an unopposed demurrer to the first amended complaint, alleging that the plaintiff, MMBA Ventura, LLC, lacks standing to sue and that the three-day notice served was insufficient. The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff has the opportunity to correct the defects in the complaint.

The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations regarding the rent credit and the employment agreement were contradictory, and that the plaintiff failed to explain the reason for the change in the rental amount. The judge also ruled that the three-day notice was invalid because it sought rent in excess of the amount due. Finally, the judge found that the plaintiff's attempt to cross-out and omit the rental amount in the original agreement from the FAC without an explanation was a sham pleading.
