MMBA Ventura, LLC
v. Sypien, Case No. 24SMCV01224
Hearing Date June
27, 2024
Defendant Sypien’s
Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (UNOPPOSED)
 
Plaintiff MMBA
Ventura filed a form complaint for unlawful detainer on March 15, 2024 seeking
possession and past due rent. After demurrer, plaintiff filed an amended form complaint.
 
Per the FAC,
defendant entered into a written agreement with plaintiff’s agent to rent the
premises and also work as an employee, entitling him a rent credit. A copy of
the lease is not attached. Code Civ. Proc. §1161(2). The FAC alleged defendant
was substitute served a three-day notice on February 20, 2024 to Vivian (Doe). Defendant
demurs to the FAC. No opposition is filed.
 
Demurrer
Under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1170, the defendants to an action for possession of
real property may demur to the complaint. A defendant may demur on several
grounds, including the ground that the pleading does not state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action. Code Civ. Proc. §430.10(e).
 
Standing
Defendant argues
plaintiff does not have standing to sue, but FAC, para. 4 alleges plaintiff is
owner of the premises. 
 
Defendant attaches
deeds as exhibits to show the property is owned by other entities, not MMBA
Ventures. However, the court must accept as true all well-pleaded factual
allegations of the complaint. Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal. 3d 311,
318. This is a factual question, not suitable for resolution on demurrer.
 
Sufficiency of
Three-Day Notice
A three-day notice
must state “the amount that is due, the name, telephone number, and address of
the person to whom the rent payment shall be made,” and the methods by which
the tenants may pay the landlord. Code Civ. Proc. §1161(2). “Due to the summary
nature of such an action, a three-day notice is valid only if the landlord
strictly complies with the provisions of section 1161, subdivision 2 …” Levitz
Furniture Co. v. Wingtip Comms. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1035, 1038.
 
A three-day notice
is invalid if it seeks rent in excess of the amount due. Id. This is to
ensure a tenant is “given the proper opportunity to cure and prevent an
unlawful detainer action.” Bevill v. Zoura (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th
694, 698. “[F]airness requires that the landlord demand the precise sum due, so
that the tenant will know what he must do to avoid the forfeiture.” Budaef
v. Huber (1961) 194 Cal.App.2d 12, 18.
 
Defendant argues the
three-day notice overstates the amount of rent due. The notice stated defendant
owed $3,425 per month from March 1, 2023 through February 29, 2024. FAC Exh. 2.
Paragraph 6(d) of the FAC alleges the rent agreement was changed when
defendant’s employment with plaintiff’s agent terminated in February 2023.
“Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement, rent was increased to
$3,425 pursuant to Santa Monica Rent Charter Amendment Section 7001.” FAC ¶6(d).

 
Defendant argues plaintiff
served the three-day notice “without first having served [defendant] with a
notice raising his rent.” Demurrer, p. 6. If plaintiff did not serve a notice
of rent increase per Civil Code sec. 827, which requires notices of rent
increase be delivered personally or by mail, the increase was unlawful and the
three-day notice demands an amount in excess of the lawful rent. Plaintiff
failed to oppose. Sustained with leave
 
Sham Pleading
Defendant argues plaintiff’s
allegation as to the rent at the beginning of the rental agreement in the FAC
contradicts plaintiff’s alleged rent amount in the original complaint. The
allegations are contradictory. See Complaint ¶6(a)(2), cf FAC ¶(6)(a)(2). As to
the monthly rent beginning on or about July 1, 2020, the original complaint
states $660, and the FAC states $1,490. Complaint ¶6(a)(2); FAC ¶(6)(a)(2). The
court acknowledges plaintiff’s attempt to cross-out and omit the rental amount
in the original agreement from the FAC, without an explanation as to why the
amount was changed. Defendant demonstrated the existence of a sham pleading, as
the change in the rental amount can be considered a harmful fact in one
pleading that was avoided in a subsequent pleading without adequate
explanation. Relevant facts which make a pleading defective cannot simply be
omitted, particularly when the original pleading is verified. Webb, supra,
23 Cal.App.5th at 256.
 
Plaintiff must
explain the reason for the change in the rental amount. 
 
SUSTAINED WITH
LEAVE TO AMEND.
