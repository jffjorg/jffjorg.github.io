The Defendant moved to set aside the default judgment due to counsel's inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The Judge has ruled that the motion fails to comply with statutory requirements, including the requirement to file a copy of the proposed answer and provide the hearing date information. The Judge has also stated that the notice of the motion is defective due to the failure to include the hearing date information. The Judge has given the Defendant the opportunity to continue the motion to allow proper notice and compliance with applicable statutes.
