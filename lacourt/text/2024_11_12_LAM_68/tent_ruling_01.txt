Motion
for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiffs
Julian Cano and Shaniqua Cones allege Defendants failure to provide certain
material information regarding total mileage on a 2016 Honda Civic vehicle
purchased by the parties on November 20, 2021. 
 
On
March 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their complaint for 1. Violations of the
Consumers Legal Remedies Act; 2. Intentional Misrepresentation; 3. Concealment
4. Negligent Misrepresentation; 5. Breach of the Implied Warranty of
Merchantability; 6. Violation of the Unfair Competition Law; and 7. Violation
of Vehicle Code § 11711. On October 17, 2023, Defendant Shift Operations, LLC
filed a notice of Bankruptcy showing a Chapter 11 Bankruptcy petition filed on
October 9, 2023. On November 6, 2023, the case was ordered stayed as to the
Shift Operations, LLC. 
 
On
March 29, 2024, Plaintiffs dismissed American Contractors Indemnity without
prejudice. On May 6, 2024, the court stayed the entire action due to the Shift
Operations, LLC bankruptcy. The court vacated the August 12, 2024, trial date.
 
On
June 11, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed Shift Operations, LLC without Prejudice. On
August 14, 2024, the court lifted the stay and restored the case to the civil
active list.
 
RULING: Granted.
Request
for Judicial Notice: Granted in Part.
The
court takes judicial notice of the filed pleadings, but not the content for the
truth of the matter asserted.
 
Plaintiffs
Julian Cano and Shaniqua Cones move for leave to file a first amended complaint
in order to add new allegations, delete certain claims, and update certain
material information. [Declaration of Declaration Gregory Babbitt, Compendium
of Exhibits, Ex. 1.] The court electronic filing system shows no opposition or
reply on file.
 
A
motion for leave to amend must comply with the requirements set forth in
California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324, which states as follows:
 
“(a)      Contents of motion
A
motion to amend a pleading before trial must:
(1)              
Include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended
pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from previous
pleadings or amendments;
(2)              
State what allegations in the previous pleading are
proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number,
the deleted allegations are located; and 
(3)              
State what allegations are proposed to be added to the
previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located.
 
(b)        Supporting declaration
A
separate declaration must accompany the motion and must specify:
(1)        The effect of the amendment;
(2)        Why the amendment is necessary and
proper;
(3)        When the facts giving
rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and 
(4)              
The reasons why the request for amendment was not made 
earlier…” (emphasis added).
 
Dilatory delays and prejudice to the opposing parties is a valid
ground for denial. (Hirsa v. Superior
Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490.) 
Prejudice exists where the amendment would require delaying the trial,
resulting in loss of critical evidence, or added costs of preparation such as
an increased burden of discovery. (Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488.) 
 
Leave to amend is generally liberally granted. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473(a); Mesler v. Bragg
Management Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 296.) The court will not generally
consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading in ruling on a motion
for leave, instead deferring such determinations for a demurrer or motion to
strike, unless the proposed amendment fails to state a valid claim as a matter
of law. (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Marker, U.S.A.) (1989) 213
Cal. App.3d 1045, 1048; California
Casualty Gen. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 280–281
disapproved of on other grounds by
Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390.) 
 
The motion comes approximately 18 months after March 2023
filing of the complaint. Plaintiff maintains delays were caused due to the
bankruptcy, election to dismiss American Contractors Indemnity, and a change of
counsel for Capital One. [Babbit Decl.] The court accepts the timing of the
motion based on the circumstances, including the stay imposed as a result of
the bankruptcy and recent lift of the stay upon the dismissal of the bankruptcy
petition filing party.
 
Because the changes arise from the
common core of facts and otherwise adds no substantial material change to the
underlying action, the court finds no showing of significant prejudice to
Defendant. Defendant submits no opposition otherwise challenging the propriety
of the proposed pleading. Defendant will have sufficient time to address the
claims against them given the lack of any trial date. (See Magpali v.
Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-487; Hulsey v.
Koehler (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1150, 1159.) 
 
The motion is therefore granted. Plaintiffs
to file a separate copy of the first amended complaint within 10 days of the
order.
 
The court will concurrently conduct a case management
conference and establish a new trial date.
 
Plaintiffs to provide notice.
