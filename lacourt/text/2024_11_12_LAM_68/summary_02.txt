And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion for summary judgment. The court finds that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the sufficiency of accommodation for outdoor seating at the restaurant. The court also declines to find any triable issues of material fact on the basis of the "new issue" regarding single-use foodware accessories. The trial remains set for February 18, 2025. The Judge's ruling is based on the fact that the Defendant failed to establish that the outdoor tables were accessible to the Plaintiff's wheelchair and that the Plaintiff had a valid claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
