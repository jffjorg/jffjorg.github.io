A preliminary
injunction will issue if 1) moving party is likely to suffer greater injury
from a denial than the non-moving party is likely to suffer from its grant, and
2) a reasonable probability that the moving party will prevail on the merits. IT
Corp. v. County of Imperial (1983) 35 Cal.3d 63, 69-70. When a strong
showing is made on one of these two elements, the showing as to the other
element does not need to be as strong. Right Site Coalition v. Los Angeles
Unified School Dist. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 336, 339. A preliminary
injunction will only be issued if money damages would be an inadequate remedy. Tahoe
Keys Prop. Owners’ Assoc. v. State Water Resources Control Bd. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th
1459, 1471. 
 
The plaintiff
seeks relief, arguing he faces imminent foreclosure of his home. Despite the
temporary restraining order, the Notice of Trustee's Sale was recorded on
January 3, 2024, and foreclosure is imminent. Plaintiff likely face a greater
injury from a denial than defendant, as plaintiff stands to lose title to the
property and suffer severe economic harm from the foreclosure sale. The foreclosure
action stems from plaintiff’s inability to pay a loan amount on his property.
Cambell Decl. ¶ 5. Plaintiff alleges the inability to pay the loan is due to defendant’s
delay in paying the agreed-upon amount per the parties’ loan agreement. Id. ¶¶
34-37, 39. 
 
The property is
considered unique, and plaintiff would be prejudiced should the property to be
foreclosed upon. Plaintiff rightly points out that, by contrast, defendant
would face minimal hardship beyond temporarily being unable to foreclose on the
property, and any losses would be monetary losses only. Defendant does not file
opposition. 
 
Plaintiff
additionally evidences a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of
his breach of contract action and that the relief sought can offset the
mortgage owed on the property. Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch.
9(II)-A.
 
Plaintiff argues
the parties entered a contractual relationship for a loan and modifications
totaling $722,050 intended to be used to reimburse expenses incurred for a home
modification project. Plaintiff agreed to and did make regular monthly payments
on the loan. Plaintiff completed construction and requested reimbursements;
however, defendant withheld and limited release of funds, despite plaintiff’s
ongoing construction. The resulting delay resulted in additional interest
expenses and costs. Plaintiff alleges rather than disperse the construction
funds, defendant is attempting to foreclose. Plaintiff meets his burden
in showing a reasonable probability of success on the merits, especially in
light of the lack of opposition. As the property is unique and monetary damages
would be inadequate, the injunction is GRANTED.
