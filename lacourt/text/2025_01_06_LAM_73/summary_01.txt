Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the defendant's motion to consolidate two lawsuits, one filed by the defendant (Thomas Wesley Pentz) against the plaintiff (Marchel Gabrielle Auguste) alleging stalking, trespass, and distribution of private materials, and the other filed by the plaintiff against the defendant alleging sexual battery, gender violence, and violation of civil rights. The Judge found that the two cases involve common questions of law and fact, and that consolidating the two cases will promote trial convenience and economy by avoiding duplication of procedure. The Judge also noted that the parties share the same counsel and that the cases involve the same underlying facts, making consolidation appropriate.
