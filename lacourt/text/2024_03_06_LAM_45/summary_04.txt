And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to the Defendant's Motion to Strike punitive damages from the First Amended Complaint (FAC). The Defendant argues that the allegations in the FAC do not support the conclusions of malice, fraud, or oppression, and therefore, punitive damages should not be awarded.

The Judge agrees with the Defendant, finding that the Defendant's actions, although potentially breaching the Policy, do not rise to the level of malice, fraud, or oppression. The Judge notes that the dispute is over the amount of damages owed to the Plaintiff, rather than the Defendant's intentional conduct.

The Judge also grants the Plaintiff 20 days to amend the FAC, finding that there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. The Judge's ruling is based on the California Civil Procedure Code (CCP) and the California Civil Code (CIV).
