And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the special motion to strike (Anti-SLAPP) in part, as to the first, third, and fourth causes of action, with 30 days leave to amend, and denies it in part as to the second cause of action. The judge finds that the Plaintiff's causes of action for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, false light invasion of privacy, and public disclosure of private facts have minimal merit.

The judge rules that the Plaintiff's Complaint does not meet the requirements for alleging a cause of action for defamation, and that the Defendant's statement regarding the reason for the Plaintiff's termination is protected speech. The judge also finds that the Plaintiff has not established his causes of action for false light invasion of privacy and public disclosure of private facts.

The judge orders that the Plaintiff has 30 days to amend his Complaint to address the deficiencies identified in the ruling.
