 Case Number:  21STCV44769    Hearing Date:   September 21, 2023    Dept:  31 TENTATIVE
 
Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file an amended
complaint is GRANTED. 
 
Legal Standard
 
California Code
of Civil Procedure section¿473, subdivision¿(a)(1) provides, in relevant part:
“The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper,
allow a party¿to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the
name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a
mistake in any other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for
answer or demurrer.¿ The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to
the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any
pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an
answer to be made after the time limited by this code.”¿ 
 
“This discretion
should be exercised liberally in favor of amendments, for judicial policy
favors resolution of all disputed matters in the same lawsuit.”¿¿(Kittredge
Sports Co. v. Superior Court¿(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.)¿
Ordinarily, the court will not consider the validity of the proposed amended
pleading in ruling on a motion for leave since grounds for a demurrer or motion
to strike are premature.¿ The court, however, does have discretion to deny
leave to amend where a proposed amendment fails to state a valid cause of
action as a matter of law and the defect cannot be cured by further
amendment.¿¿(See¿California Casualty General Ins. Co. v. Superior Court¿(1985)
173 Cal.App.3d 274, 281¿(overruled on other grounds by¿Kransco¿v. American
Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co.¿(2000) 23 Cal.4th 390).)¿ 
 
Furthermore, ‘it is
irrelevant that new legal theories are introduced as long as the proposed
amendments “relate to the same general set of facts.” [Citation.]’ ”]; Hirsa v. Superior
Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d, 486,
490.)  Even if a good
amendment is proposed in proper form, a long, unwarranted and unexcused delay
in presenting it may be a good reason for denial.  In most cases, the
factors for timeliness are: (1) lack of diligence in discovering the facts or
in offering the amendment after knowledge of them; and (2) the effect of the
delay on the adverse party.  Prejudice exists where the amendment would
require delaying the trial, resulting in loss of critical evidence, or added
costs of preparation such as an increased burden of discovery.  (Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488.) 
 
Under¿California
Rules of Court¿Rule 3.1324(a), a motion to amend a pleading shall (1) include a
copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially
numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments; (2) state
what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any,
and where, by page, paragraph and line number, the deleted allegations are
located; and (3) state what allegations are proposed to be added to the
previous pleading, if any,¿and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located.¿ 
 
Under¿California
Rule of Court¿Rule 3.1324(b), a separate declaration must accompany the motion
and must specify (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is
necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations
were discovered; and (4)¿the reasons why the request for amendment was not made
earlier.¿ 
 
Discussion
Plaintiff seeks leave to
file an amended complaint as very recent discovery of new but related
facts and circumstances give rise to additional causes action and damages.
Plaintiff requests leave to add allegations that Don
had agreed to pay for a storage locker to store most of Anna’s belongings until
her return from her “temporary” stay in Estonia. In January 2023, however, Anna
learned for the first time that Don had, at some time prior, relinquished the
storage locker and had taken control of or disposed of her property, which is
worth no less than $100,000. Anna noticed social media posts depicting Greta
Park wearing Anna’s clothing and using other of Anna’s items, such as handbags,
shoes and the like. Permitting leave will not prejudice Defendants in any way
and will permit Anna to seek full compensation for all related conduct in one
lawsuit. Moreover, there is sufficient time remaining before the April 20204
trial date to conduct investigation and discovery in facts and circumstances.
Depositions have yet to be taken and therefore examinations of Plaintiff,
Defendant Don Park and Defendant Greta Park concerning Plaintiff’s new
allegations and claims may be conducted without altering any discovery schedule
agreed to by the parties. Permitting leave will also further notions of
judicial economy by avoiding multiple lawsuits, all arising out of related
transactions and prevent the possibility of inconsistent judgements and ruling,
should Anna be required to file a new action. 
The Court finds Plaintiff has complied with
CRC Rule 3.1324(a) by
including a copy of the proposed amended complaint and indicating what
allegations are proposed to be added to the previous pleading.  Plaintiff
also generally explains that her counsel discovered recently new facts that
give rise to new causes of action. The Court finds this is sufficient to
explain why the amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise
to the amended allegations were discovered, and why it was not made earlier. 
 
Despite
Defendant’s argument that Plaintiff delayed in amending the complaint,
Defendant would also need to show that it was prejudiced by the amendment.
Defendant has not explained how he would be prejudiced, other than generally
arguing he will be. Moreover, Defendant’s arguments at the validity of the
proposed amendment will not be considered at this time. Ordinarily, the court
will not consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading in ruling on a
motion for leave since grounds for a demurrer or motion to strike are
premature.¿¿(See¿California Casualty General Ins. Co. v. Superior Court¿(1985)
173 Cal.App.3d 274, 281¿(overruled on other grounds by¿Kransco¿v. American
Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co.¿(2000) 23 Cal.4th 390).)¿ Furthermore, ‘it is irrelevant that new
legal theories are introduced as long as the proposed amendments “relate to the
same general set of facts.” [Citation.]’ ”]; Hirsa, supra, 118 Cal.App.3d at p. 490.) 
 
Moreover,
Defendant’s argument relating to Plaintiff’s minor procedural defects are also
unavailing. 
 
Accordingly, the
Court exercising its discretion liberally in favor of amendments, grants the
motion for leave to file an amended complaint. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file an amended complaint is
GRANTED. Plaintiff
is ordered to file the first amended complaint attached as Exhibit B to the
motion within 10 days of this order. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
