And here is the summary in English text:

**Tentative Ruling**

The Judge grants Plaintiff Anna's motion to file an amended complaint. The motion is granted because the proposed amendment is related to the same general set of facts and does not prejudice the Defendants. The Court finds that Plaintiff has complied with the necessary requirements for the amendment and that there is sufficient time remaining before the trial date to conduct further investigation and discovery. The Judge also notes that permitting the amendment will further the notions of judicial economy by avoiding multiple lawsuits and preventing the possibility of inconsistent judgments.

The Court has considered the arguments of both parties, including Defendant Don Park's argument that Plaintiff delayed in amending the complaint, but finds that Defendant has not shown how the amendment would prejudice them. The Judge also declines to consider the validity of the proposed amendment at this time, as it is premature to do so.

The Court orders Plaintiff to file the amended complaint within 10 days and notifies the parties of the ruling.
