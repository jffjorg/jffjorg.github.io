**Tentative Ruling**

The Judge grants Plaintiff Anna's motion to file an amended complaint. The motion is granted because the proposed amendment is related to the same general set of facts and does not prejudice the Defendants. The Court finds that Plaintiff has complied with the necessary requirements for the amendment and that there is sufficient time remaining before the trial date to conduct further investigation and discovery. The Judge also notes that permitting the amendment will further the notions of judicial economy by avoiding multiple lawsuits and preventing the possibility of inconsistent judgments.

The Court has considered the arguments of both parties, including Defendant Don Park's argument that Plaintiff delayed in amending the complaint, but finds that Defendant has not shown how the amendment would prejudice them. The Judge also declines to consider the validity of the proposed amendment at this time, as it is premature to do so.

The Court orders Plaintiff to file the amended complaint within 10 days and notifies the parties of the ruling.

English text:
The court grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file an amended complaint. Under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(a)(1), the court may allow a party to amend a pleading in furtherance of justice. The court should exercise this discretion liberally in favor of amendments. New legal theories are allowed as long as they relate to the same general set of facts. The plaintiff, Anna, seeks to add allegations that Don Park had agreed to pay for a storage locker to store her belongings until her return from Estonia. However, Anna recently discovered that Don had relinquished the storage locker and taken control of or disposed of her property, which is worth at least $100,000. Anna noticed social media posts of Greta Park wearing her clothing and using other items. Allowing the amendment will not prejudice the defendants and will permit Anna to seek full compensation for all related conduct in one lawsuit. The court finds that the plaintiff has complied with the California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324(a) and (b) by including a copy of the proposed amended complaint and specifying the effect of the amendment, why it is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. Despite the defendant's argument that the plaintiff delayed in amending the complaint, the defendant has not explained how they would be prejudiced. Therefore, the court grants the motion for leave to file an amended complaint.
