And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted defendant Marcx S. Diaz's motion for an order allowing the filing of a cross-complaint against plaintiff Maximo Belleza Narvaez Jr. The defendant is seeking to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff and additional cross-defendants, Dino Adrian Potato and Cebuchon SA Barrio, SA XMC LLC. The judge found that the defendant is entitled to file the proposed cross-complaint under Code of Civil Procedure section 426.50, as the defendant's failure to file the cross-complaint concurrently with their initial answer was due to a possibility of settlement and lack of time to determine the propriety of a cross-claim against the plaintiff. The judge also noted that the defendant has demonstrated that the cross-complaint is not made in bad faith and that there is no prejudice to the plaintiff, as the court has not yet set a trial date in this action nor has any depositions taken place.
