Here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has ruled that the demurrer to the complaint is OVERRULED. The plaintiff, Donna Motsinger, has alleged sufficient facts to revive her claim for sexual assault under California Code of Civil Procedure § 340.16(e). The court finds that Motsinger has alleged a viable claim against William Cosby and Jemmin, Inc. for the sexual assault and cover-up of the assault. The court also finds that Jemmin, Inc. is legally responsible for the damages arising out of the assault, citing negligence and vicarious liability. The court rejects Defendants' arguments that the complaint is made in bad faith and that the allegations are not properly alleged.
