 Case Number:  19STCV44013    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2024    Dept:  T Motion for Determination of Good Faith SettlementVeronica Pellot v. Latinas Cleaning Services, et al.Moving Party: Defendants Latinas Cleaning Services; Esteban Yoshizaki; Naoki Yoshizaki BailonResponding Party: N/AThe Motion for Determination of Good Faith Settlement is off-calendar, as default was entered against Defendants before the present demurrer
was filed. Entry of default bars Defendants from taking any action other than
seeking to have the default set aside. (Sporn v. Home Depot USA, Inc.
(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1294, 1301 [“The clerk's entry of default cuts off the
defendant's right to take further affirmative steps such as filing a pleading
or motion, and the defendant is not entitled to notices or service of pleadings
or papers.” (citation omitted)]; Devlin v. Kearny Mesa Amc/Jeep/Renault
(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385 [“The entry of a default terminates a
defendant's rights to take any further affirmative steps in the litigation
until either its default is set aside or a default judgment is entered.”].)Should Plaintiff move to set aside the default at the time of the hearing, the Court will rule on the motion.
