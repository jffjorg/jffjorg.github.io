And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Attorney Tom G. Antunovich to be relieved as counsel in the case of Mari Hartoonian v. Ashley Furniture Industries, Inc. The motion was filed due to a significant breakdown in the relationship between counsel and client. The judge has discretion to allow the withdrawal of an attorney, as long as it does not cause undue prejudice to the client's interests. In this case, the plaintiff has not objected to the withdrawal, and the judge has determined that the withdrawal will not cause significant prejudice. The order granting the motion will become effective once Attorney Antunovich files proof of service of the order.
