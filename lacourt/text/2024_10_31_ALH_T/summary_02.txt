And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion for determination of good faith settlement and has determined that it is off-calendar because default was entered against the defendants before the motion was filed. As a result, the defendants are barred from taking any action except seeking to have the default set aside. The judge notes that the entry of default cuts off the defendants' right to take further affirmative steps, and that the defendants are not entitled to notices or service of pleadings or papers. If the plaintiff moves to set aside the default at the hearing, the judge will rule on the motion.
