ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT KAISER
  FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN, INC.’S MOTION TO STRIKE
 



 
I.              
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff
Jose Flores (“Plaintiff”) alleges former Defendant Ashish Sehgal (“Sehgal”) sexually
assaulted him on June 2, 2009, while administering emergency medical care at a Kaiser
Permanente hospital in Panorama City, CA. (See First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”), ¶¶ 16-24.) 
Plaintiff served
his Complaint and Summons on a defendant Kaiser Foundation & Health Plan
Inc. on September 3, 2021. The clerk of court entered judgment against Kaiser
Foundation & Health Plan Inc. on November 4, 2021. 
On December
17, 2021, the court approved Plaintiff’s amendment to his Complaint, correcting
Kaiser Foundation & Health Plan Inc.’s name to Defendant Kaiser Foundation
Health Plan, Inc. (“Defendant”).
Plaintiff
attempted to have default judgment entered against Defendant several times
since initially filing his action on September 2, 2021. As part of that
process, on March 22, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed Sehgal.
On October 4,
2024, the Court granted Defendant’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons. On
October 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed his FAC and properly served his FAC and
Summons on Defendant. 
Defendant now demurrers to all
Plaintiff’s causes of action and seeks to strike portions of Plaintiff’s FAC.
II.

On March 22,
2024, Plaintiff dismissed Sehgal. 
On October 4,
2024, this Court granted Defendant’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons.
On October

Pursuant to Civil Code § 1708.5; (3) Assault; (4) Battery; (5) Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress; (6) Professional Negligence; and (7)
Professional Negligence.
On November

On December
31, 2024, Defendant filed an Objection to Plaintiff’s RJN (“Objection RJN”). 
III.        
DEMURRER
A.            
Legal Standard
A demurrer is a pleading used to test the
legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact,
regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading (complaint,
answer or cross-complaint). (See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 422.10, 589(a);
see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.)[1] It
is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the
complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in
the complaint are assumed to be true. (See Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th
at 994.) 
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law. We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and
also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.” (Mitchell v.
California Dept. of Pub. Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007, citation
omitted.) “[T]he facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be. (Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.
(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604.) Allegations are to be liberally construed. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 452.) A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are
stated to support the cause of action asserted. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
430.10(e).)  
“A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded.” (Id.) In testing the sufficiency of the
complaint, the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (See Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence
or other extrinsic matters. (See SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered. (See
Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court
to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso
v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862
[disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos.
(1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court
record].) Accordingly, “[w]hether the plaintiff will be able to prove the
pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.” (Stevens v.
Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609-10.) 
A demurrer can only be sustained when
it disposes of an entire cause of action. (See Poizner v. Fremont
General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian
Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The
burden is on the complainant to show the Court a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Id.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245)
B.            
Meet and Confer
Before
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet
and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a),
emphasis added.) A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the
results of the meet and confer process. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(3).)
          Defendant
filed a declaration attesting to the parties’ meet and confer effort, which
consisted of an emailed and mailed meet and confer letter. (See Declaration
of Megan Lane filed November 22, 2024, ¶¶
2-3, Ex. A.) Defendant has neither fulfilled its meet and confer
obligations nor explained why they failed to do so. The Court will issue a
ruling on Defendant’s Demurrer in the interest of judicial efficiency this time.
However, the Court reminds both parties it expects compliance with their meet
and confer obligations in future filings before this Court and that failure to
do so could result in denial of a motion for that reason alone. 
C.            
Request for Judicial Notice
Plaintiff
request this Court take judicial notice of Assembly Committee Bill, AB 2777 (RJN
No. 1, Ex. A.) and Expert Opinion of Dr. Lori Haskell, C. Psych and Dr. Melanie
Randall (RJN No. 2, Ex. B.) 
///
Defendant
objects to Plaintiff’s RJN, arguing it is an attempt to amend his FAC without
leave of Court. (See Objection RJN, pp. 1-2.) In the alternative,
Defendant argues RJN No. 1 has not been properly authenticated and that RJN No.
2 simply “does not qualify for judicial notice.” (Objection RJN, pp. 2-4.) 
The Court
first notes, while Plaintiff describes his RJN as “in Support of his First
Amended Complaint”, Plaintiff also references his RJN in his Opposition to
Defendant’s Demurrer. (See Opposition, pp. 8-9.) The Court thus grants
Plaintiff’s RJN in part, as detailed below, only in the context of Plaintiff’s
Opposition to Defendant’s Demurrer. The Court’s granting of judicial notice is
not to be construed as granting Plaintiff leave to amend his FAC. 
 The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s RJN No. 1 as the
Court finds it is an official act of the California Legislature within the
meaning of Evidence Code 452(c). The Court, however, DENIES Plaintiff’s RJN No.
2, a report submitted to the Canadian Department of Justice, as it does not
fall into any of the categories of matters this Court may take judicial notice
of under Evidence Code 452 and is thus impermissible hearsay. (See Childs v.
State of California (1993) 144 Cal.App.3d 155, 163 (“A court cannot take
judicial notice of self-serving hearsay allegations.”).
D.           
Plaintiff’s Claims are not Barred by
Code of Civil Procedure § 340.5 or § 340.16’s Statute of Limitations.
1.              
Code of Civil Procedure § 340.5.
Defendant
first argues Plaintiff’s claims are barred by Code of Civil Procedure § 340.5’s
statute of limitations because the gravamen of all Plaintiff’s claims is
medical malpractice. (See Demurrer, pg. 2, citing Larson v. UHS of
Rancho Springs, Inc. (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 336 (“Larson”.) “[T]he
gravamen of his claims are professional negligence” as they arose out of Sehgal’s
“rendering of professional services.” (Id. at 3.) As such, Plaintiff’s
claims should have been brought three years after the date of the incident [June
3, 2009][2] or
within one year after Plaintiff discovered, or should have discovered, his
injury. (See id.) Defendant argues Plaintiff’s long list of reasons why
he did not bring the action sooner[3] do not
support a reasonable finding of delayed discovery and, in any event, Plaintiff
has not alleged fraud, intentional concealment, or the presence of a foreign
body such that the statute of limitations would be tolled. (See id. at
4-6.)
In
Opposition, Plaintiff argues the gravamen of his claims are not merely medical
malpractice but are “Civil, and Criminal, a very serious felony offense
Pursuant to; California Penal Code Section 243.4 PC: Sexual Battery, Assault.”
(Opposition, pg. 15.)[4],[5] 
The Court does
not find all of Plaintiff’s claims arise out of Sehgal’s alleged professional
negligence. Code of Civil Procedure § 340.5 provides that “[i]n an action for
injury or death against a health care provider based upon such person’s alleged
professional negligence, the time for the commencement of action shall be three
years after the date of injury or one year after the plaintiff discovers, or through
the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury, whichever
occurs first.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 340.5.) “[W]hen a plaintiff asserts a claim
against a health care provider on a legal theory other than professional
negligence, courts must determine whether the claim is nonetheless based on
the health care provider’s professional negligence, which would require
application of MICRA.” (Larson, 230 Cal.App.4th at 347 (emphasis in
original).) “Professional negligence” is “[a] negligent act or omission to act
by a healthcare provider in the rendering of professional services, which act
or omission is the proximate cause of a personal injury.” (Larcher v.
Wanless (1976) 18 Cal.3d 656, 657-58.)
          The
Court finds Larson, relied on by Defendant in support of its argument,
instructive. In Larson, the plaintiff alleged the anesthesiologist
handled him roughly during a preoperative checkup and in administering
anesthesia (to include grabbing and twisting his arm, prying open his mouth,
pushing his face). (See Larson, 230 Cal.App.4th at 351.) The Larson
Court found the plaintiff “simply claims [the anesthesiologist] performed his
professional services in an unnecessarily harsh and forceful manner, which
amounts to a claim [the anesthesiologist] failed to meet the applicable
standard of care in rendering his services.” (Id., 230 Cal.App.4th at 352.)
Importantly, the “focus of Larson's claims concern the manner in which [the
anesthesiologist] rendered his professional services as an anesthesiologist, not
some collateral course of conduct pursued for [the anesthesiologist]'s own gain
or gratification.” (Id. (emphasis added).)
          Here,
however, Plaintiff claims he was admitted to “the emergency room at the
Panorama City, California Kaiser hospital for hyperglycemia and anxiety” but
that “[a]t some point during the physical evaluation [Sehgal] without a written
or verbal consent, without explaining anything and without Plaintiff’s
permission went ahead and told Plaintiff to lie on his side, Plaintiff was
resting on the bed face up wearing a gown, them [Sehgal] with gloves inserted
his index finger into Plaintiff’s anus for a period of time.” (FAC, ¶ 18.) This
act was done despite the fact that “there was no medical or professional
purpose for this act, defendants [sic] intent was sexual arousal, sexual
gratification and sexual abuse…[t]his vile and despicable act was perpetrated
outside of the scope of treatment and without consent with no medical purpose.”
(Id. at ¶ 21; see also id. at ¶ 44 (alleging “defendants [sic] intent
was sexual arousal, sexual gratification and sexual battery”).) 
          Here,
unlike in Larson, Plaintiff alleges Sehgal actions were collateral to
his professional services as an emergency room physician and were pursued for
Sehgal’s own sexual gratification. Thus, the Court does not find all of
Plaintiff’s claims arose out of Sehgal’s professional negligence such that Code
of Civil Procedure § 340.5 is applicable. 
2.              
Code of Civil Procedure § 340.16.
Defendant
next argues Plaintiff’s claims are barred under Code of Civil Procedure §
340.16, as the incident occurred in 2009 when Plaintiff was over 18, occurred
over 10 years prior to Plaintiff filing his Complaint, and because “plaintiff
has not alleged any facts sufficient to establish that a reasonable person
would not have discovered the injury or illness sooner than September 2, 2018.”
(Demurrer, pg. 6.) Defendant argues Code of Civil Procedure § 340.16(e) does
not revive Plaintiff’s claims because Plaintiff does not adequately allege all
elements of the revival statute, including that “defendant engaged in an
alleged ‘cover up’.” (Id. at 7.)
In
Opposition, Plaintiff argues his claims are timely under Code of Civil Procedure
§ 340.16(a)(2) and (e). (See Opposition, pp. 5-7.) 
The Court finds
Plaintiff’s claims are not barred by Code of Civil Procedure § 340.16’s
limitations period. “In any civil action for recovery of damages suffered as a
result of sexual assault, where the assault occurred on or after the
plaintiff’s 18th birthday, the time for commencement of the action shall be the
later of the following: [¶] (1) Within 10 years from the date of the last
act, attempted act, or assault with the intent to commit an act, of sexual
assault against the plaintiff. [¶] (2) Within three years from the date
the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered that an injury or
illness resulted from an act, attempted act, or assault with the intent to
commit an act, of sexual assault against the plaintiff.” (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 340.16(a).) The current version of Code of Civil Procedure § 340.16 became
effective on January 1, 2023, and included the addition of two relevant statute
of limitations revival provisions, § 340.16(b)(3) and § 340.16(e). Both
provisions allow for the revival of sexual assault claims that would otherwise
be barred by Code of Civil Procedure 340.16(a). 
Code of Civil
Procedure § 340.16(b)(3) states as follows: “This section applies to any action
described in subdivision (a) that is based upon conduct that occurred on or after
January 1, 2009, and is commenced on or after January 1, 2019, that would have
been barred solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had
expired. Such claims are hereby revived and may be commenced until December 31,
2026.” 
Code of Civil
Procedure § 340.16(e)(1) states as follows: “Notwithstanding any other law, any
claim seeking to recover damages suffered as a result of a sexual assault that
occurred on or after the plaintiff's 18th birthday that would otherwise be
barred before January 1, 2023, solely because the applicable statute of
limitations has or had expired, is hereby revived, and a cause of action may
proceed if already pending in court on January 1, 2023, or, if not filed by
that date, may be commenced between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023.” Code
of Civil Procedure § 340.16(e)(2) revives claims brought by a plaintiff who
alleges: “[¶] (A) The plaintiff was sexually assaulted. [¶] (B) One or more
entities are legally responsible for damages arising out of the sexual assault.
[¶] (C) The entity or entities, including, but not limited to, their officers,
directors, representatives, employees, or agents, engaged in a cover up or
attempted a cover up of a previous instance or allegations of sexual assault by
an alleged perpetrator of such abuse.” 
          Plaintiff
claims the incident occurred in June of 2009. (See FAC, ¶¶ 16 & 40.)
Plaintiff’s claims would therefore be barred by Code of Civil Procedure §
340.16(a)(1), as Plaintiff filed his Complaint after June 2019. Plaintiff must
therefore have brought his claims “[w]ithin three years from the date the
plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered that an injury or
illness resulted from an act, attempted act, or assault with the intent to
commit an act, of sexual assault against the plaintiff” [§ 340.16(a)(2)] or meet
the requirements of either of the relevant revival provisions, listed above. 
          As
currently alleged, the Court finds Plaintiff brought his claims within three
years from the date he discovered or reasonably should have discovered his
injuries. ¿The accrual
date of a cause of action is delayed until a plaintiff both aware of their
injury and its negligent cause. (See Jolly v. Eli Lilly & Co. (1988)
44 Cal.3d 1103, 1109.) A plaintiff has “reason to discover a cause of action
when he or she ‘has reason at least to suspect a factual basis for its
elements.’” (Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 797,
807 (citing Norgart v. Upjohn Co. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 398).) “Rather
than examining whether [a] plaintiff[] suspect[s] facts supporting each
specific legal element of a particular cause of action, we look to whether [a] plaintiff[
has] reason to at least suspect that a type of wrongdoing has injured them.” (Id.,
35 Cal.4th at 807.)¿¿ 
          Here,
Plaintiff claims he “did not discover and had no reason to discover the
unlawful acts until May 2021 when while examining the medical documents
provided by [Defendant] upon recent request, Plaintiff understood that what [Sehgal]
did was not protocol because many other doctors who also examined Plaintiff,
did not suggested or performed [sic] the same test as [Sehgal] did, every other
doctor simply questioned Plaintiff if he had notice any blood in his stool to
which Plaintiff responded no.” (FAC, ¶ 34(e).) Plaintiff filed his Complaint on
September 2, 2021, within 5 months of his discovery of Sehgal’s alleged
wrongdoing. (See Complaint.) While some of Plaintiff’s alleged reasons
for his delayed discovery, such as “Plaintiff wanted to forget all the events
that remind him of the shameful incident” and “Plaintiff was incapacitated,
suffering from mental behavior issues” do not support a reasonable inference
of delayed discovery, they also do not contradict Plaintiff’s claim he didn’t
discover Sehgal’s wrongdoing until May 2021. (See FAC, ¶ 34(2), (b).) 
The Court’s
finding is supported by Plaintiff’s claims “[Sehgal] told him everything was
okay” immediately after inserting his fingers intro his rectum and “Plaintiff
somehow believed what defendants did was protocol.” (FAC, ¶¶ 19, 34(c).) It is
reasonable for Plaintiff’s suspicion of Sehgal’s wrongdoing to be delayed if he
believed Sehgal’s actions were “protocol.” In the absence of any additional
facts which would support an earlier suspicion of wrongdoing and viewing
Plaintiff’s FAC in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds Plaintiff’s
claims are not barred by Code of Civil Procedure 340.16(a)(2). (See Perez v.
Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238 (“This rule
of liberal construction means that the reviewing court draws inferences
favorable to the plaintiff, not the defendant.”).)
Accordingly,
the Court finds Plaintiff’s claims are not barred by either Code of Civil
Procedure § 340.5 or § 340.16 and declines to sustain Defendant’s Demurrer on
these grounds. 
///
E.            
Plaintiff’s Properly Alleges Defendant’s
Vicarious Liability for Rape, Sexual Battery, Assault, Battery, and Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress. 
Defendant
argues it can only be held liable for Sehgal’s alleged intentionally tortious
actions (Plaintiff’s first cause of action for rape, his second for sexual
battery, his third for assault, his fourth for battery, and his fifth for
intentional infliction of emotional distress) if Defendant is vicariously
liable for Sehgal’s actions. (See Demurrer, pp. 8-10.) Defendant argues
Sehgal was not an employee of Defendant’s but, even if he was, his alleged
sexual assault of Plaintiff would not be covered in the course and scope of his
employment, particularly because Plaintiff did not present for issues involving
his rectum. (See id. at 8.) 
The Court
finds Sehgal’s status as an agent of Defendant who was acting within the course
and scope of his duties is a question of fact and thus inappropriate for
demurrer. “[A] principal who personally engages in no misconduct may be vicariously
liable for the tortious act committed by an agent within the course and scope
of the agency. Agency is the relationship which results from the manifestation
of consent by one person to another that the other shall act on his behalf and
subject to his control, and consent by the other so to act...” (Barenborg v.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 70, 85 (internal
citations and quotations omitted).) Although employers and principals are
subject to vicarious liability under the doctrine of respondeat superior for
the torts of their employees and agents, the general rule is that a person who
employs an independent contractor is not vicariously liable for the torts of
the contractor. (See Anderson v. Chancellor W. Oil Dev. Corp. (1975) 53
Cal.App.3d 235, 239.) 
Whether an
individual is an employee or an independent contractor is a question of fact if
it is dependent on resolution of disputed evidence or inferences. (See Fisher
v. San Pedro Peninsula Hosp. (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 608–609 n.6.) It
becomes one of law, however, if only one inference can be drawn from the
evidence. (See Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. v. Superior Court (1990)
220 Cal.App.3d 864, 872.) Whether the alleged agent’s conduct was in the course
and scope of his agency is also normally a question of fact, unless the
operable, overt, observable facts are indisputable. (See Perez v. Van
Groningen & Sons, Inc. (1986) 41 Cal.3d 962, 968.) 
Here, it is
clear resolution of whether Sehgal was an independent contractor or employee or
whether Sehgal was acting in the course and scope of his alleged agency is a
question of fact. On the face of Plaintiff’s FAC, Sehgal is an employee, a fact
Defendant disputes in its Demurrer. Plaintiff also alleges Sehgal was acting “outside
of the scope of treatment and without consent with no medical purpose” but that
he also “was acting within the scope of his duties and/or acting for the
benefit of the Kaiser at the time when he committed the negligent or wrongful
act giving rise to the torts in this claim.” (See, e.g., FAC, ¶¶ 21 &
32.) It would therefore be necessary for the Court to go beyond the face of the
FAC and establish uncontroverted facts by declaration or other extrinsic
evidence in order settle the question of whether Sehgal was Defendant’s agent
or acting within the scope of his alleged agency, an inappropriate inquiry on
demurrer. 
The Court
will not sustain Defendant’s Demurrer on these grounds and Defendant does not
provide the Court with any additional argument as to why Plaintiff’s first
through sixth causes of action fail to state sufficient facts to support a
cause of action. 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court OVERRULES Defendant’s Demurrer in its entirety.  
IV.         
MOTION TO STRIKE
A.       Legal
Standard
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in
its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false,
or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
436(a).) The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (See id. at § 436(b).) The grounds for a motion to strike are
that the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been
drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (See id. at § 436.) The grounds
for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of
judicial notice. (See id. at § 437.)
Punitive
damages may be recovered upon a
proper showing of malice, fraud, or oppression. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
3294(a).) “Malice” is defined as conduct intended to cause injury to a person
or despicable conduct carried on with a willful and conscious disregard for the
rights or safety of others. (See Turman v. Turning Point of Cent. Cal., Inc.
(2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.) “Oppression” means despicable conduct
subjecting a person to cruel and unjust hardship, in conscious disregard of the
person’s rights. (See id.) “Fraud” is an intentional misrepresentation,
deceit, or concealment of a material fact known by defendant, with intent to
deprive a person of property, rights or otherwise cause injury. (See id.)
Conclusory allegations, devoid of any factual assertions, are insufficient to
support a conclusion that parties acted with oppression, fraud or malice. (See
Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1042.) 
B.      Defendant’s Motion to Strike Is Granted
Defendant
seeks to strike Plaintiff’s punitive damages allegations and “the monetary
amounts and prayer for prejudgment interest included in plaintiff's prayer for
relief.” (Motion, pg. 2.) Defendant argues Plaintiff’s punitive damages allegations
should be stricken for three reasons: (1) Plaintiff has not complied with Code
of Civil Procedure § 425.13; (2) Plaintiff has not complied with Code of Civil
Procedure § 3294(b); and (3) Plaintiff cannot allege monetary amounts pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure § 425.10. (See Motion.) 
The
Court finds Plaintiff’s punitive damages allegations and pled monetary amounts should
be stricken (See FAC, ¶¶ 37, 56, 70, 80, and 95; see also FAC, pg.
30:7-8, 12-13.) As an initial matter, Plaintiff cannot plead a monetary amount
in his FAC. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 425.10(b); see also Code Civ.
Proc. § 3295(e).) Plaintiff must also seek leave of Court pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure § 425.13 before alleging punitive damages against Defendant, an
alleged healthcare provider (See Code Civ. Proc. § 425.13; see also FAC,
¶ 2 (“…Defendant, and DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, are and at all times
relevant hereto, were hospitals, medical centers, clinics and/or healthcare
facilities maintained pursuant to a license.”).)
“In any
action for damages arising out of the professional negligence of a health care
provider, no claim for punitive damages¿shall be
included in a complaint or other pleading unless the court enters an order
allowing an amended pleading that includes a claim for punitive damages to be
filed. The court may allow the filing of an amended pleading claiming punitive
damages on a motion by the party seeking the amended pleading and on the basis
of the supporting and opposing affidavits presented that the plaintiff has
established that there is a substantial probability that the plaintiff will
prevail on the claim pursuant to¿Section
3294 of the Civil Code.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.13(a).) 
Code of Civil
Procedure § 425.13 applies if the claim is directly related to the manner in
which professional services were provided. (See Central Pathology
Service Medical Clinic, Inc. v. Superior Court (1992) 3 Cal.4th 181,
192-93.) Although Plaintiff’s causes of action are not based on
professional negligence for the purposes of Code of Civil Procedure § 340.5,
the Court finds they are “are directly related to the manner in which
professional services were rendered” for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure §
425.13. (United Western Medical Centers v. Superior Court (1996) 42
Cal.App.4th 500, 504; see also Larson, 230 Cal.App.4th at 350-51
(recognizing the difference in language between Code of Civil Procedure §§
340.5 and 425.13).)
In
Opposition, Plaintiff argues he “did not request punitive damages in his FAC,
but he will seek permission from the court to demand such damages.” (Opposition
Motion, pg. 10.) Setting aside Plaintiff’s apparent confusion over whether he
did or didn’t allege punitive damages, Plaintiff appears to acknowledge the necessity
of requesting leave of Court to request them. To that end, Plaintiff has
already filed a motion for leave to amend his complaint to include punitive
damages which is set for hearing on March 11, 2025. 
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion. In light of the Court’s ruling, the Court
declines to address Defendant’s other arguments in favor of striking
Plaintiff’s punitive damages allegations. 
V.            
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court OVERRULES Defendant’s Demurrer and GRANTS Defendant’s
Motion to Strike. 
          IT
IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:      January 7, 2025
