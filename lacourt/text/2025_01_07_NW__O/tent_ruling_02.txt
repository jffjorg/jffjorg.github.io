[2] In what the Court
assumes is an unintentional clerical error, Plaintiff states the incident
occurred on both June 30, 2009, and June 3, 2009. (See FAC, ¶¶ 16 & 40.)
 


[3] “‘a) Plaintiff was
incapacitated, suffering from mental behavior issues; b) Plaintiff wanted to
forget all the events that reminded him of the shameful incident; c) Plaintiff
is not a doctor, he did not know that what defendant did was wrong and
unlawful, in fact Plaintiff somehow believed what defendants did was protocol,
d). Plaintiff is not an attorney there was no way for Plaintiff to know that
what defendants did was unlawful. e). Plaintiff did not discover and had no
reason to discover the unlawful acts until May 2021 when while examining the
medical documents provided by Kaiser upon recent request, Plaintiff understood
that what Dr. Ashish did was not protocol because many other doctors who also
examined Plaintiff, did not suggest or performed the same test as Dr. Ashish
did, every other doctor simply questioned Plaintiff if he had notice any blood
in his stool to which Plaintiff responded 
no. f). Plaintiff understood for the first time that his mental behavior
injuries were proximate caused by defendants' acts and conduct.’” (Demurrer,
pg. 4, citing FAC, ¶¶ 34, 53, 68, 79, & 93.)   
 


[4] The Court notes
Plaintiff’s Opposition and Opposition Motion both exceed the 15-page limit allowed
by Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(d). The Court will consider all of Plaintiff’s arguments
in this ruling but reminds Plaintiff to comply with these procedural
requirements in future filings. If he does not, the Court will not consider any
arguments contained beyond allowable page limits. 
 


[5] This Court does not have
jurisdiction over criminal matters and will not further address Plaintiff’s Opposition
arguments of Sehgal’s or Defendant’s alleged criminal liability.
