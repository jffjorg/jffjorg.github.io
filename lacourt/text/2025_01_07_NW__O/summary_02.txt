And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case regarding an incident that allegedly occurred on either June 30, 2009, or June 3, 2009. The plaintiff claims that the defendant's actions caused mental behavior issues and that the plaintiff did not know that the defendant's actions were wrong until May 2021, when they reviewed medical documents provided by Kaiser. The judge notes that the plaintiff's opposition and opposition motion exceed the 15-page limit allowed by the rules of court and reminds the plaintiff to comply with this requirement in future filings. The judge also notes that they do not have jurisdiction over criminal matters and will not address the plaintiff's arguments regarding the defendant's alleged criminal liability.
