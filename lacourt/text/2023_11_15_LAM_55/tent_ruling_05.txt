 Case Number:  22STCV37027    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2023    Dept:  55 Tentative: Motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendants continued to 12/6/2023 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 55.Moving counsel requests an order allowing withdrawal as counsel of record for defendants. Moving counsel did not, however, give notice of the continuance of this matter as  ordered on 9/18/23. The Court therefore continues the motion to permit moving counsel to provide notice and to file the proof of service regarding such notice. The Court notes that procedurally, the form notice, declaration, proposed  order, and proof of service are sufficiently in compliance.  See  CRC Rule 3.1362. In addition, moving counsel’s declaration shows  cognizable grounds for withdrawal.
