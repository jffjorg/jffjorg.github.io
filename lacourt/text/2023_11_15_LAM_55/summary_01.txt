And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The motion to tax costs filed by Emmons, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant, is denied. The court finds that Emmons failed to provide evidence that it had paid its half of the court reporter fees as agreed upon by the parties. Therefore, the court is unable to tax half of the reporter costs as requested. The court also finds that the costs incurred by Jesso, Defendant/Cross-Complainant, for preparation of trial binders, including copying and printing of exhibits, were reasonable in amount and reasonably necessary to the conduct of the trial. Additionally, the court concludes that the costs incurred by Jesso for electronic presentation of exhibits, including the services of an independent trial consultant, were reasonably helpful to aid the trier of fact and were reasonable in amount. Therefore, the motion is denied as to these costs.
