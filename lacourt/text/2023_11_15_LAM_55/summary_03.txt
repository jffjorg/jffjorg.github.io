And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants both motions filed by the defendant, Aaron Markowitch, to compel further responses to the plaintiff's interrogatories. The plaintiff, Elchanan Beiss, is ordered to serve further responses to the interrogatories without objections and in full compliance with the California Discovery Act by January 6, 2024.

The judge also orders the plaintiff to pay discovery sanctions in the amount of $4,600 to the defendant. The judge finds that the plaintiff's responses to the interrogatories were insufficient and lacked substantial justification.

The judge concludes that the plaintiff's attempts to justify the missing information were not reasonable and did not comply with applicable law. The judge declines to deny the motions based on the lack of meet and confer, as the plaintiff's opposing documents continue to assert that all of the many responses at issue are in statutory compliance.
