 Case Number:  21STCV09633    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2023    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Motion of Citron & Citron to Be Relieved
as Counsel for Defendant Sylmar Apts., Inc.
 
The motion is granted. The Court will sign and file the
proposed, form order lodged with the motion.
Trial set for 2/20/24 is advanced and continued to May
20, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., and the FSC set for 2/9/2024 is advanced and continued
to May 10, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., to allow Defendants more time to retain
substitute counsel.
On 3/11/21, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint for Tortious
Breach Of Warranty Of Habitability and typically related claims, alleging that Defendants
failed to maintain habitable conditions at the apartment leased by Plaintiffs.
Trial is currently set for February 20, 2024.
Defense counsel filed a motion to be relieved as
counsel of record for Defendant Sylmar Apts., Inc. based upon a form declaration
evidencing a breakdown in communications with their client. (Defense counsel has
filed a separate motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Anza Management
Company, which is set for hearing on November 28, 2023.) 
Defense counsel further stated in a declaration filed
with the reply brief that Sylmar Apts. also failed and refused to comply with
the terms of their agreement to retain defense counsel by failing to pay
attorney's fees and the costs of experts. Further, moving defense counsel
contends that there would be no prejudice caused by the withdrawal because Sylmar
Apts. received notice of the motion five months before the current February
2024 trial date. 
Procedurally, the form notice, declarations, proposed
order, and proof of service are sufficiently in compliance.  See
CRC Rule 3.1362. “The determination whether to grant or deny an attorney’s
motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound discretion of the
trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might work an injustice in
the handling of the case.”  Lempert v.
Sup. Ct. (2003) 112 Cal. App. 4th 1161, 1173.  The Court finds that defense counsel has
adequately established grounds for withdrawal based on the communications
breakdown and Sylmar Apts.’s failure to pay fees and costs. While Sylmar Apts. disputes
that a breakdown in communications has occurred, the CEO for Sylmar Apts. fails
to provide specific information about any recent communications it has provided
to defense counsel. And Sylmar Apts. does not address its purported failure to pay
fees and costs. The Court will continue the trial date for a short time to
allow more time to retain substitute counsel and thereby avoid any potential prejudice.
See Rules Prof. Conduct, Rule 1.16(d).
The Court therefore grants the motion to withdraw. The
Court also advances the 2/20/2024 jury trial and 2/9/2024 FSC and re-sets the
jury trial on May 20, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. and the FSC on May 10, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
All discovery and motion cut-off dates will be based upon the new trial date.
