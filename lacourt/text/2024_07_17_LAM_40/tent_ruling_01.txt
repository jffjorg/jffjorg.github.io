Defendants.
  


 Case No.: 23STCV08765
 Hearing Date: July 17, 2024
 Trial Date: August 20, 2024
 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Sonia Maravilla’s Motion to Compel Compliance
  With Court’s February 7, 2024 Discovery Order.



 
On April 20, 2023, Plaintiff SONIA MARAVILLA (“Plaintiff”) filed a
Complaint against Defendants FCA US LLC (“FCA”) and DOES 1 through 10,
inclusive. The Complaint asserts the following causes of action against all
defendants: 1) Violation of Civil Code Section 1793.2(d); 2) Violation of Civil
Code Section 1793.2(b); 3) Violation of Civil Code Section 1793.2(a)(3); 4)
Breach of Express Written Warranty – Civil Code Sections 1791.2(a), 1794;  and 5) Breach of Implied Warranty of
Merchantability – Civil Code Sections 1791.1, 1794.
Plaintiff now brings a Motion to Compel Compliance under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2031.310 (further responses) and 2031.320 (compel
compliance) with this Court’s February 7, 2024 Discovery Order, which
Defendants have not opposed. 
After review, the Court GRANTS the Motion because Plaintiff has
shown that Defendant FCA has failed to comply with the Court’s previous
discovery order and has not provided any substantial justification or other
circumstances explaining why it has not complied.
 
Background Allegations
This Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty action involves Plaintiff’s
purchase of a 2021 jeep Cherokee (“Vehicle”) on or about September 19, 2021.
(Compl., ¶5.) The Vehicle is manufactured and/or distributed by Defendant. (Id.
at ¶6.) Plaintiff received an express written warranty stating Defendant FCA
would preserve or maintain the utility or performance of the vehicle or provide
compensation if there is a failure in utility or performance for a specified
period of time. (Id. at ¶9.) The Vehicle contained or developed defects
after Plaintiff took possession and during the warranty period. (Id. at
¶¶10-11.) Defendant FCA was unable and/or failed to service or repair the
Vehicle within a reasonable number of attempts. (Id. at ¶14.) The
Vehicle’s defects have substantially impaired its safety, use and/or value and
could not have been discovered by Plaintiff prior to taking possession. (Id.
at ¶¶15-16. )
 
Motion to Compel Compliance 
Compel Compliance with Discovery Legal Standard: “If a party filing a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling under Sections 2031.210,
2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280 thereafter fails to permit the
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in accordance with that party's statement
of compliance, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
compliance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320(a).)
Here, Plaintiff served on Defendant FCA US LLC (“Defendant FCA”) Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), Requests for
Admissions (Set One), and Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) on
August 11, 2023. ((Maxfield Decl., ¶3.) As such, Defendant FCA had until
September 28, 2023 to serve its responses and produce the requested documents
because it would within 30 days after service of the written discovery plus the
two additional court days for electronic service. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.260(a).) Defendant FCA failed to provide any responses to the propounded
discovery, so on December 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel initial
discovery responses, which were granted on February 7, 2024. (Maxfield Decl.,
¶8.) As of the date of the filing of the instant motion, Plaintiff contends
Defendant FCA has not provided any discovery response or document production in
compliance with the February 7, 2024 order. (Id. at ¶12.) Although not
required to do so, Plaintiff’s counsel met and conferred with Defendant FCA’s
counsel telephonically and through email concerning the discovery responses. (Id.
at ¶¶9, 11, Exs. 1-2.) Plaintiff asserts no response has been received
pertaining to the email sent to Defense counsel. (Id. at ¶15.) Finally,
Defendant FCA has not opposed the instant motion to refute or rebut Plaintiff’s
contentions. 
            The Court notes that, however
frustrating the situation to the Plaintiff must be, the relief sought here – to
compel compliance with a court’s prior order -- is inapt.  Courts do not generally make orders to comply
with their prior orders; each one stands on its own, and it will be up to the
Plaintiff to request appropriate sanctions if the Defendant fails to comply
with any particular court order. The statutes upon which Plaintiff relies in her
notice do not support said order in any event. A motion to compel further
responses under CCP section 2031.310 applies when a response is filed and
further responses are requested; a motion to compel compliance under CCP
2031.320 is brought when a party states in its responses that it will provide
documents and fails to do so. Here, neither situation applies. Rather,
Defendant has failed to file any responses to the original discovery; to the
original motion to compel; or to the instant motion. As a result, a motion for issue,
evidence, monetary or terminating sanctions under CCP section 2031.300 subd. (c)
might have been appropriate. The Court will consider an OSC or other appropriate
mechanism to see what action should be taken in light of Defendant’s apparent failure
to participate in this case since at least August of 2023 when the trial was
set.
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff Sonia Maravilla’s Motion to
Compel Compliance with Court’s February 7, 2024 Discovery Order is DENIED.
