And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to strike a supplemental expert designation by the defendants in a wrongful death action. The plaintiff, Haley Chapman, argues that the designation of Dr. James High as an expert on causation is improper because the defendants already have experts on the subject matter of causation. The defendants argue that the designation of Dr. High is proper under Code Civ. Proc. § 2034.280(a), which permits a party to designate an expert on a subject to be covered by an expert designated by an adverse party to the exchange.

The court finds that the defendants properly submitted a supplemental witness list designating Dr. High on the issue of psychiatry, a topic not previously covered in their initial exchange. The court also finds that there is no indication of gamesmanship or prejudice in the defendants' designation of Dr. High, and that the law does not require a party to initially designate every expert witness it anticipates using to rebut the experts the other side might designate as an expert.

Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's motion to strike the supplemental expert designation.
