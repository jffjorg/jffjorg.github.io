And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion by non-party G.R. Isidro to set aside the satisfaction of judgment. The original judgment creditors, Connie Hur and Marvin Hur, had assigned their rights and interests in the judgment to Isidro, but Isidro did not provide notice of the assignment to the defendant, Soo Young Biun. As a result, the satisfaction of judgment was properly filed and entered. The judge finds that Isidro has not demonstrated "proper cause" to set aside the satisfaction of judgment, as the judgment has been fully satisfied and the judgment debtor, Biun, has already paid the amount due in full.
