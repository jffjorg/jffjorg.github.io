And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the plaintiff's motions to compel responses to discovery requests and has made a tentative ruling. The plaintiff, Isabella Novo, filed the lawsuit against Apricode KDS, Corp. and Artem Timofeev alleging wage violations. The discovery requests were served on November 28, 2023, and the parties engaged in settlement discussions with extensions granted accordingly. However, the defendants failed to respond to the discovery requests by the final extension date of August 20, 2024.

The judge finds that an order compelling responses is warranted, but notes that there is a issue with proper service of the motions. The proofs of service indicate service by email, but no email address is listed for the defendants, and it is unclear if they agreed to receive service by email. Therefore, the judge has granted the plaintiff's motions to compel responses, but only if the plaintiff provides proper proof of service by the time of the hearing. The judge has also set an order to show cause (OSC) regarding striking the answer of Apricode KDS, Corp. for October 23, 2024.
