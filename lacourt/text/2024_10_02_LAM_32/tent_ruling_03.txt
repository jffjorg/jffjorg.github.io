ISABELLA NOVO,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
APRICODE KDS, CORP., et
  al., 
                        Defendants.
  


 
  Case No.:  23STCV22214
  Hearing Date:  October 2, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motions to compel responses 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On September 14, 2023, Plaintiff
Isabella Novo filed this action against Defendants Apricode KDS, Corp. and
Artem Timofeev, alleging wage violations. 
            On August 21 and 22, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant six motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories and
Requests for Production. 
            As all six motions concern identical
issues, they are advanced and heard on this date (October 2, 2024).   
LEGAL STANDARD
Discovery responses are due 30 days after
service of the requests, unless the parties stipulate or the court orders
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a).) If a
responding party fails to respond in time, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling the responses or deeming matters admitted. (Id., §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b), 2033.280(b).) The responding party also waives its
objections. (Id., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a).)  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff served the subject
discovery on November 28, 2023. (Litwin Decl. ¶ 2.) The parties thereafter
engaged in settlement discussions, and extensions were granted accordingly. (Id.,
¶ 3.) The parties did not reach a settlement, and Plaintiff granted a final
extension to August 20, 2024. (Ibid.) Defendants did not respond to the
discovery by August 20, 2024. (Id., ¶ 4.) These motions followed. 
            The facts demonstrate that an order
compelling responses is warranted. However, there does not appear to be proper
service of the motions. The proofs of service indicate service by email, but no
email address is listed for either Defendant. Defendants also recently became
pro per, and it is unclear that they agreed to receive service by email. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motions to compel
responses are GRANTED if Plaintiff provides proper proof of service by the time
of the hearing. 
            OSC re Striking the Answer of
Apricode KDS, Corp. Pursuant to CCP § 436 set for October 23, 2024.
