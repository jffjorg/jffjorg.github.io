And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by plaintiff Ronald Cortez to compel defendant G&E Healthcare Services, LLC to provide further responses to discovery requests. The requests are for information about aggrieved employees, including time records, meal period waiver records, and wage statements. The defendant objected to the requests as overbroad/burdensome and invading privacy, but the judge finds that the requests are not overbroad or burdensome and do not represent a serious intrusion into a privacy interest. The judge orders the defendant to provide further responses to the discovery requests within 20 days of the order.
