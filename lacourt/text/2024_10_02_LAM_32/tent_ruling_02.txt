  Case No.:  23STCV17783
  Hearing Date:  October 2, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses to requests for production (CRS# 9925) 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On July 28, 2023, Plaintiff Ronald
Cortez filed this action against Defendants G&E Healthcare Services, LLC; G
and E Healthcare Services, LLC; Astoria Nursing and Rehabilitation Center; Gem
Healthcare, LLC; Gen Transitional Care Center; and Grace Santos Mercado. This
is an action for wage violations. The claims are asserted individually and
under PAGA on behalf of other aggrieved employees. 
            On August 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to compel Defendant G&E Healthcare Services, LLC’s
further responses to Requests for Production. Defendant filed a notice of
non-opposition on September 18, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Upon receiving responses to its discovery
requests, the propounding party may move for an order compelling further
responses if the responses are incomplete or evasive, or objections are without
merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a),
2033.290(a).) The party seeking production of documents
bears the initial burden of showing good cause through a fact-specific showing
of relevance. (Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.)
Once this showing is made, the burden shifts to the responding party to justify
any objections. (Ibid.) 
MEET AND CONFER
A motion to compel further must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to
resolve the matter informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1),
2031.310(b), 2033.290(b).) The Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the meet
and confer requirement. (See Mooradian Decl.)
DISCUSSION
            The five RFPs at issue request the
following information on aggrieved employees: time records (no. 12); meal
period waiver records (no. 13); punch questionnaires/break logs (no. 15); wage
statements (no. 16); and separation documents (no. 17). Defendant objected to
the requests as overbroad/burdensome and invading privacy, and then stated that
it “will produce a sampling of responsive documents in its custody, possession
or control.” 
            There is good cause for the
requested information because the documents are directly related to the wage
claims asserted in the complaint. The requests are not overbroad or burdensome,
nor do they represent a serious intrusion into a privacy interest. (See Williams
v. Sup. Ct. (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552; Pioneer Electronics (USA), Inc.
v. Superior Court (2007) 40 Cal.4th 360, 371.) The response is evasive
because the requests ask for all documents, not merely a “sampling.” Defendant
concedes that further responses are warranted. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses is GRANTED. Defendant G&E Healthcare Services, LLC shall provide
further responses to the subject discovery within 20 days of this order.
