     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
non-party g.r. isidro’s motion to set
  aside satisfaction of judgment 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On October 28, 2014, Plaintiffs
Connie Hur and Marvin Hur filed this action against Defendants Soo Young Biun
and Equity & Trust Company. 
            On April 27, 2016, default judgment
was entered against Defendants in the amount of $47,519.72. 
            On June 5, 2018, non-party G.R.
Isidro filed a notice of assignment of judgment, representing that
Plaintiffs/Judgment Creditors assigned all title, rights, interests, and
authority in the judgment to Isidro. 
            On January 24, 2020,
Plaintiffs/Judgment Creditors Connie Hur and Marvin Hur filed an acknowledgment
of satisfaction of judgment, indicating that the judgment had been satisfied in
full. 
            On May 28, 2024, G.R. Isidro filed
the instant motion to set aside the satisfaction of judgment. Defendant Biun
filed her opposition on September 18, 2024.
DISCUSSION
            “[A] satisfaction of judgment which
has been filed and entered may be set aside by appropriate proceedings for
proper cause.” (Brochier v. Brochier (1941) 17 Cal.2d 822, 825.) 
            Moving party Isidro argues that the
satisfaction of judgment must be set aside because the original judgment
creditors, Connie Hur and Marvin Hur, assigned all rights and interest in the
judgment to Isidro and had no authority to file a satisfaction of judgment.
However, there is no indication that Isidro provided notice of the assignment
to Defendant Biun. (See Kaplan v. Hacker (1952) 113 Cal.App.2d 571, 572.)
“[T]he mere filing thereof does not operate as constructive notice to the
judgment debtor.” (Id. at p. 573.) 
            A judgment debtor who fully
satisfies the judgment is entitled to have an acknowledgment of satisfaction on
record. (Southern California Edison Co. v. Harnischfeger Corp. (1979) 99
Cal.App.3d 9, 13.) Isidro does not contend that the judgment has not in fact
been satisfied. The judgment cannot be reinstated against Defendant Biun after
Defendant has already paid the amount due in full. 
            In sum, Isido has not demonstrated
“proper cause” to set aside the satisfaction of judgment. (See Brochier,
supra, 17 Cal.2d at p. 825.) 
CONCLUSION
            Non-party G.R. Isidro’s motion to
set aside satisfaction of judgment is DENIED.
