And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to transfer the venue of the case to Tuolumne County. The defendant argued that Tuolumne County was the proper venue because that is where he resides. However, the judge found that the case falls under the exception to the general rule that venue is proper only in the county of the defendant's residence. Specifically, the judge ruled that the case is an "action arising from an offer or provision of goods . . . intended primarily for personal, family or household use" and therefore venue is proper in the county where the buyer resides at the time of the action. Since the plaintiff resides in Los Angeles County, the judge ruled that Los Angeles County is the proper venue. The judge's ruling is supported by several California court cases and statutes, including Code of Civil Procedure section 395(b) and Civil Code section 1761(a), (d).
