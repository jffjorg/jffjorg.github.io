And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is issuing an order to show cause re monetary sanctions against Superior Life Finance and its counsel, Benjamin Fliegel, Daniel Ahn, and Reed Smith LLP. The court granted leave to intervene to Superior Life Finance, but the company failed to file its complaint in intervention as required by CCP section 387(e). Instead, the company filed papers for improper purposes, including harassment, causing unnecessary delay, and needlessly increasing the cost of litigation. The court finds that the company's counsel, Mr. Ahn, represented to the court that a final decision on filing the complaint in intervention had not been made, indicating potential fraud upon the court. The court orders mandatory reporting to the State Bar of California and sets a compliance hearing to ensure compliance with the order.
