 Case Number:  23STCV09679    Hearing Date:   March 12, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s
Counsel Irving Pedroza.
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On May 1, 2023, Plaintiff Rony Issac Montes
(“Plaintiff”) filed his complaint against Christopher Tsunglung Ho and Does 1
to 50 for Motor Vehicle Negligence and General Negligence stemming from an auto
accident occurring May 1, 2021.
Defendant Christoper Tsunglung Ho filed his
answer on October 19, 2023.
On February 16, 2024, Irving Pedroza (“Counsel”) filed this motion to be relieved
as counsel. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon request
by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Code of
Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be Relieved as Counsel. Counsel
states his client has been unresponsive to communications, and as such,
continued employment will likely result in a violation of the California Rules
of Professional Conduct. (Decl., No. 2.)
Counsel has been
unable to confirm Plaintiff’s address, but mailed the motion to the client’s
last known address with return receipt requested and emailed the documents to Plaintiff.

The Court finds
that counsel has satisfied all substantive and procedural requirements for a
motion to be relieved and grants the motion, subject to counsel submitting a
revised proposed order that includes the date for the OSC re dismissal of April
28, 2025.
Conclusion
The Court grants
counsel’s motion to be relieved.
The order is
effective upon counsel submitting a revised proposed order to the Court and
counsel filing a proof of service with the Court showing service of the signed order
on the client.
Moving counsel
is ordered to give notice.
