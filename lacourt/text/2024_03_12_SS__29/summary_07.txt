And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge granted the defendants' motion to compel non-party 360 Wellness Physical Therapy to comply with a deposition subpoena for the production of business records. The subpoena was issued and served on 360, but the party failed to comply. The judge found that the defendants had shown good cause for the production of the requested records and that the plaintiff did not file any opposition to the motion. Therefore, the court ordered 360 to comply in full with the subpoena and produce the requested records within 14 days of notice. The defendant's request for sanctions was denied, as 360 did not oppose the motion and there was no finding of bad faith or without substantial justification.
