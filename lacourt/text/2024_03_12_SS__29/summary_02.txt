```

And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the motion to compel the plaintiff to respond to the defendant's supplemental requests as moot, since the plaintiff has already provided the requested responses. The request for sanctions is also denied, as the plaintiff did not oppose the motion and the Court finds that the reasoning of Justice Moor in the case City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) is persuasive.
