And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the motion filed by Plaintiff's Counsel, Irving Pedroza, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed due to the Plaintiff's unresponsiveness to communications, which would likely result in a violation of the California Rules of Professional Conduct. The Judge finds that Counsel has satisfied all substantive and procedural requirements for the motion and grants it, subject to Counsel submitting a revised proposed order and filing proof of service with the Court showing service of the signed order on the client. The effective date of the order relieving Counsel will be upon submission of the revised proposed order and proof of service.
