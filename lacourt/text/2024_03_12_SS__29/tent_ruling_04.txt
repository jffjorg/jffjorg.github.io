 Case Number:  21STCV13446    Hearing Date:   March 12, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Specially Set Motion for Summary Judgment Date
or Alternatively to Continue Trial filed by Defendant Palp, Inc. dba Excel
Paving Company.
 
Tentative
The Court will hear from counsel.
Background
Plaintiff Martha Fox (“Plaintiff”) alleges that on March
8, 2020, she sustained severe and permanent injuries after falling on uneven
cement in an alleyway at or near 404 North Palm Drive in Beverly Hills.  She filed the complaint in this action on
April 8, 2021, asserting causes of action for premises liability and negligence
against City of Beverly Hills (“City”), Excel Paving Company, and Does 1 through
50.
 
On May 13, 2021, City filed its answer to the complaint
and a cross-complaint for indemnity against Palp, Inc. dba Excel Paving Company
(“Palp”) and Roes 1 through 50.
 
On April 18, 2022, Plaintiff amended her complaint to
name Palp as Doe 1.
 
Following a vacated default, Palp filed its answer to the
complaint and cross-complaint on September 12, 2022.
 
On March 17, 2023, the Court granted City’s motion and
continued the trial date to April 29, 2024 (from August 4, 2023).  This was done in part to allow City’s summary
judgment motion, with a reserved hearing date of March 21, 2024, to be heard
before trial.
 
On January 3, 2024, City filed its motion for summary
judgment, set for hearing on March 21.
 
On January 12, 2024, Palp filed its motion for summary
judgment, set for hearing on March 26, 2025, approximately 11 months after the
trial date.
 
On January 30, 2024, the Court denied Palp’s ex parte
application to advance the hearing or continue trial, without prejudice to Palp’s
seeking the same relief through a noticed motion.  The Court also stated that Palp “should check
CRS for an earlier available hearing date” on the summary judgment motion.
 
On February 16, 2024, Palp filed this motion to advance
the hearing or continue trial.  In the
motion, Palp states that the hearing is now set for April 9, 2024 – less than
30 days before trial, but considerably earlier than the initially scheduled
hearing date in March 2025.  
 
Plaintiff filed her opposition to the
motion on February 28, 2024. City filed a “response” on February 29.  Palp filed its reply on March 5.
 
On March 1, 2024, Palp filed a notice
that April 9, 2024 is the new hearing date for its summary judgment motion
(pending the rule on this motion).
 
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 128, subdivision
(a)(8), provides that the court has the power to amend and control its process
and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The power to
determine when a continuance should be granted is within the discretion of the
trial court.” (Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599,
1603.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of calendar control
including the granting or denying of continuances.” (Park Motors, Inc. v.
Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.) 

Each request for a continuance must be
considered on its own merits according to California Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(c). The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance. Circumstances of good cause include:  
“(1) The unavailability of an essential lay
or expert witness because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(2) The unavailability of a party because of
death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;  
(3) The unavailability of trial counsel
because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;  
(4) The substitution of trial counsel, but
only where there is an affirmative showing that the substitution is required in
the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition of a new party if: (A) The
new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare
for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to the new party's
involvement in the case;  
(6) A party's excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts; or  
(7) A significant, unanticipated change in
the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for
trial.”  
 
(Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1332(c).)  
 
California Rules
of Court, rule 3.1332 sets forth a list of non-exhaustive factors to be
analyzed when determining whether good cause for a trial continuance is
present. A court considers factors such as: 

 
“(1) The proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether there was any previous
continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party;  
(3) The length of the continuance
requested;  
(4) The availability of alternative means to
address the problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a
continuance;  
(5) The prejudice that parties or witnesses
will suffer as a result of the continuance; 
(6) If the case is entitled to a preferential
trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need for a
continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's calendar and the impact of
granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether trial counsel is engaged in
another trial;  
(9) Whether all parties have stipulated to a
continuance;  
(10) Whether the interests of justice are
best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing
conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other fact or circumstance relevant
to the fair determination of the motion or application.”  
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) 
Discussion
Palp moves for an order specially setting the hearing date on its
summary judgment motion, so that the hearing may be less than 30 days before
trial, or in the alternative for a order continuing the trial date.  
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c and the governing appellate
case law, the notice of the motion and the supporting papers must be served at
least 75 days before the hearing; the hearing must be at least 30 days before
trial (unless the court sets a later date for good cause shown); and a party
has a right to have a timely filed motion for summary judgment heard before
trial, regardless of calendar congestion in the superior court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(2)-(3); Cole v.
Super. Ct. (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88; Sentry Ins. Co. v. Super.
Ct. (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529.)
In her Opposition, Plaintiff
argues that she did not receive the required 75-day advance notice that Palp’s
motion is set for hearing on April 9, 2024. 
That appears to be correct.  But
Plaintiff does not contest that Palp timely filed a motion for summary
judgment, and that Palp has a right to have that motion heard before trial.
The Court will hear from counsel.  
The Court’s tentative decision is
to reset Palp’s motion for a date that is at least 75 days in the future (likely
early June) and to continue trial to a date that is at least 30 days after the summary
judgment hearing date.  
The Court would also like to hear
from counsel regarding the degree of overlap between Palp’s motion and the City’s
motion.  (The City in its “response” to
the pending motion indicates that there is significant overlap.)  If it would promote efficiency for the court
and the parties, the Court will consider continuing, on its own motion, the
hearing on City’s summary judgment motion so that the two motions may be heard
at the same time.
Conclusion
The Court will
hear from counsel.
