The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Jason Adam Oberlander's motion to reopen discovery in two related cases, Case No. 21STCV47187 and Case No. 21STCV47478. The cases arise from a motor vehicle accident on January 3, 2020, on the 10 Freeway in Santa Monica. The Marquez Plaintiffs (Margarita Marquez, Maria Marquez, and Primitiva Estrada) filed their complaint on December 28, 2021, while the Weingarten Plaintiffs (Jennie Journo Weingarten and Lishai Weingarten) filed their complaint on December 30, 2021. The Defendant filed his answers on July 27, 2022, and the cases were related on November 2, 2022. The Defendant's motion seeks to extend the deadline for all discovery and motions, as well as to take the deposition of each of the Marquez Plaintiffs, obtain independent medical examinations, conduct third-party discovery, and engage in supplemental discovery and expert discovery. The motion was granted as to Case No. 21STCV47187, but denied without prejudice as to Case No. 21STCV47478. The Court found that the motion was supported by a showing of good cause.
