And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case involving a slip and fall accident on November 3, 2020. The plaintiff, Ana Maria Vasquez, filed a lawsuit against Food 4 Less of California, Inc. dba Food 4 Less, The Kroger Co., and others. The defendant filed a motion for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions, alleging that the plaintiff failed to comply with discovery orders.

The court denied the request for terminating sanctions, finding that the plaintiff's failure to provide responses within the time period ordered by the Court was not a repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process. However, the court granted in part the request for monetary sanctions, ordering the plaintiff to pay $820 to the defendant. The court also ordered the plaintiff to pay the filing fee.

The court's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the Enforcement of Judgments Law. The court's intention is to obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery Act and the Court's orders, and to punish the plaintiff for her failure to comply with the discovery orders.
