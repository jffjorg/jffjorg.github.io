The English text to summarize this judge's tentative ruling is:

The judge is considering Palp's motion to advance the hearing on its summary judgment motion, which is currently set for April 9, 2024, or to continue the trial date. The judge notes that the motion was filed without providing 75-day advance notice, but Palp has a right to have the motion heard before trial. The judge is tentatively deciding to reset Palp's motion for a date at least 75 days in the future (likely early June) and to continue the trial date to a date at least 30 days after the summary judgment hearing date. The judge also wants to hear from counsel regarding the degree of overlap between Palp's motion and City's motion for summary judgment, and may consider continuing the hearing on City's motion to hear the two motions together.
