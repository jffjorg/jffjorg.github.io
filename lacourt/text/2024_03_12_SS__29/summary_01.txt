The judge has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Mario M De La Rosa. The motion was filed on January 30, 2024, and no opposition was filed. The judge found that all substantive and procedural requirements for the requested relief were satisfied. However, the judge noted that the future settlement conference and trial dates have been continued, and therefore, an amended proposed order must be submitted identifying the current dates. The order relieving counsel will be effective upon the submission of the amended proposed order and proof of service of the signed order on the client.
