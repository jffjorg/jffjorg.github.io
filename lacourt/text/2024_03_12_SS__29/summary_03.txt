And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the motion to seal the terms of the settlement agreement between the Settling Defendants (Brian Williams, Ronald Williams, and Cash Money Records, Inc.) and the Plaintiffs (Kenneth Lawson and Monique Jourdain-Lawson). The motion was filed on January 10, 2024, and the Settling Defendants seek to seal the terms of the settlement agreement, which contains a confidentiality provision. The Judge finds that the motion is denied because it is unclear what the Settling Defendants seek to seal, and they have not provided sufficient evidence to support the required findings. The Judge also finds that the motion fails to establish an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record.

The Judge continues the hearing on the motion for a good faith settlement determination, which was also filed by the Settling Defendants. The motion seeks a determination that the settlement is in good faith and that the amount paid is reasonable in light of the settling defendant's proportionate share of liability. The Judge notes that the Settling Defendants have not provided sufficient information to support the motion, including the amount of the settlement, and that the motion is denied without prejudice.
