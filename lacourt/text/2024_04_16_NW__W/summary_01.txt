And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions for good faith settlement. The first motion was filed by BOC Construction, Inc. (BOC) to determine the good faith of its settlement with Plaintiff Seth Lichtenstein. The court granted the motion, finding that the settlement represents BOC's proportional share of liability. The second motion was filed by Premier Pool Plastering (Premier) to determine the good faith of its settlement with Plaintiff Seth Lichtenstein. The court also granted this motion, finding that the settlement represents Premier's proportional share of liability. The court considered various factors, including the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and the recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than they would if they were found liable after a trial. The court also considered the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of the settling defendants, as well as the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of non-settling defendants.
