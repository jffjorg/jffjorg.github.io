TENTATIVE RULING
 
Petitioner Price brings this petition
seeking permission to present a late tort claim against the City of Los Angeles
pursuant to Gov’t Code Section 912.  This
petition arises out of a motor vehicle accident which occurred on October 22,
2022. Gov’t Code Section 911.2 provides that “[a] claim relating to a cause of
action for death or for injury to person or to personal property or growing
crops shall be presented as provided in Article 2 (commencing with Section 915)
not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.”  Petitioner did not file a tort claim until May
5, 2023, more than 180 days after the accident. 
Petitioner argues that he should be granted leave to file a late tort
claim for two reasons: first, the cause of action did not accrue until March of
2023, when the extent of plaintiff’s injuries was understood; and second, that plaintiff’s
error in not filing within the six month period was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect. 
 
The City counters that the petition for
relief from the claims presentation requirements set forth in Government Code §
945.4 must be denied because petitioner did not first present an application
for leave to present a late
claim to the City, as required by Section
946.6.   That section provides that a petitions
for relief from the claims presentation requirements imposed by Section 945.4
can only be filed after “an application for leave to present a claim is denied
or deemed to be denied.” (Gov. Code, § 946.6, subd. (a).) The petition can only
be
granted upon a determination by the
court that, among other things, “the application [for leave to present a late
claim] … was made within a reasonable time not to exceed that specified in
subdivision (b) of Section 911.4 and was denied or deemed denied.” (Gov. Code,
§ 946.6, subd. (c).)   The City asserts
that no such application was set forth in the petition or, in fact, ever
presented.  Any such application would
have to have been made no later than October 22, 2023, one year after the accrual
of the cause of action. (Gov’t Code Section 911.4.)  Here, there can be no question but that the
cause of action accrued at the time of the collision with the City’s fire truck
and not at some later point when the petitioner understood the full extent of
his injuries.   
 
The court agrees that the petitioner
must be denied unless the petitioner can establish that it first presented the
application to the City prior to October 22, 2023, and that such application
was denied or deemed denied.   There is
no evidence before the court that any such application was made.   “[R]elief provided by section 946.6 is
available only if an application for leave to present a late claim is filed
with the public entity involved and is denied or deemed denied.” (Williams v.
Mariposa County Unified Sch. Dist. (1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 843, 848.)
 
The Petition to File a Late Claim is
DENIED.
