BACKGROUND
 
This is a
medical malpractice action. Plaintiff Kimberly J. Squire alleges Defendants
were negligent in the surgery on her leg performed in 2020. Plaintiff alleges
Defendants’ actions led to Plaintiff suffering a pulmonary embolism in the
hospital. Further, their course of treatment post-surgery caused Plaintiff to
endure a second injury and a second surgery, as Defendants had her put on too
much weight too soon.
 
On April 26,
2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Noble Orthopedic Medical
Corporation, Eric I. Ferkel, M.D., Southern California Orthopedic Institute,
L.P. and Valley Presbyterian Hospital for medical negligence.

DISCUSSION
 
I.                   
PLAINTIFF KIMBERLY J. SQUIRE’S MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES BY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ORTHOPEDIC INSTITUTE, L.P. TO
REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION
 
Plaintiff Kimberly J. Squire moves the
court for an order compelling further responses by Defendant Southern
California Orthopedic Institute, L.P. to Requests for Production of Documents,
Nos. 1 – 6 and for sanctions in the amount of $7,125.00 as reasonable costs and
attorney fees against Defendants Ferkel, Southern California Orthopedic
Institute, L.P., and Noble Orthopedic Medical Corporation and their counsel of
record for the instant motion and Plaintiff’s eleven concurrently filed
motions.
 
A motion to compel further responses to
a demand for inspection or production of documents (“RFP”) may be brought based
on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or
incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly
generalized objections.  (CCP §
2031.310(c).) A motion to compel further production must set forth specific
facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection
demand. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1).) It is not necessary for the
motion to show that the material sought will be admissible in evidence. “Good
cause” may be found to justify discovery where specific facts show that the
discovery is necessary for effective trial preparation or to prevent surprise
at trial. (See Associated Brewers Dist. Co. v. Superior Court (1967) 65 Cal.2d
583, 586-588; see also CCP §§ 2017.010, 2019.030(a)(1).) 
 
Plaintiff seeks further responses to
RFP Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 on the grounds Defendant only agreed to provide “a copy
of the office chart of Ms. Squire” and “emails.” Plaintiff contends this is not
“all DOCUMENTS” or “all COMMUNICATIONS.” Plaintiff avers the responses further
fail to meet the standards of Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.220 where
the responding party agrees that the documents or things in the demanded
category that are in the responding party’s possession, custody, or control
will be produced (except to the extent of any objections). To the extent
Defendant claims an inability to comply, Plaintiff contends Defendants must
fully comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.230. As for RFP Nos. 5
and 6, Plaintiff argues the objections are nuisance objections. 
 
As this court has previously held, the
court finds good cause for the discovery as to RFP Nos. 1-4.  If Noble truly is not in possession of the
requested documents, it must comply with Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.230. Moreover, Defendant must clearly state that it has provided all
documents in its possession, custody or control. As for RFP Nos. 5 and 6, the
court agrees with defendant that the requests are vague, ambiguous and
overbroad. As such, Defendant need not provide further responses.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Further Responses by Southern California Orthopedic Institute, L.P. to
Requests for Production is GRANTED in part and denied in part. Defendant to provide
further responses to requests 1-4 within 20 days, without objections. 
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is
denied as previously discussed in the court’s submitted April 30, 2024 minute
order. 
 
II.                 
PLAINTIFF KIMBERLY J. SQUIRE’S MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES BY ERIC IAN FERKEL TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES
 
Plaintiff Kimberly J. Squire moves the
court for an order compelling further responses by Defendant Eric Ian Ferkel to
Special Interrogatories Nos. 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, and 13 and for sanctions in the
amount of $7,125.00 as reasonable costs and attorney fees against Defendants
Ferkel, Southern California Orthopedic Institute, L.P., and Noble Orthopedic
Medical Corporation and their counsel of record for the instant motion and
Plaintiff’s eleven concurrently filed motions.
 
A motion to compel further responses to
form or specially prepared interrogatories may be brought if the responses
contain: (1) answers that are evasive or incomplete; (2) an unwarranted or
insufficiently specific exercise of an option to produce documents in lieu of a
substantive response; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections.  (CCP § 2030.300(a).)   
 
Plaintiff seeks further responses to
SROG Nos. 3 and 4 on the grounds Defendant Ferkel improperly references other
documents in their response. Additionally, the conclusory response “The initial
surgery complied with the standard of care and was appropriately performed and
all treatment by Dr. Ferkel and SCOI met the standard of care and did not cause
harm to plaintiff” fails to state if Ferkel considers the surgery a success and
why. 
 
In opposition, Defendant Ferkel argues
‘success’ is a vague term and it is rather accurate to say the performance of
the surgery by Dr. Ferkel complied with the standard of care. Moreover, the
interrogatory is calling for an opinion by an expert, yet experts have not been
designated. The response clearly indicates the position that Dr. Ferkel
complied with the standard of care in performing the surgery, and all other treatment
was also appropriate. 
 
The court agrees the term ‘success’ is
vague. Defendant is unable to respond to these interrogatories. The court
denies the motion to compel further as to SROG Nos. 3 and 4. 
 
Plaintiff also seeks further responses
to SROG No. 5 on the grounds Defendant Ferkel improperly references other
documents in their response. Moreover, it includes a conclusory response.
Similarly, Defendant Ferkel must provide complete and straightforward response
to SROG No. 8. Plaintiff contends Defendant Ferkel cannot simply refer to
records for the proposition that Squire did not need a second surgery. 
 
In opposition, Defendant Ferkel argues
SROG No. 5 calls for speculation as to what was told to Ms. Squire by other
individuals. However, Defendant Ferkel can amend their response to follow the
Form Interrogatory 17.1 response, “Dr. Ferkel advised Ms. Squire that she had a
nonunion of the medial plateau fracture, and referred her to Geoffrey Marecek,
M.D., at Cedars Sinai Medical Center for possible revision surgery evaluation.”
As for SROG No. 8, Defendant Ferkel argues this interrogatory seeks information
that needs to be provided by either subsequent treaters and/or expert witnesses.
Moreover, Plaintiff’s request for a further response is extremely confusing as
it contains a double negative and it is unclear what further response is being requested.
 
The court grants the motion to compel
as to SROG Nos. 5 and 8. These responses fail to respond to the interrogatory.
Defendant cannot simply point to medical records without explaining their
contentions. 
 
Lastly, Plaintiff seeks further
responses to SROG Nos. 11 and 13. As for SROG No. 11, Plaintiff argues the
objections are nuisance objections. As for SROG No. 13, Plaintiff argues the
response provided does not actually state what the relationship with Ferkel and
Noble is. 
 
In opposition, Defendant Ferkel argues the
number of prior surgeries performed by Dr. Ferkel is not likely to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. As Dr. Ferkel did not perform the surgery,
there is no reason for him to state how many times he has performed it.
Moreover, as to SROG No. 13, in regard to Ms. Squire, Noble Orthopedic and Dr.
Ferkel had no relationship to each other. Noble Orthopedic did not provide any
care or treatment for Ms. Squire and no further responses need to be provided. 
 
As for SROG 11, the court agrees how
many similar surgeries Defendant has performed to the second surgery is
irrelevant. Plaintiff has not shown Defendant’s knowledge or experience of how
to perform the second surgery equates the first surgery falling below the
standard of care. Moreover, the court agrees with Defendant that the response
to SROG 13 is sufficient even if Plaintiff believes the response is inaccurate.

 
Accordingly, Plaintiff Kimberly J.
Squire’s Motion to Compel Further Responses by Eric Ian Ferkel to Special
Interrogatories is GRANTED as to SROG Nos. 5 and 8; DENIED a to SROG Nos. 3, 4,
11, and 13. 
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is
denied as previously discussed in the court’s submitted April 30, 2024 minute
order. 
 
III.               
PLAINTIFF KIMBERLY J. SQUIRE’S MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES BY NOBLE ORTHOPEDIC MEDICAL CORPORATION TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES
 
Plaintiff Kimberly J. Squire moves the
court for an order compelling further responses by Defendant Noble Orthopedic Medical Corporation
to Special Interrogatories Nos. 3, 4, 5, 8, and 12 and for sanctions in the
amount of $7,125.00 as reasonable costs and attorney fees against Defendants
Ferkel, Southern California Orthopedic Institute, L.P., and Noble Orthopedic
Medical Corporation and their counsel of record for the instant motion and
Plaintiff’s eleven concurrently filed motions.
 
The parties make the same arguments as
the discovery requests are identical and the responses identical as well as to
SROG Nos. 3, 4, 5, 8, and 11. As for SROG 12, it similarly requests as SROG 13
for Noble Orthopedic to describe its relationship with Ferkel. As noted above, the
response to SROG 13 is sufficient even if Plaintiff believes the response is
inaccurate.  
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff Kimberly J.
Squire’s Motion to Compel Further Responses by Noble Orthopedic Medical Corporation to Special Interrogatories is
GRANTED as to SROG Nos. 5 and 8; DENIED a to SROG Nos. 3, 4, 11, and 12.
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is
denied as previously discussed in the court’s submitted April 30, 2024 minute
order. 
 
IV.              
PLAINTIFF KIMBERLY J. SQUIRE’S MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES BY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ORTHOPEDIC INSTITUTE, L.P.
TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES
 
Plaintiff Kimberly J. Squire moves the
court for an order compelling further responses by Defendant Southern
California Orthopedic Institute, L.P. to Special Interrogatories Nos. 3, 4, 5,
and 8 and for sanctions in the amount of $7,125.00 as reasonable costs and
attorney fees against Defendants Ferkel, Southern California Orthopedic
Institute, L.P., and Noble Orthopedic Medical Corporation and their counsel of
record for the instant motion and Plaintiff’s eleven concurrently filed
motions.
 
The parties make the same arguments as
the discovery requests are identical and the responses identical as well. 
 
Accordingly, Kimberly J. Squire’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses by Southern California Orthopedic Institute,
L.P.  to Special Interrogatories is
GRANTED as to SROG Nos. 5 and 8; DENIED a to SROG Nos. 3, 4. 
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is
denied as previously discussed in the court’s submitted April 30, 2024 minute
order. 
 
V.                
PLAINTIFF KIMBERLY J. SQUIRE’S MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES BY ERIC IAN FERKEL TO FORM INTERROGATORIES
 
Plaintiff Kimberly J. Squire moves the
court for an order compelling further responses by Defendant Eric Ian Ferkel to
Form Interrogatories Nos. 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, and 16.1 through 16.10 and for
sanctions in the amount of $7,125.00 as reasonable costs and attorney fees
against Defendants Ferkel, Southern California Orthopedic Institute, L.P., and
Noble Orthopedic Medical Corporation and their counsel of record for the
instant motion and Plaintiff’s eleven concurrently filed motions.
 
Plaintiff seeks further responses to
Plaintiff’s FROG Nos. 2.3, 2.5, and 2.6 on the grounds failed to properly
provide any information. 
 
In opposition, Defendant Ferkel argues
FROG 2.3 is part of the form interrogatories in a personal injury case. This
interrogatory would apply to an automobile accident case, but that is not at
issue here. Moreover, FROG 2.5 is not calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence. Dr. Ferkel can be reached through defense counsel at all times. As
for FROG 2.6, Defendant Ferkel contends the response provides his address of
employment and as noted in the Response to Form Interrogatory 17.1, Dr. Ferkel
is a partner at Southern California Orthopedic Institute, L.P. 
 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to
compel further responses to 2.3, 2.5 and 2.6. This is general background
information and relevant. 
 
Plaintiff also seeks further responses
to the 16 series of form interrogatories. Plaintiff argues Defendant’s
objections are meritless as Defendants have had “a reasonable opportunity to conduct
an investigation or discovery of the injuries and damages of the plaintiffs
[sic]….” including issuing subpoenas, obtaining discovery responses from
co-defendant Valley Presbyterian and so forth. 
 
In opposition, Defendant argues at the
time the responses were made, it was premature to respond to any of these
questions as to whether any of these contentions are being made. In the future, these responses may change and the
instructions specifically state: “The interrogatories in section 16.0,
Defendant’s Contentions – Personal injury, should not be used until the
defendant has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct an investigation or
discovery of plaintiff’s injuries and damages.
 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to
compel further responses to FROG Nos. 16.1 through 16.10. This action has been
litigated for a year now. Defendant does not provided what further
investigation needs to occur. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff Kimberly J.
Squire’s Motion to Compel Further Responses by Eric Ian Ferkel to Form
Interrogatories is GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is
denied as previously discussed in the court’s submitted April 30, 2024 minute
order.
