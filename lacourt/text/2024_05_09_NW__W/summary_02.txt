And here is the English-text summary of the "Tentative Ruling":

The court has tentatively ruled that the defendants' motion to amend their responses and objections to the plaintiff's requests for admissions is granted. The defendants sought to amend their responses to a request for admission regarding the parking of a green truck in a marked loading zone. The court finds that the initial admission was made in error due to a mistake, inadvertence, and/or excusable neglect. The court grants the motion and allows the defendants to file amended responses and objections. The court also notes that the plaintiff may continue discovery against the defendants' expert and may pursue additional discovery into the matter. The court declines the plaintiff's request to be permitted to comment on any changes made by the defendants to the request for admission throughout the case and at trial.
