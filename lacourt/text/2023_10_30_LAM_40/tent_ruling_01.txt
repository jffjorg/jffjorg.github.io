Background
Pleadings
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Randall
L. Bort (hereafter, Plaintiff Bort) sues Defendants/Cross-Complainants KBS
Holdco, LLC (KBS), Brian Kennedy (KBS’s owner), and Does 1-50 pursuant to
claims of (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Promissory Estoppel, (3) Quantum Meruit,
and (4) Account Stated.
The claims arise from allegations
that KBS and Kennedy (hereafter, Defendants) entered into a written Agreement
with Plaintiff Bort to employ his professional services to perform various
tasks—including obtaining financing—for Defendants’ intended purchase of the
remainder of a company named Regency Outdoor Advertising (Regency), with
Plaintiff Bort to be paid a Retainer Fee of $50,000 or relevant Success Fee of
$1,470,000 if the Regency Project was structured as an asset purchase.
Plaintiff Bort alleges that his efforts helped the Defendants successfully
purchase Regency on February 2, 2021 but that the Defendants breached the
Agreement by only paying Plaintiff Bort a $10,000 downpayment and no other monies,
causing Bort damages of $1,460,000.
In turn, Defendants KBS and Kennedy
sue Plaintiff Bort and Roes 1-10 pursuant to a June 30, 2021 Cross-Complaint
alleging claims of (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Rescission, (3) Unfair
Competition, and (4) Declaratory Relief.
The claims in the cross-complaint arise
from allegations that, among other things, Defendant Kennedy acquired Regency
through use of his own funds and that Plaintiff Bort breached the Agreement by
failing to secure the financing contemplated by the parties’ contract, for
which reason a rescission of the Agreement is merited and Plaintiff Bort is not
entitled to the $1,460,000 sought in the Complaint.
Motions Before the Court
On September 20, 2023, Defendants
filed and served a motion to quash four subpoenas duces tecum served on various
third-party law firms by Plaintiff Bort on September 5, 2023.
Specifically, the subpoenas were
served on Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP, Karish & Bjorgum PC,
LTL Attorneys, LLP, and Parker, Milliken, Clark, O’Hara & Samuelian. The subpoenas
contain identical categories of examination and an identical production request.
The categories of examination are (1) “[d]id you provide services to Brian
Kennedy and/or KBS Holdco, LLC,” (2) “[w]ere you paid in full for the services”;
and (3) “[w]hat is the balance due for those services?” The production request
seeks “documents sufficient to identify any amounts due from Brian Kennedy
and/or KBS Holdco, such as a statement of account or a last invoice.”
On September 29, 2023, Defendants
filed and served a motion to quash six additional subpoenas served on
third-party law firms by Plaintiff Bort on September 8, 2023.
The subpoenas were served on Robins
Kaplan LLP, Crochetiere LLP, Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump & Aldisert LLP,
Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP, Stubbs, Alderton & Markiles, LLP, and
Shartsis Friese LLP. These subpoenas contain categories of examination and a
production request identical to those in the September 5th subpoenas.
The motions attached separate
statements and were respectively scheduled for hearing on January 12 and 22,
2024.
On October 23, 2023, the Court held
a final status conference (FSC) in this action, at which time the Court, on
oral stipulation, advanced and continued the hearings on the motions to quash
to October 30, 2023.
On October 24, 2023, Plaintiff
filed and served a combined opposition to the motions to quash. No separate
statement was attached thereto.
The two motions to quash are now
before the Court.
 
Motions to Quash Subpoena Duces Tecum

Legal Standard 
A motion to
quash a deposition subpoena or deposition notice is used to strike, modify, or
impose conditions on a subpoena or notice that is procedurally or substantively
defective. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1987.1, subd. (a), 2025.410, subd. (c);
see, e.g., Catholic Mut. Relief Soc’y v. Superior Court (2007) 42
Cal.4th 358, 365 [motion based on ground that subpoenas sought information
outside scope of discovery]; John B. v. Superior Court (2006) 38 Cal.4th
1177, 1186 [motion based in part on ground that subpoenas violated right of
privacy]; McClatchy Newspapers v. Superior Court (1945) 26 Cal.2d 386,
391 [motion based on ground that subpoenas were unreasonable and oppressive]; Far
W. S&L Assn. v. McLaughlin (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 67, 71 [motion based
on ground that subpoena was not properly served]; City of Los Angeles v.
Superior Court (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 883, 888 [procedural remedy for a
defective subpoena is generally a motion to quash under § 1987.1].) 
Such
a motion may be made by:
(1)
Any party to the action (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (b)(1)); 
(2)
The subpoenaed witness (e.g., a custodian of another person’s personal records)
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (b)(2); Monarch Healthcare v. Superior
Court (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1287-1288); 
(3)
A person (party or nonparty) whose consumer, governmental, or employment
information or records have been subpoenaed (see Code Civ. Proc., § 1985.3,
subd. (g) [party consumer], 1985.4 [state or local-agency employee or any other
natural person], 1985.6, subd. (f)(1) [employee], 1987.1, subd. (b)(3)
[consumer], 1987.1, subd. (b)(4) [employee]; see also Code Civ. Proc., §§
1985.3, subd. (g), ¶ 2, 1985.6, subd. (f)(2) [nonparty consumer can make
written objections instead of motion to quash]); 
(4)
A person whose “personally identifying information” within the meaning of Civ.
Code § 1798.79.8, subd, (b), subpoenaed in connection with an action involving
that person’s exercise of free-speech rights; and 
(5)
The Court, on its own motion, after giving the parties notice and the
opportunity to be heard (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (a).) 
A
motion to quash may be based on various grounds, including that:
The
subpoena contains error or irregularities in the deposition notice (see Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.410, subds. (a), (c));
The
subpoena seeks information that is not relevant to the issues in the case (see,
e.g., Catholic Mut. Relief Soc’y v. Superior Court, supra, 42
Cal.4th at p. 365 [motion to quash deposition subpoena because documents were
outside the scope of discovery]; cf. Cadiz Land Co. v. Rail Cycle, L.P.
(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 74, 122-123 [motion to quash deposition notice because
deposition would not lead to admissible evidence]);
The
subpoena seeks information that is not relevant to the issues in the case (see,
e.g., Slagle v. Superior Court (1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 1309, 1314-1315
[motion to quash trial subpoena because medical records were not relevant was
properly overruled]);
The
subpoena makes unreasonable or oppressive demands for information (see Code
Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (a); see, e.g., McClatchy Newspapers v. Superior
Court, supra, 26 Cal.2d at p. 391 [motion to quash deposition
subpoenas because they were unreasonable and oppressive]);
The
disclosure of the records sought will violate the consumer’s constitutional
right to privacy (see Cal. Const., art. I, § 1; see, e.g., Fett v. Medical
Bd. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 211, 213 [petitions to quash to nonparties’
doctor because of privacy rights]; Manela v. Superior Court (2009) 117 Cal.App.4th
1139, 1150-1151 [motion to quash a subpoena to party’s doctor because of
privacy rights]); and
The
disclosure of records will violate a privilege of the consumer, the witness, or
a person with whom the witness has a relationship that requires the witness to
assert the privilege on the person’s behalf. (See, e.g., Monarch Healthcare
v. Superior Court, supra, 78 Cal.App.4th at p. 1290 [objections to
subpoena for business records based on trade-secret privilege]).

Order Quashing Subpoena: GRANTED.
I. Preliminary
Discussion
The Court initially notes that
because all ten subpoenas duces tecum are identical in their categories for
examination and production request, the Court can apply its determination
equally to all of them, informed by the arguments advanced by the parties.
The identical categories of
examination at issue ask:
(1) “Did you provide services to
Brian Kennedy and/or KBS Holdco, LLC”;
(2) “Were you paid in full for the
services”; and 
(3) “What is the balance due for
those services?”
The identical production request
seeks:
“Documents sufficient to identify
any amounts due from Brian Kennedy and/or KBS Holdco, such as a statement of
account or a last invoice.”
(See Mots., Ex. A.)
II. Proper Party
Defendants have standing to make this
motion because they are parties to the action (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd.
(b)(1)) and/or persons (party or nonparty) whose consumer, governmental, or
employment information or records have been subpoenaed (see Code Civ. Proc., §§
1985.3, subd. (g) [party consumer], 1987.1, subd. (b)(3) [consumer]).
III. Merits
In their motions, Defendants argue
that the documents and information sought are not relevant to Plaintiff’s
causes of action, that the documents and information are impermissible character
evidence and are thus not admissible, that Plaintiff requests documents and
information protected by the attorney-client privilege, and that the documents
and information requested violate Defendant Kennedy’s personal privacy rights.
(9/20/23 Mot., pp. 3-8; 9/26/23 Mot., pp. 3-10.)
In opposition, Plaintiff argues
that the documents and information sought are relevant to pattern and practice
of not paying for services and do not involve character evidence, but rather, involve
evidence of intent, credibility, custom, truthfulness, and lack of illegality
or nonperformance by Plaintiff Bort. The opposition also argues that the
billing and payment history involved in the categories for examination and
production request are not privileged or confidential, though the briefing
fails to discuss privacy. Last, the opposition briefly argues that there was an
insufficient meet and confer prior to these motions. (Opp’n, pp. 11-15.)
The Court finds in favor of
Defendants.
The Court determines that the
documents and information sought in the subpoena are beyond the scope of
discovery because they are irrelevant to the question of whether the specific
conditions to trigger the Success Fee took place. Liability turns on that
question, not on a question of intent or state of mind, which would be relevant
to a fraud claim. In contrast, Plaintiff’s Complaint pleads claims sounding in
contract alone. It is noteworthy that the other lawsuits principally relied
upon by Plaintiff in which at least one court allowed such discovery (which
ruling is, of course, not precedent) included a federal action which included a
RICO and fraud claim, and a state court action that included a fraud claim. 
To the extent that Plaintiff contends
that this discovery will assist in refuting Defendants’ arguments as to their real
“motive” for not paying Plaintiff, or show a “custom” regarding like cases
pursuant to Evidence Code section 1101, the Court has several concerns. First, it
is not clear whether Defendants will in fact “open the door” to impeachment in
this manner, and if they do so, there appears to already be substantial evidence
that is in the possession of the Plaintiff that can be used to impeach Mr.
Kennedy. Under Evidence Code section 352, it is very unlikely that the Court would
allow all of the evidence sought to be discovered in these subpoenas at trial,
as proving up both the failure to pay, as well as the purported reason for not
paying, each of these law firms will require a consumption of time that would
become undue at some point. 
Moreover, Defendants have a right
to privacy which merits the quashing of these motions, which is a topic
unaddressed by Plaintiff’s opposition.
Defendant Kennedy, as an
individual, has a right to prevent disclosure of information about personal
finances, including information about bank accounts, assets, and debts. (See In
re Ins. Installment Fee Cases (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1395, 1428
[information privacy in personal financial affairs].) The right to privacy
extends to an individual’s confidential financial information in whatever form
it takes, e.g., tax returns, checks, statements, or other account information.
(Look v. Penovatz (2019) 34 Cal.App.5th 61, 73; SCC Acquisitions,
Inc. v. Superior Court (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 741, 754; Overstock.Com,
Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 471, 503.) Similarly,
Defendant KBS has a right to privacy, even if it is more limited than Defendant
Kennedy’s. (Ameri-Med Corp. v. Worker’s Comp.
Appeals Bd. (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1286-1287 (Ameri-Med)
[corporation has no standing to assert a constitutional right to privacy but
has a general right to privacy that depends on the circumstances, including the
strength of the nexus between the artificial entity and human beings and the
context in which the controversy arises].) 
In the face of an objection based
on privacy, the party that is seeking discovery of another party’s financial
information must show that this information is directly relevant to a cause of
action or defense, such that the disclosure is essential to a fair resolution
of the lawsuit. (Look v. Penovatz, supra, 34 Cal.App.5th at p.
73.) Here, as discussed above, Plaintiff has not met this burden.
Last, the Court notes that it is
satisfied with the meet and confer efforts here. Moreover, Plaintiff presents
no authority for the purpose of showing that meet and confer efforts are
specifically necessary for motions to quash pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1987.1. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1; see also Mots., Notice [motions
brought under Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, while sanctions brought separately
under Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2020.010 and 2023.010].)
Defendants’ motions are therefore
GRANTED.
Sanctions: DENIED.
Except as specified in subdivision
(c), in making an order pursuant to motion made under subdivision (c) of
Section 1987 or under Section 1987.1, the court may in its discretion award the
amount of the reasonable expenses incurred in making or opposing the motion,
including reasonable attorney’s fees, if the court finds the motion was made or
opposed in bad faith or without substantial justification or that one or more
of the requirements of the subpoena was oppressive. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.2,
subd. (a).)
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
The September 20, 2023 motion seeks
$6,800 in sanctions against Plaintiff Bort and his counsel for discovery abuse
in serving the subpoenas and for opposing this motion without substantial
justification. (9/20/23 Mot., pp. 8-9; 9/20/23 Mot., Angioni Decl., ¶¶
4-6 [seeking reduced fees of $6,800, but representing that (1) counsel Nannina
Angioni spent eight hours on this motion at a rate of $687 per hour, (2) counsel
Allyssa Rose spent eight hours on this motion at a rate of $400 per hour, (3) counsel
Allyssa Rose expects to expend eight hours on a reply at a rate of $400 per
hour, and (4) counsel Nannina Angioni expects to expend five hours on a reply
and appearing at this hearing at a rate of $687 per hour, which, per the
Court’s calculation, totals $15,331 in work by counsel].)
The September 29, 2023 motion seeks
$8,500 in sanctions against Plaintiff Bort and his counsel for the same
reasons. (9/29/23 Mot., pp. 10-11; 9/29/23 Mot., Swanson Decl., ¶¶ 5-6 [seeking reduced fees of
$8,500, but representing that (1) counsel Sarah Swanson spent seven hours on
this motion at a rate of $500 per hour, (2) counsel Allyssa Rose spent five
hours on this motion at a rate of $400 per hour, (3) counsel Sarah Swanson
expects to expend two hours on a reply at a rate of $500 per hour, (4) counsel
Allyssa Rose expects to expend three hours on a reply at a rate of $400 per
hour, and (5) counsel Nannina Angioni expended or expects to expend five hours
preparing this motion and attending the hearing at a rate of $687 per hour,
which, per the Court’s calculation, totals $11,135 in work by counsel].)
The opposition does not discuss the
merit of sanctions.
The Court finds in favor of Plaintiff.
The Court finds that Plaintiff had a
substantial justification for opposing these motions, because of the
possibility that Defendants may seek to defend this lawsuit at trial with
testimony that could be impeached with evidence of a failure to pay other
professionals. However, for all the reasons stated above, the Court ultimately
did not find that Plaintiff had met his heavy burden of showing that these subpoenas
should not be quashed.
In addition, even if the Court were
to have granted sanctions, the time expended by Defendants on each motion was
excessive.
The sanctions requests are thus
DENIED.
