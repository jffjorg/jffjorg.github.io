And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Lisa Nguyen's motion to quash the service of summons and complaint. The motion was filed on August 9, 2023, and argues that the service was defective because it was made at a location where Defendant Nguyen was not present and did not work. The judge finds in favor of Defendant Nguyen and grants the motion. The service of summons and complaint on March 9, 2023, is quashed. The judge notes that this motion is directed at a pleading that has been superseded by the filing of the October 2, 2023 First Amended Complaint, and that any service of the First Amended Complaint on Defendant Nguyen is not affected by this ruling. The judge also notes that the plaintiffs have failed to oppose Defendant Nguyen's motion, which lends merit to it.
