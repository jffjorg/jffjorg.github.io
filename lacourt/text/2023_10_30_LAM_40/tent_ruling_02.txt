 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant Lisa Nguyen’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons and
  Complaint.



 
Background
Plaintiffs Marisela Vasquez,
Anthony Ixta, Anabelle Ixta, Luna Vasquez, and Manuel Vasquez (the latter four
Plaintiffs being minors) sue Defendants Pacific Urban Investors (Pacific;
erroneously sued as Haven Warner Center), FPI Management, Inc. (FPI), Lisa
Nguyen, Dennis Treadaway, Regina Jasinksi, and Does 1 through 20 pursuant to an
October 2, 2023 First Amended Complaint alleging claims of (1) Battery, (2)
Negligence, (3) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, (4) Breach of the
Implied Warranty of Habitability, (5) Breach of the Covenant of Quiet
Enjoyment, (6) Violation of Civil Code Section 1942.4, (7) Private Nuisance,
(8) Public Nuisance, and (9) Breach of Contract.
The claims arise from allegations
that during their tenancy of the premises located at 6530 Independence Ave.,
Canoga Park, California 91303 (the Haven Warner Center), Unit 237 (Subject
Premises), Plaintiffs for months suffered from a bed bug infestation, resulting
in bites, injuries, and medical expenses to Plaintiffs, with Plaintiffs
informing Defendants of the infestation, which Defendants failed to remedy.
The action was originally assigned
to Department 27 of the Personal Injury Court at the Spring Street Courthouse.
The summons of the Complaint was not issued and filed until November 14, 2022.
On March 9, 2023, the summons and
Complaint were served on Lisa Nguyen by substituted service on a leasing office
representative at the Haven Warner Center.
On May 8, 2023, Department 27
determined that this action was not a personal injury case as defined in the
Superior Court’s General Order re Jurisdiction of such cases, for which reason,
Department 27 sent this action to Department 1 for reassignment. Department 27
also took off calendar all hearings for this action then set in that Department.
On May 9, 2023, Department 1
reassigned this action to Department 40 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse (the
Court).
On May 17, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a
proof of service for Defendant Nguyen.
On August 9, 2023, Defendant Nguyen
made a motion to quash the service of summons and Complaint effected on her at
the Haven Warner Center on March 9, 2023.
Plaintiffs have failed to oppose Defendant
Nguyen’s motion to quash, which is now before the Court.
 
Motion to Quash
Preliminary
Note
The
Court makes a dispositive ruling on this motion but notes that this motion is
directed at a pleading (the May 28, 2021 Complaint) that has been superseded by
Plaintiffs’ filing of the October 2, 2023 FAC. Moreover, any service of the FAC
on Defendant Nguyen is not affected by this ruling. A new motion to quash would
need to be filed.
Timeliness
A
motion to quash service of summons must be filed and served “on or before the
last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court
may for good cause allow.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a).)
Here,
the time “to plead” was the time to answer the Complaint, which was 30 days
after service on March 9, 2023. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 430.40, subd. (a).) This
motion was made on August 9, 2023, i.e., more than 30 days after March 9, 2023.
Yet, because Defendant Nguyen argues that she was never properly served with
the summons and Complaint, the Court finds good cause to allow this motion to
be heard.
Legal
Standard
A
motion to quash can be brought on the ground that the court lacks personal
jurisdiction over the defendant, e.g., because service was improper. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1); see, e.g., Tresway Aero, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1971) 5 Cal.3d 431, 433 [defendant filed motion to quash on
ground that service on corporation was defective because it did not comply with
Code Civ. Proc., § 410, now § 412.30]; County of Riverside v. Superior Court
(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 443, 446 [defendant filed motion to quash on ground that
service was defective because summons did not specify date for answering and
appearing].)
The
defendant should attach evidence to support its motion. (See School Dist. of
Okaloosa Cty. v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1126, 1131 [defendant
must present some admissible evidence in form of affidavits or declarations to
place issue of lack of jurisdiction before court]; see, e.g., Aquila, Inc.
v. Superior Court (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 556, 563 [defendant supported
motion to quash with declarations]; cf. Floveyor Int’l v. Superior Court
(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 793-794 [“‘A defendant who takes the position that
the service of summons as made upon him did not bring him within the
jurisdiction of the court’[] may serve and file a notice of motion to quash the
service,’” where “‘the effect of such a notice is to place upon the plaintiff
the burden of proving the facts that did give the court jurisdiction … [or] the
facts requisite to a[] [showing of] effective service,’” citations omitted].)
Order
Quashing Summons: GRANTED.
In
her motion, Defendant Nguyen moves to quash the service of summons and
Complaint effected on her on the grounds that service was made at the Haven
Warner Center on March 9, 2023 under circumstances where Defendant Nguyen has
not worked for FPI since March 28, 2020 and was not physically present at the
Haven Warner Center on that day. Defendant Nguyen also argues that she has not
been personally served or served by substituted service at an appropriate
location. (Mot., pp. 3-4.)
In
support, Defendant Nguyen provides a sworn declaration advancing these grounds
for quashing service on her. (Mot., Nguyen Decl., ¶¶ 1-7.)
Plaintiffs
have failed to oppose this motion and its arguments.
The
Court finds in favor of Defendant Nguyen.
Defendant
Nguyen has provided evidence to show that, on March 9, 2023, a process server
effected service of the summons, Complaint, and other documents at a location—the
Haven Warner Center—where Defendant Nguyen was not present and did not work.
Moreover,
this motion is unopposed, lending merit to it. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1342 [“The failure of the opposing party to serve and file a written
opposition may be construed by the court as an admission that the motion is
meritorious, and the court may grant the motion without a hearing on the
merits”]; Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410
[“The rule [inferring merit in unopposed motions] seems to apply only when a
party has not filed any written opposition”].) 
Defendant
Nguyen’s motion is thus GRANTED. 

Conclusion
Defendant Lisa Nguyen’s Motion to
Quash Service of Summons and Complaint is GRANTED.
The March 9, 2023 service of the
summons and Complaint on Defendant Lisa Nguyen is QUASHED.
