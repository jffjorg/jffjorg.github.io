Cross-Defendant Aidee Jacqueline Tinoco Bucio’s Motion to
  Compel Cross-Complainant Khowsrow Benji’s Response to Request for Statement
  of Damages; and
Cross-Defendant Aidee Jacqueline Tinoco Bucio’s Request
  for Sanctions Against Defendant and Counsel of Record Bent Caryl & Kroll,
  LLP in the Amount of $1,190.00.



 
I. Background
On February 26, 2024,
Cross-Complainant Khowsrow Benji filed and served a Cross-Complaint in this
action suing Cross-Defendant Aidee Jacqueline Tinoco Bucio (Tinoco Bucio)
and Roes 1 through 5 based on claims of (1) Negligence, (2) Assault, (3)
Battery, (4) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED), and (5)
Physical Elder Abuse.
On March 15, 2024, Cross-Defendant
Tinoco Bucio served a request for statement of damages on Khowsrow
Benji.
Khowsrow Benji’s
response to the request was due on April 3, 2024.
On April 4, 2024, based
on Khowsrow Benji’s nonresponse, Cross-Defendant Tinoco Bucio filed a motion to
compel a response to Cross-Defendant Tinoco Bucio’s request for a statement of
damages. The motion also seeks sanctions pursuant to the Discovery Act against
Khowsrow Benji and counsel.
That same day, Khowsrow
Benji served a response to Cross-Defendant Tinoco Bucio’s request for a
statement of damages.
On May 31, 2024,
Khowsrow Benji filed and served an opposition to Cross-Defendant Tinoco Bucio’s
motion. The opposition was filed one court day late.
On June 3, 2024, Cross-Defendant
Tinoco Bucio filed a reply to Khowsrow Benji’s opposition.
Cross-Defendant Tinoco
Bucio’s motion is now before the Court.
 
II. Reply Request to Not Consider Untimely Opposition:
DENIED.
A. Legal Standard
The principal purpose of the
requirement to file and serve a notice of motion a specified number of days
before the hearing is to provide the opposing party with adequate time to
prepare an opposition. That purpose is served if the party appears at the hearing,
opposes the motion on the merits, and was not prejudiced in preparing an
opposition by the untimely notice. Consequently, a party who appears at the
hearing on a motion and contests the motion on the merits without objecting to
a defect or irregularity in the notice of motion, including the failure to
serve a notice of motion the prescribed number of days before the hearing,
ordinarily is deemed to waive the defect or irregularity. (Arambula v. Union
Carbide Corp. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 333, 343.)
Even when
the opposing party does expressly object to inadequate notice but then opposes
the motion on the merits, the issue of defective notice may be waived unless
the opposing party makes a request for a continuance or demonstrates prejudice
from the defective notice. (Carlton v. Quint (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 690, 697 (Carlton);
Reedy v. Bussell (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1288 (Reedy); see
also Robinson v. Woods (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1264 [When a party only “respond[s] to [a]
[late-served] motion by filing a written opposition containing only the notice
objections and never argue[s] the merits,” no waiver occurs, such that the
objecting party need “not … [even] claim or show prejudice [to object to the
late-served motion] because the[] [plaintiffs] did not address the merits [of
the motion], in writing or otherwise”]; contra. Boyle v. CertainTeed Corp.
(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 645, 650 [“A party’s participation in a hearing after
the party’s objection to the hearing as unauthorized does not constitute waiver
by acquiescence”].)

B. Analysis
The Court DENIES Cross-Defendant
Tinoco Bucio’s reply argument that the Court should not consider the opposition
filed by Khowsrow Benji because it was filed one court day late and has
allegedly prejudiced Cross-Defendant Tinoco Bucio.
The Court relies on Carlton
and Reedy for its determination. Simply, the reply does not sufficiently
demonstrate that prejudice arises from service of the opposition one court day
late. Cross-Defendant Tinoco Bucio is correct in arguing that the opposition
should have been filed on May 30, 2024, nine court days before the hearing,
rather than on May 31, 2024, eight court days before the hearing. However,
Cross-Defendant Tinoco Bucio alleges undue prejudice based on insufficient time
to adequately research, prepare, and file a responsive reply brief. (Reply, p.
2.) This contention is belied by the reply’s points and authorities discussing
the arguments raised in the opposition on the merits. The Court thus proceeds
with a full analysis of the papers filed with the Court.
 
III. Motion to Compel Response to
Statement of Damages:
MOOT.
A.
Legal Standard
A
defendant or cross-defendant that wants to know the nature and amount of
damages the plaintiff is seeking may at any time serve a written request for
that information on the plaintiff. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.11, subd. (b).)
The
plaintiff must serve a responsive statement within 15 days. (Code Civ. Proc., §
425.11, subd. (b).)
If
the plaintiff fails to serve any statement of damages within 15 days after
service of the defendant’s request, the defendant may, on noticed motion,
obtain an order compelling the plaintiff to serve a statement. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 425.11, subd. (b).)
B.
Analysis

The purpose of Cross-Defendant
Tinoco Bucio’s motion was to compel a response to the request for statement of
statement of damages that she served on Cross-Complainant Khowsrow Benji on
March 15, 2024, via email. (Mot., pp. 2, 3; Mot., Akhavan Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.)
The parties’ papers do not dispute
that service of the response was due on April 3, 2024, but served on April 4,
2024. (Opp’n, p. 2 & Opp’n, Kroll Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. 1; Reply, p. 4 [“It was
not until April 4, 2024[] that Cross-Complainant [Khowsrow Benji] served his
statement of damages”].)
The reply does not challenge the
April 4th response on the ground that the response is inadequate. (See Reply,
pp. 2-4.)
Accordingly, the
Court determines that Cross-Defendant Tinoco Bucio’s motion is MOOT.
 
IV. Request for Sanctions:
DENIED.
A. Legal Standard
Monetary discovery sanctions may be
imposed under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 only to the extent
authorized by another provision of the Discovery Act, where Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010 describes conduct that is a misuse of the discovery
process but does not authorize the imposition of sanctions. (City of Los
Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (Oct. 20, 2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466,
475.)
California Civil Discovery Act is
contained in Code of Civil Procedure sections 2016.010 to 2036.050. 
B. Analysis
The Court DENIES the request for
sanctions.
Here, Cross-Defendant Tinoco
Bucio’s request for sanctions is premised on Code of Civil Procedure sections
2023.010, 2023.030, and 2030.290. (Mot., pp. 2, 4.)
However, PricewaterhouseCoopers
has made clear that sanctions pursuant to the Discovery Act must be tied to
another provision of the Discovery Act, and section 425.11 of the Code of Civil
Procedure is not a statutory section in the Discovery Act.
Moreover, the Court notes that Argame
v. Werasophon (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 616, 618, fn. 3 (Argame) is
distinguishable.
First, the footnote relied on by
Cross-Defendant Tinoco Bucio is dicta because it simply noted that the trial
court could have imposed sanctions for the conduct at issue in that case. (Ibid.
[“… Considering counsel’s disregard for the requirements of section 425.11
displayed here, the court would have been justified in requiring Argame (or
more appropriately her counsel) to reimburse defendants for costs incurred in
making such a motion”].) For this reason, the cited footnote in Argame
is, at most, a dictum that has no force as precedent and is not binding on this
Court. (Katie V. v. Superior Court (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 586, 598 [“Dicta,
of course, is not binding authority”]; People v. Linwood (2003) 105
Cal.App.4th 59, 69 [“Dictum has no force as precedent”], citing Ginns
v. Savage (1964) 61 Cal.2d 520, 524, fn. 2.)
Second, even had the Court
considered monetary sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
pursuant to the Court’s inherent authority to make case-specific orders with
due notice given, or pursuant to some other applicable authority, the circumstances
before the Court would not have merited sanctions. The response to the
statement of damages was served one day late based on a 15-day timeframe. While
this is the second time the Court discusses a one-day delay by Khowsrow Benji
(see Section II above), again, the Court finds insufficient prejudice arose
from this late service to merit the relief requested—here, sanctions.
For these reasons, Cross-Defendant
Tinoco Bucio’s request for sanctions is DENIED.

Cross-Defendant Aidee Jacqueline
Tinoco Bucio’s Motion to Compel Cross-Complainant Khowsrow Benji’s Response to
