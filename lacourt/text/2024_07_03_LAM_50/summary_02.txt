And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, addressing two key issues. Firstly, the Court notes that the Plaintiff's counsel filed and served supplemental declarations on June 18, 2024, which is after the 16-day deadline for filing and serving supporting papers. The Court also notes that the supplemental declarations were served via electronic mail, which extends the deadline by two court days. However, the Court declines to consider the untimely supplemental declarations as Plaintiff does not appear to have been authorized to file them. Secondly, the Court notes that the Plaintiff's evidentiary objections are misnumbered. Overall, the Court's tentative ruling aims to ensure that the hearing on July 3, 2024, is conducted fairly and in accordance with the law.
