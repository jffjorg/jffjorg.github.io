And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Tia Shipman's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The proposed amended complaint adds a second cause of action for statutory misappropriation of likeness and new factual allegations. The judge finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause to file the proposed amended complaint, despite Defendant Tamara Mellon Brand, Inc.'s opposition. The judge orders Plaintiff to file and serve the amended complaint within 3 days of the date of the order. The judge also notes that there is time to conduct discovery regarding the amended allegations, given the current trial date of March 5, 2025.
