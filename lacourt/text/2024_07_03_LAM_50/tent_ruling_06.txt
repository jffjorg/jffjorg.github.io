Briarwood Apartments (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1055, where the Court of Appeal noted that “[a]s long-standing authority
makes clear, punitive damages may be awarded in an action by a residential
tenant based on the landlord’s interference with peaceful possession. Punitive damages likewise are
recoverable for retaliatory eviction and for the infliction of emotional
distress. Causes of action for forcible entry and detainer and for trespass
also support the award of exemplary damages.” (Internal quotations and
citations omitted.)
