[1]The Court notes that on June 18, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel filed and served via electronic mail untimely supplemental declarations
in support of the motions. The Court notes that “[u]nless otherwise ordered or specifically provided by law, all
moving and supporting papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court days
before the hearing.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1005, subd. (b).) Sixteen court days before the July 3, 2024 hearing is
June 10, 2024. In addition, “[a]ny period of notice, or any right or duty to do any act
or make any response within any period or on a date certain after the service
of the document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of
court, shall be extended after service by electronic means by two court days…” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).) Plaintiff does not appear to show that he was
authorized to file the supplemental declarations.¿Thus, the Court declines to
consider the untimely supplemental declarations. 
 


[2]The Court notes
that Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections are misnumbered.
