And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to provide further responses to requests for production of documents. The judge finds that the requests are overbroad, seek information protected by the right of privacy, and that the burden and expense of the requested discovery outweighs the potential benefit. The judge cites California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2017.010, 2017.020, 2031.310, subdivision (a)(3) in support of the ruling. The defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
