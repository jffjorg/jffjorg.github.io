Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion for determination of good faith settlement brought by defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The motion was joined by plaintiff Felisa Dee Richards on January 3, 2024. The court has considered the moving, joinder, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with the motion and has granted the request for judicial notice.

The court has evaluated the settlement agreement based on the Tech-Bilt factors and finds that the agreement was made in good faith. The court has noted that the settlement amount of $400,000 is proportional to the approximate amount that plaintiff could have recovered at trial, and that the agreement was reached following arms-length negotiations during a mediation with third party Richard Copeland.

The court has also considered the contention that the settlement was the result of collusion, but finds that the language quoted from the original settlement agreement does not show the existence of collusion. The court has also noted that the settlement agreement was revised to exclude objectionable language.

Based on its findings, the court grants defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.'s motion for determination of good faith settlement and orders that all other joint tortfeasors or co-obligors are barred from any further claims against defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.
