[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses to requests for production
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Juan M. Ramirez      
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District (sued as John Doe
1)
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Juan M. Ramirez (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order compelling
defendant Los Angeles Unified School District (sued as John Doe 1)
(“Defendant”) to serve further responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production
of Documents, numbers 4 and 22.
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 4 and 22 because Defendant’s
objections in those responses are not without merit since (1) the requests are
overbroad since they call for the production of information that is neither
relevant to the subject matter of the action nor reasonably calculated to lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence, (2) the requests seek information that
is protected by the right of privacy of persons who are not parties to this
action, and (3) the burden and expense of the requested discovery clearly
outweighs the likelihood that the information sought will lead to the discovery
of admissible evidence.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2017.010, 2017.020, 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Zenaidi Decl.,
¶¶ 4, 6-8.)
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Juan M.
Ramirez’s motion to compel further responses to requests for production of
documents. 
The court orders defendant Los
Angeles Unified School District to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
