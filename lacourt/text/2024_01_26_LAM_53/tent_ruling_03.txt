[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses to special amended interrogatories



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Billy Earley  
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Amended Interrogatories
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Billy Earley (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1)
compelling defendants Keith Landrum and Landrum Law Firm LLP (“Defendants”) to
serve further responses to Plaintiff’s Special Amended Interrogatories, Set
One, numbers 1-30, and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendants in the amount of $3,000.
The court finds that Plaintiff did not comply with California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345. 
“Any motion involving the content of a discovery request or the
responses to such a request must be accompanied by a separate statement.  The motions that require a separate statement
include a motion: [¶¶] (2) To compel further responses to
interrogatories[.]”  (Cal. Rules of Ct.,
rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(2).)  Plaintiff
did not file with the court and serve on Defendants a separate statement in
support of the pending motion.  Thus, the
court finds that Plaintiff has not complied with California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1345. 
The court exercises its discretion to deny Plaintiff’s motion for the
failure to file a separate statement as required.  (Mills v. U.S. Bank (2008) 166
Cal.App.4th 871, 893 [trial court has discretion to deny a discovery motion for
failure to comply with separate statement requirement].) 
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Billy
Earley’s motion to compel further responses to special amended interrogatories.

            The court orders defendants Keith
Landrum and Landrum Law Firm LLP to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
