            Defendants’ request for judicial
notice is granted pursuant to Evidence Code Section 452(d).
 
            Demurrer

A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v.
Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In testing the sufficiency of the complaint,
the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The Court may not
consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.App.4th
634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the
plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish
every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.
 (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County
of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
Sufficient facts are the essential facts
of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently
specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his
cause of action.”  (Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.)  "Whether the plaintiff will be able to
prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer."  (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)  Under Code
Civil Procedure § 430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is
“uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a
complaint’s factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently
apprise a defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
Defendants demur to the entire SAC and
each cause of action pursuant to CCP § 430.10(a)(e) and (f) on the grounds that
the Court lacks jurisdiction over this matter, that the causes of action fail
to state sufficient facts, and that the SAC is uncertain.
First, Defendants demur to the entire SAC
on the grounds that the Court lacks jurisdiction because a prior unlawful
detainer judgment acts as collateral estoppel to bar the causes of action of
the instant SAC. The Court has taken judicial notice of the Complaint, Answer,
and Judgment in Case No. 20IWUD00738.
An unlawful detainer action is a
special limited summary proceeding limited to the issue of the right to
possession. As such, the parties cannot raise extrinsic issues and are
generally limited in the issues that they can litigate. Thus, usually, the judgment
in the unlawful detainer action does not have a res judicata effect on any
issue other than one that was necessarily litigated to determine the right of
possession. “[T]he critical question is whether or not the unlawful detainer
defendant has had adequate opportunity to present his case.” Gonzales v. Gem
Properties, Inc. (1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 1029, 1036. In some circumstances,
the unlawful detainer judgment does bar a subsequent action by the parties. Any
issue that was necessarily litigated in the unlawful detainer to resolve the
issue of the right to possession cannot be raised in any subsequent action
between the parties. “The party asserting issue preclusion bears the burden of
establishing these requirements.” Needelman v. DeWolf Realty Co., Inc.
(2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 750, 757. The unlawful detainer judgment may be barred
by res judicata on issues that were not necessary to the issue of possession
when the issue is raised in the proceedings without objection and fully
litigated by the parties.  Vella v.
Hudgins (1977) 20 Cal. 3d 251, 256–57.
Here, a review of the UD
Complaint, Answer, and Judgment does not reveal, at least for purposes of the
instant demurrer, a complete bar to the causes of action based on principles of
collateral estoppel and res judicata. First, the Court notes that the UD
Judgment was entered only in favor of Clay Claudino and Lee Marie Claudino,
Trustees of the Clay and Lee Claudino Living Trust Dated November 2, 2007.
Defendants have failed to establish, at this time, that the other two
Defendants named in the Complaint can utilize the principles of collateral
estoppel and res judicata in their favor.  Second, a review of the UD Judgment only
reflects a discussion of issues involving Newton’s alleged maintenance of a
nuisance by placing undue restrictions on the asbestos abatement efforts. As
the parties are probably aware, there are a multitude of issues that are
alleged in the instant Complaint which are not addressed at all in the UD
Judgment. The Court declines to dismiss the action or sustain the demurrer, at
this time, based on principles of collateral estoppel and res judicata.
However, the Court sustains the
demurrer based on uncertainty. The attached lease reflects the parties to the
lease as Plaintiff and Defendant Clay Claudino. Yet, throughout the SAC,
Plaintiff repeatedly refers to “Defendant” and “Defendants” without any
delineation as to which Defendant or Defendants that she is referring to. In
addition, it is entirely unclear the bases for liability as to Defendants Clay
Claudino and Lee Marie Claudino, Trustees of the Clay and Lee Claudino Living
Trust Dated November 2, 2007 and Lee Marie Claudino, individually, as again, as
noted above, these parties are not mentioned in the lease, at all. 
While Defendants made specific
arguments, in this regard, related to the Fraud and IIED causes of action, this
defect permeates every cause of action. For example, to state a cause of action
for fraud, Plaintiff must state facts which “show how, when, where, to whom,
and by what means the representations were tendered.”  Lazar
v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645. Plaintiff’s constant
referrals to “Defendants” and “Defendant” lack the requisite specificity as to
who made the alleged representations.
 The Court notes that uncertainty as a ground
raised in the demurrer to every cause of action. Thus, the demurrer to the SAC
is sustained with 20 days leave to amend on the ground of uncertainty.
            Motion to
Strike  
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any
time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.  CCP § 436(a). 
The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of
the court.  CCP § 436(b).  The grounds for a motion to strike are that
the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or
filed in conformity with laws.  CCP §
436.  The grounds for moving to strike
must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.  CCP § 437.
 
Defendants’ motion to strike is deemed
moot pursuant to the Court’s ruling sustaining the demurrer to the entire SAC.
 
Defendants are ordered to give notice of
this ruling.
