And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) with 20 days leave to amend on the ground of uncertainty. The demurrer was filed by the defendants, Clay Claudino, et al., and alleged that the complaint lacks jurisdiction, fails to state sufficient facts, and is uncertain. The judge also declined to dismiss the action or sustain the demurrer based on principles of collateral estoppel and res judicata.

The judge found that the complaint's factual allegations are confusing and do not sufficiently apprise the defendants of the issues they are being asked to meet. Specifically, the complaint repeatedly refers to "defendants" without distinguishing between the individual defendants, and fails to specify the bases for liability against certain defendants.

The judge also noted that the unlawful detainer judgment entered in a prior case does not bar the causes of action in this case, as the issues raised in the complaint were not necessarily litigated in the unlawful detainer action.

The judge deemed the defendants' motion to strike Portions of the Second Amended Complaint moot, as the demurrer was sustained and the Second Amended Complaint was deemed uncertain.

The judge ordered the defendants to give notice of this ruling, and the plaintiff has 20 days to amend the complaint to address the uncertainty.
