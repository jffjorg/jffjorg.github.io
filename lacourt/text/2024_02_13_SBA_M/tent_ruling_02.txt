PROCEEDINGS
 
VAM
Manchester LLC v. Keith Richmond, et al.   
23TRCV04043
1.      Stone & Sallus LLP’s Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel for Plaintiff VAM Manchester LLC  
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Stone & Sallus LLP’s Motion to
be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff VAM Manchester LLC is granted.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on December 4, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. This is a commercial unlawful detainer action
regarding property located at 2614 W. Manchester Blvd., Inglewood, CA 90305.  
 
Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel
 
Counsel
states, in the declaration, valid reasons for withdrawal. Counsel states that
there has been a complete breakdown in the relationship of the parties. The
Court finds that the attorney has filed and served upon the client a
declaration.  The Court also finds that
the attorney has shown sufficient reasons why the motion to be relieved as
counsel should be granted and why the attorney brought a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure § 284(2) instead of filing a consent under section 284(1). The
Court finds that the attorney served the proposed order upon the client and all
parties as required by Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362(d)(1).
 
Therefore, the
motion to be relieved as counsel is granted.
 
The attorney is
relieved as counsel of record for the client effective upon the filing of the
proof of service of the signed order upon the client. 
 

Stone & Sallus LLP is ordered to give notice of
the Court’s ruling.
