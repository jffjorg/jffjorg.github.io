The plaintiffs failed to provide responses to the discovery requests, despite several extensions of the deadline. The judge has ordered the plaintiffs to provide code-compliant responses within 60 days and has also ordered the plaintiffs to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $748.91 and $2,817.82, respectively. The judge has also warned that if the plaintiffs fail to provide responses by the deadline, the defendant may seek terminating sanctions.
