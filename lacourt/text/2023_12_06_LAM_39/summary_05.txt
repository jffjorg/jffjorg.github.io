And here is the English summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Mercury Insurance Company against Elaine Johnson, the plaintiff. The judge sustains the demurrer to the declaratory relief claim, agreeing with the defendant that a declaratory relief action is inappropriate when a plaintiff has an adequate remedy on other causes of action at trial. The judge also grants the motion to strike the prayers for punitive damages and attorneys' fees, finding that the plaintiff's allegations do not support a claim for punitive damages and that the prayer for attorneys' fees is not supported by any contractual or statutory basis. The judge orders the defendant to file an answer within 30 days and sets a hearing on an order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed against the plaintiff and/or plaintiff's counsel for failing to serve Mercury Insurance Company.
