And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled on the motion to set aside defaults and default judgment. The Court has granted the motion to continue the hearing on the motion to vacate default/default judgment to February 2, 2024, and ordered the defendants' counsel to file and serve the motion sufficiently in advance to provide statutory notice. The Court has also continued the case management conference to the same date and time as the hearing.

Furthermore, the Court has noticed its own motion for reconsideration of its order of October 31, 2023, due to the defendants' failure to file a motion to vacate the defaults and default judgment. The Court will hear its own motion for reconsideration on February 2, 2024, and the defendants' counsel may file an opposition and the plaintiff's counsel may file a reply based on statutory deadlines.

The Court has warned that if the defendants do not file a motion to vacate their defaults/default judgments, the Court will vacate its order of October 31, 2023, and permit the plaintiff's counsel to seek to enforce the default judgment.
