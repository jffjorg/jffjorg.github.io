 Case Number:  22STCV16831    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2023    Dept:  39 Original Balboa
Caregivers, Inc. v. Michael Moussa Yedidsion, et al.
Case No.
22STCV16831
Minute Order
 
            Defendants
filed a motion for protective order and a motion to disqualify Plaintiff’s
counsel, which originally was noticed for hearing on March 7, 2024.  On November 9, 2023, the Court granted
Defendants’ ex parte application and advanced the hearing to December 1,
2023.  The Court was unexpectedly dark
that date due to a death in the family, so Judge Gail Killefer continued the
hearing to December 6, 2023.  Now, the
Court continues the hearing to its first available hearing date: January 30, 2024, at
8:30 a.m.  
 
            The Court
posted a tentative order in advance of the hearing indicating that it intends
to stay this case pending the Court’s decision on the motion.  The Court held a hearing on the matter on
December 6, 2023, and afforded the parties an opportunity to be heard.  Following the hearing, the Court ordered that
the case shall be stayed in its entirety until the Court decides the instant
motion.
 
            Defendants’
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.
