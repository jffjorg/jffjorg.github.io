Case No.
20STCV25795
Motions to Compel
 
NOTICE:  The Court advances the motions to compel from
December 7, 2023, to December 6, 2023, at 8:30 a.m., and shall hear all the
motions on the same date/time.
 
Defendant Sirudang, Inc.
(“Defendant”) filed motions to compel responses to Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One (“RPDs”) from Plaintiffs San Joong Kim and Suk Kyung Yun, as
well as a motion to compel responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, from
Plaintiff Suk Kyung Yun.  The discovery
requests were served on March 23, 2023. 
(See Declaration of James K. Beck, ¶ 3.) 
Plaintiffs failed to provide responses by the deadline.  (Id., ¶ 4.) 
Defendants’ counsel extended the deadline to June 26, 2023, “without any
objections.”  (Id., ¶ 5 & Exh.
#3.)  Defendant’s counsel again extended
the deadline to July 27, 2023, but Plaintiffs did not provide responses.  (Id., ¶ 6.) 
Plaintiffs’ counsel indicated that he would be withdrawing from the
case.  (Ibid.)  On August 16, 2023, Plaintiffs filed
substitution of counsel forms to represent themselves.  Defendant’s counsel filed the instant motions
on August 22, 2023, and Plaintiffs’ new counsel filed substitution of counsel
forms on September 18, 2023.  
 
Plaintiffs filed oppositions on
November 28, 2023.  The oppositions do
not explain why they did not comply with their discovery obligations between
September 18, 2023, and November 28, 2023. 
Instead, the oppositions argue that Defendant’s counsel failed to
sufficiently meet-and-confer before filing these motions.  The Court disagrees.  Defendants’ counsel made ample efforts to
attempt to resolve these issues without a motion, and Plaintiffs simply failed
to comply with their discovery obligations for over seven months.
 
Based upon the foregoing, the Court
orders as follows:
 
1.         Defendant’s
motions to compel are granted.
 
2.         Plaintiffs
shall provide code-compliant responses, without objections, in 60 days.
 
3.         The
Court finds that Plaintiffs have abused the discovery process, warranting
sanctions.  The Court orders as follows:
(a) Plaintiff San Joong Kim shall pay Defendant monetary sanctions in the
amount of $748.91 within 60 days; and (b) Plaintiff Suk Kyung Yun shall pay
Defendant monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,817.82 within 60 days.  
 
4.         If
Plaintiffs fail to provide code-compliant responses by the deadline, absent
good cause, Defendant may notice any motion for terminating sanctions for
hearing on March 18, 2023, at 8:30 a.m.
 
5.         Defendant’s
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.
