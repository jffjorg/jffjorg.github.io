And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting plaintiff Gerardo Garcia's motion for approval of a settlement under the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA). The proposed settlement is fair and reasonable, and the court will sign the proposed order and judgment submitted by plaintiff. The settlement was reached at mediation, and plaintiff's counsel spent over 300 hours investigating and litigating the case. The gross PAGA settlement amount of $1,200,000 represents a fair compromise, and allocating 33% of the gross settlement fund to attorney fees is typical and fair based on the lodestar.
