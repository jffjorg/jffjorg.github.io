And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses two matters: (1) petitions for approval of compromise of claim or action for minors Ashairel Aguirre, Axel Aguirre, and Fredy Aguirre, and (2) a motion for determination of good faith settlement by defendants Judith Sixtos and Jesus Sixtos.

Regarding the first matter, the judge denies the petitions without prejudice due to two reasons: (1) the manner of distributing funds to each minor claimant is not permitted under the law, and (2) the proposed orders approving the compromises were not submitted on mandatory Judicial Council form MC-351.

Regarding the second matter, the judge grants the motion for determination of good faith settlement. The settling defendants have shown proof of service on all parties who have appeared in this action, and the judge finds that the settlement was made in good faith. The judge considered various factors, including the lack of collusion between the settling parties and the settlement amount appearing to be within the "reasonable range" of the settling party's proportionate share of comparative liability for a plaintiff's injuries. The judge also noted that selling the building two years before plaintiffs filed this action significantly reduces Judith Sixtos and Jesus Sixtos's proportionate share of liability.
