Summary:

The judge finds that the receiver's authority should not be narrowed to prohibit ex parte communications, transfers of over $250,000 without prior court approval, or shareholder distributions without court approval. The judge also finds that the proposed supplemental order appointing receiver is unnecessary and overly broad, and that the receiver's motion for supplemental order appointing receiver is denied without prejudice.
