  Case Number:  22STCV05120    Hearing Date:   November 21, 2024    Dept:  52 Tentative Ruling:
            Plaintiff
Gerardo Garcia’s Motion for Approval of PAGA Settlement
Plaintiff
Gerardo Garcia moves for approval of settlement of this action under the
Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA). 
Labor
Code section 2699, subdivision (s)(2)
provides, “The superior court shall review and approve any settlement of any
civil action filed pursuant to” PAGA. 
Courts review and approve PAGA settlements to “ensur[e] that any
negotiated resolution is fair to those affected.”  (Williams v. Superior Court (2017)
3 Cal.5th 531, 549.)  
The
proposed settlement is fair and reasonable. 
Plaintiff is represented by experienced counsel, who investigated the
case and spent over 300 hours litigating. 
The parties reached the settlement at mediation before mediator Steven
G. Pearl.  (Majarian Decl., ¶ 6.)  The gross PAGA settlement amount of $1,200,000
represents a fair compromise.  Allocating
33% of the gross settlement fund to attorney fees is typical in PAGA settlements
and is fair based on the lodestar.  (See Laffitte
v. Robert Half Internat. Inc. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 505.)  
Plaintiff
Gerardo Garcia’s motion for an order approving the settlement of this
representative PAGA action is granted.  The court will sign the proposed order and
judgment plaintiff submitted.
