And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted with respect to the first cause of action, which alleges breach of contract, without leave to amend. The judge has found that the contract language is unambiguous and does not impose an obligation on Defendant to approve the installation of new playground equipment. The judge has also found that the second cause of action, which alleges breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, is not deficient and has denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to that cause of action. The judge has noted that the parties have met and conferred in person or by telephone, but has not found that the meet-and-confer process was insufficient. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff has not demonstrated how the complaint might be amended to cure the deficiency with respect to the first cause of action.
