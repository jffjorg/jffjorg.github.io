Here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Zelta Siley's motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The case involves a dispute between Plaintiff Charles Evans and Defendant Zelta Siley over a brick planter box and a tall block wall on Plaintiff's property. Defendant claims to have a prescriptive easement on the property and has torn down the planter box and built a new wall on Plaintiff's property. Plaintiff alleges that the new wall is a nuisance and has denied Defendant's claims.

The Judge has found that Defendant has not established undisputed facts that she has enjoyed continuous and uninterrupted use of the property for the statutory period of five years, as the new construction was only built in 2022 and has not been shown to have been in the same location as the original planter. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied.

The Judge has also found that Defendant's claims for injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and violation of Civil Code section 841 fail as they are derived from the cause of action to quiet title, which also fails. The case will proceed to the next stage, where the parties will have the opportunity to present further evidence and arguments.
