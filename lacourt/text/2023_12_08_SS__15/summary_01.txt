And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary adjudication filed by Autozone West LLC, a defendant in a case brought by Lorenzo Ruiz and Linda Ruiz. The motion was filed on September 25, 2023, but the Judge has determined that it was served late, giving the Plaintiffs only 74 days' notice instead of the required 75 days. The Judge has also found that the Defendant failed to comply with the trial setting order, which required electronic service by 5 p.m. on the day of service. As a result, the Judge has taken the motion off calendar and will not hear it. The Judge has also denied the Defendant's request to move the hearing date to late December, citing a lack of authority to do so.
