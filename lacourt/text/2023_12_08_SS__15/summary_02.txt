Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service of summons and a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. The plaintiff, Maria Lozano, alleges she developed mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos in products from the defendant, Cosmetic Specialties, Inc. The defendant argues that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over it because it is incorporated in New Jersey and has no connections to California. The plaintiff argues that the defendant has sufficient connections to California because it supplied talc to companies that manufactured products used by the plaintiff.

The court has denied the motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents because the plaintiff's requests are overbroad and seek documents that are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The court has also denied the motion to quash service of summons because the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendant.

The hearing on the motion to quash service of summons has been continued to January 24, 2023, and the parties are directed to file supplemental opposition and reply briefs according to the statutory schedule.
