  Case Number:  23GDCV00516    Hearing Date:   December 8, 2023    Dept:  15 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION
            On
September 25, 2023, Defendant Autozone West LLC filed and served a motion for
summary adjudication with a hearing date of December 8, 2023.  Plaintiffs Lorenzo Ruiz and Linda Ruiz filed
objections to the motion arguing it is untimely.
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (a) requires a party filing a
motion for summary adjudication to give “at least” 75 days’ notice.  The August 15, 2023 trial setting order in
this case set December 8, 2023 as the deadline for hearing motions for summary
judgment and set trial on December 11, 2023. 
(Trial Setting Order, ¶¶ 2, 26.) 
(Because the court is dark on December 11, 2023, the trial date was
recently continued to December 12, 2023.) 
While the trial setting order allows the parties to stipulate to shorten
the time for summary adjudication motions (ibid.), Plaintiffs and
Defendant did not stipulate to shorten the time on Defendant’s motion.
            Plaintiffs
argue that 75 days before December 8 was September 24, a Sunday.  (Objections at p. 3.)  To ensure that Plaintiffs had at least 75
days’ notice, Defendant needed to serve Plaintiffs by September 22.  By serving Plaintiffs on September 25,
Defendants gave Plaintiffs only 74 days’ notice.  Also, Defendant accomplished service on
September 25 at 6:08 p.m. (Rosenthal Decl., Ex. 3 at p. 1), but the trial
setting order requires electronic service by 5 p.m. for electronic service to
be equivalent to personal service on that day. 
(Trial Setting Order, ¶ 7.) 
Therefore Plaintiffs were technically served on September 26.
            Defendant
argues Plaintiffs failed to meet and confer on a stipulation to shorten the
notice period even though Plaintiffs gave other defendants shorter notice
periods.  However, Defendant cites no law
obligating Plaintiffs to consider giving Defendant a shorter notice
period.  Further, Defendant states it did
not ask for a shorter notice period until September 25, 2023, when the deadline
to file the motion had already passed. 
(Reply at p. 2.)
            Defendant
suggests the court has the authority to shorten the 75-day period, citing Carlton
v. Quint (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 690. 
In that case, the plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion for
summary judgment on the merits and thereby waived any alleged defect in the
service of the motion.  (Carlton,
supra, 77 Cal.App.4th at p. 697.) 
Here Plaintiffs did not file an opposition on the merits; they only
filed objections to the motion based on untimely service.  Further, the law is clear that “trial courts
do not have the authority to shorten the minimum notice period for summary
judgment hearings.”  (McMahon v.
Superior Court (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 112, 118.)
            Defendants
argue that because Plaintiffs have violated the trial setting order, Defendant
does not need to comply with the 75-day notice requirement.  (Reply at p. 5.)  Defendant cites no law that because
Plaintiffs served late deposition notices, Defendant can give less than 75 days’
notice.
            Finally,
Defendant contends the court can move the hearing date to late December to give
Plaintiffs time to file an opposition. 
(Reply at p. 6.)  This is not
possible for at least two reasons. 
First, trial is on December 12, 2023, and this is a preference
case.  Defendant does not cite any law
that a preference trial date can be continued because a defendant failed to
give adequate notice on a summary adjudication motion.  Second, when a court continues a summary adjudication
motion hearing date so that the moving party can give 75 days’ notice, the
notice period must “begin anew.”  (Robinson
v. Woods (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1268.)  The court cannot merely continue the hearing
date a few days to account for the few days missing from the notice
period.  Rather, it must continue the
hearing date 75 days or take the motion off calendar.  (Ibid.)  
            The
motion was served late.  The court cannot
start the 75-day notice period all over again because that would require
continuing the trial date for two and a half months, which the court cannot do
in a preference case.  Therefore, the
court takes the motion OFF CALENDAR.
            The
moving party is to give notice.
