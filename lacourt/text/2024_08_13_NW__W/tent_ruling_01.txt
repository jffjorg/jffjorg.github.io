BACKGROUND
 
This is a collections case. On December 22, 2020, Plaintiff
Discover Bank filed a complaint against Defendant Jemma Kerobyan for common
counts. On May 17, 2021, the clerk entered default judgment against Kerobyan in
the amount of $29,619.23. 
 
Kerobyan filed a claim of exemption on July 2, 2024 .
 
[Tentative] Ruling: CONTINUE
 
At a hearing on a claim of exemption, “the [judgment debtor]
has the burden of proof” in demonstrating that the property claimed exempt is
indeed exempt. (CCP §§ 703.520(b), 703.580(b), (c).) In meeting this burden,
the judgment debtor must establish the right by evidence or facts; an affidavit
which merely follows the language of the statute and states nothing more than
conclusions of law is insufficient.¿(Le Font v.¿Rankin¿(1959)¿167¿Cal.App.2d
433, 435.)
 
“Within 10 days after service of the notice of claim of
exemption, a judgment creditor who opposes the claim of exemption shall file
with the court a notice of opposition to the claim of exemption and a notice of
motion for an order determining the claim of exemption and shall file with the
levying officer a copy of the notice of opposition and a copy of the notice of
motion. Upon the filing of the copies of the notice of opposition and notice of
motion, the levying officer shall promptly file the claim of exemption with the
court.” (CCP § 703.550.)¿ 
 
Judgment Debtor Kerobyan seeks to claim exemptions from her
wage garnishment. Debtor Kerobyan submitted a financial statement, in which she
claims a total monthly income of $6,000.00. Of that $6,000.00, Kerobyan claims $2,500.00
for rent, $1,500.00 for food and household supplies, $500 for utilities and
telephone, $200 for clothes, $200 for school, $580 for transportation, $300 for
installment payments, $100 for laundry, and $200 for entertainment. 
 
Debtor Kerobyan fails to however include what the $300
installment payments are for or what is included in the $580 a month for
transportation. In meeting their burden, the judgment debtor must establish the
right by evidence or facts; an affidavit which merely follows the language of
the statute and states nothing more than conclusions of law is insufficient. (Le
Font, supra, 167 Cal.App.2d at p. 435.) 
 
The court nonetheless is inclined to grant partial relief,
but to allow wage garnishment of $115 twice a month.  The monthly amount set aside for
entertainment and unnamed “installment payments,” is not essential and should
give way to payment of this debt.
