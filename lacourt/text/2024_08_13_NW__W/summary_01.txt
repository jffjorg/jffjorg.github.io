And here is the summary in English text:

This is a collections case where Discover Bank is seeking to collect a debt of $29,619.23 from Jemma Kerobyan. On December 22, 2020, Discover Bank filed a complaint against Kerobyan, and on May 17, 2021, a default judgment was entered against her. On July 2, 2024, Kerobyan filed a claim of exemption. At a hearing on August 13, 2024, the court will consider the claim of exemption.

The court's tentative ruling is to continue the hearing and consider the claim of exemption. The judgment debtor, Kerobyan, has the burden of proof in demonstrating that the property claimed exempt is indeed exempt. She must establish the right by evidence or facts, not just by stating conclusions of law.

Kerobyan's financial statement shows a total monthly income of $6,000.00, with various expenses claimed for rent, food, utilities, clothes, school, transportation, installment payments, laundry, and entertainment. However, she fails to provide details on the $300 installment payments and $580 transportation expenses. The court is inclined to grant partial relief, but to allow wage garnishment of $115 twice a month, as the court believes that the expenses claimed for entertainment and unnamed "installment payments" are not essential and should give way to payment of the debt.
