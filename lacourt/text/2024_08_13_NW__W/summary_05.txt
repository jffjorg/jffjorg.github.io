And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint filed against Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. and Galpin Volkswagen is sustained, with leave to amend. The demurrer was filed by Galpin Volkswagen, which argues that the plaintiff's negligent repair claim is barred by the economic loss rule and fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge agrees, finding that the plaintiff's complaint does not allege any of the exceptions that lie to the rule and fails to provide specific facts to support the claim. The judge has given the plaintiff the opportunity to amend the complaint to address the deficiencies.
