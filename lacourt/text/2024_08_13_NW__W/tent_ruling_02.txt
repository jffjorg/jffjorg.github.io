BACKGROUND
 
On April 4, 2024, Plaintiff James Parker filed a complaint against
Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“LACMTA”)
and John Doe for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence. Plaintiff
alleges in August 2021, while operating his bicycle, a LACMTA bus came into
contact with Plaintiff after the LACMTA driver, John Doe, illegally crossed the
intersection. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority’s Motion to Compel Defense Neurological Examination of Plaintiff
James Parker is GRANTED. 
 
discussion
 
Defendant LACMTA
moves this court for an order compelling Plaintiff James Parker to appear,
without objection, for a defense neurological examination, pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 2032.220, at the offices of Edwin Amos, M.D., 2021
Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 525E, Santa Monica, CA 90404, on a date and time
earliest available to the doctor. Defendant LACMTA also asks this court to
impose sanctions on Plaintiff James Parker. 
 
Except for defense
physicals in personal injury cases (in which one examination is permitted as a
matter of course) and exams arranged by stipulation, a court order is required
for a physical or mental examination. Such order may be made only after notice
and hearing, and for “good cause shown.” 
(CCP §2032.320(a).)  
 
The examination will
be limited to whatever condition is “in controversy” in the action.  (CCP §2032.020(a).)  This means the examination must be directly
related to the specific injury or condition that is the subject of the
litigation.  (Roberts v. Superior
Court (1973) 9 Cal.3d 330, 337.)
 
Plaintiff previously
appeared for a medical examination with Defendant’s orthopedic expert, Kevin M.
Erhardt, M.D. (Cole Decl. ¶4.) Later at Plaintiff’s deposition Plaintiff
testified to prolonged memory loss. (Cole Decl. ¶5, Exh. B.) Thereafter, the
parties agreed for Plaintiff to attend a second defense examination with
neurologist Edwin Amos, M.D. for June 11, 2024. (Cole Decl. ¶6, Exhs. D, E.) Plaintiff
served no objections and on June 10, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel confirmed that
his client would attend the examination as noticed. (Cole Decl. ¶6, Exh. F.)
However, Plaintiff failed to appear for the appointment. (Cole Decl. ¶6.) Dr.
Amos submitted an invoice for his standard “no-show” fee of $750.00, which
LACMTA has paid. (Cole Decl., ¶6, Exh. G.) LACMTA contacted Plaintiff’s counsel
advising him on the no show and requested to reschedule the examination. (Cole
Decl. ¶6, Exh. H.) However, LACMTA has received no response. (Cole Decl. ¶6.) 
 
The court finds good
cause to compel the neurological examination of Plaintiff Parker. Mr. Parker
has claimed serious neurological injuries. Moreover, Mr. Parker originally
agreed to participate in the neurological examination yet chose not to appear.
Plaintiff did not file any opposition to the motion or otherwise dispute the
injuries claimed have necessitated an additional examination by a neurologist. 
 
Accordingly, the
Motion to Compel Defense Neurological Examination of Plaintiff James Parker is GRANTED.
