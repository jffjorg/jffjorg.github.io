And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to quash or modify a subpoena issued by the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District, to Netflix, Inc. The plaintiff, Jane Doe, is seeking to quash or modify the subpoena on the grounds that it is overly broad, seeks protected information, and is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The defendant argues that the subpoena is necessary to support their defense and that the information sought is relevant and discoverable.

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion, but has limited the scope of the subpoena to specific information, including performance reviews and evaluations, records of promotions, demotions, complaints, accolades, and awards, and records of attendance and absences (if any). The court has also stated that the parties can address concerns over privacy by way of a protective order.
