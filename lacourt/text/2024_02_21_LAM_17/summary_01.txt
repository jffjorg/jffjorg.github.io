And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to quash a deposition subpoena issued by the defendant. The plaintiff argued that the subpoena must be quashed because the majority of the documents sought from her brother, David Belasco, are protected by attorney-client privilege. However, the judge found that David Belasco was an inactive member of the California Bar during the relevant time period and therefore was not authorized to practice law. As a result, communications with him are not entitled to privilege protection. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to show that she was speaking with her brother in a professional capacity as his client and that she had a reasonable belief that her brother was eligible to practice law. Finally, the judge noted that the plaintiff failed to support her claims of work-product privilege and did not produce a privilege log to explain what was being withheld.
