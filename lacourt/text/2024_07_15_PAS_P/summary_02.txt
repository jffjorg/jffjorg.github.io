And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court granted Defendant XuenSong Guan's motion to deem the Requests for Admission (RFAs) admitted and awarded $1,500 in sanctions against Plaintiff Deeson Pan. The Defendant served the RFAs on January 23, 2024, and the time for Plaintiff to respond expired on February 22, 2024. However, Plaintiff failed to serve responses. Therefore, the Court granted the Defendant's motion to deem the RFAs admitted. The Court also granted the Defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,500, which is the reasonable amount of attorney's fees and costs incurred by the Defendant in connection with the motion.
