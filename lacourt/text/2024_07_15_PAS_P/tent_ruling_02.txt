I.         
INTRODUCTION
On
July 27, 2023, Plaintiff DEESON PAN (“Plaintiff’) filed a complaint against XUENSONG
GUAN (“Defendant”) alleging five causes of action for: 1) breach of contract,
2) constructive fraud, 3) negligent misrepresentation of facts, 4) unfair business
practice violations, 5) unfair competition related to Plaintiff’s ownership in
real property, located at 1420 S. Del Mar Ave, unit #6 San Gabriel, California
91776. On January 23, 2024, Defendant served
Plaintiff by U.S. mail with Requests for Admission, with a deadline to respond
by February 22, 2024.  Plaintiff failed
to respond. (Declaration of James L. Andion, ¶ 3, Exh. A.) On April 29, 2024, Defendant filed the
instant motion asking the Court to deem the RFAs admitted.  To date, Plaintiff has not served responses
to the RFA request.  (Andion Decl., ¶ 5.)  Defendant also requests $1,500 in sanctions. 
Defendant
has not filed any opposition to the pending motion.
        II.         
LEGAL STANDARD
A.    Requests for Admission
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
(“Code Civ. Proc.”), section 2033.280(b), a “party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with section 2023.010).”  The court “shall” grant the
motion to deem requests for admission admitted “unless it finds that the party
to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that
is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2033.280(c).)
B.   
Mandatory Sanctions – Deem RFAs Admitted
            Sanctions are mandatory “on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response
to request for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.280(c).)
                   
III.         
            DISCUSSION
A.   
Request to be Deemed Admitted is Granted
                    Defendant
filed the pending motion requesting the Court order the truth of any matters specified in the RFAs be deemed admitted. On
January 23, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with copies of the RFAs. As
discussed above, the time for Plaintiff to serve timely responses expired
on February 23, 2023, and Plaintiff failed to serve responses as of the date Defendant filed the instant motion on April 29, 2024. (Andion Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.)  Accordingly, the Court grants the Defendant’s motion
to deem the RFAs admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).)
 B.   
The Requests for Monetary Sanctions is Granted
            Sanctions are mandatory
in connection with motions to compel responses to interrogatories and requests
for production of documents against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).) However, sanctions are not mandatory if
the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Id.) 
            Furthermore, regardless
of the reason for the delay in responding, monetary sanctions are mandatory
against a party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response
necessitated the filing of the deemed-admitted motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280(c).)
            Defendant’s
counsel, a California and Florida-licensed attorney, moves the Court to impose
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff in the total amount of $1,500.00 based his
hourly billing  rate of $350 being
applied to: (1) three hours to prepare the motion, (2) one and a half hours to prepare
for the hearing, travel to the hearing, and attend the hearing, and (3) parking
and the $60 filing fee.  (Andion Decl., ¶ 7.) 
            Defendant
is entitled to monetary sanctions for reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in
connection with the motions.  Plaintiff failed
to serve timely responses, necessitating the filing of the motions, and Plaintiff
has still not served responses. In addition, given the non-opposition by Plaintiff,
there is no evidence suggesting that Defendant acted withoutsubstantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanctions
unjust. 
Utilizing a lodestar
approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances including Plaintiff’s
lack of opposition, the Court finds the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s
fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending
motion is $1,500.  
            The Court grants Defendant’s request for monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff in the reduced total amount of $1,500.  
                      
II.         
CONCLUSION & ORDER The Court GRANTS Defendant’s Request to Deem Admitted by Plaintiff the
truth of any matters specified in the Requests for Admissions (Set One).The Court GRANTS Defendant’s Request for Monetary Sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $1,500,
which Plaintiff is to pay within thirty days of this order.
Defendant
is ordered to provide notice of this ruling. DATED:  July 15, 2024
