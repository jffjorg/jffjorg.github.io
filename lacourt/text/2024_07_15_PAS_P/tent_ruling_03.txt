 Case Number:  BC617479    Hearing Date:   July 15, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO TAX COSTS                        
I.         
INTRODUCTION
This action was filed on April 18, 2016, and
arises from a physical altercation. Plaintiffs Akop Torosian aka Jack Torosian,
Robert Torosian, Marina Fermanyan and Elda Madatyan filed eight causes of
action against Defendants Arutyun Fitilchyan, Hrachya Gasparyan, Armen
Tashjian, Armen Jermakyan, and Ashon Mkitaryan. The causes of action include:
1) assault and battery, 2) conspiracy to commit assault and battery, 3)
negligence, 4) loss of consortium, 5) abuse of process, 6) extortion and
blackmail, 7) conspiracy to commit extortion and blackmail, and 8) intentional
infliction of emotional distress.
Discovery in this matter has been stalled,
and on February 8, 2024, the Court granted a motion for terminating sanctions
in favor of Defendant Armen Tashjian’s (“Defendant”) as to Plaintiffs Akop
Torosian and Robert Torosian (“Plaintiff”) for failure to cooperate in a
court-ordered deposition. On March 8, 2024, Defendant’s counsel filed his
memorandum of costs seeking total costs of $15,724.29. Plaintiff filed this motion to tax costs on
April 8, 2024. Defendant filed an opposition on July 1, 2024, concurrently with
the declaration of Michel N. Hirota (“Hirota Decl.”). No reply has been filed. On
July 11, 2024, Defendant filed a notice of non-receipt of a reply to the
instant motion.
The motion to tax costs is DENIED.
                      
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD  
            CCP Section
1032 provides that a prevailing party may recover their costs. (CCP § 1032.) CCP
Section 1033.5(a) itemizes allowable costs; CCP Section 1033.5(b) itemizes
costs that are not allowed. Subsection (c) provides that costs shall be
necessary to the litigation and reasonable in amount, and that items of cost
not mentioned in the statute are recoverable in the court’s discretion.       
                   
III.         
ANALYSIS
            Plaintiff argues
that most of the costs set forth in the memorandum of costs are excessive,
unnecessary, and unrecoverable. Specifically, Plaintiff objects to the filing
fees, deposition costs, process server fees, service fees, copy fees, and
“other” fees.  Defendant argues that, as
prevailing party, he is entitled to his costs and that Plaintiff has failed to
meet his burden of proof because his motion offers no evidentiary support. 
The Court declines to strike these costs,
as they are either explicitly authorized by statute or reasonably necessary to
this litigation. Plaintiff objects to several categories of costs in the
memorandum of costs but advances no substantive arguments to tax them, only
broad, conclusory statements.  All the
named fees are recoverable under CCP Section 1033.5. (CCP § 1033.5(a)(1), (3), (4),
(8), (13), (14),(16).) The Court declines to strike these costs. Defendant has
provided additional supporting documentation in his opposition.
            Defendant argues
that Plaintiff bears the burden of proof and has submitted no evidence to overcome
that burden. The Court agrees.  Evidence
is generally required to support an objection, and the mere assertion of
conclusions or bare allegations typically does not justify taxing costs. (See County
of Kern v. Ginn (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1107) (bare allegation that
depositions were neither necessary nor reasonable insufficient to overcome
right to costs). Allegations are sufficient, however, if they depend upon
undisputed facts where nothing more needed to be, or could have been, added by
additional declarations or affidavits. (Fennessy v. Deleuw-Cather Corp.
(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1192, 1196.)
Here, there is a verified
memorandum of costs, so the burden of showing that the costs sought were not
reasonable or necessary was on Plaintiff.  Plaintiff only makes conclusory assertions and
offers no declarations or other evidence in support of his assertions.  Plaintiff’s failure to provide a declaration offers
the Court no evidence from which to consider Plaintiff’s claims. As discussed
above, Plaintiff has the burden of proof to show that the item of cost was not
reasonably necessary for the conduct of the litigation; mere conclusory
assertions are insufficient to rebut the prima facie showing costs are proper.
(See Jones, supra, 63 Cal.App.4th at 1266; County of Kern, supra, 146
Cal.App.3d at 1113-14.) Accordingly, the court finds that Plaintiff fails to
meet his burden of proof as to all costs.
            In sum, the
Court taxes $0. Costs are granted in the amount of $15,724.29.
                    
IV.         
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
            The Court denies
Plaintiff’s motion to tax costs. Costs are granted in the amount of $15,724.29.
            Counsel for
Defendant to give notice of this ruling.
