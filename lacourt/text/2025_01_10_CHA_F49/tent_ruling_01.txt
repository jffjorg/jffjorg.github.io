Eisenberg
RESPONDING PARTY: None.
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An order relieving Counsel Jason

TENTATIVE
RULING: The

BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from alleged personal injuries that
Plaintiff sustained as a result of a motor vehicle accident that occurred on September
5, 2021.
 
On August 15, 2023, Plaintiff Alondra Estrada (“Plaintiff” or “Estrada”) filed a Complaint against
Defendants Angela Llanos, Edella Rodriguez, and Does 1 to 25, alleging two
causes of action: (1) Motor Vehicle, and (2) General Negligence. 
 
On August 29, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel Jason Eisenberg (“Counsel”) filed the instant Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel (the “Motion”).
 
            No Opposition papers have been
received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
The court may
order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after
judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney and
after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284, subd. (2).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.) An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council
Forms MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).)
            In
addition, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subsection (d) requires that
the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on
the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case by personal
service, electronic service, or mail. If the notice is served by mail, it must
be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing that either:
            (A) The service address is the current residence or
business address of the client; or
(B)
The service address is the last known residence or business address of the
client and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after
making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the
motion to be relieved.
 
            (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(1)(A) & (2).)
 
Here, Counsel has filed Judicial Council Forms MC-051 and
MC-052. Counsel has also lodged Judicial Council Form MC-053 with the Court. 
 
Counsel has provided a
declaration stating that the Motion is necessitated by an “[i]rreconcilable
breakdown in the attorney/client relationship.” (MC-052, ¶ 2.) 
 
The Court finds Counsel’s reasons for seeking relief to be adequate.
Counsel states in his declaration that the Motion was served by mail at Plaintiff’s
last known address. (MC-052, ¶ 3a(2).) Additionally, Counsel declares that he
has been unable to confirm that the address is current or to locate a more
current address for Plaintiff after making the following efforts: mailing the
motion papers to Plaintiff’s last known address, return receipt requested, and
calling the client’s last known telephone number(s). (Id. ¶ 3b(2).)
 
Counsel indicates that a jury trial is not yet set. (MC-052,
¶ 6; MC-053, ¶ 9.) Additionally, the case records indicate that no future
hearings are currently scheduled.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff Alondra Estrada’s
counsel Jason Eisenberg’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED. 
 
Moving counsel to give notice.
