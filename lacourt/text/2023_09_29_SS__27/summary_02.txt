And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:
The Judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiffs' motion for summary adjudication in the case of Aram Dachian et al. v. Zhong Xin Du (Case No. 22STCV14528). The plaintiffs, Aram Dachian and Aram Dashyan, filed their motion on August 3, 2023, which is only 58 days before the hearing date, and 29 days before the trial date. The Judge found that the motion is procedurally defective, as it does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure, section 437c, which requires a minimum of 75 days' notice and a hearing no later than 30 days before the trial date. The Judge also noted that the plaintiffs did not request a separate order finding good cause to hear the motion within 30 days of the trial date, as required by Robinson v. Woods (2008). Therefore, the motion for summary adjudication is denied, and the moving party is ordered to give notice. The parties have the option to submit on the tentative ruling, but if they do not, the Court may adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
