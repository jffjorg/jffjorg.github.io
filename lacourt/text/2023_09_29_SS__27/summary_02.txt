And here is the English-text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for summary adjudication filed by Plaintiffs Aram Dachian and Aram Dashyan. The motion is procedurally defective because it was filed and served less than 75 days before the hearing date, and the hearing date is less than 30 days before the trial date. Additionally, the Plaintiffs did not request good cause for hearing within 30 days of the trial date. The Judge relies on Code of Civil Procedure, section 437c, and case law to support the ruling. The motion is denied, and the Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice.
