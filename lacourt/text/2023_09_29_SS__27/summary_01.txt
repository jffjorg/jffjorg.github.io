The court found "good cause" for the continuance, as the defendant is entitled to have their summary judgment motion heard before trial.  Since this is the second continuance request and no party opposed the motion, the court found no prejudice to any party.  The trial date was moved from January 17, 2024 to September 3, 2024. The Final Status Conference was also moved from January 3, 2024 to August 20, 2024.
