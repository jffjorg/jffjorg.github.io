MOTION
FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION



 
MOVING PARTY:                   Plaintiffs
Aram Dachian and Aram Dashyan
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
            On August
3, 2023, Plaintiffs, Aram Dachian and Aram Dashyan, filed this motion for
summary adjudication.  
 
            Plaintiffs’
motion is procedurally defective.  Code
of Civil Procedure, section 437c requires parties to serve notice of a motion
for summary judgment or summary adjudication and all supporting papers at least
75 days before the time appointed for hearing. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(2).) 
Further, the motion must be heard¿no later than 30 days before the date
of trial, unless the court for good cause orders otherwise.  (Code Civ. Proc., §  437c, subd. (a)(3).)  The trial court has no power to change the
notice and filing periods of section 437c. 
(Hernandez v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th, 285, 299.)   Here, Plaintiffs filed and served this motion
on August 3, 2023 which is only 58 days before the hearing date.  Moreover, the hearing date is only 29 days
before the trial date.  Even if
Plaintiffs had filed their motion at least 75 days before the hearing, Plaintiffs
have not requested before filing this motion that the Court make a
separate order finding good cause to hear this motion within 30 days of the
trial date.  (Robinson v. Woods (2008)
168 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1268 (holding it is an abuse of discretion to hear a summary
judgment motion within 30 days of the trial date without prior determination of
good cause.)
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion for summary adjudication
is DENIED.
 
Moving party to give notice.
