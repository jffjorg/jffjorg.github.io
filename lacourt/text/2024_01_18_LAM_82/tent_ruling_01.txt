Case:                           Warren E&P,
Inc. et al. v. City of Los Angeles et al. (23STCP00060)
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
The Motion for Leave to Intervene filed by Proposed
Intervenors Esperanza Community Housing Corporation, Center for Biological
Diversity, Communities for a Better Environment, Natural Resources Defense
Council, and Physicians for Social Responsibility – Los Angeles is DENIED. 
 
I.                  
BACKGROUND
 
This proceeding concerns the adoption of the Oil and Gas
Drilling Ordinance (“Oil Ordinance”) by the City of Los Angeles (“City”). Under
the Oil Ordinance, new or expanded oil and gas extraction is prohibited as a
nonconforming use in all zones within the City. With respect to existing oil
and gas extraction, such extraction shall be phased out during a twenty-year
amortization period. 
 
Petitioners Warren E&P, Inc., Warren Resources of
California, Inc., and Warren Resources, Inc. challenge the Oil Ordinance. 
 
Esperanza Community Housing Corporation, Center for
Biological Diversity, Communities for a Better Environment, Natural Resources
Defense Council, and Physicians for Social Responsibility – Los Angeles
(collectively, “Proposed Intervenors”) seek leave to intervene in the instant
writ proceeding. 
 
II.               
MANDATORY INTERVENTION
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 387(b), a nonparty may
intervene as a matter of right if the nonparty demonstrates: (1) it has an
interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the
action; (2) it is so situated that the disposition of the action may, as a
practical matter, impair or impede its ability to protect that interest; and
(3) its interests are not adequately represented by existing parties. (Siena
Court Homeowners Ass'n v. Green Valley Corp. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1416,
1423-1424.)
 
Proposed Intervenors fail to demonstrate that their
interests are not adequately represented by the City. “In the absence of a
‘very compelling showing to the contrary,’ it will be presumed that a state
adequately represents its citizens when the [proposed intervenor] shares the
same interest.” (Arakaki v. Cayetano (9th Cir. 2003) 324 F.3d 1078,
1086; see Edwards v. Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. (2018) 29
Cal.App.5th 725, 732 [in assessing requirements for mandatory intervention,
courts look to federal law for guidance].) Here, Proposed Intervenors and the
City share the same interest in defending against challenges to the Oil
Ordinance and the implementing ZA Documents. Indeed, as acknowledged by
Proposed Intervenors, the City has made clear its position that the Oil
Ordinance “advances the basic core principle of zoning in Los Angeles to
protect citizens’ health, safety, and welfare.” (Los Angeles City Department of
City Planning, Department of City Planning Recommendation Report at A-2 (Sep.
22, 2022) (Department of City Planning Report)
<https://planning.lacity.org/plndoc/Staff_Reports/2022/09-13-2022/CPC_2022_4864.pdf>.)
Proposed Intervenors similarly seek to protect the health, safety, and welfare of
communities impacted by urban drilling. (Cantor Decl. ¶¶ 5, 7-13; Clay Decl. ¶¶
7-9, 11; Hernandez Decl. ¶¶ 7, 9, 10, 14-16, 20, 21, 23-27; Nagami Decl.
¶¶ 6-8, 10, 19, 22; Kakoussian Decl. ¶¶ 9-11, 13, 22-24; Puvvula Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6,
7-14, 16; Robertson Decl. ¶¶ 4, 7, 14-21; Siegel Decl. ¶¶ 10, 13, 14, 15;
Uriarte Decl. ¶¶ 7, 10, 14, 18, 20, 23.) 
 
Proposed Intervenors argue that the City’s representation
may be inadequate because the City’s primary interest is in defending its
jurisdiction and authority and because the City must balance policy goals,
including resource constraints and expeditious resolution of litigation. Proposed
Intervenors also argue that, because claims attacking the Oil Ordinance have
statewide implications, they have an interest in resolving such claims in a
manner that does not discourage other municipalities from enacting similar
ordinances. Proposed Intervenors maintain the City does not share that
interest. 
 
Proposed Intervenors’ concerns are too speculative to
constitute a sufficiently compelling showing. Proposed Intervenors’ arguments
suggest that their litigation strategy may differ from the City because the
City may be more agreeable to settling or accepting a disposition due to resource
constraints or because the City is not concerned with how other municipalities handle
oil drilling concerns. “When a proposed intervenor has not alleged any
substantive disagreement between it and the existing parties to the suit, and
instead has vested its claim for intervention entirely upon a disagreement over
litigation strategy or legal tactics, courts have been hesitant to accord the
applicant full-party status.” (League of United Latin American Citizens v.
Wilson (9th Cir. 1997) 131 F.3d 1297, 1306.) How the City elects to resolve
the underlying litigation does not change the fact that the City shares
Proposed Intervenors’ interest in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of
communities impacted by oil drilling through enactment of the Oil Ordinance. Proposed
Intervenors’ showing is insufficient to demonstrate that the City may somehow
compromise this interest in its defense of the Oil Ordinance. 
 
For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Proposed Intervenors
do not have a mandatory right to intervene in the instant proceeding.  
 
III.            
PERMISSIVE INTERVENTION
 
A trial court has broad discretion to permit or deny
intervention. (Lippman v. City of Los Angeles (1991) 234 Cal.App.3d
1630, 1633, fn. 2.)  The Court considers
whether the applicant’s interests are already adequately represented in the
action, or whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the rights
of the original parties.  (Hausmann v.
Farmers Ins. Exchange (1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 611, 616.)  When “[p]resented with a motion for
intervention, the court must determine whether the intervenor has established
(1) it has a direct interest in the lawsuit; (2) intervention would not enlarge
the issues raised by the original parties; and (3) the intervenor would not
‘tread on the rights of the original parties to conduct their own lawsuit.’” (Bame
v. City of Del Mar (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1346, 1364.)  “The ‘interest,’ it has been said, must be of
such direct or immediate character that the intervener will either gain or lose
by the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment.” (Hausmann,
213 Cal.App.2d at 614.) 
 
For the reasons stated above, Proposed Intervenors fail to
demonstrate that they would not interfere in the City’s right to conduct its
own lawsuit. Proposed Intervenors demonstrate that they are not hesitant to
disagree with the City’s litigation strategy or legal tactics, even when such
strategy or tactics reasonably advance the interests that they share with the
City. The City is situated to assert the same interests as Proposed Intervenors
in this proceeding. Consequently, the Court exercises its discretion to deny
intervention.
 
IV.            
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is DENIED.
