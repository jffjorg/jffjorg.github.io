And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to have requests for admission deemed admitted. The plaintiff, Leslie Hernandez, moves the court to deem the requests for admission admitted as against the defendants, Jose Roberto Garnica Juarez and Lucky 7 GM Transportation Inc. The plaintiff seeks sanctions in the amount of $1,560.00.

The judge denies the motions due to lack of jurisdiction. The plaintiff's counsel failed to provide sufficient evidence that the defendants agreed in writing to an extension of the deadline for serving responses to the requests for admission. The 45-day limitation for serving responses is "jurisdictional" in the sense that it renders the court without authority to rule on the motion to compel further responses.

The judge notes that the relief sought by the plaintiff is erroneous, as the defendant's objections-only responses were not required to be verified. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's counsel failed to provide a concise outline of the discovery requests and each response in dispute, as required by the California Rules of Court.

The judge orders that the motions be denied and that the plaintiff take no further action in connection with the motions. The judge finds that the plaintiff's counsel failed to make a good faith attempt at an informal resolution of the issues presented by the motion, as required by the California Rules of Court.
