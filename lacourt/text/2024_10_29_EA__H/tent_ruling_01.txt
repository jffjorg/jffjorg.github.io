  Case Number:  24PSCV00539    Hearing Date:   October 29, 2024    Dept:  H   Hernandez  v. Juarez, et al., Case No. 24PSCV00539   ORDER ON MOTIONS TO HAVE REQUESTS   FOR ADMISSION DEEMED ADMITTED   1.        Plaintiff Leslie Hernandez’s Motion  to Have Request for Admissions, Set One, Deemed Admitted (i.e., as against  Defendant Jose Roberto Garnica Juarez) is DENIED for lack of jurisdiction. 2.        Plaintiff Leslie Hernandez’s Motion  to Have Request for Admissions, Set One, Deemed Admitted (i.e., as against  Defendant Lucky 7 GM Transportation Inc.) is DENIED for lack of  jurisdiction.     I.        Background  Plaintiff  Leslie Hernandez (“Plaintiff”) alleges that she sustained injuries and damages  in a May 14, 2022 motor vehicle accident.  On  February 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting motor vehicle and  general negligence causes of action against Jose Roberto Garnica Juarez  (“Juarez”), Lucky 7 GM Transportation Inc. (“Lucky 7”). and Does 1-50.  Pending  before the Court are Plaintiff’s motions for requests for admission to be  deemed admitted as against Juarez and Lucky 7. For the reasons stated herein,  the motions are denied for lack of jurisdiction.   II.      Legal Standards A  response to requests for admission is due 30 days after service. (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2033.250,  subd. (a).) “If a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve  a timely response, . . .[t]he requesting party may move for an order that the  genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests  be deemed admitted. . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)“The  court shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests  for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion,  a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance  with Section 2033.220. . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) “It  is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction . . . on the party or attorney,  or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated  this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)“[T]he  party requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a further response  if that party deems that . . . (1) An answer to a particular request is evasive  or incomplete [and/or that] (2) An objection to a particular request is without  merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (a).)The motion must include a meet and confer  declaration which “state[s] facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt  at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ.  Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2033.290, subd. (b)(1).)  “In lieu of a separate statement required under the California Rules of Court,  the court may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the  discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290,  subd. (b)(2).)Notice  of the motion must be provided “within 45 days of the service of the verified  response, or any supplemental verified response, or any specific later date to  which the requesting party and the responding party have agreed in writing . .  .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c).) The responding party has the  burden of justifying the objections to the requests. (Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.) “The  court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further  response, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with  substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of  the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (d).)  III.     Discussion A.       Motion to Deem Requests for Admissions  Admitted as to Juarez         Plaintiff moves the Court for an order establishing admissions to the truth of each  matter specified in Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, Set One (“subject  discovery”), propounded to Juarez be deemed admitted. Plaintiff also seeks  sanctions against Juarez and Juarez’s attorney of record in the amount of  $1,560.00. Plaintiff’s counsel Alexander Zeesman (“A. Zeesman”)  represents as follows: On April 29, 2024, Plaintiff  served Juarez with the subject discovery. (A. Zeesman Decl., ¶ 8.) On or about May 29, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed  Juarez’s counsel, granting an extension to provide responses to Plaintiff’s  discovery until June 14, 2024. (Id., ¶ 9.) On June 14, 2024, Juarez’s  counsel requested another extension until June 28, 2024, which Plaintiff’s  counsel granted. (Id.) Plaintiff’s counsel provided Juarez’s counsel  with a third extension on June 27, 2024, which extended the deadline to July  12, 2024. (Id.) Juarez’s counsel sought a further extension to July 26,  2024, but Plaintiff’s counsel granted only until July 19, 2024. (Id.) On  July 19, 2024, Juarez served unverified responses, which contained blanket  objections. (Id., ¶ 10, Exh. A.) Plaintiff’s counsel reached out to  Juarez’s counsel to meet and confer and was advised by Juarez’s counsel that  substantive responses with verifications would be provided. (Id., ¶ 11,  Exh. B.) Plaintiff’s counsel subsequently gave Juarez’s counsel until September  3, 2024 to provide responses. (Id., ¶¶ 12 and 13, Exh. C.) No responses  have been provided. (Id., ¶14.)  At the outset, the Court notes that the relief  Plaintiff seeks in her notice of motion is erroneous; since objection-only  responses were served, they were not required to be verified. (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 2033.240, sub. (a) [“The party to whom the requests for admission are  directed shall sign the response under oath, unless the response contains only  objections”].) There is no indication in any of counsel’s attached  communications that the extensions provided to Juarez’s counsel prior to  service of the July 19, 2024 responses were contingent upon objections being  waived. Plaintiff, moreover, has filed a concurrent separate statement, which  is required for a motion to compel further responses, not a motion to deem  requests for admissions admitted. The Court thus will treat the instant motion  as a motion to compel further responses to requests for admissions. The motion is denied on the basis of lack of  jurisdiction. Again, notice of the motion must be provided  “within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental  verified response, or any specific later date to which the requesting party and  the responding party have agreed in writing . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.300, subd. (c).) The 45-day  limitation is “’jurisdictional’ in the sense that it renders the court without  authority to rule on motion to compel other than to deny them.” (Sexton v.  Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  On July 26, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed  Juarez’s counsel and asked when he could expect further responses and whether  Juarez’s counsel would “authorize 45 days from that date certain for [them] to  proceed with a motion to compel further responses.” (Id.,  ¶ 11, Exh. B.) Juarez’s counsel did not  expressly agree to any extension of the motion filing deadline in response. (Id.)  That day, Plaintiff’s counsel asked Juarez’s counsel to confirm that he was  “authorizing an open extension to file our motion(s) in response.” (Id.)  The next communication on the email string is dated August 13, 2024 from  Juarez’s counsel, wherein he advised only that he expected to complete Juarez’s  discovery responses by August 27, 2024; again, Juarez’s counsel did not  expressly agree to any extension of the motion filing deadline. (Id.)  While counsel exchanged several communications thereafter, it does not appear  that Juarez’s counsel at any point agreed in writing to any extension of the  motion filing deadline. The instant motion was not filed until September 11,  2024, after the 45 days had expired. B.       Motion to  Deem Requests for Admission Admitted as to Lucky 7 Plaintiff  moves the Court for an order establishing admissions to the truth of each  matter specified in Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, Set One, propounded to  Lucky 7 be deemed admitted. Plaintiff also seeks sanctions against Lucky 7 and  Lucky 7’s attorney of record in the amount of $1,560.00. In  support of the motion against Lucky 7, Plaintiff proffers the same facts supporting  the prior motion, namely, that the subject discovery was served on April 29,  2024, that Lucky 7 obtained four extensions, with an ultimate deadline of July  19, 2024, and that Lucky 7 served unverified objections-only responses on July  19, 2024. For the same reasons set forth above in connection  with the previous motion, the Court denies the motion due to lack of  jurisdiction.
