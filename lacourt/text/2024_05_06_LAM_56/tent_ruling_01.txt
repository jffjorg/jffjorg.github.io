  CASE NO.: 20STCV31030
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: DEFENDANT’S MOTION
  FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES
 
8:30 a.m.
May 6, 2018
Dept. 56



 
This
is an action arising from the allegedly defamatory statements made by
Defendants Amy Huang (“Huang”) and Lauren Hyun between March 2019 and June
2020, accusing Plaintiff Joseph Choi (“Choi”) of sexual assault.  On April 6, 2019, Plaintiff was appointed as
Los Angeles City Manager of the Asian Creative Network Los Angles (“ACN LA”)
but was asked to voluntarily resign from his role in June of 2020, after
Defendant Huang began circulating the allegedly defamatory statements about
him.  Then, on June 4, 2020, Defendant
Huang published a post on Twitter, stating Plaintiff had sexually assaulted her
on February 19, 2019.  Plaintiff alleges
such statements were false and have injured his reputation.  On August 14, 2020, Plaintiff filed a
Complaint alleging causes of action for: (1) defamation—libel per se;
(2) defamation—slander per se (Cal. Civ. Code §46(3)); and (3)
false light. 
 
On
April 16, 2021, the Court granted Defendant’s anti-SLAPP motion as to the
entirety of the Complaint.  As the
prevailing party on her anti-SLAPP motion, Defendant seeks $23,025 in attorneys’
fees, representing 30.7 hours (which does include the time spent drafting the
instant fee Motion) at $750 per hour.  (Gebelin
Decl. ¶ 19.)  Defendant also seeks $1,293.50
in costs in connection with the appeal from the Anti-SLAPP Order.  (Gebelin Decl. ¶ 21.)  Lastly, at the time of drafting the instant
motion for attorneys’ fees (the “Motion”), Defendant estimated spending 4 hours
($3,000) in preparing, and another 3 hours ($2,250) reviewing any opposition,
filing a reply, and attending the hearing on the Motion.  
 
Thus,
Defendant seeks to recover a total of $29,568.50 in recoverable fees. 
 
Plaintiff
does not oppose the motion. 
 
As
the prevailing party on her anti-SLAPP motion, Defendant is indeed entitled to her
attorney’s fees.  (Code Civ. Proc. §
425.16(c).)  Moreover, defense counsel’s
hourly rate of 
$750 per hour is high
but reasonable considering Gebelin’s experience and qualifications.  The number of hours expended—30.7 hours—is
very reasonable for having defended an anti-SLAPP Order on appeal.  Defendant’s request is in line with other fee
awards this Court has given to prevailing defendants on defending an anti-SLAPP
motion.  
 
However,
in light of the fact Plaintiff did not oppose the Motion and Defendant did not
have to subsequently review an opposition or file a reply, the Court finds it
appropriate to subtract the anticipated 2 hours of work ($1,500) from
Defendant’s estimated total ($29,568.50)..
 
Thus,
the Court GRANTS the Motion and awards Defendant $28,068 in attorneys’ fees as
the prevailing party on her anti-SLAPP motion. 
 
Defendant
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMCDEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
