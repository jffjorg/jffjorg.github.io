And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiffs' motion for order compelling responses to discovery requests. The court found several deficiencies in the motion, including improper service of the discovery requests, non-compliance with page limits for memoranda of points and authorities, and combining three discovery motions into one. The court also found that the plaintiffs failed to provide proper proofs of service and did not meet the requirements for separate reservation fees for each underlying discovery request. As a result, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion and did not impose monetary sanctions.
