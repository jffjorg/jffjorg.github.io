[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
DEMURRER
 
8:30 a.m.
May 6, 2024
Dept. 56



 
This
is an action arising from the alleged sexual assault of Plaintiff Jane Doe
(“Doe”) by Defendant Tommy Lee (“Lee”) during a helicopter ride from San Diego
to Van Nuys.  Plaintiff Doe alleges in her
original complaint, filed on December 19, 2023, that in February of 2003, she
and Lee were riding in the helicopter of Defendant Natural High Helicopters,
LLC dba SoCal Helicopters (“Helicopters LLC”)[1]
when the assault took place.  (First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) ¶¶ 1-2.)  The
parties stipulated to the filing of an amended complaint and on February 21, 2024,
Plaintiff Doe filed the operative FAC alleging causes of action for: (1) sexual
assault/battery; (2) gender violence; (3) intentional infliction of emotional
distress; and (4) negligence. 
 
Plaintiff
brings her claim pursuant to the Sexual Abuse and Cover Up Accountability Act, Assembly
Bill 2777 (“AB 2777”) [FAC
¶ 5], codified in California Code of Civil Procedure section 340.16(e) (“Section
340.16(e)”), which provides that a claim seeking to recover damages suffered as
a result of a sexual assault that occurred on or after a plaintiff’s 18th
birthday, otherwise barred, may be brought subject to this act between January
1, 2023 and December 31, 2023.
 
Section
340.16(e) specifically provides that:
 
(2)This subdivision revives claims brought by a
plaintiff who alleges all of the following:
 
(A) The plaintiff has
been sexually assaulted.
(B) One or more
entities are legally responsible for damages arising out of the sexual assault.
(C) The entity or
entities, including, but not limited to, their officers, directors,
representatives, employees, or agents, engaged in a cover up or attempted a
cover up of a previous instance or allegations of sexual assault by an alleged
perpetrator of such abuse.
(3)  F to allege a
cover up as required by subparagraph (C) of paragraph(2) as to one entity does
not affect revival of the plaintiff’s claim or claims against any other entity.
(4)  For purposes of
this subdivision:  
a)
 “Cover up” means a concerted effort to hide evidence relating to a sexual
assault or other inappropriate conduct, communication, or activity of a sexual
nature that incentivizes individuals to remain silent or prevents information
relating to a sexual assault or other inappropriate conduct, communication, or
activity of a sexual nature from becoming public or being disclosed to the
plaintiff, including, but not limited to, the use of nondisclosure agreements
or confidentiality agreements. 
b)
“Entity” means a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company,
corporation, association, or other legal entity. 
c)
“Legally responsible” means that the entity or entities are liable under any
theory of liability established by statute or common law, including, but not
limited to, negligence, intentional torts, and vicarious liability.  
Defendant’s
Request for Judicial Notice
On
March 23, 2024, Defendants filed the instant Demurrer (the “Demurrer”), along
with a Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”). 
Accordingly, Defendants request that the Court take judicial notice of
the following:
(1) The
January 2, 2020, Secretary of State Certificate of Dissolution for Mayhem
Touring, Inc. (“Mayhem”), retrieved from the California Secretary of State
website on March 21, 2024, Exhibit 1.
(2) The
February 17, 2006, Articles of Incorporation of Tommy Lee, Inc, (“TLI”)
retrieved from the California Secretary of State website on March 21, 2024, Exhibit
2. 
(3)
The Entity details for Helicopters LLC, retrieved from the Nevada Secretary of
State website on March 21, 2024, Exhibit 3. 
(4) The
Entity details for Mayhem, retrieved from the California Secretary of State
website on March 21, 2024, Exhibit 4. 
(5) The
November 5, 2018, Statement of Information for Mayhem, retrieved from the
California Secretary of State website on March 21, 2024, Exhibit
5. 
(6) The November 13, 2023, Statement of Information for TLI,
retrieved from the California Secretary of State website on March 21, 2024, Exhibit
6. 
(7) The Legislative History for California Statutes of 2022,
Chapter 442, Assembly Bill 2777, prepared by LRI History LLC, Exhibit
7. 
 
Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice as to Exhibits (1)-(7) is GRANTED.

 
Plaintiff’s
Request for Judicial Notice
On April 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed
their opposition to the Demurrer, along with her own RJN, requesting notice of
the existence of the
First Amended Complaint for Damages filed on March 23, 2023, in the lawsuit
captioned Acevedo,
et  al. v. eXp Realty, LLC, et al., Case No. 2:23-cv-01304-AB-AGR
(C.D. Cal.) (“Acevedo”), Exhibit
A. 
 
Along with Defendants’ Reply to the opposition, filed on April 29,
2024, Defendants filed an opposition to Plaintiff’s RJN.  Defendants argue that granting Plaintiff’s
RJN would be an improper use of judicial notice of the “meaning of a document
based on the document alone, without allowing the parties an opportunity to
present extrinsic evidence of the meaning of the document,” the Court may still
judicially notice the existence of a document. 
Fremont Indem. Co v. Fremont Gen. Corp.,
148 Cal. App. 4th 97, 114-15 (2007). “[A]lthough the existence
of a document may be judicially noticeable, the truth of statements
contained in the document and its proper interpretation are not subject to
judicial notice if those matters are reasonably
disputable.”  Elford
v. Hiltabrand, 63 Cal. App. 2d 65, 73 (1944) (citing Communist
Party v. Peek, 20 Cal.2d 536, 546 (1942)) (“Whenever
there is possibility of dispute judicial notice cannot be taken of the
existence of a claimed fact.”).  
 
The Court does note that Plaintiff has provided no evidence that
the pleading presented for judicial notice in Acevedo was itself
challenged or otherwise tested and accepted as sufficient by that court;
therefore, it provides no evidence that the pleading presented has been evaluated
under AB 2777 in the district court where it was filed or in this or any court.  Of course, even if Acevedo  had been so tested, such a determination would
not be binding on this Court.
 
Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice is granted to the extent
set forth above.
 
Meet
and Confer
Defendants
have properly satisfied their requirement to Meet and Confer with Plaintiff before
filing the Demurrer.  (Frid Decl. ¶¶ 3-7,
Exs. A-C.)
 


 
Demurrer
Defendants Lee,
TLI and Mayhem demur to the First, Second, Third and Fourth Causes of Action alleged
in Plaintiff Doe’s FAC. Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to satisfy
the requirements of AB 2777 and Section 340.16(e) and that the revival of
claims provided for therein does not apply.  On that ground, Defendants assert that all
four causes of action are time-barred by the statute of limitations. “A
complaint showing on its face the cause of action is barred by the statute of
limitations is subject to general demurrer.” Iverson,
et al v. Berwald, 76 Cal. App. 4th 990, 995 (1999). 
 
Defendants argue that
Plaintiff’s claims do not qualify for revival under AB 2777 and Section
340.16(e) because Plaintiff fails to allege either that: (1) a legal entity is
responsible for damages; and (2) Defendant entities were responsible for a
“cover up,” according to the definition in AB 2777 and Section 340.16€.  (Dem. at pp. 14-17.)  Defendants argue that no legal entity Defendant
could be responsible for damages arising out of the alleged conduct in February
of 2003 because neither of the two legal entities that Plaintiff contends are
responsible for damages were in existence at that time.  (Dem. at p. 9.).   Defendant provides evidence that TLI was not
formed until February 17, 2006 and Mayhem was suspended in February of 2002.  (Dem. at Exs 1-2 and 4.)  
 
In opposing the Demurrer,
Plaintiff asserts that: (1) Defendant TLI may be liable under a successor
liability theory; and (2) public records reveal that Mayhem was not suspended
but merely delinquent and, thus, still an operable entity at the time of the
underlying events.  (Opp. at p. 13.)  
 
With regard to TLI,
the Court notes that Plaintiff’s assertion that there must have been an
eligible entity covering the services of Defendant Lee during the time of the
alleged assault to which TLI is the successor does not appear to be based upon
any actual “information and belief” regarding specific named predecessor entity
but instead relies upon a vague “industry standard” for its assertion that
there must have been such an entity.
 
With regard to
Mayhem, the Court does not make a finding regarding the status of Mayhem, as
such is not apparent on the face of the document presented, i.e.,
Defendants’ RJN, Ex. 4.
 
In their reply, Defendants
argue that even if either legal entity had been in existence at the time of the
alleged conduct, Plaintiff still fails to plead facts to support the allegation
of a “cover up” as required and defined by the text of Section ABB 2777 and
Section 340.16(e).  (Reply at p. 9.)
 
In accordance
with definition provided by AB 2777 and Section 340.16(e), the Court finds that
Plaintiff has not pled facts sufficient to support the theory of the necessary
“cover up” because Plaintiff has not asserted facts evidencing Defendants’
“concerted effort to hide evidence relating to sexual assault.”  (AB 2777.). 
Plaintiff instead makes vague allegations that the Court finds
insufficient to support the revival of a claim under AB 2777 and Section
340.16(e).
 
While
Plaintiff’s reference to the Acevedo
case as an action alleging
sufficient facts to be covered by the revival statute, Acevedo is
distinguished from Plaintiff’s action in that while it also alleged sexual
assault, the pleading specifically alleges that Defendant Michael Bjorkman
“threaten[ed]” Plaintiff to not say anything about it.  (Pl’s RJN ¶ 47.)  No such facts are alleged in the FAC here.  
 
Although the FAC alleges that: “[o]n information and belief, Martz,
Lee, Defendants, and Does 1-20 knew of and were aware of such sexual assaults
and engaged in a concerted effort to prevent information or evidence of such
sexual assaults from being made public or disclosed to anyone, including
Plaintiff,” these allegations are conclusory in nature and do not allege
specific actions directed to Plaintiff as in Acevedo.  (FAC ¶ 35.) 
Thus, Plaintiff has not pled facts sufficient to cause the revival of
her claims under AB 2777 and Section 340.16(e).  As such,
Plaintiff’s action as alleged is effectively time-barred.
 
Because Plaintiff has failed to assert facts to support the “cover
up” requirement of AB
2777 and Section 340.16(e), the Court need not resolve the issue of
Defendants’ legal entity existence at this time.  
 
Conclusion
The
Court SUSTAINS Defendants’ Demurrer with twenty (20) days leave to amend.  The Court notes that if any Second Amended Complaint
filed does not cure the defects discussed above, the Court will consider the
sustaining of a demurrer thereto without leave to amend.  
 
Defendants
are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
