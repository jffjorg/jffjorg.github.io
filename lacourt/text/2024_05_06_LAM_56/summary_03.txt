The court has determined that the plaintiff has not pleaded sufficient facts to support the revival of the claims under Assembly Bill 2777 and Section 340.16(e) of the California Code of Civil Procedure. The court has also determined that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to support the theory of the necessary "cover up" required by the statute. As a result, the court has sustained the demurrer and has granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint with 20 days' leave to amend.
