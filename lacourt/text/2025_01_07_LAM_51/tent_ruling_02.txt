STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On May 14, 2024, Plaintiff Manuel Pineda (Plaintiff) filed a
Complaint against Defendants Judith Fischer as Trustee of the Fischer Family
Trust, North Oak Real Estate INV, Inc., Sinahi G. Barrios, and Joel B. Rodstein
(Defendants) with causes of action for: (1) Breach of Agreement, (2) Breach of
the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment, (3) Violation of Civ. Code §§ 1941, 1941.1,
and 1942.4, (4) Willful Interruption of Services – Violation of Civ. Code §
789.3, (5) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, (6) Private Nuisance,
(7) Negligence, (8) Constructive Eviction, (9) Violation of Unfair Competition
Laws (Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq.), and (10) Unlawful Entry (Civ.
Code § 1954 et seq.).
 
According to the Complaint, Plaintiff is a tenant at 6336
Orange St., Unit #3, Los Angeles, California 90048, owned and operated by
Defendants, which allegedly contain substantial substandard conditions. 
 
On July 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Amendment to Complaint
substituting Comex Holdings, LLC for DOE 1.
 
On August 21, 2024, Defendants Judith Discher, as Trustee of
the Fischer Family Trust, North Oak Real Estate INV. Inc., Sinahi G. Barrios,
and Joel B. Rodstein (Defendants) filed the instant Demurrer with Motion to
Strike. On December 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed oppositions. On December 30,
2024, Defendants filed replies. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Prior to filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required
to satisfy their meet and confer obligations pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc.
§430.41, and demonstrate that they so satisfied their meet and confer
obligation by submitting a declaration pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc.
§430.41(a)(2) & (3). ¿The meet and confer requirement also applies to
motions to strike. (CCP § 435.5.) Here, the parties met and conferred
telephonically. (Larsen Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.)
 
Demurrer
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint
states a cause of action.¿(Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context.¿In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the
evidence or other extrinsic matters. …. The only issue involved in a demurrer
hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous
matters, states a cause of action.”¿(Hahn¿147
Cal.App.4th at 747.)¿¿ 
 
Motion to Strike
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. (CCP § 436(a).) The court may also
strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with
the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Id., § 436(b).) The grounds for moving
to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.
(Id.¿§¿437.)¿“When the defect which
justifies striking a complaint is capable of cure, the court should allow leave
to amend.” (Vaccaro v. Kaiman¿(1998)
63 Cal.App.4th 761, 768.)¿¿¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Demurrer
 
Fifth Cause of
Action – Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
 
Defendants contend that Plaintiff failed to sufficiently
allege outrageous conduct, no allegations of intent to cause emotional distress
to Plaintiff, and no allegations of severe emotional distress. Defendants also
contend this claim is uncertain because the factual allegations contradict
themselves concerning repairs made or not made. Plaintiff argues the outrageous
conduct was Defendants knowingly displaced Plaintiff and failed to remediate
the problems to his home before he returned. Plaintiff further argues this
conduct shows a reckless disregard for the probability of causing emotional
distress and did cause Plaintiff to suffer extreme emotional distress.[1]
Defendants reply that Plaintiff still failed to specifically allege outrageous
conduct by each defendant and the actions pled show nuisance and negligence.
 
The necessary elements for Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress (IIED) are: (1) outrageous conduct by the defendant; (2)
which was intentional or reckless in nature; (3) severe emotional distress; and
(4) causation.  (Huntingdon Life
Sciences, Inc. v. Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA, Inc. (2005) 129
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1259 (Huntingdon).) 
For purposes of pleading IIED, conduct is outrageous if it is “so extreme as to
exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.”  (Davidson v. City of Westminster (1982)
32 Cal.3d 197, 209 (Davidson).) 
 
¿ 
Although emotional distress may consist of any highly
unpleasant mental reaction such as fright, grief, shame, humiliation,
embarrassment, anger, chagrin, disappointment or worry [citation], to make out
a claim, the plaintiff must prove that emotional distress was severe and not
trivial or transient.” (Wong v. Tai Jing
(2010) 189 Cal. App. 4th 1354, 1376.)¿ Such distress must be “of such
substantial quality or enduring quality that no reasonable person in civilized
society should be expected to endure it.”¿ (Potter
v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 965, 1004.)¿A tenant
may sue their landlord for IIED “if the landlord’s acts are extreme and
outrageous and result in severe mental distress.” (Stoiber v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 922 [noting a
factual question in that case.]) Behavior may be considered outrageous if a
defendant: (a) abuses a relation or position which gives him power to damage
the plaintiff's interest; (b) knows the plaintiff is susceptible to injuries
through mental distress; or (c) acts intentionally or unreasonably with the
recognition that the acts are likely to result in illness through mental
distress.  (Id. at p. 921.)  
 
Upon reviewing the Complaint, although Plaintiff sufficiently
alleged facts supporting a claim for IIED, Plaintff  failed to articulate which defendant had
knowledge and how they had such knowledge. First, Plaintiff alleges that the
outrageous conduct was “intentionally ignoring and failing to keep the Property
clean, sanitary, and free from accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, and
garbage, and by violating health and safety codes, ordinances, regulations, and
other laws” coupled with knowing the Property was “untenable” and “refused to
remediate.” (Complaint ¶¶ 137-138.) While these allegations in isolation are conclusory, the fifth cause
of action incorporates the prior factual allegations in the preceding paragraphs.
(Complaint ¶ 136.) Throughout the complaint, Plaintiff pleads facts recounting significant
habitability issues that Defendants
had knowledge of and yet failed to correct including a collapsed bedroom
ceiling (Complaint ¶¶  40-42), flea
infestation ((Complaint ¶¶  48-51),  inoperable heater ((Complaint ¶¶ 53-55), lack
of running water (Complaint ¶¶  56-60), and
being removed from the unit in January 2023 without being offered relocation
benefits. (Complaint ¶¶  75-77).) These incorporated
facts sufficient to state a claim. However, Plaintiffs lump all defendants
together and fail to specifically alleges which defendants they provided notice
or how knowledge was  imputed to each
defendant. 
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the Fifth
Cause of Action.
 
Motion to Strike
 
Defendants seek to strike the following portions of the
Complaint:
1.      Paragraph
118: “This constitutes malice . . . and justifies an award of punitive damages.”
2.      Paragraph
119: “This constitutes oppression . . . and justifies an award of punitive
damages”
3.      Paragraph
114: “Plaintiff requests an award of punitive damages against Defendants”
4.      Paragraph
151: “Plaintiff requests an award of punitive damages against Defendants”
5.      Paragraph
164: “Punitive damages”
6.      Paragraph
183: “Plaintiff requests an award of punitive damages against Defendants”
7.      Prayer
for Relief, Paragraph C: “For punitive and exemplary damages”
Defendants contend that Plaintiff failed to allege facts
that Defendants acted with malice, oppression, or fraud warranting punitive
damages because the alleged failure to timely or properly maintain the Premises
alone is not despicable conduct. Plaintiff argues he alleged sufficient facts
demonstrating malice and punitive damages are warranted for Defendants’
repeated failure to remediate the Property despite Plaintiff’s and government
citations. Defendants reply that gross negligence is insufficient to justify a
punitive damages award.[2]

 
To obtain punitive damages, a plaintiff must plead
sufficient facts in support of punitive damages.¿ (See¿Hilliard v. A.H. Robins Co.¿(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 374, 391-92.)¿ In
addition,¿punitive damages are allowed only where “it is proven by clear and
convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or
malice.”¿ (Civ. Code, § 3294(a).)¿ Courts have viewed despicable conduct as
conduct “so vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome that it
would be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people. (Scott v. Phoenix Schools, Inc., (2009)
175 Cal.App.4th 702, 715.) Further, Civil Code § 3294(c) provides the
definition of malice, oppression, and fraud. Malice is “conduct which is
intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable
conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious
disregard of the rights or safety of others.” (Ibid.) Oppression is “despicable conduct that subjects a person to
cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person's rights.” (Ibid.) Fraud is “an intentional
misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the
defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving
a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.”¿(Ibid.)¿ 
 
Upon reviewing the Complaint, again, while Plaintiff sufficiently
alleged facts warranting punitive damages, Plaintiff filed to enumerate how each
defendant had actual or imputed knowledge. In Stoiber v. Honeychuck, the premises was so dilapidated that it
needed to be torn down. ((1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 912 [describing the
following defects identified by the Kern County health Department: “heavy
cockroach infestation, broken interior walls broken deteriorated flooring on
front porch, falling ceiling, deteriorated, overfused electrical wiring, lack
of proper plumbing connection to sewage system in bathroom, sewage under
bathroom floor, leaking roof, broken, windows, and fire hazard.”]) The Court
there found that the plaintiff pled sufficient facts to support her prayer for
punitive damages because the defendant had actual knowledge of defective
conditions in the premises, acted with full knowledge of the consequences
thereof and the damage being caused to plaintiff, and their conduct was
willful, oppressive, and malicious. (Id.
at p. 920.) Here, as in Stoiber,
Plaintiff alleged that Defendants had actual knowledge of the defects, that the
defects were causing Plaintiff damages, and that Defendants’ conduct was
willful, oppressive, and malicious. (See, e.g., Complaint ¶¶ 22, 23, 28, 30, 34,
35, 36, 37, 40, 41, 44, 45, 46, 54, 55, 56, 58, 75, 76, 82, 83, 84, 85.) However,
there are insufficient allegations to determine which defendants committed the
various allegedly malicious acts.
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Defendants’ motion to
strike in full.
 
Leave to Amend
 
Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment. 
(See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 349 [court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to amend
if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment”]; Kong v. City of Hawaiian
Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 [“A demurrer
should not be sustained without leave to amend if the complaint, liberally
construed, can state a cause of action under any theory or if there is a
reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by amendment.”]; Vaccaro v. Kaiman (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th
761, 768 [“When the defect which justifies striking a complaint is capable of
cure, the court should allow leave to amend.”].)  The burden is on the complainant to show the
Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)
 
Here, the above deficiencies are reasonably possible to
cure.
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS leave to amend.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Demurrer
to the Fifth Cause of Action is SUSTAINED;
2.      Motion
to Strike is GRANTED in its entirety;
3.      Leave
to Amend is GRANTED;
4.      Plaintiff
shall file an amended complaint within 20 days of this ruling.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
