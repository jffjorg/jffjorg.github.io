Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted International Vintage Watch's motion for relief from waiver of jury trial. The company waived its right to a jury trial by failing to pay the non-refundable fee for jury trial as required by CCP section 631. However, the judge has discretion to allow a trial by jury even after a waiver, and public policy favors granting the requested relief. The judge has noted that SKU Jewelry Company has not shown prejudice that would result if the requested relief is granted. The motion is granted, and the case will proceed to trial by jury.
