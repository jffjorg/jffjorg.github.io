  Case Number:  21SMCV01125    Hearing Date:   September 12, 2024    Dept:  P Tentative Ruling SKU Jewelry
Company v. International Vintage Watch, Case No. 21SMCV01125Hearing Date:
September 12, 2024Defendant International Vintage Watch’s Motion
for Relief from Waiver of Jury Trial SKU Jewelry Company brought a breach of contract claim
against the defendant International Vintage Watch (“IVW”), alleging it loaned
$250,000 and IVW failed to make interest payments. IVW requests relief from its
jury trial waiver. Plaintiffs SKU and Sulaminian’s request for judicial
notice nos. 1-6 are GRANTED under Evid Code §452(d) as court documents. CCP section 631 provides “[a]t least one party
demanding a jury on each side of a civil case shall pay a nonrefundable fee of
one hundred fifty dollars ($150), unless the fee has been paid by another party
on the same side of the case.” Code Civ. Proc. §631(b). The fee must be paid
before the date scheduled for the initial case management conference. §631(c). A
party waives jury trial by failing to timely pay the fee. §631(f)(5).“The court may, in its discretion upon just terms,
allow a trial by jury although there may have been a waiver of a trial by
jury.” Id., §631(g). “A trial court abuses its discretion as a matter of
law when [] relief has been denied where there has been no prejudice¿to the
other party or to the court from an inadvertent waiver.” Tesoro del Valle
Master Homeowners Ass’n. v. Griffin¿(2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 619,
638. Policy favors the court using its discretion to proceed with a jury
trial. Bishop v. Anderson¿(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 821, 823.¿ “Where the right to jury is threatened, the crucial
focus is whether any prejudice will be suffered by any party or the court if¿a
motion for relief from waiver is granted. [Citations.]¿A trial court abuses its
discretion as a matter of law when ‘…relief has been denied where there has
been no prejudice to the other party or to the court from an inadvertent
waiver. [Citations.]’” Wharton v. Superior Court¿(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d
100, 104.¿“The mere fact that trial will be by jury is not prejudice per se.” Johnson-Stovall
v. Superior Court¿(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th¿808, 811.¿Rather, the prejudice
that must be shown is “prejudice from the granting of relief from waiver not
prejudice from the jury trial.” Winston v. Superior Court¿(1987) 196
Cal.App.3d 600, 602, 603.The complaint was filed June 28, 2021. IVW requested a
non-jury trial per its case management statement. See 09/23/2021 Case
Management Statement. At the initial case management conference on March 23,
2022, a non-jury trial was scheduled. See 03/23/22 Minute Order.IVW argues it inadvertently waived its right to a jury
trial due to prior counsel’s unauthorized action. Abramov Decl., ¶¶ 5-6; Cohen
Decl., ¶¶ 5-6. In opposition, SKU contends the waiver was not accidental, as
IVW expressly waived its right to a jury trial, and more than three years have
passed without correction. Based on the filings and minute order, it does
appear IVW waived its right to a jury trial and did request a non-jury trial. 





















Trial by jury is a fundamental right, and public
policy favors granting the requested relief. The court has discretion to grant
the requested relief, even absent an explanation for the long delay in making
such request. SKU has not shown prejudice that would result if the requested relief
is granted. Noting that it is an abuse of discretion for the court not to provide
relief in the absence of prejudice, the motion is GRANTED.
