 Case Number:  23SMCV04551    Hearing Date:   September 12, 2024    Dept:  P Guerrero v. Regents, case no. 23SMCV04551
Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings
Plaintiff alleges injuries on 9/29/21 at UCLA Medical Center
when she slipped and fell on water on the floor. She had been hospitalized since
9/25/21 for a kidney transplant. Defendant Regents move for judgment on the
pleadings on statute of limitations grounds, as the complaint was filed
9/27/23, more than a year after the incident. Regents argue that, though the
complaint alleges premises liability claims, which have a two-year statute,
this should be considered a medical negligence claim, which has a one-year
statute, making the claim untimely.
Plaintiff argues this is a premises claim, as alleged, as
the mechanism of injury results not from the hospital’s care of plaintiff, but
from a general duty of care to maintain its premises. Thus, the two-year
statute of limitations applies.
The standard for ruling on a motion for judgment on the
pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable to a general demurrer --
it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322, citing Schabarum
v. California Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216. Matters subject
to mandatory judicial notice may be treated as part of the complaint and may be
considered. “The motion is confined to the face of the pleading under attack
and all facts alleged in the complaint must be accepted as true.”  Hightower v. Farmers Insurance Exchange
(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 853, 858. A plaintiff may move for judgment on the
pleadings on the ground that “the complaint states facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action against the defendant and the answer does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a defense to the complaint.” Code Civ.
Proc. §438(c)(1)(A).
On judgment on the pleadings, all plaintiff’s allegations
must be treated as true, as on demurrer. 
The court agrees with plaintiff’s argument that the injuries
did not arise from any alleged medical negligence or the provision of medical
care. Rather, plaintiff alleges injuries arising from slipping on a recently
mopped, wet floor. Simply because she was inpatient does not mean that any and
all injuries she might sustain at the hospital are subsumed within the ambit of
professional negligence. See Gopaul v. Herrick Memorial Hospital (1974)
38 Cal.App.3d 1002, 1007; Flores v. Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital
(2016) 63 Cal.4th 75, 88, cited by both parties. 
As plaintiff argues, if a visitor slipped and fell on the
wet floor, that visitor’s claim would not be one for professional negligence;
it would be one for premises liability. Simply because it was inpatient plaintiff
who fell, not a hypothetical visitor, does not make a premises liability claim
into a professional negligence claim.
Flores, 63 Cal.4th at 86, stated CCP 340.5’s
statute of limitations would not apply in the circumstances of a “failure to
place a warning sign on a wet, recently mopped floor,” exactly the
circumstances presented here. The injury did not occur “in the rendering of
medical services,” so the one-year statute does not apply.
The court declines to take judicial notice of plaintiff's
medical records under Cal. Evid. Code 452, as there is no basis for the court
to do so. The motion is denied.
