And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to the demurrer filed by the defendants, Natella and Tigran Petrosyan, to the plaintiff's complaint alleging negligence, premise liability, and intentional torts. The plaintiff, Springman, claims that he was repeatedly sexually assaulted by an employee of Solstice, an inpatient mental health/substance abuse treatment facility, from May to September 2021. The defendants argue that the claims are time-barred by the two-year statute of limitations under CCP §335.1, but the Judge rules that CCP §340.16, which creates a 10-year statute of limitation for civil actions for damages stemming from a sexual assault that occurs after the plaintiff's 18th birthday, applies to the case.

The Judge also rules that the complaint adequately alleges a negligence claim, stating that the defendants owed a duty to take reasonable steps to protect vulnerable residents like the plaintiff and failed to do so. The Judge further rules that the complaint adequately alleges a premises liability claim, stating that the allegations are sufficient to put the defendants on notice.

The Judge orders the defendants to answer the complaint within 10 days.
