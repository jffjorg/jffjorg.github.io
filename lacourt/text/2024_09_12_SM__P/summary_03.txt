And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which argues that the plaintiff's claim is untimely due to the statute of limitations. The plaintiff alleges that she slipped and fell on water on the floor at UCLA Medical Center on September 29, 2021, while she was an inpatient at the hospital for a kidney transplant. The defendant argues that the claim is a medical negligence claim, which has a one-year statute of limitations, rather than a premises liability claim, which has a two-year statute of limitations. The court agrees with the plaintiff that the injuries did not arise from medical negligence, but rather from the hospital's failure to maintain its premises in a safe condition. The court declines to take judicial notice of the plaintiff's medical records and denies the defendant's motion.
