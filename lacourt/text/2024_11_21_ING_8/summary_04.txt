And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to compel further responses to discovery requests is continued. The judge finds that the plaintiffs' meet and confer efforts are insufficient and orders the parties to meet and confer in good faith prior to the court's decision on the motion. The judge also intends to narrow the scope of permissible discovery and will not order production of electronically stored information (ESI) as to other California customers' complaints. The judge sets forth parameters for production of documents, including limiting the scope of requests for overall buyback and warranty data and statistics, limiting the scope of requests for internal emails, and requiring production of internal reports, external emails, and repair orders and invoices. The judge also orders the parties to discuss search terms for key words to be used in a program for American Honda Motor Co., Inc. to run on its digitally stored records.
