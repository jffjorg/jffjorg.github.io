And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents. The motion was brought by the defendants, Darren Jerome Doucette and Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and seeks to compel the plaintiff, Shawna Landon Lupia, to provide further responses to the request for production of documents.

The judge has granted the motion, but subject to the plaintiff's counsel explaining how a photograph or video could constitute an attorney-client privileged communication, and explaining how the plaintiff's counsel intends to better comply with the privileged log requirements. The judge has also indicated that it will be interested in oral argument from the plaintiff's counsel at the trial as to how she intends to comply with the code section violations.

The judge has also identified two documents from the personnel files of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority that it views as being discoverable, and has ordered that they be produced subject to a protective order for employment records. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's responses have failed to comply with the code section requirements, and has ordered that the plaintiff's counsel provide a privilege log that is more specific and detailed.

The judge's ruling is based on the court's analysis of the parties' conduct and the applicable law. The court has found that the plaintiff has failed to comply with the code section requirements, and has granted the motion to compel further responses. The judge has also indicated that it will be interested in oral argument from the plaintiff's counsel at the trial as to how she intends to comply with the code section violations.
