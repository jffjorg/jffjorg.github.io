And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the motion to compel arbitration brought by Uber Technologies, Inc. (Uber) and joined by Galina Sergeevna Gaipova (Gaipova). The motion seeks to compel arbitration of the claims brought by Plaintiff Billy Massey against Uber and Gaipova. The court finds that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) governs the arbitration agreement and that Uber has presented sufficient evidence to establish the validity of the arbitration agreement by a preponderance of the evidence. The court also finds that the arbitration agreement covers the claims at issue in this case and that Gaipova has consented to arbitrate Plaintiff's claims against her.

The court notes that Plaintiff has denied signing or agreeing to any arbitration agreement, but finds that Uber has established that Plaintiff "confirmed" or "consented to" the Terms of Service containing the Arbitration Agreement on at least 4 separate occasions. The court also finds that the risk of inconsistent rulings is not a sufficient ground to deny enforcing the arbitration agreement.

As a result, the court grants the motion to compel arbitration and orders the entire case and each of the parties to arbitration. The court seeks oral argument from Uber regarding Plaintiff's foundation objection to the Yu declaration, and will set an arbitration status conference approximately 9 months out.
