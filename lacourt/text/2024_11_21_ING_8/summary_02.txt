Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by LCM Defendants (Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center Torrance and Providence Little Company of Mary Transitional Care Center) to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff Susan Rosak. The demurrer argues that the FAC fails to state a cause of action for Elder Abuse and is uncertain and not stated with sufficient particularity. The Judge finds that the additional allegations added to the FAC cure the deficiencies previously identified and that the FAC now asserts that LCM Defendants failed to provide medical care despite creating a skin integrity care plan. The Judge also finds that the FAC links LCM Defendants' understaffing to Plaintiff's injury. Therefore, the demurrer is OVERRULED. LCM's Answer is due within 20 days.
