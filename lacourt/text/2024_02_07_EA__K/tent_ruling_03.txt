A Case  Management Conference is set for February 7, 2024. 1-4.      Motion to Compel Seidner PMK  Deposition, Motion to Compel Polaris PMK Deposition, Motion for Sharing  Protective Order and Motion for Protective Order Re: Rey Deposition The court’s December  8, 2023 minute order reflects that the above motions were continued on that  date to February 7, 2023. The minute order further reflects that “[t]he Motions  to Compel date will be reset on 2/7/2024.” The court, then,  will continue the hearing on the above motions to April 10, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. Mendoza’s  counsel is to provide notice. 5.         Motion to Compel  Arbitration Seidner renews its  previously heard motion for an order compelling contractual arbitration and  staying the instant action pending the completion of arbitration. Joinder Rey’s joinder is granted as timely. Polaris’s joinder is  denied as untimely. Merits The motion is denied. Seidner brings the instant motion  pursuant to (1) Code of Civil Procedure § 1008, subdivision (b), (2) court’s  inherent authority under Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094 and  pursuant to (3) the court’s alleged denial of the initial motion without  prejudice “pursuant to the filing [of] a renewed motion based on newly  discovered facts to show the nature of the relationship between Rey and  [P]laintiff. The court expressed it would use its discretion and consider such  a motion brought on the strength of newly discovered evidence.” (Motion,  2:13-17). First, the court declines to revisit its September 14, 2023  order denying Seidner’s original motion to compel arbitration pursuant to Le  Francois, supra, 35 Cal.4th at 1105 [i.e., a trial court has the inherent  authority “to reconsider its prior interim rulings on its own motion”]. “[I]n order to  grant reconsideration on its own motion, the trial court must conclude that its  earlier ruling was wrong, and change that ruling based on the evidence originally submitted.” (In re  Marriage of Barthold (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1314 [emphasis theirs].)  The court does not take this position. Next, the court disagrees with Seidner’s characterization of  the court’s remarks made during the September 14, 2023 hearing. Seidner has  attached a copy of the reporter’s transcript for the September 14, 2023  hearing, during which time the following exchange was held:          MR. GUTIERREZ: . . . So I guess my  thought or my question to the court  is, given that the court’s  tentative is to deny, am I safe to presume that it’s a            denial without prejudice? That is  we do develop that subsequent information,  we can renew the motion to compel?   THE COURT: I don’t—I think at a  certain point you’ve had that opportunity  now, Mr. Gutierrez, and you haven’t  come up with it. I don’t—you know, that’s  a –let me stop you there before—and  I’ll let you finish. I don’t know, you know,  whether or not these motions to  compel arbitration, if there is some way, some  how, to seek leave.   And if I—certainly if I have the  discretion at a later point in time—if I have  it—I’ll exercise it. I’m just not  clear exactly, you know, when that discretion  would be less than –lessened or if  it remains the same throughout the course of  the litigation. Because obviously  there are prejudice issues going forward; right?  And I think—   MR. GUTIERREZ: Right.   THE COURT: --That’s where the court  would have to balance that, So you  know more at this point than I do  whether or not you could file it with  prejudice. My only issue today is  I’m going to deny your motion. . .    (Redfield Decl., ¶ 2(b), Exh. E, 8:19-9:16).  Finally, the court rejects Seidner’s assertion that Rey’s  October 4, 2023 voluntary statement constitutes “new or different facts,  circumstances, or law” warranting reconsideration pursuant to  Code of Civil Procedure § 1008, subdivision  (b). That code section provides, in relevant part, as follows: A party who originally made an  application for an order which was refused  in whole or part, or granted  conditionally or on terms, may make a  subsequent application for the same  order upon new or different facts,  circumstances, or law, in which case  it shall be shown by affidavit what  application was made before, when  and to what judge, what order or decisions  were made, and what new or different  facts, circumstances, or law are claimed  to be shown. . .   Seidner correctly notes that a renewal motion has no time  limit. (Randy’s Trucking, Inc. v. Superior Court of Kern County (2023)  91 Cal.App.5th 818, 846). However, “[the burden under section 1008 is  comparable to that of a party seeking a new trial on the ground of newly  discovered evidence: the information must be such that the moving party could  not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced it at the trial.” (New  York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-213.) Here, Seidner’s original motion to compel arbitration was  filed on May 19, 2023 and taken under submission after hearing on June 14,  2023; on that latter date, the court continued the hearing to July 13, 2023,  ordered Polaris and Rey to advise the court whether they intended to join the  instant motion and, if so, to provide authority to allow for such joinder and  ordered Rey to provide any factual evidence in support of her contention that  Plaintiff should be bound by the Arbitration Provision in the Vehicle Sales  Contract. Polaris and Rey filed joinders on June 29, 2023 and July 12,  2023, respectively. On July 13, 2023, the court continued the hearing on the  motion to compel arbitration to August 31, 2023. On August 29, 2023, the court  continued the scheduled August 31, 2023 hearing on the motion to September 14,  2023. Seidner argues that “at the time it filed its initial motion  to compel arbitration, [Seidner] did not know of the principal facts upon which  it bases its renewed motion. Although [Seidner] had learned from Rey’s counsel  that plaintiff and Rey had a relationship and co-parented the minor involved in  the Razor accident, [it] lacked any knowledge of the facts specific to the  purchase of the Razor.” (Motion, 4:15-20). Seidner posits that it “simply did  not have access to the newly discovered facts until Rey expressed a willingness  to cooperate with [it]—which occurred only after the court denied [its] initial  motion and plaintiff’s counsel objected to the subsequently notice[d]  deposition of Rey. (See Redfield Decl., ¶¶ 4-5).” Redfield’s declaration, however, is silent on what efforts,  if any, his office made to reach out to Rey’s counsel at any time during the four  months between when the initial motion was filed and when it was ruled upon  to obtain a declaration from Rey regarding her relationship with Plaintiff and  the circumstances surrounding the purchase of the subject vehicle. The instant  motion, in fact, acknowledges that Rey’s counsel volunteered information to  Seidner relative to the existence of Plaintiff’s and Rey’s relationship and  co-parenting of the minor involved in the incident in the first instance. Again,  the “information must be such that the moving party could not, with  reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced it at the trial.” (New  York Times Co., supra, 135 Cal.App.4th at 212-213 [Emphasis added].) Seidner  argues that Rey is its adversary and has separate counsel. (Reply, 5:2-3). The  latter point is, of course, true; the former point is also true, to the extent  that Seidner has cross-complained against Rey; however, Rey and Seidner’s  interests were aligned with respect to the initial motion to compel, as  evidenced by Rey’s joinder to same. The motion is  denied.
