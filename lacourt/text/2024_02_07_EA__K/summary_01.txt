And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion of Plaintiffs Zia Abhari and Amir Shamloo to vacate several null and void dispositions, alleging extrinsic fraud. The Plaintiffs contend that Gordes Hospitality, Inc. and LVGEM Hotel Corporation engaged in fraud in the inducement, breach of contract, and other wrongdoing. The court finds that the Plaintiffs have failed to specifically identify which court orders they contend must be vacated and that the Defendants have provided sufficient evidence to support their positions. The court also finds that the alleged fraud was not extrinsic, but rather a result of the Plaintiffs' own failure to adequately communicate with the Defendants. Therefore, the motion to vacate is denied.
