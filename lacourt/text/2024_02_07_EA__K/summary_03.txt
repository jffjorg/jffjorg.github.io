Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that the hearing on the motions to compel depositions and arbitration will be continued to April 10, 2024. The court also denied Seidner's motion to compel arbitration and stay action. The motion was denied because Seidner failed to show that it could not have discovered the information it relies on earlier, and because the court did not believe that Seidner's characterization of the court's remarks made during the September 14, 2023 hearing was accurate. The court also rejected Seidner's assertion that Rey's October 4, 2023 voluntary statement constitutes "new or different facts, circumstances, or law" warranting reconsideration.
