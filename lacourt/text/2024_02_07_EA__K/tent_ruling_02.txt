1.                 
The PMK at Polaris regarding complaints pertaining to
rollover accidents in Polaris UTVs;
2.

The PMK at Polaris regarding the number of right arm
injuries/amputations of 
            individuals
involved in passenger side leaning rollovers resulting in complaints pertaining
to rollovers in Polaris UTVs; and 
5.                 
The PMK at Polaris regarding any efforts by Polaris to
analyze the correlation between right arm injuries in passenger side leading
rollovers with left arm injuries in driver side leaning rollovers and any
attempt to mitigate such injuries.
Plaintiffs also move the court for orders that Polaris
provide documents responsive to the concurrent document request three business
days prior to the deposition, that Polaris’ objections to the deposition be
overruled, and that Polaris produce a privilege log if applicable.
The court will continue the hearing on the instant
motion, to April 10, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. At the outset, the court queries whether
or not Plaintiffs have provided notice of the February 7, 2024 hearing date
after having the instant motion placed back onto the law and motion calendar on
or about January 9, 2024. There is nothing on ecourt (i.e., as of January 30,
2024, 2:53 p.m.) reflecting that such notice was given. Plaintiffs are
instructed to file proof of notice of the continued hearing date at or before
the time of the hearing.
Additionally, the court notes that none of the
exhibits referenced in the Declaration of John P. Kristensen (“Kristensen”)
accompanying the instant motion have, in fact, been attached. Plaintiffs’
counsel is requested to re-file and serve Kristensen’s declaration with
Exhibits 1-6 forthwith. Counsel for Plaintiffs is to provide notice
