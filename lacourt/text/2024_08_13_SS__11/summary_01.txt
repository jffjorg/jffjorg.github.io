Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion to dismiss/stay the action and the arbitration motion. The court denies Ohno's motion to dismiss/stay the action without prejudice, meaning that the action will continue in California. The court finds that Malta is not a suitable forum for the action, and Ohno has failed to demonstrate that all defendants are subject to jurisdiction in Malta.

Regarding the arbitration motion, the court denies Ohno's motion to arbitrate the claims of Prasad Hurra, David Kim, Artemio Verduzco, David Kwon, and Young Jae Kwon. The court finds that Ohno has failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish the existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties. The court also finds that the arbitration clause in the White Papers is unenforceable, as it is an unauthenticated browsewrap agreement.
