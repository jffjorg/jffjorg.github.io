cases have stated that the motion must be denied unless defendant establishes
that California is a ‘seriously inconvenient’ forum.”  (Id. at ¶ 3:408.8.)  But, “where plaintiff is a nonresident, it is
error for the trial court to impose the ‘seriously inconvenient’ burden on
defendant.”  (Ibid.)  “To the extent this standard is appropriate .
. . , it applies only when defendant seeks dismissal of the action on forum non conveniens
grounds.  It does not apply when
defendant seeks a stay of the action.” 
(Ibid., emphasis in original.)

Ohno states that, if nothing else, the Court should compel Verduzco’s claims to
arbitration since he bought Hybrid Tokens while the White Paper with the
arbitration clause was in force.  (See
Reply, p. 11.)  
 
The Court disagrees.  Again, the White Paper is unauthenticated,
and Ohno fails to show that Verduzco accessed it.  Even assuming he accessed it, the record is
inconclusive about whether the website utilized browsewrap features or
clickwrap features, which is significant to the question of enforceability.
