And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel arbitration and a motion to stay the action. The plaintiff, Verduzco, claims that the arbitration clause in the White Paper was in force when he bought Hybrid Tokens. However, the White Paper is unauthenticated, and the record is inconclusive about whether the website utilized browsewrap or clickwrap features, which is significant to the question of enforceability. The judge disagrees with the defendant's claim that the arbitration clause should be enforced and does not need to consider the private-interest and public-interest factors. The judge also notes that California is not a "seriously inconvenient" forum and that the burden of proving this should not be imposed on the defendant.
