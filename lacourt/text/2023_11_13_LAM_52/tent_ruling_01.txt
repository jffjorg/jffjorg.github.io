  Case Number:  23STCV03952    Hearing Date:   November 13, 2023    Dept:  52 Plaintiff
David Mathews’ Demurrer to Defendants’ First Amended Answer
Plaintiff David
Mathews demurs to the 7th-11th, 13th, 15th-18th, 20th, 22nd, 25th-27th, 30th,
and 31st affirmative defenses alleged in the first amended answer by defendants
Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Doc McGhee, and GAPP 2002 Ltd.
Rather
than denying the plaintiff’s allegations, affirmative defenses assert new
allegations that would defeat the plaintiff’s claims.  (CCP § 431.30(b); FPI Development, Inc. v.
Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 383-385.)  Affirmative defenses must not be pled as
“terse legal conclusions,” but “rather … as facts averred as carefully and with
as much detail as the facts which constitute the cause of action and are
alleged in the complaint.” (In re
Quantification Settlement Agreement Cases (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 758,
812-13, internal quotes and citations omitted.) 
Plaintiff
demurs to 17 affirmative defenses.  For
16 of the 17 defenses, plaintiff makes only conclusory arguments with no
citation to authority.  “The court may
construe the absence of a memorandum as an admission that the motion or special
demurrer is not meritorious and cause for its denial and, in the case of a
demurrer, as a waiver of all grounds not supported.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(a).)  
For
example, the 17th affirmative defense states, “Answering Defendants’ alleged
acts of which Plaintiff complains were based on reasonable factors other than
his alleged whistleblower status or other prohibited factor due, in part, to
the regularly increasing costs of Plaintiff’s work for certain Answering
Defendants.”  (FAA, ¶ 17.)  Plaintiff argues, “Defendants fail to provide
what reasonable factors these acts were based on.”  (Demurrer, p. 9.)  But they allege an ultimate fact constituting
such a factor: “the regularly increasing costs of Plaintiff’s work.”
As
another example, the 26th affirmative defense states, “Plaintiff’s claim that
he was unlawfully denied his right to meal and rest periods is barred due to
his status as an Independent Contractor, and further to the extent that he
affirmatively chose not to take or voluntarily waived meal periods, which were
provided, and rest breaks, which were authorized and permitted despite his
status as an Independent Contractor.” 
(FAA, ¶ 26.)  
Without
citing any authority, plaintiff argues, “California
law requires there be written notice and an employee sign-off before any meal
break can be waived.” 
(Demurrer, p. 11.)  That may apply
if the employee is not relieved of all duty (see Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, § 11100, subd. 11(C), but this defense asserts
that defendants provided the breaks, but plaintiff chose not to take them—not
that defendants failed to relieve him of duty. 
“[T]he
employer is not obligated to police meal breaks and ensure no work thereafter
is performed.  Bona fide relief from duty
and the relinquishing of control satisfies the employer’s obligations, and work
by a relieved employee during a meal break does not thereby place the employer
in violation of its obligations and create liability for premium pay.”  (Brinker Restaurant Corp. v. Superior
Court (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1004, 1040–1041.)
Plaintiff
only cites authority supporting the demurrer to the 16th affirmative defense,
that “Defendants would have made the same decisions with respect to Plaintiff’s
claims pursuant to valid business justification due to, in part, the regularly
increasing costs of Plaintiff’s work for certain Answering Defendants.”  (FAA, ¶ 16.) 
Plaintiff alleges whistleblower retaliation in violation of Labor Code
section 1102.5 and argues the same-decision defense only applies to FEHA claims.  (Demurrer, p. 9, citing Harris v. City of
Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 233-234 (Harris.))  That is incorrect.  Harris applies the same-decision defense
to FEHA but does not preclude applying it to other forms of employment
discrimination or retaliation.  To the
contrary, the Legislature codified the same-decision defense to whistleblower
retaliation.  (Lab. Code, § 1102.6 [“the
employer shall have the burden of proof to demonstrate by clear and convincing
evidence that the alleged action would have occurred for legitimate,
independent reasons even if the employee had not engaged in activities
protected by Section 1102.5”]; Lawson v. PPG Architectural Finishes, Inc.
(2022) 12 Cal.5th 703, 716 [section 1102.6 “codifi(ed) the burden on the
employer to make out its same-decision defense”].)
Disposition
            Plaintiff David Mathews’ demurrer to the first amended
answer by defendants Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Doc McGhee, and GAPP 2002 Ltd.
is overruled.
