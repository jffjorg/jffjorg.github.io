And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by plaintiff David Mathews to the first amended answer by defendants Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Doc McGhee, and GAPP 2002 Ltd. The judge has determined that the plaintiff's demurrer to the affirmative defenses is without merit and has overruled the demurrer. Specifically, the judge found that the affirmative defenses are pled as facts, not terse legal conclusions, and that the plaintiff's arguments against the defenses are conclusory and lack citation to authority. The judge also found that the same-decision defense, which is applicable to whistleblower retaliation claims, was correctly applied by the defendants. The judge's ruling is based on the laws and regulations cited in the document, including California Code of Regulations, title 8, section 11100, subdivision 11(C), Labor Code, sections 1102.5 and 1102.6, and various California Appellate Court decisions.
