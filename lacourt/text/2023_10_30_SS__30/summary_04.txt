And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion filed by Indian Harbor Insurance Company to have the plaintiff, Tinnia Jonsdottir, submit to a mental examination. The company is seeking to have Dr. Ari Kalechstein perform the examination to assist in understanding the origin, nature, and severity of the plaintiff's alleged mental difficulties. The plaintiff has argued that the examination would violate their privacy rights and is unlikely to lead to admissible evidence. However, the court has found that the examination is necessary to address the breadth of complaints made by the plaintiff regarding their mental status post-accident. The court has ordered the plaintiff to sit for the mental examination within 30 days of notice of the ruling.
