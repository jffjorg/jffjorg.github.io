And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's motions to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for production of documents are granted. The plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses without objections within 20 days. The defendant's requests for sanctions are denied. The court declines to award sanctions as the motions are unopposed. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendant's discovery demands, despite being granted a thirty-day extension and multiple attempts by the defendant to meet and confer. The court notes that a party waives objections to a discovery request when it does not serve a timely response to the request, as stated in CCP 2030.290(a).
