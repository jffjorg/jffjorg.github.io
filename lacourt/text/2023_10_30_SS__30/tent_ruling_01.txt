  Case Number:  19STCV21811    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2023    Dept:  30 EARL HACKETT, JR. vs ISB TRANSPORT LTD., et al.Motion to Continue the Trial DateTENTATIVEDefendant’s motion to continue trial and all related deadlines is DENIED.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.DISCUSSIONGiven the age of the case, the currently scheduled discovery, and the prejudice to the opposing side, the Court finds that no good cause exists to continue the trial date. Enough time exists for all parties to be ready for trial. Further, both sides are not equally enthusiastic about mediating. Thus, the Court puts little weight on the possibility of mediation as ground to continue the trial in this aged case.
