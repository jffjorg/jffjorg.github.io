Here is the English-text summary:

The judge denies the defendant's motion to continue the trial date and all related deadlines. The judge finds that no good cause exists to continue the trial date, citing the age of the case and the existing discovery schedule, which may prejudice the opposing party. Additionally, the judge notes that both parties are not equally enthusiastic about mediation, which the judge does not consider a sufficient reason to continue the trial. The judge orders the moving party to give notice and concludes that enough time exists for all parties to be ready for trial.
