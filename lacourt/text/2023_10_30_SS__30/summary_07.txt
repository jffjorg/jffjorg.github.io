Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the motion to compel the Plaintiff to submit to a physical examination. The Plaintiff failed to attend a scheduled examination on May 17, 2023, and the Defendant argues that good cause exists to compel the Plaintiff to submit to the examination as it has prevented preparation for trial and the defense cannot analyze the possibility of settlement. The Judge finds that good cause exists to compel the Plaintiff to submit to a medical examination, as the Plaintiff has put her physical well-being in controversy for this matter. The Plaintiff must attend a medical examination within 30 days. The Defendant's request for sanctions is denied as the motion is unopposed.
