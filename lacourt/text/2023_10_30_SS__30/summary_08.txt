And here is the English-text summary:

The Tentative Ruling by the Judge denies the Motion to Compel Arbitration filed by Bird Rides, Inc. The dispute revolves around whether the arbitration agreement is enforceable against a minor who misrepresented their age and executed the agreement in their father's name. The Judge agrees with the Plaintiff's contentions that a minor does not have competency to enter into a contract, and that the misrepresentations made by the minor do not change this analysis. The Judge also finds that the agreement cannot be enforced against the father, as there was no authorization for the minor to enter into the agreement using the father's name. Therefore, the Motion to Compel Arbitration is denied.
