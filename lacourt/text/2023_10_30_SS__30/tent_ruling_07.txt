 Case Number:  22STCV09640    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2023    Dept:  30 CLIFSHEENA YEARWOOD vs LULA MAE MOUTON, et al.Motion to Compel IME of PlaintiffTENTATIVEThe Motion to Compel Plaintiff to submit to a physical examination is GRANTED. Plaintiff must submit to a physical examination within 30 days. Request for Sanction is DENIED.  Moving party to give notice.DISCUSSIONDefendant Mouton moves to compel Plaintiff to comply with a demand for a physical examination. An examination was scheduled for May 17, 2023, with Dr. Nick Shamie, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon. However, Plaintiff did not appear for the exam. Defendant argues that good cause exists to comply compliance because Plaintiff’s failure to attend the examination has “prevented preparation for trial” and the defense “cannot analyze the possibility of settlement.” (Motion 4: 13-16.)As of October 26, 2023, no opposition has been filed.The Court finds that good cause exists to compel Plaintiff to submit to a medical examination. The complaint alleges that Plaintiff sustained serious bodily injuries due to the metal security gate falling on top of Plaintiff. (Comp. ¶ 19-21.) As Plaintiff has put her physical well-being in controversy for this matter, the Court finds that a physical examination is appropriate. Therefore, based on CCP § 2032.250, Plaintiff must attend a medical. Defendant attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff to resolve the issue, specifically as to why Plaintiff failed to attend the May 2023 examination, but it was not resolved. (Dec. Leeper, ¶ 7 Ex. D.) Thus, Defendant is in compliance with CCP § 2032.250. As this motion is unopposed, the Court declines to award sanctions.
