 Case Number:  22STCV06773    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2023    Dept:  30 TIMOTHY MOSES, AN INDIVIDUAL vs LA OLYMPIC HOTEL, UNKNOWN ENTITY, et al.Motion to Quash Service of SummonsTENTATIVEThe Motion to Squash Service of Summons and Complaint is GRANTED.  Moving party to give notice.DISCUSSIONDefendant asserts that the proof of service filed with the Court is false.Firstly, Defendant states that although his home address is 2796 Creston Drive in Los Angeles, the home is part of a gated community that is difficult to access. (Declaration of James Tuggle, hereinafter, “Tuggle Dec.”, ¶ 8.) Defendant states that neither himself nor any other occupant of the home was notified of a visitor at the times and dates stated on the proofs of service, which are: 8:58pm on February 7, 2023 and 8:58am on February 12. (See Motion, Exh. 1.) Second, Defendant claims the description of the person served within the proofs of service is inaccurate. The proof of service describes Defendant as an 80-year-old Caucasian male, weighing 160 pounds, standing at 5 feet 11 inches, and having white hair. (Id.) Defendant states that he is heavier than 160 pounds, stands at 5 feet 6 inches, and has gray hair. (Tuggle Dec., ¶ 10.)Third, Defendant argues that in addition to failing to serve him personally, Plaintiff made no effort to use other manners of service like serving Defendant at his place of business at 725 S Westlake Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90057, where a business manager would have been present to accept service. (Tuggle Dec., ¶ 7.) Finally, it appears that Plaintiff waited over a year to attempt service, and Defendant states that the only manner in which he found out about the instant case was the Request for Entry of Default mailed to his home on May 22, 2023. The instant Motion was filed three days later, with no opposition following.“When a motion to quash is properly brought, the burden of proof is placed upon the plaintiff to establish the facts of jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.” Aquila, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 556, 568. Here, Plaintiff has filed no opposition and thus does not meet its burden to this regularly noticed motion.
