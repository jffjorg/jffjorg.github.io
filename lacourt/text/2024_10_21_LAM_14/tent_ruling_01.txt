Legal Standard
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve
a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order,
or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., section
473(b).)
“[I]t is the policy of the law to bring about a trial on the merits
whenever possible, so that any doubts which may exist should be resolved in
favor of the application, to the end of securing to a litigant his day in court
and a trial upon the merits.”  (Frank E. Beckett Co. v. Bobbitt (1960)
180 Cal.App.2d Supp. 921, 928 (Bobbitt).)  “Even in a case where
the showing under section 473 is not strong, or where there is any doubt as to
setting aside of a default, such doubt should be resolved in favor of the
application.”  (Ibid., quoting Van Dyke v. MacMillan (1958)
162 Cal.App.2d 594, 598, italics in Bobbitt.) 
Discussion
Cross-Defendant C&C Concrete Works is a
Cross-Defendant named in the Cross-Complaint filed by Hovanes Pashyan. C&C
moves to set aside entry of default on the grounds that it failed to answer the
Complaint because its principal, Jesus Ortiz Camacho, mistakenly believed that Pashyan’s
attorney, Alexander Kasendorf, was going to dismiss C&C from this case.
(Camacho Decl., ¶f.) Camacho testifies and provides evidence that he emailed a
letter to Plaintiff’s counsel explaining that Plaintiff sued the wrong company.
(Id.) C&C was never retained by Plaintiff and the company did not
even exist when the construction work at issue was completed. (Id.)
Kasendorf promised to dismiss C&C after receiving the letter. (Id.)
The Court notes that although C&C states it failed
to answer the Complaint and that it contacted Plaintiff’s counsel, it is clear
from the moving papers that C&C is referring to the Cross-Complaint filed
by Pashyan and that C&C contacted Pashyan’s attorney regarding this
dispute. 
The Court is satisfied that C&C failed to respond
to Pashyan’s Cross-Complaint because its principal mistakenly believed that Pashyan’s
attorney, Kasendorf, would dismiss C&C from the Cross-Complaint.
Additionally, the law favors cases being tried on their merits. Finally, the
motion is unopposed. The lack of an opposition amounts to a concession that the
motion is meritorious. (See California Rules of Court Rule 3.1113(a); see also
Rule 3.1320(f); Herzberg v. County of Plumas (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th
1, 20 (the party who fails to argue an issue abandons that issue).)
Because C&C meets the requirements of Code Civ.
Proc., section 473, the motion to set aside default judgment is GRANTED.
Conclusion
C&C Concrete Works’ motion to set aside entry of
default is GRANTED. C&C is to file its Answer within 30 days of receiving
notice of this order.
