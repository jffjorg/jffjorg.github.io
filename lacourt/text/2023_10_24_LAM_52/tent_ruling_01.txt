  Case Number:  21STCV08677    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2023    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Basilio Nicolas’s Motion to
Enforce Settlement
Plaintiff
Basilio Nicolas moves to enforce the parties’ settlement agreement and to enter
judgment against defendant BGB Distributions, Inc.  “If parties to pending litigation stipulate,
in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court... for
settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.”  (CCP § 664.6(a).)  
The
parties stipulated in writing to settle this action.  They signed a “mediator’s proposal” to settle
the case for $30,000.  (Sterling Decl.,
¶¶ 5-9, Exs. A-B.)  The proposal provides
that if no long form settlement agreement is executed, “this executed and
accepted Mediator’s Proposal shall be treated as an enforceable, binding
settlement agreement pursuant to [Code of Civil Procedure section] §
664.6.”  (Id., Ex. A.)
Defendant
opposes this motion only on the basis that it cannot afford to pay the $30,000
in three monthly installments as provided in the settlement agreement.  (Opp., Noorani Decl., ¶ 3.)   That is not a valid reason to deny the
motion or to not enter judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6.  
Plaintiff
Basilio Nicolas’s motion to enforce settlement is granted.  The court enters judgment for plaintiff
Basilio Nicolas against defendant BGB Distributions, Inc. in the amount of
$30,000.
