```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement and enters judgment against the defendant in the amount of $30,000. The parties had stipulated to settle the case in writing and signed a mediator's proposal to settle the case for $30,000. The proposal specifies that if no long-form settlement agreement is executed, it shall be treated as an enforceable and binding settlement agreement. The defendant opposes the motion only on the basis that it cannot afford to pay the settlement amount in three monthly installments. However, the judge finds that this is not a valid reason to deny the motion or to not enter judgment, and therefore grants the motion and enters judgment in favor of the plaintiff.
