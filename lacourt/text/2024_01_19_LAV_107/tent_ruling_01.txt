BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff is suing as assignee of State
Compensation Insurance Fund (“Assignor”). 
Assignor provided Defendant Mirko Pavlovich with worker’s compensation
insurance pursuant to two policies of insurance, Policy Nos. 9107037-17 and 9258320-19.  Defendant Pavlovich breached the insurance
policies by failing to pay the premiums due thereon.  Plaintiff alleges an outstanding balance of
$94,360.60 on Policy No. 9107037-17 and $23,928.87 on Policy No.
9258320-19.  
            On July 1, 2022, Plaintiff filed a
complaint alleging (1) breach of contract; (2) open book account; (3) account
stated; and (4) reasonable value.  Defendant
Pavlovich filed an answer on November 7, 2022. 
A non-jury trial is scheduled for July 1, 2024. 
 
DISCUSSION
Applicable Law
 
CCP § 2031.310
(a) On receipt of a
response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the
demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand
if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply:
            (1) A statement of compliance with
the demand is incomplete.
            (2) A representation of inability to
comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
            (3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.
(b) A motion under
subdivision (a) shall comply with each of the following:
            (1) The motion shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
demand.
            (2) The motion shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.
            (3) In lieu of a separate statement
required under the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving
party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request and each response in
dispute.
(c) Unless notice
of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response,
or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date
to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in writing,
the demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to the
demand.
… (h) Except as
provided in subdivision (j), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further
response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.
            Where a party is seeking to compel
further responses to requests for document production, the burden is on the
moving party to show both relevance to the subject matter and specific facts
justifying discovery. (CCP §2031.310(b)(1); Kirkland v. Supr. Ct. (2002)
95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98 (“Once good cause was shown, the burden shifted to
Kirkland to justify his objection”); Glenfed Develop. Corp. v. Superior
Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117.) Once good cause is established by
the moving party, the burden then shifts to the responding party to justify any
objections made to document disclosure. (Hartbrodt v. Burke (1996, 2nd
Dist.) 42 Cal.App.4th 168, 172-174.)
 
Application to
Facts
 
            Meet and Confer
            Plaintiff served the RFPs on
November 15, 2022 and granted an extension to respond until January 18,
2023.  (Jun Dec., ¶¶1, 2.)  Defendant did not serve his first set of
responses until January 27, 2023, after the extended deadline expired.  (Jun Dec., ¶3.)  Parties met and conferred by correspondence
and telephonically from February through April 2023 on these initial responses.  Parties attended an IDC with the Court on
June 1, 2023.  (Jun Dec., ¶6.)  At the IDC, Defendant agreed to produce
further responses by July 7, 2023 and the agreement was set forth in the
Court’s July 7, 2023 minute order.  (Jun
Dec., ¶6.)  
            
Defendant failed to
provide further responses by July 7, 2023 in violation of the Court’s June 1,
2023 order.  (Jun Dec., ¶6.)  Defendant finally provided untimely further
responses on August 15, 2023.  (Jun Dec.,
¶8.)  Parties met and conferred by email
and telephonically regarding these further responses from September through
November 1, 2023.  (Jun Dec.,
¶¶9-10).  At the November 1, 2023, meet
and confer, Defendant indicated that Plaintiff should proceed with its motions
to compel further responses on discovery and insisted the responses were
sufficient.  (Jun Dec., ¶10.)  
 
            Parties have engaged in extensive
meet and confer efforts regarding Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories
(Set One).  Plaintiff establishes
compliance with the meet and confer requirement under CCP §2030.310(b).  
 
Defendant’s
responses are insufficient and further responses are required
 
Defendant’s
responses to RFP Nos. 5 and 6 are insufficient. 
Defendant provided identical further responses to both RFP Nos. 5 and 6:
“Defendant previously produced check registers as part of its audit but cannot
currently locate them, even after diligent search and inquiry. Plaintiff,
however, has confirmed that it has them. Hence this request is burdensome and
harassing.”  (Separate Statement, Further
Response to Request for Production No. 5 and Further Responses to Request for
Production No. 6, 2:11-13 and 5:16-18.)  
 
The responses fail
to satisfy the requirements of CCP §§2031.210 and 2031.230.  Defendant’s responses indicate an inability
to comply but fails to “affirm that a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry
has been made in an effort to comply with that demand. This statement shall
also specify whether the inability to comply is because the particular item or
category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or
stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or
control of the responding party. The statement shall set forth the name and
address of any natural person or organization known or believed by that party
to have possession, custody, or control of that item or category of item.”  (CCP §2031.230.)  
 
Defendant must
serve further responses in compliance with CCP §2031.230 (1) indicating a
“diligent search and a reasonable inquiry has been made”; (2) whether
Defendant’s inability to comply is because the particular item or category has
never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has
never been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of
Defendant; and (3) setting forth the name and address of any natural person or
organization known or believed by Defendant to have possession, custody, or
control of that item or category of item. 
(CCP §2031.230.)  
 
Defense counsel
filed a declaration on January 12, 2024, indicating that further responses have
already been served to the RFP Nos. 5 and 6. 
Defense counsel indicates Defendant has already provided all information
in his possession, custody and control.  (Sina
Dec., ¶2.)  Defense counsel also maintains
the sanctions are excessive and egregiously inflated.  (Id.)
 
Defense counsel did
not provide copies of those further responses with the January 12, 2024,
declaration, nor does defense counsel indicate when those further responses
were served.  As such, the motion is not
moot.  
Plaintiff’s Motion
to Compel Further Responses to RFP Nos. 5-6 is GRANTED.  Defendant is ordered to serve further
responses to RFP Nos. 5 and 6 in compliance with CCP §§2031.210 and 2031.230
within 20 days.  
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests
sanctions in the amount of $4,560 against Defendant Pavlovich and his counsel,
Reza Sina.  The requested sanctions are
based on 6 hours of motion preparation, 3 hours of anticipated time to review
any opposition, prepare a reply and prepare and attend the hearing on this
motion at $500/hr.  A two-paragraph
declaration opposition was filed but no reply was filed as of January 16,
2024.  Plaintiff’s instant motion is
largely duplicative of Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to Special
Interrogatory Nos. 15-35.  Plaintiff is
awarded $2000 in sanctions and $60 in filing fees for a total of $2,060.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses from Defendant Mirko Pavlovich to RFP Nos.
5-6 (Set One) is GRANTED.  Pavlovich is
ordered to serve further responses to RFP Nos. 5-6 (Set One) within 20
days.  Pavlovich and counsel Sina are
ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of $2,060 within 20 days.  
 
            Plaintiff to give notice.
