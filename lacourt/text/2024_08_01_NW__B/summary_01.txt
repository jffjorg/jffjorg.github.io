Summary:

The Judge, Karen Moskowitz, has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants in the case of Adina Avila, Aaron Guerra, and Margarita Chavez (plaintiffs) against Daniel Chan, Chanchenda Hou, Chanvachana Hou, and Carolyn Nguyen (defendants). The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the complaint and argues that the defendants do not have a duty to protect the plaintiffs.

The Judge finds that the demurrer is sustained as to the causes of action for negligence and premises liability, but allows the plaintiffs 20 days to amend the complaint. The Judge also rejects the special demurrer for uncertainty, finding that the pleadings are sufficient despite some ambiguity.

The Judge concludes that the defendants do not have a duty to protect the plaintiffs, citing the lack of prior similar criminal incidents on the property and the uncertainty of the foreseeability of the harm. The Judge also notes that the plaintiffs' allegations of gang activity in the area are not sufficient to establish a duty of care.
