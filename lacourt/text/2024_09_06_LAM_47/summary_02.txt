And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that a plaintiff's motion to overrule a defendant's clawback demand and privilege objection will be continued to a later date. This decision comes after the plaintiff filed a notice regarding the documents at issue, but did not actually lodge the documents with the court. The judge cannot rule on the privilege objection without reviewing the documents, so the motion is being continued to give the plaintiff time to lodge the documents.
