Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Defendant Ford Motor Co.'s motion for a protective order in part, with modifications to the proposed order. The motion was brought under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.060, which allows a party to seek a protective order to protect against unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense.

The Judge found that Defendant demonstrated good cause for the issuance of a protective order to protect its confidential and proprietary information. The proposed order includes modifications to Paragraph 7, which clarifies the definition of "affiliated attorneys" and excludes mock jurors from accessing confidential documents. The order also includes revisions to Paragraph 8, which prohibits the posting or sale of Defendant's confidential documents on a website or internet-accessible repository.

The Judge disagreed with Plaintiff's objections to the proposed revisions, finding that they were reasonable and necessary to protect Defendant's confidential information. The Judge also found that the proposed modification to Paragraph 21, which requires the return or destruction of Defendant's confidential documents within 30 days of the case's conclusion, was reasonable and necessary.

The Judge's tentative ruling is subject to submission on by any party, and the Court will still conduct a hearing if any party appears.
