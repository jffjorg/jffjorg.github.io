 Case Number:  22STCV04378    Hearing Date:   September 6, 2024    Dept:  47 The Court is in receipt of Plaintiff’s Motion to Overrule
Defendants Clawback Demand and Privilege Objection pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.285, currently scheduled for September 6, 2024. Although
Plaintiff filed a Notice of Lodging of Document Conditionally Under Seal
regarding the materials at issue on that motion on June 28, 2024, it appears
that the documents themselves were never lodged with the Court. Since the Court
cannot rule on a privilege objection without reviewing the materials at issue,
Plaintiff’s Motion is CONTINUED to Thursday, September 19, 2024 at 1:30 PM.
Plaintiff is directed to deliver a copy of the documents to be lodged to the
Court on or before Thursday, September 12, 2024. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
