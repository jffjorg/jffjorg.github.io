And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) is granted in part and denied in part. The plaintiff is allowed to add causes of action for battery and breach of fiduciary duty, but the motion to add punitive damages is denied. The plaintiff failed to meet the requirements for alleging punitive damages, including providing sufficient evidence and arguing that they have met the "substantial probability" standard to prevail on the claim. The judge also notes that the motion was untimely, as the plaintiff was required to file the motion for leave to amend to add punitive damages claims by July 2023, but did not file the motion until September 1, 2023.
