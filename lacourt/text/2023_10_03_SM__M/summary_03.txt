The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) is granted in part and denied in part. The plaintiff is allowed to add causes of action for battery and breach of fiduciary duty, but the motion to add punitive damages is denied. The plaintiff failed to meet the requirements for alleging punitive damages, including providing sufficient evidence and arguing that they have met the "substantial probability" standard to prevail on the claim. The judge also notes that the motion was untimely, as the plaintiff was required to file the motion for leave to amend to add punitive damages claims by July 2023, but did not file the motion until September 1, 2023.

**English Summary:**

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to amend filed by Plaintiff Williams against The Medical Office of Dr. Jamie S. Schwartz. 

**The Ruling:**

* **Granting Leave to Amend:** The court will grant Plaintiff's request to amend the complaint to include new causes of action for battery and breach of fiduciary duty. The Plaintiff has adequately complied with procedural requirements for such an amendment.
* **Denying Leave to Amend for Punitive Damages:** The court will deny Plaintiff's request to add a claim for punitive damages. The Plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to meet the "substantial probability" standard required for such a claim against a healthcare provider under CCP § 425.13. Additionally, the motion was filed past the deadline set by the statute.



The judge finds that while the new claims for battery and breach of fiduciary duty are permissible, the Plaintiff's current evidence does not warrant the addition of punitive damages.

English text:

The tentative ruling for the case of Williams v. The Medical Office of Dr. Jamie S. Schwartz, et al. (case number 22SMCV01262) pertains to Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 473(a)(1) and in compliance with California Rule of Court, rule 3.1324. Plaintiff wishes to add causes of action for battery and breach of fiduciary duty. The Court will permit this amendment as Plaintiff complies with rule 3.1324 and provides the proposed allegations. However, Plaintiff fails to make the additional showings required for alleging punitive damages against a healthcare provider. Plaintiff does not notice the relevant statute, Code of Civil Procedure § 425.13, and does not present evidence or argument that they have met the "substantial probability" standard to prevail on the punitive damages claim. Furthermore, the motion is untimely as it was not filed within two years after the complaint was filed or not less than nine months before the date the matter is first set for trial, whichever is earlier. Accordingly, the motion for leave to amend to assert additional causes of action is granted, but the motion is denied to the extent that it seeks to add the punitive damages claim.
