```

And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the cross-complaint is sustained with leave to amend. The Judge finds that the cross-complaint does not adequately allege an inherent power imbalance in the client-construction manager relationship, which is required for liability under Civil Code section 51.9. The Judge notes that while the cross-complaint alleges that Vardi's conduct was rude, pushy, and potentially offensive, it does not allege facts that would support the existence of such a power imbalance. The Judge also finds that the conduct alleged in the cross-complaint, while pervasive and severe, does not necessarily rise to the level of harassing conduct under the statute.

The Judge gives Beischl leave to amend the cross-complaint to try to plead facts that would support the existence of an inherent power imbalance and to allege more specific facts about the harassing conduct. The Judge sets a deadline of 10 days for Beischl to file an amended cross-complaint.

Case Number: 22SMCV02820
Hearing Date: October 3, 2023
Dept: M
Case Name: Vardi v. Beischl, et al.

* The tentative ruling is in response to a demurrer to the cross-complaint for gender violence pursuant to Civil Code section 51.9
* The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend
* The legal standard for a demurrer is whether the complaint states a cause of action
* The court reads allegations liberally and in context, and defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice
* A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters
* A plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him
* A "demurrer does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law"
* A special demurrer for uncertainty is disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond
* Liberality in permitting amendment is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given
* It is an abuse of discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action
* The burden is on plaintiff to show in what manner plaintiff can amend the complaint, and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading
* Cross-Defendant Doron Vardi demurs to the sole cause of action for gender violence pursuant to Civil Code section 51.9 alleged by Cross-Complainant Adriana Beischl
* Vardi argues that Beischl is not a protected party under Section 51.9, Beischl is not a professional under Section 51.9, and Beischl fails to allege pervasive or severe harassment
* A defendant is liable for sexual harassment under Civil Code section 51.9 when (1) there is a business, service, or professional relationship between the plaintiff and defendant, (2) the defendant made unwelcome and pervasive or severe sexual advances, solicitations, sexual requests, demands for sexual compliance by the plaintiff, or engaged in other conduct of a sexual or hostile nature based on gender, and (3) as a result, the plaintiff suffered or will suffer economic loss or disadvantage or personal injury
* The business, service, or professional relationship may exist between the plaintiff and a person including, but not limited to, physician, psychotherapist, dentist, attorney, social worker, real estate agent, real estate appraiser, investor, accountant, banker, trust officer, financial planner loan officer, collection service, contractor, escrow loan officer, executor, trustee, administrator, landlord, property manager, teacher, elected official, lobbyist, director, or producer, or in a "relationship that is a substantially similar to any of the above"
* Cross-Defendant argues that the pled facts do not establish a qualifying relationship between himself and Cross-Complainant which would support liability under Civil Code section 51.9
* Cross-Defendant points out that he is the client in this situation, and not a professional as defined by the statute
* Cross-Defendant also argues that Beischl also is not a professional, because she is not a licensed contractor
* The court concurs that the defendant needs fall into the enumerated professions to be potentially liable under Section 51.9
* The court looks to the defendant’s status as a qualifying professional under the statute when interpreting the relationship requirements under Section 51.9
* As an alleged client of a construction manager, Cross-Defendant does not easily fit into any of the enumerated categories
* The court does not believe that such a relationship could exist in this context
* To allege a "substantially similar" relationship under Section 51.9, a complainant must allege facts which support an inherent power imbalance where one party is uniquely situated to exercise coercion or leverage over the other
* Beischl fails to allege that Vardi had an inherent power imbalance by virtue of his status as her client, such that he was uniquely situated to exercise coercion or leverage over Beischl
* The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend

In this tentative ruling, the judge is ruling on a demurrer to a cross-complaint for gender violence pursuant to Civil Code section 51.9. The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff is given the opportunity to correct any defects in the complaint. The legal standard for a demurrer is whether the complaint states a cause of action, and the court reads the allegations liberally and in context. A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. The burden is on the plaintiff to show in what manner they can amend the complaint and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.

In this case, the defendant, Doron Vardi, is demurring to the sole cause of action for gender violence pursuant to Civil Code section 51.9 alleged by the plaintiff, Adriana Beischl. Vardi argues that Beischl is not a protected party under Section 51.9, Beischl is not a professional under Section 51.9, and Beischl fails to allege pervasive or severe harassment. The court agrees with Vardi that the defendant needs to fall into the enumerated professions to be potentially liable under Section 51.9. The court also looks to the defendant’s status as a qualifying professional under the statute when interpreting the relationship requirements under Section 51.9.

The plaintiff, Beischl, is an alleged client of a construction manager and does not easily fit into any of the enumerated categories. The court does not believe that such a relationship could exist in this context. To allege a "substantially similar" relationship under Section 51.9, a complainant must allege facts which support an inherent power imbalance where one party is uniquely situated to exercise coercion or leverage over the other. In this case, the plaintiff has failed to allege that the defendant had an inherent power imbalance by virtue of his status as her client.

The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff is given the opportunity to correct any defects in the complaint. The plaintiff may file an amended cross-complaint within 10 days.
