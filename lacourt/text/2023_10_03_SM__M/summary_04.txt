And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the cross-complaint is sustained with leave to amend. The Judge finds that the cross-complaint does not adequately allege an inherent power imbalance in the client-construction manager relationship, which is required for liability under Civil Code section 51.9. The Judge notes that while the cross-complaint alleges that Vardi's conduct was rude, pushy, and potentially offensive, it does not allege facts that would support the existence of such a power imbalance. The Judge also finds that the conduct alleged in the cross-complaint, while pervasive and severe, does not necessarily rise to the level of harassing conduct under the statute.

The Judge gives Beischl leave to amend the cross-complaint to try to plead facts that would support the existence of an inherent power imbalance and to allege more specific facts about the harassing conduct. The Judge sets a deadline of 10 days for Beischl to file an amended cross-complaint.
