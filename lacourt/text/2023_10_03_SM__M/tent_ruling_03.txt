Leave to Amend 
 
If a party
wishes to amend a pleading after an answer has been filed, or after a demurrer
has been filed and after the hearing on the demurrer, or if he or she has
already amended the pleading as a matter of course, the party must obtain permission
from the court before amendment. (CCP §§ 473(a)(1), 576.) 
 
Motions
for leave to amend the pleadings are directed to the sound discretion of the
court. “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be
proper, allow a party to amend any pleading . . . .” (CCP § 473(a)(1); see CCP
§ 576.) Policy favors liberally granting leave to amend so that all disputed
matters between the parties may be resolved. (See Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422,
1428.) Absent prejudice to the adverse party, the court may permit amendments
to the complaint “at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial.”
(Atkinson v. Elk Corp.
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761 [internal quotes omitted].) Where leave is
sought to add entirely new claims, the court may grant leave to amend if the
new claims are based on the same general set of facts, and the amendment will
not prejudice the opposing party. (Austin
v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 596, 600-602; Glaser v. Meyers (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 770, 777 [holding
trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting amendment of complaint,
which originally alleged constructive eviction, to allege retaliatory eviction
where the new claim was based on the same general set of facts].)
 
Although
denial is rarely justified, a judge has discretion to deny leave to amend if
the party seeking the amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced
the opposing party. (Morgan v. Superior
Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530; Hirsa v. Superior Court
(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490). An opposing party is prejudiced where the
amendment would necessitate a trial delay along with a loss of critical
evidence, added preparation expense, increased burden of discovery, etc. (Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488 [leave properly
denied where plaintiff sought leave on the eve of trial, nearly two years after
the complaint was originally filed and gave no explanation for the delay which
prejudiced defendant who did not discover or depose many of the witnesses who
would support the new allegations and had not marshaled evidence in opposition
of the new allegations].)
 
Procedurally,
a motion for leave to amend must state with particularity what allegations are
to be amended. Namely, it must state what allegations in the previous pleading
are proposed to be deleted and/or added, if any, and where, by page, paragraph,
and line number. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(2)-(3).) The motion must be accompanied
by a declaration specifying: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for
amendment was not made earlier. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(b).) The motion must also be
accompanied by the proposed amended pleading, numbered to differentiate it from
the prior pleadings or amendments. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(1).) It is within the
court’s discretion to require compliance with Rule 3.1324 before granting leave
to amend. (Hataishi v. First American Home Buyers Protection Corp. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 1454, 1469.)
 
Claim for Punitive Damages
 
In any action¿for professional
negligence¿against a health care provider, no claim for punitive damages may be
included in an original complaint.¿¿(CCP,¿§ 425.13 (a).)¿Rather, a¿plaintiff
must file a motion¿for leave¿to amend the complaint and add a prayer for
punitive damages. 
¿ 
A¿motion¿for leave
to amend under section 425.13¿must be supported by declarations establishing
facts sufficient to support a finding there is a “substantial probability”
the¿plaintiff will prevail on the punitive damages claim. “Substantial
probability” requires the plaintiff to show a legally sufficient claim
substantiated by competent, admissible evidence.¿(College Hospital Inc. v.
Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 719.)¿ The plaintiff
must make a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain the punitive
damage claim,¿taking into account¿the higher “clear and convincing” standard of proof required
for such claims under Code of Civil Procedure section 3294.¿(Looney v.
Superior Court¿(1993)¿16 Cal.App.4th 521, 538-540.)¿“Consistent with the
legislative intent to protect health care defendants from the drastic effects
of unwarranted punitive damage claims, the entire package of materials
submitted in support of the¿section 425.13(a) motion should be carefully
reviewed to ensure that a genuine contestable claim is indeed proposed.” (College
Hospital, supra,¿8 Cal.4th at pp. 719–720.) 
 
Nevertheless, the
court may not assess credibility or weigh conflicting evidence.¿(Id.¿at
539; see also Looney, supra, 16 Cal.App.4th at p. 539 [“In making
this judgment, the trial court’s consideration of the defendant’s opposing
affidavits does not permit a weighing of them against the plaintiff’s
supporting evidence, but only a determination that they do or do not,¿as a
matter of law,¿defeat that evidence”].)¿The¿court must not reject a
well-pled and factually supported punitive damages claim simply because the
court believes the evidence is not strong enough for probable success before a
jury.¿(College Hospital, supra,¿8 Cal.4th¿at¿709.) 
 
The basic elements
of a punitive damages claim are set out in section 3294 of the Civil
Code.¿There must be proof of “oppression, fraud, or malice.” (Civ. Code § 3294
(a).) As defined in Civil Code section 3294(c), “the punishable acts which fall
into these categories are strictly defined.¿ Each involves ‘intentional,’
‘willful,’ or ‘conscious’ wrongdoing of a ‘despicable’ or ‘injur[ious]’ nature.
[Citation].” (College Hospital Inc.,¿supra,¿8 Cal.4th at 721.)¿Punitive
damages are only proper when the tortious conduct arises to the level of
extreme indifference to the plaintiff’s rights, a level which decent citizens
should not have to tolerate.¿(Tomaselli v. Transamerica Ins. Co.¿(1994)
25 Cal.App.4th 1269, 1287.)¿Despicable conduct has been characterized as
conduct that is so vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome
that it would be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people.¿(Mock
v. Michigan Millers Mutual Ins. Co.¿(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 306, 331.)  

 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff brings her motion for
leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 473(a)(1) and in compliance with California Rule of Court, rule
3.1324. Plaintiff wishes to add causes of action for battery and breach of
fiduciary duty. Plaintiff argues that the evidence will show that Defendants
recklessly performed lipedema surgery below Plaintiff’s knees after Plaintiff
specifically requested they not perform such a surgery and while Plaintiff was
under anesthesia. Further, Plaintiff requests that the court grant leave to add
punitive damages.
 
As to the additional causes of
action, the Court will permit this amendment. Plaintiff complies with rule 3.1324.
Plaintiff provides the proposed allegations. Counsel provides
a declaration specifying (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment
is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended
allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for amendment
was not made earlier. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(b); see Petale Decl., ¶¶3-18.)
Given the policy of liberality towards amendments such as this, the Court is
inclined to grant leave.
 
However,
Plaintiff fails to make the additional showings required for alleging punitive
damages against a healthcare provider. Plaintiff does not notice the relevant
statute, Code of Civil Procedure¿§ 425.13.
Ignoring the procedural issues, the Court finds no substantial evidence
supporting the claim for punitive damages. Plaintiff only provides the
declaration of counsel showing the general requirements of leave to amend.
Plaintiff does not present evidence or argument that they have met the “substantial
probability” standard to prevail on the punitive damages claim.
It is only in reply that Plaintiff presents substantive evidence of her medical
battery claim, which denies Defendant a reasonable opportunity to oppose the
motion.  (See  American Drug Stores, Inc. v. Stroh
(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1446, 1453 ("[p]oints raised for the first time in a
reply brief will ordinarily  not be
considered, because such consideration would deprive the respondent of an
opportunity to counter the argument.") 
 
Further,
Defendants properly note that the instant motion is untimely. “The court
shall not grant a motion allowing the filing of an amended pleading that
includes a claim for punitive damages if the motion for such an order is not
filed within two years after the complaint or initial pleading is filed or not
less than nine months before the date the matter is first set for trial,
whichever is earlier.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.13(a).) This matter was first
set for trial for April 4, 2024. Pursuant to Section 425.13(a), Plaintiff was
required to file her motion for leave to amend to add punitive damages claims
by July 2023. Plaintiff filed her motion for leave to file her FAC, which would
add causes of action seeking punitive damages and a prayer for punitive
damages, on September 1, 2023.
 
Accordingly, the motion for leave
to amend to assert additional causes of action is GRANTED. The motion is DENIED
to the extent that it seeks to add the punitive damages claim.
