Significant Statements:
* "A motion for new trial is a creature of statute; ... A movant must satisfy CCP sections 657 and 659."
* "The purpose of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is not to afford a review of the jury's deliberation but to prevent a miscarriage of justice in those cases where the verdict rendered is without foundation."
* "The court must deny the motion if there is any substantial evidence to support the verdict."
* "The goal of trial court gatekeeping is simply to exclude 'clearly invalid and unreliable' expert opinion."
* "The purposes of punitive damages are to punish the defendant and deter the commission of similar acts."
* "A reviewing court cannot make a fully informed determination of whether an award of punitive damages is excessive unless the record contains evidence of the defendant's financial condition."
```

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the motions for new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and concludes that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict on the claims of fraud, breach of contract, and breach of lease. The judge also concludes that the punitive damages award was excessive and grants the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to that claim.
