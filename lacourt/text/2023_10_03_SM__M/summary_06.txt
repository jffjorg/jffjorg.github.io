The judge is considering the defendants' motion to tax costs of $36,206.32. The plaintiff properly objects to each item of costs.

The defendants have failed to oppose the motion to tax, and therefore have failed to meet their burden to justify the costs. The court grants the motion to tax and orders the costs to be taxed in the full amount.

The court also finds that the defendants' request for $4,291.26 in court reporter fees is improbable and that the costs will be taxed in the full amount. Additionally, the court finds that the defendants' request for $3,777.88 in costs for printing trial exhibits is unlikely and that the costs will be taxed in the full amount.

The judge orders the plaintiff to prepare a proposed order.

## English Summary

The judge issued a tentative ruling in the case of *Large, et al. v. Tunnel Post Inc., et al.* granting the plaintiff's motion to tax costs.  

The defendants had sought $36,206.32 in costs, primarily for filing fees and court reporter fees. The judge found these amounts improbable and placed the burden on the defendants to justify the costs. 

Since the defendants failed to oppose the motion to tax, the judge found in favor of the plaintiff and will allow the plaintiff to propose a revised order specifying the allowable costs. The judge highlights that the plaintiff's objections to the defendants' cost memorandum must be specific and refer to each item objected to.

summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the Judge's analysis of a motion to tax costs in the case of Large, et al., v. Tunnel Post Inc., et al. The Judge has ruled in favor of the Plaintiff and has found that the Defendants have failed to meet their burden of proof in justifying the costs they have requested. The majority of the costs, $27,987.18, were incurred for filing and motion fees, but the Judge finds it improbable that Defendants incurred such high costs for mere filing and motion fees. The Judge has also found that the court reporter fees and the costs for printing of trial exhibits requested by the Defendants are improbable and have not been justified. Therefore, the motion to tax is granted, and the Plaintiff is to prepare a proposed order.
