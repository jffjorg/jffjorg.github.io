And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the defendants' motion to tax costs of $36,206.32. The plaintiff properly objects to each item of costs. The majority of the costs, $27,987.18, were incurred for filing and motion fees. The court finds it unlikely that the defendants incurred such high costs for mere filing and motion fees. The defendants have failed to oppose the motion to tax, and therefore have failed to meet their burden to justify the costs. The court grants the motion to tax and orders the costs to be taxed in the full amount.

The court also finds that the defendants' request for $4,291.26 in court reporter fees is improbable and that the costs will be taxed in the full amount. Additionally, the court finds that the defendants' request for $3,777.88 in costs for printing trial exhibits is unlikely and that the costs will be taxed in the full amount.

The judge orders the plaintiff to prepare a proposed order.
