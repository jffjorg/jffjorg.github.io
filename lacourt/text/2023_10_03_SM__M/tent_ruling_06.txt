Legal
Standard
 
In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (CCP § 1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17
Cal.4th 599, 606.) “Prevailing party” includes the party with a net
monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a
defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a
defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against
that defendant. (CCP § 1032 (a)(4).)
 
            “Allowable costs shall be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial
to its preparation.” (CCP § 1033.5(c)(2).) “If the items appearing in a cost
bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax
costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.) On
the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue
and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs. (Ibid.)
 
            Unless an objection is made to the
entire cost memorandum, the motion to strike or tax costs must refer to each
item objected to by the same number and appear in the same order as the
corresponding cost item claimed on the memorandum of costs and state why each
item is objectionable. (CRC rule 3.1700(b)(2).) Any grounds not stated are
waived. (Boyd v. Oscar Fisher Co. (1989) 210 Cal. App. 3d 368, 383.)
 
Analysis
 
Defendants served a Memorandum of
Costs seeking $36,206.32 in costs. Plaintiff properly objects to each item of
costs. 
 
The majority of these costs, $27,987.18,
were incurred for filing and motion fees. Defendants filed 98 documents in this
case, including four motions and six answers. The Court finds it improbable that
Defendants incurred such high costs for mere filing and motion fees. Since
these costs are properly objected to by Plaintiff, Defendants have the burden
to show the validity of the costs. Defendants have failed to oppose the motion
to tax, and thus failed to meet this burden.  Based upon evidence submitted by Plaintiff,
the proper costs for this item would be $2,850.
 
Defendants also request $4,291.26 of
costs in court reporter fees. Parties may recover costs for “[c]ourt reporter
fees as established by statute.” (CCP § 1033.5(a)(11).) Reviewing the record,
the Court also finds this improbable that Defendants incurred such high costs
for court reporter fees alone. Defendants may be seeking to recover costs for
reporter transcripts, which is prohibited unless the transcripts were
ordered by the court. (CCP § 1033.5(b)(5).) There is no order from this Court
related to the ordering of transcripts. Thus, this item of costs appears
facially improper. Defendants have failed to oppose the motion to tax, and thus
failed to meet their burden to justify the costs. The costs will therefore be
taxed in the full amount.
 
Defendants request $3,777.88 in
costs for the printing of trial exhibits. However, this case never went to
trial. Plaintiff notes that Defendants shared less than 2000 pages of trial
exhibits with Plaintiff. (Fowler Dec. ¶ 9.) The Court therefore finds it
unlikely that Defendants incurred $3,777.88 to print trial exhibits. Defendants
have failed to oppose the motion to tax, and thus failed to meet their burden
to justify this item. The costs will therefore be taxed in the full amount.
 
Accordingly, the motion to tax is
GRANTED.  Plaintiff to prepare a proposed
order.
