## English Summary:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to add punitive damages to their medical malpractice lawsuit against Dr. Rible and the Regents of the University of California. 

The plaintiffs allege that Dr. Rible acted negligently during the delivery of their baby, ultimately leading to the baby's death. They argue that Dr. Rible's actions, including failing to properly monitor the fetal heart rate and delaying a cesarean section, constituted "conscious disregard" for the mother and baby's safety, warranting punitive damages.

However, the judge found that the plaintiffs’ evidence does not meet the high "clear and convincing" standard required to prove punitive damages. While the judge acknowledges Dr. Rible's potential negligence, the evidence does not show a deliberate or malicious intent to harm the plaintiffs. Instead, the judge views the case as one of medical negligence, not intentional wrongdoing.

Furthermore, the judge ruled that the Regents cannot be held liable for punitive damages, citing a state statute that protects public entities from such liability.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion by the plaintiffs to add punitive damages to their complaint against the defendants, the Regents of the University of California and Radhika Rible, M.D. The plaintiffs brought this action for medical malpractice against the defendants for the wrongful death of their newborn infant, Emily Page St. Martin. The judge found that the plaintiffs did not present sufficient prima facie evidence to support a finding of punitive damages, as they failed to show that the defendants acted with conscious disregard for the rights and safety of the patient. The judge also found that the plaintiffs lacked evidence that the defendants were aware of the probable consequences of their actions or inactions, and that the failure to provide proper medical care was not despicable. Finally, the judge noted that the motion also failed to the extent that it sought leave for punitive damages against the Regents, as public entities are not liable for punitive damages under California law.

English text:
The judge has issued a tentative ruling for the case St. Page, et al., v. Regents of the University of Cal., et al., with case number 22STCV11302, scheduled for hearing on October 3, 2023. The plaintiffs, Estate of Emily Page St. Martin, Laura St. Martin, and John Michael St. Martin, have moved for leave to amend the complaint to seek punitive damages against defendants Regents of the University of California and Radhika Rible, M.D.

According to the judge's ruling, in order to file a claim for punitive damages against a health care provider, a plaintiff must file a motion for leave to amend the complaint and add a prayer for punitive damages, supported by declarations establishing facts sufficient to support a finding of a "substantial probability" that the plaintiff will prevail on the punitive damages claim. The court must not reject a well-pled and factually supported punitive damages claim simply because the court believes the evidence is not strong enough for probable success before a jury.

In this case, the plaintiffs allege that Dr. Rible acted with a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of the mother and her unborn child. However, the judge has ruled that the plaintiffs do not present sufficient prima facie evidence that they will prevail under the clear and convincing standard required of punitive damages. The plaintiffs lack substantial evidence of Dr. Rible’s conscious disregard of Laura St. Martin’s and Emily St. Martin’s safety. The evidence does not show whether Dr. Rible acted willfully or deliberately.

Therefore, the motion for leave to amend the complaint to seek punitive damages is denied.
