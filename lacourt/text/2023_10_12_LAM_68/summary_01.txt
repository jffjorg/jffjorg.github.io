The motion is based on a conflict that has arisen between the attorneys and the client, which constitutes an ethical dilemma. The attorneys are no longer authorized to act on behalf of the client and have been unable to communicate with the client about any matters.

The motion complies with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362 and the judge is considering the case citations People v. Prince (1968) and Merco Constr. Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978).
