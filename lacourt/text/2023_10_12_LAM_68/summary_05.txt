Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by Nike, Inc. and Nike USA, Inc. to the plaintiff's second amended complaint. The plaintiff, Jessica Bradford, is seeking to hold the defendants liable for the death of her son, Jayden Bradford, who was shot and killed at a Nike shoe release event. The defendants argue that they do not have a duty to protect Jayden because the shooting occurred on property owned by Shoe Palace, not Nike. The plaintiff argues that Nike had a duty to protect Jayden due to its alleged negligent undertaking.

The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff cannot refile the complaint with the same allegations. The judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to establish a duty on the part of Nike to protect Jayden, and that the shooting was not a foreseeable risk. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's claims for wrongful death and survival action are derivative of the wrongful death action, which has been demurred to.
