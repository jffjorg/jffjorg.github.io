And here is the English text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a commercial unlawful detainer case. The judge is considering a demurrer filed by the defendant, Day-O-Graphics, Inc., which argues that the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Peter Simpson, is defective and does not state a claim. The judge rules that the demurrer is untimely and that the complaint is sufficient to state a claim. The judge also finds that the defendant's arguments lack legal authority and are therefore not persuasive. The judge overrules the demurrer and orders the defendant to file an answer within 5 days.
