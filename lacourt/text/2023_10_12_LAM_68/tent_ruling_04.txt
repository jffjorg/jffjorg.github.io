 Case Number:  22STCV19217    Hearing Date:   October 12, 2023    Dept:  68 DAY O GRAPHICS, INC.’S DEMURRERBACKGROUND:     This is a commercial unlawful detainer case.MOVING PARTY argues:  Plaintiff, identified as “Peter Simpson,” has
not requested a substitution of the party plaintiff. Also, paragraph 40 of the
First Amended Complaint does not identify demurring Defendant as being served
with the three-day notice to quit. Plaintiff also does not allege that
Day-O-Graphics was mailed a copy of the three-day notice to quit. There are no
allegations showing the requisite due diligence to allow the service of the
three-day notice to quit. There is no information in the proof of service about
prior attempts to serve Defendants. Further, Plaintiff has not alleged
sufficient facts to satisfy the requirements for the “posting and mailing”
method of serving the three-day notice to quit. Also, the complaint states that
Defendants served Belle Art Custom Framing, but that is a fictitious business
name. Complaint fails to allege the date the alleged subletting occurred, the
name of the person or entity to whom a portion of the subject properly was
sublet, the specific portion of the subject property that were sublet, and the
specific language in the lease agreement that purportedly makes it illegal to
sublet a portion of the subject property. It cannot be ascertained from the
Complaint or the three-day notice to quit which fire sprinklers Defendants
failed to maintain, in what manner Defendants failed to maintain fire
sprinklers in the subject property, what language in the lease agreement made
it Defendants’ responsibility to maintain the fire sprinklers in the subject
property, in what manner failing to maintain the fire sprinklers is a
“nuisance” sanctioning the use of Code of Civil Procedure, §1161(4), and what
notice, if any, Plaintiff provided to Defendants prior to the purported service
of the three-day notice to quit that informed Defendants that Plaintiff deemed
Defendants to have not maintained the fire sprinklers in the subject property. Plaintiff
has failed to allege the nature of the insurance Defendants purportedly failed
to maintain, the date said insurance lapsed or Defendants failed to renew said
insurance, and what knowledge or information Plaintiff has to support the
statement in the three-day notice to quit that Defendants failed to maintain
insurance required by the Lease Agreement. None of the acts or omission by
Demurring Defendant, constitute a nuisance that would support implementation of
Code of Civil Procedure, §1161(4) and allow termination of the lease agreement.RESPONDING PARTY argues: Plaintiff is
unaware of, and Defendant does not offer, any precedent suggesting that a party
may not amend its Complaint to correct the name or capacity of the plaintiff as
a matter of course under section 472. In addition the service alleged complied
with the lease agreement and with the law. The notice was properly served on
Day-O Graphics, Inc. Further, the First Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges unauthorized
sublease and breaches based on nuisance.IN REPLY, MOVING PARTY argues: None. LEGAL
STANDARD: A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint by raising
questions of law. (Rader Co. v. Stone (1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 10, 20.) The
complaint must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the
facts pleaded. (Flynn v. Higham (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 677, 679.) Where
written documents are the foundation of an action and are attached to the
complaint and incorporated therein by reference, they become a part of the
complaint and may be considered on demurrer. (Byrne v. Harvey (1962) 211
Cal.App.2d 92, 103; see also Dodd v. Citizens Bank of Costa Mesa (1990)
222 Cal.App.3d 1624, 1626–1627.) A demurrer must be sustained where the facts
alleged do not entitle the plaintiffs to relief under any possible legal
theory. (See Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn. (1972) 7 Cal.3d 94,
103.) Where there is no possibility amendment would cure the complaint's
defects, it is appropriate to sustain the demurrer without leave to amend. (Minsky
v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 113, 118–119.)MEET AND CONFER: The meet-and-confer requirements
in Code Civil Procedure, section 430.41, that
must be met before the filing of a demurrer are not applicable to unlawful
detainer actions. (Code Civ. Pro., §430.41, subd. (d)(2).)DISCUSSION:Preliminarily,
the demurrer is untimely. A defendant has five days
after service in which to respond to an unlawful detainer action. (Code
Civ. Pro., §§1167, 1167.3, 1170.) Here, Plaintiff
served the first amended complaint by electronic mail on August 31, 2023. Defendant
demurred on September 13, 2023, which is past the five days even after adding
days for service by electronic mail. (Code. Civ. Pro., § 1010.6, subd.
(a)(3)(B).) The complaint
must set forth the facts which the plaintiff seeks to recover and must describe
the premises with reasonable certainty. (Code Civ. Pro., §1166, subd.(a)(2),
(a)(3).) It must also set forth the amount of damages claimed, and if the case
is based on the tenant’s default in the payment of rent, the amount of that
rent. (Code Civ. Pro., §1166(a)(4), (b).) Finally, it must state the method
used to serve the defendant with the notice of termination on which the
complaint is based. (Code Civ. Pro., §1166, subd. (a)(5).) The complaint must
be verified. (Code Civ. Pro., §§446, 1166, subd. (a)(1).) Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants breached the lease agreement by subletting the subject
property as a residence, not maintaining the fire sprinkler, and not
maintaining the required insurance coverage. (First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)
¶¶ 21-39.) Plaintiff identifies the property as 3055 Humboldt Street, Los
Angeles, California. (FAC ¶14, Ex. A.) Plaintiff sets forth damages at the rate
of $345.20 per day and statutory damages of $600. (FAC, Prayer.) Plaintiff
states that the three-day notice was served by posting a copy of the notice in
a conspicuous place on the property and then mailing a copy by U.S. mail. (FAC
¶42.) The complaint is verified.Defendant’s arguments lack
legal authority. A legal proposition asserted without apposite authority fails.
(People v. Taylor (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 628, 643.) “A
judge in a civil case is not "'obligated to seek out theories [a party]
might have advanced, or to articulate … that which … [a party] has left
unspoken.'"  (Mesecher v.
County of San Diego (1992) 9 Cal. App. 4th 1677, 1686.) The Court overrules the
demurrer.









The Demurrer is OVERRULED.  Defendant shall file an answer only within 5
days.
