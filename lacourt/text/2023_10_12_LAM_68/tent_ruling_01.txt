  Case Number:  20STCV25912    Hearing Date:   October 12, 2023    Dept:  68 Motion to be Relieved as Counsel

D&D
Building Solutions, Inc. vs. AMW Construction, Inc., et al.; 20STCV25912 
Moving
Party: Counsel for Plaintiff D&D Building Solutions, Inc.

Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel
Roza Crawford of
Crawford Law Group, counsel of record for Plaintiff D&D Building Solutions,
Inc., seeks to be relieved as counsel for that party.  Counsel filed motions with the required Forms
MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053.  Counsel’s
declaration states that a conflict has arisen between attorneys and client
which constitutes an ethical dilemma.  The
declaration also states that attorneys are no longer authorized to act on
behalf of client and have been unable to communicate with the client about any
matters.
Absent a showing
of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268
Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion complies
with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362 and meets its requirements. 
The Court is
inclined to grant the motion to be relieved as counsel because it meets the requirements.
 However, the Court would ask for
confirmation that the corporate Defendant has found new representation or does
not need representation before granting the motion because corporations may not
represent themselves.  (Merco Constr.
Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724.)
