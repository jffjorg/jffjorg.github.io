Summary:

This is a tentative ruling in a child sexual assault case. LAUSD moves for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the California legislature's elimination of the requirement to present a pre-litigation government tort claim is unconstitutional and creates government liability. The Court denies LAUSD's motion for judgment on the pleadings with regard to the other two causes of action (negligent hiring, supervision, and retention of unfit employee and negligent supervision of minor) and grants LAUSD's motion for judgment on the pleadings with regard to the Failure to Report Suspect Child Abuse cause of action.
