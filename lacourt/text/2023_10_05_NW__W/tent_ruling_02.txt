BACKGROUND
 
This is an action to confirm an
arbitration award issued in Petitioner Swift Financial, LLC, as servicing agent
for WebBank’s favor and against Respondents Milky Way Catering, Inc. and Karine
Malakyan. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Petitioner
Swift Financial, LLC’s Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Petitioner
Swift Financial, LLC moves this court for an order granting the petition to
confirm arbitration award on the grounds that the Defendant has been properly
served with the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award and has not timely
responded to said Petition. Swift Financial makes this petition pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 1285. 
 
“Any party
to an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court to
confirm, correct or vacate the award.” (CCP §1285.) The petition must set forth
(1) the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate, (2)
the names of the arbitrators, and (3) the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators,
or attach a copy.  (CCP §1285.4.)  Confirmation of the award is mandatory
unless a response or petition to correct or vacate the award has been timely
filed.¿ (See CCP §1286;¿Valsan Partners Limited Partnership
v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc.¿(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.)


 
A petition
to confirm an award shall be served and filed not later than four years after
the date of service of a signed copy of the award on the petitioner. (CCP
§1288.) A court does not have jurisdiction to correct or vacate an award if the
response or petition to correct or vacate the award is filed 100 days after the
date of the service of a signed copy of the award on the petitioner.  (CCP §1288; Abers v. Rohrs (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 1199,
1203.)
 
In the
instant matter, the Petition complies with Code of Civil Procedure section
1285.4. The arbitration award was entered by the American Arbitration
Association in the State of Delaware on March 13, 2023. Petitioner has attached
a copy of the agreement to arbitrate. (See Attachment 4(b).) Moreover, the
petition states that George J. Tzanetopoulos conducted the arbitration
(Petition ¶6) and a copy of the arbitration award and written opinion is
attached to the petition.  (Petition ¶8(c),
Exh. 8(c).) The copy of the arbitration award provides that the petitioner is
awarded, against Respondents, jointly and severally, the total sum of $139,307.15,
which represents $137,559.15 in the unpaid loan balance and loan fees, plus
$1,748.00 in attorney's fees incurred in enforcing the Loan Agreement. (See
Exh. 8(c).) 
 
The court
notes the prevailing party on a motion to confirm, correct, or vacate an
arbitration award is entitled to a mandatory award of costs.  (CCP §1293.2.)  Item 10(e) of the petition requests costs and
attorney fees according to proof as well as interest at the statutory rate.
Because the petitioner does not provide the amounts sought, the court cannot
grant the request at this time. 
 
Petitioner
also requests prejudgment interest under Civil Code 3289 from the date of the
award, March 13, 2023 to the date of entry of judgment. 
 
Accordingly,
the petition for order confirming arbitrator’s award as judgment is GRANTED.
