The court grants the petition to confirm the arbitration award in favor of Swift Financial, LLC, as servicing agent for WebBank, against Milky Way Catering, Inc. and Karine Malakyan. The petition was properly served and no opposition was filed. The arbitration award was entered by the American Arbitration Association in Delaware on March 13, 2023, and the petition complies with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4. The court notes that the prevailing party on a motion to confirm, correct, or vacate an arbitration award is entitled to a mandatory award of costs, but cannot grant the request at this time as the amounts sought are not provided. The court also denies the request for prejudgment interest under Civil Code section 3289 without prejudice, pending further evidence of the amounts sought.
