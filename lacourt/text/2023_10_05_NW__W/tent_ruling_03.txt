inoperable, sunroof making creaking noises, excessive days out of service, and

discussion
 
Plaintiffs
Joseph
Menashe and Deborah Menahse move for an order to strike Defendant FCA US LLC’s
objections and compel further responses to Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatories
(Set One), Nos. 14, 20, 39, and 41 as well as further responses and production
of documents to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents (Set One)
Requests Nos. Requests Nos. 7, 16, 20, 40, 44, 46, 50. Plaintiffs make the
motions on the grounds Defendant FCA failed to provide appropriate and complete
responses to the requests. 
 
“On
receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an
order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of
the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate. (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general.”¿(CCP § 2030.300(a).) “A motion under subdivision (a) [of CCP §
2030.300] shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.” (CCP § 2030.300(b).)¿In addition, a separate statement is required.¿
(CRC Rule 3.1345(a)(2).) 
 
A
motion to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or production of
documents (“RFP”) may be brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of
compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive, or incomplete claims of inability to
comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections.  (CCP §
2031.310(c).) A motion to compel further production must set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
inspection demand. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1).) In Digital Music
News LLC v Superior Court (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 216 at 224, the Court
defined “good cause” as a showing that there “a disputed fact that is of
consequence in the action and the discovery sought will tend in reason to prove
or disprove that fact or lead to other evidence that will tend to prove or
disprove the fact.”  
 
Plaintiffs
contend the interrogatories that are the subject of this Motion seek the
identification of key witnesses, namely, those who inspected and tested, and
performed warranty repairs on the Vehicle, and those who were involved with
Defendant’s decision of whether or not to repurchase or replace the Vehicle at
the prelitigation stage. However, Defendant’s responses asserted multiple
boilerplate objections to these requests and failed to identify a single
individual. Moreover, to prove their allegations, Plaintiffs requested the
following categories of documents: (1) those relating specifically to Plaintiff
and the subject vehicle (Request Nos. 7 and 40), (2) those relating to
Defendant’s knowledge, internal investigations, analysis and publications of
defects plaguing the Vehicle (Request Nos. 16, 44, 46, and 50); and (3) those relating
to Defendant’s warranty and vehicle repurchase policies, procedures, and
practices (Request No. 20). Again, Plaintiffs contend Defendants responded with
boilerplate objections. 
 
In
opposition, Defendant FCA argues Plaintiffs prematurely ended the meet and
confer process and filed a template motion to compel further responses to
Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatories Nos. 14, 20, 39 and 41 and Request for Production of Documents
Nos. 7, 16, 20, 40, 44, 46 and 50. Defendants also contend it has expressed a
willingness to supplement and now has supplemented many of the requests at
issue in this motion and therefore, made Plaintiffs’ motions moot. Plaintiffs
do not address the supplemental responses provided since the filing of the
opposition.  
 
The
court finds SROG Nos. 14 and 20 MOOT. FCA has provided supplemental responses.
However, the court finds SROG Nos. 39, and 41 insufficient. FCA states for SROG
Nos. 39 and 41 it “will designate a corporate representative pursuant to
California Code of Civil Procedure Section 2025.230.” However, that does not
answer the discovery requests nor has FCA actually complied. 
 
As
for RPD Nos. 7, 16, 20, 40, 44, 46, and 50, the court orders FCA to produce
further responses pursuant to a privilege log. FCA’s response it “will conduct
a diligent search and inquiry” but failing to do so is not compliance.
