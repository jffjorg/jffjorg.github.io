And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Westside Contractors, Inc.'s request for default judgment against Regency Plastering, Inc. in the amount of $3,341,307.66. The court found that the requested amount exceeds the demand set forth in the complaint, which is limited to $500,000. The court notes that the demand sets a ceiling on recovery and a judgment purporting to grant relief beyond that ceiling is void for being in excess of jurisdiction. The court has denied the request without prejudice, allowing Westside to file new default judgment documents that request damages in an amount equal to or less than $500,000 and are supported by revised interest computations.
