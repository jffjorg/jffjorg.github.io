[tentative]
  Order RE:
 
cross-complainant’s request for entry of
  court judgment by default
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Cross-complainant Westside
Contractors, Inc.          
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Request for Default Judgment
Cross-complainant Westside
Contractors, Inc. (“Westside”) requests that the court enter default judgment
in its favor and against cross-defendant Regency Plastering, Inc. (“Regency”)
in the total amount of $3,341,307.66, consisting of (1) $2,757,208.75 in
damages, (2) $528,024.36 in interest, (3) $3,414.55 in costs, and (4) $52,660
in attorney’s fees.[1]

The court finds that it cannot
enter default judgment in the amount requested by Westside. 
“The relief granted to the
plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint
. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 580, subd.
(a).)  “Thus, ‘in all default judgments,
the demand sets a ceiling on recovery,’ and a judgment purporting to grant
relief beyond that ceiling is void for being in excess of jurisdiction.”  (Sass v. Cohen (2020) 10 Cal.5th 861,
863.) 
In the prayer of its
Cross-Complaint, Westside has prayed for damages in the amount of $500,000.  (Cross-Compl., Prayer, § a.)  Thus, the court cannot award damages to
Westside in excess of that amount.  (Sass,
supra, 10 Cal.5th at p. 863; Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d
822, 830 [allegations requesting damages in an amount that exceeds the
jurisdictional requirements of the court, which, at the time, was $15,000, gave
the defendant sufficient notice that the plaintiff claimed at least $15,000 in
damages, such that a judgment in that amount—but no more—was within the
jurisdiction of the court].) 
The court therefore denies
Westside’s request for default judgment, without prejudice to Westside’s filing
new default judgment documents that (1) request damages in an amount equal to
or less than $500,000, and (2) request interest on the modified amount and are
supported by revised interest computations. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  January 21, 2025
