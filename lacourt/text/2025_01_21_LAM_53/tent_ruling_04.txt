13, 2024, i.e., the date that Defendant filed his special motion to strike,
since the filing of that motion stayed all discovery in this action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (g) [“All
discovery proceedings in the action shall be stayed upon the filing of a notice
of motion made pursuant to this section”].)

Defendant did not raise any other defenses to the enforcement of the
arbitration provision in his opposition.
