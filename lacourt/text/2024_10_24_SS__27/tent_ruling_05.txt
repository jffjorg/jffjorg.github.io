INTRODUCTION
On October 28, 2022, Plaintiffs Tonya Emerson
(“Tonya”) and Hanna Abdullah (“Hanna”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed an
action against Defendants Ahmad Ayam (“Ahmad”), Ayam Ayam (“Ayam”), Malaysia
Sierra Pye (“Malaysia”), Hertz Vehicles LLC (“Hertz”), Mechanics Bank (“Bank”)
and Does 1 through 50 for bodily injury and/or property damage.  The Complaint alleges that around November 1,
2020, Defendants’ negligence caused a motor vehicle accident involving
Plaintiffs.  As a result, Plaintiffs
sustained bodily injuries and damages. 
On May 10, 2024, pursuant to Plaintiffs’ request, the Court dismissed
Defendants Hertz and Bank without prejudice.
On September 23, 2024, Defendants Ahmad
and Ayam filed the instant Demurrer to the Complaint.  No opposition has been filed.
On September 30, 2024, default was
entered against Defendant Malaysia.
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
A demurrer is used to test the legal
sufficiency of the factual allegations in the complaint.  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 430.10.)  There are two types of demurrers – general
demurrers and special demurrers.  (See McKenney
v. Purepac Pharmaceutical Co. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 77.)
General demurrers can be used to attack pleadings for
failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action or for lack
of subject matter jurisdiction.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); McKenney, 167 Cal.App.4th at 77.)  Such demurrers can be used only to challenge
defects that appear on the face of the pleading or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable; evidence or extrinsic matters are not
considered.  (Code of Civ. Proc., §§
430.30, 430.70; Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of
the cause of action, the Court admits “all material facts properly pleaded” and
“matters which may be judicially noticed,” but does not consider contentions,
deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. [Citation].”  (Blank, 39 Cal.3d at 318.)  It gives these facts “a reasonable
interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.”  (Ibid.)  At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only
allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis
for the claim against him.  (Semole v.
Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.)  The face of the complaint includes exhibits
attached to the complaint.  (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.)  "If facts appearing in the exhibits
contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence."  (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc.
(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447.)
Special demurrers can be used to attack
the pleadings on grounds that the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, and
unintelligible, or in a contract case, for failure to allege whether a contract
is oral or written.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10,
subd. (f).)  A demurrer for uncertainty
will be sustained only where the pleading is so unclear that the responding
party cannot reasonably determine what issues to admit or deny or what counts
and claims are directed toward the responding party.  (A.J. Fistes Corp. v. GDL Best Contractors,
Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695.)
Moreover, Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)  The parties are to meet and confer at least
five days before the date the responsive pleading is due.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)  Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and
serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
When a demurrer is sustained, the Court
determines whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be
cured by amendment.  (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  When a
plaintiff “has pleaded the general set of facts upon which his cause of action
is based,” the court should give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend his
complaint, since plaintiff should not “be deprived of his right to maintain his
action on the ground that his pleadings were defective for lack of
particulars.”  (Reed v. Norman
(1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 892, 900.)  Generally, the court will allow leave to amend
on at least the first try, unless there is absolutely no possibility of
overcoming the issue.  (See Angie M.
v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227 ("Denial of leave
to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion unless the complaint shows on its
face it is incapable of amendment. [Citation.]  Liberality in permitting amendment is the
rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.").)
III.       
DISCUSSION
A.   Meet and Confer Requirement
Defense counsel declares that she
attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiffs’ counsel, but her efforts were not
successful.  (Foster Decl. ¶¶ 3-4,
Ex. A.)  She has attached a copy of
her email communications with Plaintiffs’ counsel evidencing discussions
regarding the possible filing of an amended complaint.  (Ibid.)  As of the date of the hearing, no amended
complaint has been filed.
The Court finds defense counsel’s
declaration sufficient to fulfill the meet and confer requirement.
B.  
Motion
Moving Defendants demur to the
Complaint on the basis that the Complaint fails to state a cause of action or
state facts sufficient to constitute any legally cognizable cause of
action.  Moreover, Defendants contend
that the Complaint does not name the Defendants or state any allegations
regarding the circumstances of their involvement in the motor vehicle collision
and the Complaint is also uncertain.
Defendants also argue that if
Plaintiffs are attempting to assert a claim for negligence, the allegations in
the Complaint are not sufficient to establish any of the elements of negligence.  Defendants request that the Court sustain the
Demurrer without leave to amend as Plaintiffs will not be able to cure the
defects in the Complaint.
The Motion is unopposed.
The Court finds that the two-page Complaint for bodily injury
and/or property damage fails due to uncertainty.  Under California Rule of Court, Rule 2.112:
“Each separately stated cause of action, count, or defense must specifically
state: (1) [i]ts number…(2) [i]ts nature.”  Moreover, Code of Civil Procedure section
425.10, subdivision (a)(1), states that a complaint “shall” contain a
“statement of the facts constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and
concise language.”  Although a court,
“must look to the allegations in the body of the complaint to determine whether
a set of alleged facts constitutes a cause of action,” there must be some
indication of what cause of action and elements are being pleaded.  (People ex rel. Feuer v. Superior Court
(Cahuenga’s the Spot) (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 1360, 1376.)
A demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the
pleading is so unclear that the responding party cannot reasonably determine
what issues to admit or deny or what counts and claims are directed toward the
responding party.  (A.J. Fistes Corp.
v. GDL Best Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695.)  However, “[a]s the leading practical treatise
advises, failure to comply with rule 2.112 presumably renders a complaint
subject to a motion to strike (Code of Civ. Proc., § 436), or a special
demurrer for uncertainty.” (Grappo v. McMills (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 996,
1014 (citing Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: CPBT (Rutter Group 2016),
¶6:113).  Similarly, a pleading is
subject to a demurrer for uncertainty, when it is unintelligible by
“attempt[ing] to state numerous causes of action in a very loose and rambling
manner without any attempt at separately stating them.”  (Craig v. City of Los Angeles¿(1941) 44 Cal.App.2d
71, 73.)
Here, Plaintiffs have initiated an action for bodily injuries and
damages but have not asserted any causes of action in the Complaint.  The Complaint alleges that around November 1,
2020, near Los Angeles Street and 11th Street in the City of Los Angeles,
County of Los Angeles, “a motor vehicle or vehicles were owned and were so
negligently operated, maintained, controlled and permissively used by defendants
and each of them including DOES 1 through 50, inclusive so as to cause an
accident involving each plaintiff and causing damage.”  (Complaint, ¶ 3.)  As a proximate result of Defendants’
negligence, Plaintiffs sustained bodily injuries and other forms of damages
generally referenced in the Complaint.  (Id.
at ¶¶ 4-6.)
The Court finds that the Complaint does not set forth any causes
of action or present any factual allegations to establish a cause of
action.  If Plaintiffs are asserting a
cause of action for negligence, the Complaint is comprised of conclusory
statements, without any factual allegations regarding each defendant’s actions
or omissions that could constitute negligence. 
The pleading is so unclear that moving Defendants cannot reasonably determine what issues to
admit or deny or what counts and claims are directed toward each Defendant.  Thus, the Court finds the
Complaint to be uncertain according to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (f).
Plaintiffs have not had a prior
opportunity to amend the Complaint, thus, the Court SUSTAINS the Demurrer with
20 days leave to amend.

IV.        
CONCLUSION
Accordingly, Defendants Ahmad Ayam and
Ayam Ayam’s Demurrer is SUSTAINED with 20 DAYS LEAVE TO
AMEND.

Moving party is ordered to give notice.
