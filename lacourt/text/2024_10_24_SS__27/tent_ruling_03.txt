 Case Number:  22STCV22825    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2024    Dept:  27 Hon. Lee S. Arian, Dept 27¿ ¿ MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS Hearing Date: 10/24/24¿¿ CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV22825 CRAIG A. WRIGHT vs HOTEL SADDLEBACK Moving Party: Defendant Hotel Saddleback Responding Party: Unopposed Notice: Sufficient¿¿ Ruling: MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS IS GRANTED  Background On July 15, 2022, Plaintiff filed the present case. On March 11, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel was granted. On July 1, 2024, the Court granted Defendant Saddleback’s Motion to Compel Discovery and Motion to Deem Requests for Admissions Admitted. Plaintiff did not oppose the motions or appear at the hearing. The Court ordered Plaintiff to serve discovery responses and to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,400.00 to Defendant by July 31, 2024. On August 23, 2024, the Court heard Saddleback’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Deposition. Plaintiff did not oppose the motion or appear at the hearing. The Court ordered Plaintiff to sit for his deposition and to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,675 by September 12, 2024. As of September 23, 2024, Plaintiff has not participated in his deposition, responded to written discovery or paid the court-ordered sanctions. Defendant now moves the court for terminating sanctions. Plaintiff did not file an opposition. Legal Standard Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030 gives the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a misuse of the discovery process. Misuse of the discovery process includes failure to respond to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying a court order to provide discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (g).) A court may impose terminating sanctions by striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering default judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) A violation of a discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of terminating sanctions. Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620. Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court’s orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796.)¿¿ ¿¿ The court should consider the totality of the circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful, the detriment to the propounding party, and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain discovery. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) If a lesser sanction fails to curb abuse, a greater sanction is warranted. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) However, “the unsuccessful imposition of a lesser sanction is not an absolute prerequisite to the utilization of the ultimate sanction.” (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787.) Before any sanctions may be imposed the court must make an express finding that there has been a willful failure of the party to serve the required answers. (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.) Lack of diligence may be deemed willful where the party understood its obligation, had the ability to comply, and failed to comply. (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787; Fred Howland Co. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605, 610-611.) The party who failed to comply with discovery obligations has the burden of showing that the failure was not willful. (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500, 605.)¿¿ Discussion¿ It appears that Plaintiff has abandoned his case. Plaintiff did not respond to Defendant’s discovery requests or appear for the deposition, nor did Plaintiff oppose Defendant’s various motions to compel or appear at the hearings. After the Court issued orders for Plaintiff to provide the discovery responses at issue, to sit for the deposition, and to pay monetary sanctions, Plaintiff failed to comply with any of these orders. Plaintiff also did not file an opposition to the present motion, further indicating abandonment of the case. The Court finds that Plaintiff has willfully failed to comply with discovery obligations, as evidenced by the lack of compliance with the Court’s numerous orders, failure to respond to Defendant’s discovery requests, and failure to appear at multiple motion hearings. The burden is then on the non-compliant party to demonstrate that the failure to comply was not willful. (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500, 605.) Plaintiff did not file an opposition and has therefore failed to meet this burden. Based on the foregoing, the motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED. ¿PLEASE TAKE NOTICE:  If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept27@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.  Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.  If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.
