CASE NO./NAME: BC632829 DONNA MORI-CAMPBELL
VS AMC ENTERTAINMENT INC et al.
Moving Party: Defendant AMC 
Responding Party: Plaintiff 
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: SUPPLMENTAL BRIEFING RE MOTION TO DISMISS 
 
Background
This action was filed
on September 1, 2016. On March 14, 2022, the court, with Judge H. Chester Horn
presiding, dismissed the case pursuant to the five-year rule, with an
additional six months added due to the COVID-19 emergency order, finding that
the deadline to bring the case to trial was March 1, 2022. Plaintiff appealed
this dismissal, and the appellate court remanded the case, ruling that the
trial court could not dismiss the case based solely on an oral request but
instead required a formal motion. The remittitur was filed on May 24, 2024.
On July 8, 2024,
Defendant filed a new written motion to dismiss, asserting that the five-year
deadline to bring the case to trial had expired on March 1, 2022, including the
COVID-19 extension. The motion focused exclusively on events leading up to March
14, 2022, and did not address any developments after the dismissal. The court
denied the motion, ruling that the five-year period was stayed for at least 30
additional days due to an appeal filed in September 2021, which extended the
deadline, at the very least, to April 1, 2022. This finding rendered the
original dismissal on March 14, 2022, premature. However, the court did not
continue its analysis to determine if the deadline had expired as of the time
of the filing, over two years later, because the impact of the court’s denial
and post-dismissal events were not discussed in the initial motion.
On October 3, 2024,
Defendant renewed its motion to dismiss. This renewed motion largely reiterated
the arguments from the original motion, with a significant emphasis on the
COVID-19 extension.  As referenced in the
Court’s ruling on Plaintiff’s July 8, 2024 motion, Plaintiff did address the
issue of timeliness beyond just the time as of the March 2022 dismissal.  
Plaintiff opposed the
latest motion on multiple grounds.  None
of those grounds are, in the Court’s view, persuasive and most of them have been
already addressed by the Court.  However,
one ground that appears to have been missed that causes the Court pause in
regard to dismissal is CCP § 583.350.  The
Court seeks further briefing on that statute.
Discussion


Code of Civil Procedure
§ 583.350 provides that:
If
the time within which an action must be brought to trial pursuant to this
article is tolled or otherwise extended pursuant to statute, and at the end of
the period of tolling or extension less than six months remain within which the
action must be brought to trial, the action shall not be dismissed pursuant to
this article if the action is brought to trial within six months after the end
of the period of tolling or extension.
In Him v.
Superior Court (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 35, the plaintiff sought a writ
after the denial of a motion to specially set trial to avoid running afoul of
the five-year statute of limitation. In that case, the plaintiff’s attorney was
suffering from persistent chest pains, diagnosed as angina, and was unable to
prepare the case for trial. After the five-year statute expired, the defendant
moved for mandatory dismissal. The trial court denied the motion, finding that
the five-year statute had been tolled for forty-two days due to the medical
condition of the plaintiff’s counsel on the basis of impossibility or
impracticability. (Id. at 37.) The trial court calculated that the
plaintiff had until July 21, 1986, to bring the case to trial (i.e., the expiration
of the five-year statute plus forty-two days).
On July 11, 1986, the
plaintiff brought a motion to specially set the case for trial before the
five-year period expired. The trial court denied the motion, reasoning that a
15-day notice of any new trial date could not be given before the five-year
period expired. The Court of Appeal in Him issued a writ and
remanded for trial, stating:
Neither
counsel nor the respondent was aware of section 583.350, which afforded
petitioner ample additional time to bring the action to trial after the end of
the tolling period... less than six months remained within which to bring the
action to trial at the end of the period of tolling, and hence, pursuant to the
section, petitioner had six months after July 8, 1986, the end of the tolling
period (when he returned from his sickness), to get the case to trial. 
(Id. at 38.)
Here, the case was
dismissed on March 14, 2022, and Plaintiff subsequently filed an appeal. The
Court of Appeal remanded the case, with the remittitur issued on May 24, 2024.
In ruling on the initial motion to dismiss, the Court determined that the
5.5-year deadline to bring the case to trial was, at the very least, April 1,
2022. The case was dismissed before the expiration of the 5.5-year deadline.
It appears to the Court
that section 583.350 may apply here.  The
dismissal in this case occurred just a few weeks before the April 1, 2022,
deadline. Under CCP § 583.350, when less than six months remain after tolling,
the statute allows for an additional six months to be added to the deadline.
Applying this rule to the present case, six months from the issuance of the
remittitur on May 24, 2024, appears to extend the deadline to November 24,
2024.  
The Court is inclined
to provide both parties with an opportunity to brief this issue and very
briefly continue the FSC and trial dates for that purpose.
