Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS IS
GRANTED 
 
Background
 
On May 13, 2022,
Plaintiffs Procoro Vazquez and Margot Cordova, in their individual capacities
and as successors in interest to Efren Cordova Vazquez, filed the present case
against Defendants Andrew Burciaga and Andrew Rene Burciaga. On February 2,
2024, Defendant served Plaintiffs with its first set of discovery requests. No
responses were provided, and motions to compel were filed on March 21, 2024.
Plaintiffs did not oppose the motions to compel nor did they appear at the
hearing. On May 6, 2024, the Court ordered Plaintiffs to provide the
outstanding discovery responses and pay sanctions in the amount of $930 by June
6, 2024. Plaintiffs failed to provide the responses or pay the sanctions by the
court-ordered deadline. Additionally, Plaintiffs did not respond to any meet
and confer communications from Defendants. To date, no discovery responses have
been provided, and the sanctions remain unpaid. Defendant now moves the Court
for terminating sanctions. Plaintiffs did not file an opposition.
 
Legal Standard¿ 
¿¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030 gives the
court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a misuse of
the discovery process. Misuse of the discovery process includes failure to
respond to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying a court order to
provide discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (g).) A court may
impose terminating sanctions by striking pleadings of the party engaged in
misuse of discovery or entering default judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (d).) A violation of a discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of
terminating sanctions. Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
1611, 1620. Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in
disobeying the court’s orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d
771, 795-796.) 
 
The court should consider the totality of the
circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine if the actions were
willful, the detriment to the propounding party, and the number of formal and
informal attempts to obtain discovery. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) If a lesser sanction fails to curb abuse, a greater
sanction is warranted. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th
1495, 1516.) However, “the unsuccessful imposition of a lesser sanction is not
an absolute prerequisite to the utilization of the ultimate sanction.” (Deyo,
supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787.) Before any sanctions may be imposed the court
must make an express finding that there has been a willful failure of the party
to serve the required answers. (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los Angeles
County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.) Lack of diligence may be deemed
willful where the party understood its obligation, had the ability to comply,
and failed to comply. (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787; Fred Howland
Co. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605,
610-611.) The party who failed to comply with discovery obligations has the
burden of showing that the failure was not willful. (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66
Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500, 605.) 
 
Discussion
It
appears that Plaintiffs have abandoned their case. Plaintiffs did not respond
to Defendant’s first set of discovery requests, nor did Plaintiffs oppose the motion
to compel or attend the hearing. After the Court issued an order requiring
Plaintiffs to provide discovery responses and pay sanctions within 30 days, and
despite multiple meet and confer efforts by Defendant, no communication or
discovery responses were provided. Additionally, Plaintiff did not file an
opposition to the present motion, further indicating abandonment of the case.
The
Court also finds that Plaintiff has willfully failed to comply with discovery
obligations, as demonstrated by the lack of response to Defendant’s repeated
meet-and-confer efforts and failure to provide discovery responses as required
by the Court’s order. The burden is on the non-compliant party to show that the
failure to comply was not willful. (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p.
788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250; Evid.
Code, §§ 500, 605.) Plaintiff did not file an opposition and has failed to meet
this burden.
Based on the foregoing, the motion for
terminating sanctions is GRANTED.
