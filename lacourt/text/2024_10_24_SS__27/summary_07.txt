And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by plaintiff Donna Mori-Campbell against AMC Entertainment Inc et al. The lawsuit was initially filed in 2016 and was dismissed in 2022. The plaintiff appealed the dismissal, and the appellate court remanded the case. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss in 2024, which was denied. The defendant has now renewed the motion, arguing that the five-year deadline to bring the case to trial has expired. The court is considering whether this deadline was tolled due to the COVID-19 extension and whether CCP § 583.350 applies. The court is inclined to provide both parties with an opportunity to brief this issue and briefly continue the FSC and trial dates for that purpose.
