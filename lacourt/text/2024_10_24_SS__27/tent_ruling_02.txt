MOTION TO ADVANCE MSA DATE

CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV16286 FRANK BLEDSOE vs
TCI TRANSPORTATION SERVICES et al.
Moving Party: Cross Defendant Transportation
Commodities, Inc.
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION TO ADVANCE MSA DATE IS GRANTED
 
On October 11, 2024,
Cross-Defendant Transportation Commodities, Inc. filed a motion for summary
adjudication against Cross-Complainant Transportation Commodities, Inc.
Cross-Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication is currently set to be heard
on June 10, 2025, after the trial date. The current trial date is February 18,
2025. Cross-Defendant now moves the Court to advance the hearing on its motion
for summary adjudication so it can be heard prior to trial. No opposition was
filed.
Numerous courts of
appeal have held that a trial court cannot refuse to consider a motion for
summary judgment that is timely filed. "A trial court may not refuse to
hear a summary judgment filed within the time limits of [Code of Civil
Procedure] section 437c. [Citation.] Local rules and practices may not be
applied so as to prevent the filing and hearing of such a motion." (Sentry
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529); accord First
State Inc. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 324, 330
[invalidating case management order to the extent it precluded filing motions
pursuant to section 437c ]; Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court (1988)
206 Cal.App.3d 918, 923 [local court rule that "require a party filing a
complex summary judgment motion to file the motion six months before the date
set for trial is void and unenforceable because it is inconsistent with section
437c"].) As the Sentry court explained: "We are sympathetic to
the problems the trial courts experience in calendaring and hearing the many
motions for summary judgment. However, the solution to these problems cannot
rest in a refusal to hear timely motions." (Sentry, supra, at p.
530.) 
MSJs or MSAs are
required to be served at least 107 days before trial, if done electronically. (Cole
v. Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.) The present motion
was filed and served on October 11, 2024, and the trial date is set for
February 18, 2025, which is 130 days apart. Therefore, the motion is timely.
Cross-Defendant is therefore entitled to have its motion for summary
adjudication heard prior to trial.
In advancing the motion
for summary adjudication (MSA), the Court must ensure it does not violate any
of the following deadlines. 
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
437c(a)(2) and (3):
(2) Notice of the
motion and supporting papers shall be served on all other parties to the action
at least 75 days before the time appointed for hearing. If the notice is served
by mail, the required 75-day period of notice shall be increased by 5 days if
the place of address is within the State of California, 10 days if the place of
address is outside the State of California but within the United States, and 20
days if the place of address is outside the United States. If the notice is
served by facsimile transmission, express mail, or another method of delivery
providing for overnight delivery, the required 75-day period of notice shall be
increased by two court days.
(3) The motion
shall be heard no later than 30 days before the date of trial, unless the court
for good cause orders otherwise. The filing of the motion shall not extend the
time within which a party must otherwise file a responsive pleading.
Since the MSA was
served electronically, the earliest hearing date, accounting for 75 days and
two court days from October 11, 2024, would be December 30, 2024.
Thirty days prior to
the trial date of February 18, 2025, is January 18, 2025, which establishes the
latest date the MSA can be heard. Therefore, Defendant’s MSA can only be moved
to a hearing date between December 30, 2024, and January 18, 2025. The Court
advances the hearing on the MSA to January 6, 2025, at 1:30 p.m.
