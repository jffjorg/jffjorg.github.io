And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further deposition and production of documents from non-party Ridge Surgery Center and Virella Neurosurgery. The motion was filed by the defendant, Downey Wholesale, Inc, and is unopposed. The judge has denied the motion without prejudice due to insufficient notice and service of the motions. The judge notes that the motions were served electronically, but no email address was listed for Virella and Ridge in the proof of service, and there is no indication that the non-party deponents agreed to accept service by mail or electronic service. The judge also expresses concern that the third-party deponents may not have received proper notice of the motion. The judge has advanced the hearing date to today and has scheduled an oral argument for the parties to attend remotely or in person.
