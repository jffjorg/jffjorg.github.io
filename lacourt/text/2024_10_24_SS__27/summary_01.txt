Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions. The defendant, Andrew Burciaga, moved for terminating sanctions after the plaintiff, Procoro Vazquez, failed to comply with a court order to provide discovery responses and pay sanctions. The court found that the plaintiff had abandoned the case and had willfully failed to comply with discovery obligations. The plaintiff did not respond to the defendant's discovery requests, did not oppose the motion to compel, and failed to provide discovery responses as required by the court's order. The court also found that the plaintiff did not meet the burden of showing that their failure to comply with discovery obligations was not willful. As a result, the court granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions.
