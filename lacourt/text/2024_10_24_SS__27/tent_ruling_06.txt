Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTIONS TO COMPEL INTIAL DISCOVERY
RESPONSES, MOTION TO DEEM RFA ADMITTED AND REQUESTS FOR SANCTIONS ARE GRANTED
 
On August 9, 2024,
Defendant Ruben Martinez San Diero served Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, Requests for Admission, and Requests for Production, all Set
One, on Plaintiff Alayna Hercules, a minor, through her guardian ad litem,
Rosario Pozo. Plaintiff failed to provide responses by the September 11, 2024
statutory deadline. On September 13, 2024, defense counsel followed up on the
status of the discovery responses, but Plaintiff did not reply. By September
30, 2024, when Defendant filed the present motions, Plaintiff still had not served
any of the discovery responses. Plaintiff also did not file an opposition to
the present motions.
It is undisputed that
Plaintiff failed to serve the discovery responses by the statutory deadline. No
opposition or any other filings indicating that responses were provided before
the hearing were submitted. Therefore, the motions are granted. Plaintiff is
ordered to provide complete and verified responses to Defendant’s Requests for
Production, Special Interrogatories, and Form Interrogatories, Set One, without
objection, within 20 days of today's date. The contents of Defendant’s Requests
for Admission, Set One, are deemed admitted.
Defendant requested
sanctions in the amount of $1,311.65 for each motion. Due to the simplicity of
the issues and the lack of opposition, the Court reduces the sanction to $2,000
for all motions, against Plaintiff and her counsel jointly and severally,
payable to Defendant within 20 days of today's date.
