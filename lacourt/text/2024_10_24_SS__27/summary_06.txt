And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant's motions to compel initial discovery responses, to deem requests for admission (RFA) admitted, and to impose sanctions. The plaintiff, Alayna Hercules, failed to provide discovery responses by the statutory deadline and did not file an opposition to the motions. As a result, the motions are granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to provide complete and verified responses to the defendant's discovery requests within 20 days. The judge also deems the contents of the defendant's RFA, Set One, admitted. Additionally, the judge imposes sanctions of $2,000 against the plaintiff and her counsel, payable to the defendant within 20 days.
