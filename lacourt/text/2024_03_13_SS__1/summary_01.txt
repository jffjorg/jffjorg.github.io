And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court is unable to enter a default judgment at this time. The plaintiff's request for default judgment contains several issues that need to be addressed. First, the operative complaint lacks an amount of damages or attorney fees, which is required by law. The Court cannot enter a judgment in an amount exceeding that demanded in the complaint. The plaintiff must file and serve an amended complaint with a prayer for monetary relief and attorney fees in an amount encompassing the amounts to be sought.

Additionally, the plaintiff's arithmetic is incorrect, and the Court needs more information on the amount of time the plaintiff worked and was not paid. The plaintiff also requests pre-judgment interest, but the Court is unclear on how this should be calculated.

The Court will continue to monitor the case and will serve as a status conference on the scheduled date.
