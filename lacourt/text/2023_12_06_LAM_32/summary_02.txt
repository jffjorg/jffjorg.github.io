And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between MeUndies, Inc. and Ordergroove, LLC, et al. The case involves claims of fraudulent inducement, breach of contract, and declaratory relief. MeUndies demurred to Ordergroove's quantum meruit claim, arguing that Ordergroove did not expect payment for additional services provided. The Judge rejected MeUndies' demurrer, finding that the allegations in the cross-complaint support a reasonable inference that Ordergroove provided services under circumstances where both parties understood payment was required. The Judge also rejected MeUndies' argument that seeking quantum meruit contradicts the parties' contract, finding that the case is at the pleading stage and there have been no factual findings regarding the existence of a contract or whether it imposed a condition precedent.
