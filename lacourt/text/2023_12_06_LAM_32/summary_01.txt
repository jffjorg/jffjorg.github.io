  - "Representations of opinion, particularly involving matters of value, are ordinarily not actionable representations of fact."
  - "It is not necessary to allege the circumstantial evidence from which it may be inferred that the representation or promise was false -- these are evidentiary matters which give rise to the misrepresentation."
  - "Malice means conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others."

Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The Court has ruled that the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for fraud is OVERRULED, meaning that the fraud claim will proceed to trial. The Court has also denied the motion to strike, meaning that the fraud claim will not be stricken from the complaint.

The Court's ruling is based on the allegations in the First Amended Complaint, which state that the defendants made misrepresentations about the location of the boundary between the parties' properties and that the plaintiffs relied on those misrepresentations. The Court found that the plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded the elements of fraud, including misrepresentation, knowledge of falsity, intent to defraud, justifiable reliance, and resulting damage.

The Court also found that the defendants' alleged intent to deceive and mislead the plaintiffs, as well as their alleged refusal to remedy the trespass onto the plaintiffs' property, constitute malice and justify the award of punitive damages.

The parties will have an opportunity to file objections to the tentative ruling, and the Court will consider those objections before issuing a final ruling.
