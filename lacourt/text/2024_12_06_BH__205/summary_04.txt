And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant Matthew Moore. The case arises from a car accident on August 11, 2021, in which Plaintiffs Tia Brooks, Maura Brooks, and Michael Jacobs-Sierra were injured. Defendant Moore argues that he was not properly served with the summons and complaint, as he was at work in Orange County at the time of service and does not know the person who allegedly received substitute service on his behalf.

The judge notes that service of process is fundamental to any procedural imposition on a named defendant, and that compliance with statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish personal jurisdiction. However, the judge also notes that the statutory requirements for service of process are to be liberally construed to effectuate service and uphold jurisdiction.

Defendant Moore argues that he has not been properly served, but the judge finds that he has made a general appearance by filing an answer on October 25, 2024, before filing the motion to quash. A general appearance by a party is equivalent to personal service of summons, and operates as a consent to jurisdiction of the person, dispensing with the requirement of service of process.

Therefore, the judge denies Defendant Moore's motion to quash service of summons, finding that he has voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the court by making a general appearance.
