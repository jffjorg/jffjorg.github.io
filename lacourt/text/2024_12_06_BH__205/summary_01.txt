And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a decision by Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. regarding a case between Sian Mitchell (Plaintiff) and James Thomas (Defendant) and Reklaim, Inc. The case arises from a breach of a promissory note, where Mitchell loaned Thomas $175,000 with interest. Mitchell filed a suit and amended complaint, while Thomas filed a demurrer to the amended complaint and a motion to compel further responses to inspection demands.

The Judge sustains Reklaim's demurrer to the amended complaint, citing that the complaint fails to adequately allege the existence of any contract between Mitchell and Reklaim or Reklaim's breach of any contract. The Judge also denies Mitchell's motion to compel further responses to inspection demands, finding that Mitchell has not shown good cause for the discovery she seeks. The Judge notes that Mitchell's counsel's declaration does not state specific facts supporting a good cause showing, and that the declaration is conclusory and not supported by specific facts.
