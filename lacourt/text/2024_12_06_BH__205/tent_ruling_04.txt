  ORDER
  RE:
   
  motion to quash service of 
  summons
 
 



 
BACKGROUND
 
This case arises from a car accident.  On August 11, 2021, Plaintiffs Tia Brooks,
Maura Brooks and Michael Jacobs-Sierra were at a complete stop when their car
was hit by Defendant Matthew Moore. 
Plaintiffs claim they sustained numerous and severe injuries as a result
of the accident.  
This
hearing is on Defendant’s motion to quash. 
Defendant argues that contrary to the proof of service, he was not properly
served.  Defendant argues that he is the
only person living at the service address; he was at work in Orange County when
the service was purportedly effected, and he does not know the person upon whom
substitute service was allegedly made.  Accordingly,
substitute service on him was ineffective under Code Civ. Proc. § 415.20(b) and § 416.90.  There was no opposition filed as of the
posting of this tentative ruling.  
DISCUSSION
“Service
of process, under longstanding tradition in our system of justice, is
fundamental to any procedural imposition on a named defendant.”  (AO
Alfa-Bank v. Yakovlev (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 189, 202.)  “To
establish personal jurisdiction, compliance with statutory procedures for
service of process is essential.”  (Kremerman v. White (2021). 71
Cal.App.5th 358, 371.)  
But
the statutory requirements are to be liberally construed to uphold
jurisdiction, rather than defeat it.  (Pasadena
Medi-Center Assocs. v. Sup.Ct. (Houts) (1973) 9 Cal.3d 773, 778 (“The provisions of this chapter should
be liberally construed to effectuate service and uphold the jurisdiction of the
court if actual notice has been received by the defendant, and in the last
analysis the question of service should be resolved by considering each
situation from a practical standpoint.”) 
Defendant’s
knowledge of the action does not dispense with the statutory requirements for
service of summons.  (Kappel v. Bartlett (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d
1457, 1466.)  However, as long as the
defendant receives actual notice of the lawsuit, substantial compliance with the Code provisions governing
service of summons will generally be held sufficient.  (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 410-411 (“It is well settled that strict compliance
with statutes governing service of process is not required.  Rather, in deciding whether service was
valid, the statutory provisions regarding service of process should be
liberally construed to effectuate service and uphold the jurisdiction of the
court if actual notice has been received by the defendant.”).)
“A
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow” may move “to quash
service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him
or her” that results from lack of proper service.  (Code of Civ. Proc.
§418.10(a)(1).  A defendant has 30 days after the service of the summons
to file a responsive pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§412.20(a)(3).)  
“When a defendant challenges the court’s personal
jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process, ‘the burden is on
the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia,
the facts requisite to an effective service.’” (Summers, 140
Cal.App.4th at 413.)      
DISCUSSION
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff has not properly complied with the requirements for
substitute service.  The Court need not
reach this issue because Defendant has made a general appearance by filing an
answer on October 25, 2024, before he filed the motion to quash.  “A general appearance by a party is
equivalent to personal service of summons.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 410.50, subd. (a).  “A general appearance operates as a consent
to jurisdiction of the person, dispensing with the requirement of service of
process, and curing defects in service”. 
(Fireman's
Fund Ins. Co. v. Sparks Construction, Inc. (2004)
114 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1145.) 
An answer is an appearance.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1014.) 
Thus, Defendant made a general appearance in advance of
challenging the service of the summons and complaint, and in so doing,
Defendant voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of this Court.  (Robbins v. King (Nov. 3, 2023) 2023
Cal. Super. LEXIS 101194 at *4; Miralda v. Heng Sheng (Aug. 4, 2017)
2017 Cal. Super. LEXIS 84419 at *1; Li v. Shi (Aug. 27, 2021) 2021 Cal.
Super. LEXIS 26495 at *1.)
CONCLUSION
            For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Defendant
Matthew Moore’s motion to quash service of summons.
