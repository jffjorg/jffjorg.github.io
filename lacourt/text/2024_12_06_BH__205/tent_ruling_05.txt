  RE:
  Defendant’s demurrer to first 
  amended complaint
 



 
BACKGROUND
This
is a defamation case.  Plaintiff Larry
Caldwell sues Defendant Matthew Green for allegedly making the defamatory
statement to the Daily Journal that “Larry Caldwell was
unlawfully practicing while suspended from Oct. 2019 to Aug. 2021; ordered by
the Supreme Court due to a violation of Rule 9.22.”  (First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) ¶3.)  
Caldwell claims this is a false
statement as his law license has never been suspended.  (Id. ¶4.)  Caldwell alleges on information and belief
that Green made this defamatory per se statement in furtherance of his threat,
“to destroy Larry Caldwell and his family” in retaliation for Mr. Caldwell’s
representation of Matthew Green’s sister, Paula Green, in lawsuits between
them.  (Id. ¶9.)  Caldwell claims Green has made similar
threats to other attorneys representing his sister.  (Id. ¶8.)  
This hearing is on Green’s demurrer
to the FAC.  Green argues that the
allegedly defamatory statement is in fact true based on judicially noticeable
facts, and in any event is privileged pursuant to the Fair and True Reporting
Privilege under Civ. Code § 47(d).
MEET AND CONFER
Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41 requires that before
the filing of a demurrer the moving party “shall meet and confer in person or
by telephone” with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer
for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a).)  The parties are to meet and confer at least
five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc. §
430.41(a)(2).)  Thereafter, the moving
party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer
efforts. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(3).) 
Green submits his own declaration, which shows the parties met and
conferred by telephone on September 30, 2024 which is more than five days from
the date the demurrer was filed (on November 7, 2024).  This satisfies the meet and confer
requirements of § 430.41.      
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Green requests judicial notice of (1) an
October 30, 2019 Supreme Court of California Order, IN THE MATTER OF THE
SUSPENSION OF LICENSEES OF THE STATE BAR PURSUANT TO RULE 9.22, CALIFORNIA
RULES OF COURT, suspending LARRY JACK CALDWELL, #88867 from the practice of law;
(2) an August 26, 2021 Supreme Court of California Order, IN THE MATTER OF THE
SUSPENSION OF LICENSEES OF THE STATE BAR PURSUANT TO RULE 9.22, CALIFORNIA
RULES OF COURT, terminating the October 30, 2019 suspension of LARRY JACK
CALDWELL, #88867 from the practice of law; (3) the Amended Judgment from the
Los Angeles Superior Court elder abuse case against Paula R. Green, LASC Case
No. 16STPB01322; (4) the Statement of Decision from Los Angeles Superior Court
elder abuse case against Paula Green, LASC Case No. l6STPB0l 322; (5) Minute
Orders from the Los Angeles Superior Court elder abuse case against Paula
Green, LASC Case No. l6STPB01322, showing Larry J. Caldwell appeared as an attorney,
while allegedly suspended by order of the California Supreme Court, during the
time period October 2019 to August 2021; and (6) the first page of file-stamped
court documents from various actions in California courts, filed by Larry J.
Caldwell practicing as an attorney, while allegedly suspended by order of the
California Supreme Court, during the time period October 2019 to August 2021.  
The Court grants the request as to (1)-(2)
and (5)-(6) pursuant to Evid. Code § 452 subds. (c) and (d) as court records
and official acts of a judicial department of this state.  The Court also grants the request pursuant to
§ 452 subd. (h) as “[f]acts and propositions that are not reasonably subject to
dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to
sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy”. 
Further, the Court grants the request pursuant to § 453 which requires
the court to take judicial notice of any matter specified in § 452 if a party requests it, and
“(a) Gives each adverse party sufficient notice of the request, through
the pleadings or otherwise, to enable such adverse party to prepare to meet the
request; and (b) Furnishes the court with sufficient information to enable
it to take judicial notice of the matter.”
As to (3)-(4), the decisions in Green’s case
against his sister are not relevant to this demurrer.  Courts may take judicial notice of facts
established by records from other state or federal court proceedings “if those proceedings
have a direct relation to matters at issue.” 
(Trigueros v. Adams (9th Cir. 2011) 658 F.3d 983, 987.)  Courts, therefore, should decline to
take judicial notice of irrelevant facts. (See, e.g., Turnacliff
v. Westly (9th Cir. 2008) 546 F.3d 1113, 1120 n.4.)  Accordingly, the Court denies the request as to
(3)-(4) as seeking judicial notice of irrelevant facts.  
Caldwell requests judicial notice of the (1) State
Bar of California Certificate of Standing for Larry Jack Caldwell; (2) The
State Bar of California Attorney Profile for Larry Jack Caldwell; (3) The State
Bar of California Attorney Profile for Matthew Elliott Green (aka Matthew
Green); and (4) that the Daily Journal published an article that Caldwell co-authored.

The Court grants the request as to (1)-(2) pursuant
to Cal. Evid. Code 452(c) as official acts of an executive, judicial or
legislative department of this state. 
The Court also grants the request pursuant to § 452 subd. (h) as
“[f]acts and propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are
capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of
reasonably indisputable accuracy”. 
Further, the Court grants the request pursuant to § 453 which requires
the court to take judicial notice of any matter specified in Section 452 if a party requests it, and
“(a) Gives each adverse party sufficient notice of the request, through
the pleadings or otherwise, to enable such adverse party to prepare to meet the
request; and (b) Furnishes the court with sufficient information to enable
it to take judicial notice of the matter.” 
The Court denies the request as to (3)-(4) as these items are not
relevant to the instant motion.  
LEGAL STANDARD
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of
the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235
Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A demurrer can be
used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under
attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 (in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not
consider declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not
accepted for the truth of their contents).) 
For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint
are assumed to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of
conclusions of law. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
967.)         
Leave to amend must be allowed where there is
a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 (court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to
amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment”); Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency
(2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 (“A demurrer should not be sustained without
leave to amend if the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of
action under any theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can
be cured by amendment.”).)  The burden is
on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  
DISCUSSION
According to the Complaint,
the allegedly defamatory statement was that “Larry Caldwell was unlawfully
practicing while suspended from Oct. 2019 to Aug. 2021; ordered by the Supreme
Court due to a violation of Rule 9.22.”  Green
argues that this statement is true based on the judicially noticeable facts,
and truth is a complete defense against civil liability for defamation.  The Court agrees.  
The
Supreme Court of California Order No. 242988, dated August 26 2021, “IN THE
MATTER OF THE SUSPENSIONS OF LICENSEES OF TH STATE BAR PURSUANT TO RULE 9.22
CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT” and signed by the Chief Justice of the California
Supreme Court states: "Having been provided with proof of compliance
pursuant to Family Code 17520, the suspension of LARRY JACK
CALDWELL #88867 pursuant to our order filed on October 30, 2019 is hereby
terminated. The Order is final forthwith.” (Defendant's Request for Judicial
Notice, Ex. R (emphasis added).).  There
can be no denying that the Supreme Court of California had suspended Caldwell in
2019. 
Furthermore,
the Supreme Court of California Order No. 242988, dated October 30, 2019, “IN
THE MATTER OF THE SUSPENSIONS OF LICENSEES OF THE STAT BAR PURSUANT TO RULE
9.22 CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT” and signed by the Chief Justice of the
California Supreme Court, states: “that upon receipt by the State Bar of
California of a release issued by the appropriate local support agency pursuant
to Family Code 17520, the State Bar shall certify the fact of the receipt of
such release to the Clerk of the Supreme Court and the suspension shall
be terminated by order of this Court and the individual shall be reinstated
from suspension, and to all rights and privileges, duties and
responsibilities incident thereto.” (Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice,
Ex. Q (emphasis added).) 
The
October 30, 2019 Order further stated, “that until reinstated as above
provided, the individual shall be precluded from practicing law as an attorney
of law, or an attorney or agent of another in and before all the courts,
commissions and tribunals of this state, and from holding himself or herself
out to the public as an attorney or counsel at law.” (Defendant’s Request for
Judicial Notice, Ex. Q).  As a matter of
law, therefore, Caldwell was suspended from practicing law by the California Supreme
Court in 2019, and the suspension was terminated by the California Supreme
Court’s order in 202l. 
In
his Opposition, CALDWELL argues that he was never suspended by the California
State Bar.  Caldwell has presented a certificate of standing from the
State Bar of California which states: “This is to certify that according to the
records of the State Bar, LARRY JACK CALDWELL, #88867 was admitted to the
practice of law in this state by the Supreme Court of California on November
29, 1979 and has been since that date, and is at date hereof, an ACTIVE
licensee of the State Bar of California; and that no recommendation for
discipline for professional or other misconduct has ever been made by the Board
of Trustees or a Disciplinary Board to the Supreme Court of the State of
California.”  (Ex. 1 to Caldwell
Decl.)  This evidence is beside
the point because the alleged defamatory publication stated nothing about Caldwell
being suspended by the California State Bar and only consisted of a transmittal
of two California Supreme Court orders that suspended Caldwell in 2019 and eventually
reinstated him in 2021.  
Alternatively, Green argues
that his statements are protected by the fair and true reporting privilege.  Under Civ. Code, § 47, subd. (d),
the fair and true reporting privilege protects
a fair and true report in, or a communication to, a
public journal, of a judicial proceeding, or anything said in the course
thereof.  It is an
absolute privilege—that is, it applies regardless of the defendants’
motive for making the reports.  (Argentieri v. Zuckerberg (2017) 8
Cal.App.5th 768, 787-788.)  To
be fair and true, the report must capture the substance, the gist or sting, of
the subject proceedings as measured by considering the natural and probable
effect of the report on the mind of the average reader.  (Id.) 
The defendant is entitled to a certain degree of flexibility/literary
license in this regard, such that the privilege will apply even if there is a
slight inaccuracy in details—one that does not lead the reader to be affected
differently by the report than he or she would be by the actual truth.  (Id.) 
Here, as with Green’s truth defense, the judicially noticeable facts
show that Green’s reporting to the Daily Journal is true and fair, and
therefore, privileged.  
The
Opposition argues that defendant’s affirmative defenses of truth and the true
and fair reporting privilege raise questions for the jury and are not subject
to a demurrer.  In fact, Caldwell’s
suspension is pursuant to a final order of the California Supreme Court, which
is subject to judicial notice, and the Court can sustain a demurrer based on
judicially noticeable facts, even if it contradicts allegations in the
complaint.  (Fontenot
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 264–265
(in
sustaining  demurrer, court properly
took judicial notice of recorded documents that clarified and to some extent
contradicted plaintiff's allegations).)  Further,
case law indicates that the defense of truth is a question of law when, as
here, there is no dispute as to what occurred in the judicial proceeding
reported upon or as to what was contained in it.  (McClatchy Newspapers v. Superior Court (1987)
189 Cal.App.3d 961, 976 (citing Kilgore v. Younger (1982) 30
Cal.3d 770, 777; Jennings
v.
Telegram-Tribune Co.,164 Cal.App.3d 119, 127; Grillo
v.
Smith, 144 Cal.App.3d 868, 873-874.)
Finally,
Caldwell argues that Green cannot claim the fair and true report privilege because
 the Daily Journal is not a “public
journal”.  Caldwell does not provide any factual
support for its position.  The Los Angeles
Daily Journal is a newspaper of general circulation in California, and
therefore, it is a public journal covered by the true and fair reporting
privilege. 
CONCLUSION
            For the foregoing
reasons, the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the defamation claim.
