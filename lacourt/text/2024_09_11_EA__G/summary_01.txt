And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the motion by House of God's Reward (HOGR) and Charlie Yang to vacate the dismissal of their action. The motion was filed due to counsel's inadvertence and excusable neglect in failing to appear for a final status conference. The court finds that the dismissal was caused by counsel's mistake and not by the fault of the parties. The judge intends to set new trial and final status conference dates at the hearing on September 11, 2024.
