Investment I, LLC’s Application for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiffs Pacific Castle Colima I, LLC and Master K
Investment I, LLC’s Application for Default Judgment is GRANTED in the reduced
amount of $12,887.18.
BACKGROUND
This
is an unlawful detainer action. In September 2022, Plaintiffs Pacific Castle
Colima I, LLC (Pacific Castle) and Master K Investment I, LLC (Master K)
entered into a lease agreement with Defendant 1655G Azusa LLC (1655G Azusa) in which
Pacific Castle and Master K agreed to lease a commercial property in Hacienda
Heights to 1655G Azusa for a five-year term. In support of the lease agreement,
Defendants Peter Chong and Dung Nguyen executed personal guaranties. In April
2024, Pacific Castle and Master K allege 1655G Azusa, Chong, and Nguyen (collectively,
the 1655G Azusa Defendants) failed to comply with a three-business-day notice
to pay rent or quit.
On April
17, 2024, Pacific Castle and Master K filed a complaint against the 1655G Azusa
Defendants and Does 1-10, alleging a cause of action for unlawful detainer. On April
23, 2024, Pacific Castle and Master K’s process server served Nguyen with
substitute service and 1655G Azusa and Chong with personal service in Oakland.
On May
1, 2024, the court entered default against 1655G Azusa and Chong after they
failed to file a timely answer. On May 14, 2024, the court entered default
against Nguyen after Nguyen also failed to timely file an answer.
On
May 14, 2024, the court entered a clerk’s judgment of possession in favor
Pacific Castle and Master K against the 1655G Azusa Defendants.
On July
29, 2024, Pacific Castle and Master K submitted the present application for
default judgment. A case management conference is set for September 11, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Pacific
Castle and Master K seek default judgment against the 1655G Azusa Defendants in
the total amount of $13,268.20, including $11,524.27 in damages, $735.73 in
attorney fees, and $1,008.20 in costs. Because the court finds Pacific Castle
and Master K have submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS their
application for default judgment with the following modifications.
While
Pacific Castle and Master K seek $11,976.48 in holdover damages, the court
notes this calculation is incorrect. Instead, the court notes the proper amount
should be $11,606.56 ($269.92 multiplied by 43 days (5/1/2024 to 6/13/2024)).
The court then adjusts this amount to $11,154.35 after consideration of the
1655G Azusa Defendants’ overpayment of $452.21. Based on these calculations,
the court also reduces Pacific Castle and Master K’s awarded attorney fees to $724.63
($690.00 + $34.63 or 3% of $1,154.35).
Accordingly,
the total judgment is calculated at $12,887.18.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Pacific Castle and Master K’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED in
the reduced amount of $12,887.18.
