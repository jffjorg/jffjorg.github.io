  - "If plaintiffs respond to comprehensive interrogatories seeking all known facts with boilerplate answers that restate their allegations, or simply provide laundry lists of people and/or documents, the burden of production will almost certainly be shifted to them once defendants move for summary judgment and properly present plaintiff's factually devoid discovery responses."
  - "There is evidence that Plaintiff used Dr. Scholls every day for decades and during 1960s and 1970s was purchasing the product from Defendant's stores."

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The case involves a plaintiff who developed mesothelioma after being exposed to asbestos in products from the defendant, Longs Drug Stores California, LLC.

The defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff does not have evidence of exposure to their products and that the plaintiff's claims are therefore without merit. The judge denied the motion for summary judgment, finding that there are disputed issues of fact regarding the plaintiff's exposure to asbestos in the defendant's products.

The defendant also moved for summary adjudication of the negligence, strict liability, and negligent misrepresentation claims, arguing that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to support these claims. The judge granted the motion for summary adjudication on these claims, finding that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to support their claims.

Finally, the defendant moved for summary adjudication on the claim for punitive damages, arguing that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to support their claim. The judge granted the motion for summary adjudication on this claim, finding that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to support their claim.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment, grants the defendant's motion for summary adjudication on certain claims, and denies the defendant's motion for summary adjudication on the claim for punitive damages.
