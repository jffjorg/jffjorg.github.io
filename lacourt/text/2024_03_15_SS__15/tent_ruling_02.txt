 Case Number:  22STCV19760    Hearing Date:   March 15, 2024    Dept:  15 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE MOTION TO COMPEL 
            Defendant
American International Industries served a subpoena on R. Mark Bailey and
Asbestos TEM Laboratories for a sample of Clubman Talc, chain of custody
documents regarding the talc sample, and all documents created as a result of
testing the talc sample.  Bailey was designated
as an expert in a different case but did not testify in that case and he did
not produce documents in that case.  He
is not a designated expert in this case. 
Defendant filed a motion to compel the production of documents
responsive to the subpoena.
            When an
expert is designated to testify in a case, his work product is subject to
disclosure.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2034.210.)  Here the Bailey is not
designated to testify in this case.  His
work product was not produced in the prior case and he did not testify in the
prior case.  Defendant does not cite any
law requiring the production of undisclosed expert work product from a
different case.  Therefore, the motion to
compel the production of documents created by Bailey for the prior case is denied.
            The
motion to compel the production of the talc sample and chain of custody
documents is granted.  Those items are
not Bailey’s work product, and they are potentially relevant in this case.  They are to be produced within the next 15
days.
            The
motion is granted in part and denied in part.
            The moving
party is to give notice.
