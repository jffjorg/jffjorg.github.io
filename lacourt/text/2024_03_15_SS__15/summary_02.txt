And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel production of documents filed by the defendant, American International Industries. The defendant served a subpoena on R. Mark Bailey and Asbestos TEM Laboratories for a sample of Clubman Talc, chain of custody documents, and documents created as a result of testing the talc sample. The motion seeks to compel Bailey to produce documents created for a prior case. The judge denied the motion, citing that Bailey was not designated as an expert in this case and did not produce documents in the prior case. The judge granted the motion to compel the production of the talc sample and chain of custody documents, as they are potentially relevant in this case. The defendant is required to produce these documents within 15 days.
