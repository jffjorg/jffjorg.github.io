[1]           As a final note, as the Court
previously explained on the demurrer to the FACC, this cause of action’s
citations to Civil Code section 818, 821 and 732 appears unrelated to a claim
for waste, rendering the label somewhat confusing. Instead, it appears that
Cross-Complainant intended to cite the Code of Civil Procedure instead. The
SACC fails to correct this error.
