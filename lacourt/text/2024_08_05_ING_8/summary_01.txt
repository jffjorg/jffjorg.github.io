And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Keese Hardgraves LLP, has filed a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint (FAC) to change the third cause of action from breach of oral contract to breach of written contract. The motion is granted because the plaintiff has complied with the procedural requirements and there is no opposition filed. The plaintiff is ordered to file the FAC as a standalone document within 10 days, and the September 10, 2024 case management conference will remain on calendar.
