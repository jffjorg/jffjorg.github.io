[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further
Responses from Defendant Mirko Pavlovich to Special Interrogatory Nos. 15-35
(Set One) is GRANTED.  Pavlovich is
ordered to serve further responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 15-35 within

ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of $3560 within 20 days.  Plaintiff

BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiff is suing as assignee of
State Compensation Insurance Fund (“Assignor”). 
Assignor provided Defendant Mirko Pavlovich with worker’s compensation
insurance pursuant to two policies of insurance, Policy Nos. 9107037-17 and
9258320-19.  Defendant Pavlovich breached
the insurance policies by failing to pay the premiums due thereon.  Plaintiff alleges an outstanding balance of
$94,360.60 on Policy No. 9107037-17 and $23,928.87 on Policy No.
9258320-19.  
 
            On July 1, 2022, Plaintiff filed a
complaint alleging (1) breach of contract; (2) open book account; (3) account
stated; and (4) reasonable value. 
Defendant Pavlovich filed an answer on November 7, 2022.  A non-jury trial is scheduled for July 1,
2024. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Applicable Law
 
CCP §2030.300
(a) On receipt of a
response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the
following apply:
            (1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.
            (2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate.
            (3) An objection to an interrogatory
is without merit or too general.
(b)(1) A motion
under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040.
(2) In lieu of a
separate statement required under the California Rules of Court, the court may
allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request and
each response in dispute.
(c) Unless notice
of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response,
or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date
to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing,
the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response to the
interrogatories.
(d) The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
(e) If a party then
fails to obey an order compelling further response to interrogatories, the
court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010). In lieu of, or in addition to, that sanction, the court
may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).
 
Application to
Facts
 
            Meet and Confer
 
            Plaintiff served the Special
Interrogatories on November 15, 2022 and granted an extension to respond until
January 18, 2023.  (Jun Dec., ¶¶1,
2.)  Defendant did not serve his first
set of responses until January 27, 2023, after the extended deadline
expired.  (Jun Dec., ¶3.)  Parties met and conferred by correspondence
and telephonically from February through April 2023 on these initial
responses.  Parties attended an IDC with
the Court on June 1, 2023.  (Jun Dec.,
¶6.)  At the IDC, Defendant agreed to produce
further responses by July 7, 2023 and the agreement was set forth in the
Court’s July 7, 2023 minute order.  (Jun
Dec., ¶6.)  
            Defendant failed to provide further
responses by July 7, 2023 in violation of the Court’s June 1, 2023 order.  (Jun Dec., ¶6.)  Defendant finally provided untimely further
responses on August 15, 2023.  (Jun Dec.,
¶8.)  Parties met and conferred by email
and telephonically regarding these further responses from September through
November 1, 2023.  (Jun Dec.,
¶¶9-10).  At the November 1, 2023 meet
and confer, Defendant indicated that Plaintiff should proceed with its motions
to compel further responses on discovery and insisted the responses were
sufficient.  (Jun Dec., ¶10.)  
            Parties have engaged in extensive
meet and confer efforts regarding Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s Special
Interrogatories (Set One).  Plaintiff
establishes compliance with the meet and confer requirement under CCP
§2030.300(b).  
 
Defendant’s
responses are insufficient and further responses are required
 
Defendant responded
with the same two-sentence paragraph to each of the Special Interrogatories at
issue:  “Bates 60-67 provide the names of
each employee, the hourly rate and type of labor.  From these documents, Plaintiff can just as
easily—if not a lot easier with its vast knowledge of SCIF auditing—as
Defendant (who is a mom and pop construction company) prepare an abstract,
compilation, summary and data of the figures.” 

 
The one-paragraph
response does not fully respond to the interrogatories, which ask that
Defendant identify specific errors by the Assignor in connection with the audit
of Policy Nos. 9107037-17 and 9258320-19 and information regarding the specific
employees and/or independent contractors purportedly hired by Defendant.  Defendant may have been attempting to respond
to the interrogatory pursuant to CCP §2030.230, which allows a responding party
the option to answer an interrogatory by referring to CCP §2030.230 and specify
the writings from which the answer may be derived or ascertained, if “the
answer to an interrogatory would necessitate the preparation or the making of a
compilation, abstract, audit, or summary of or from the documents of the party
to whom the interrogatory is directed, and if the burden or expense of
preparing or making it would be substantially the same for the party
propounding the interrogatory as for the responding party.”  
However, Defendant
lost the right to respond pursuant to CCP §2030.230 by failing to timely
respond to the special interrogatories: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the following rules apply:  (a)
The party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise
the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection
to the interrogatories…”  Defendant also
failed to reference section 2030.230 in his responses.  Defendant’s response is therefore patently
insufficient even if he intended to rely on CCP §2030.230.  
 
            Finally, Defendant failed to oppose
this motion.  If a timely motion to
compel has been filed, the burden is on the responding party to justify any
objection or failure to fully answer the interrogatories and RFAs. (Coy v.
Sup.Ct. (Wolcher) (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220–221; Fairmont Ins. Co. v.
Sup.Ct. (Stendell) (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)  Defendant failed to justify his failure to
fully respond to the special interrogatories. 

Plaintiff’s Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatory Nos. 15-35 is
GRANTED.  Defendant Pavlovich is ordered
to serve responses within 20 days.
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests
sanctions in the amount of $4,560 against Defendant Pavlovich and his counsel,
Reza Sina.  The requested sanctions are
based on 6 hours of motion preparation, 3 hours of anticipated time to review any
opposition, prepare a reply and prepare and attend the hearing on this motion
at $500/hr.  No opposition was
filed.  Plaintiff is awarded $3,500 in
sanctions and $60 in filing fees for a total of $3,560.   
            
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses from Defendant Mirko Pavlovich to Special
Interrogatory Nos. 15-35 (Set One) is GRANTED. 
Pavlovich is ordered to serve further responses to Special
Interrogatories Nos. 15-35 within 20 days. 
Pavlovich and counsel Sina are ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of
$3560 within 20 days.  
 
            Plaintiff to give notice.
