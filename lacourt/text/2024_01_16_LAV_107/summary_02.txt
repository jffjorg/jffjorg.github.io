And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling sustaining Defendant FOE's demurrer to Plaintiff's complaint with leave to amend. The complaint alleges that the defendants, including FOE, failed to provide safe access and created a hazardous environment that led to a motor vehicle collision and injuries to the plaintiff. However, the court finds that the complaint does not provide sufficient facts to show what duty FOE owed, and that the allegations are uncertain and vague. The court concludes that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for negligence against FOE.

The court grants leave to amend the complaint, but requires the plaintiff to specify what duty FOE owed and provide more detailed allegations of fact to support the claim. The case will be set for hearing on January 16, 2024, to give the plaintiff an opportunity to file an amended complaint.
