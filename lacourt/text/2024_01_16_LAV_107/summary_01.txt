English-text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the defendant, Mirko Pavlovich, to special interrogatories (Set One). Pavlovich is ordered to serve further responses within 20 days. The court also imposes monetary sanctions of $3560 on Pavlovich and his counsel, Reza Sina, for their failure to timely respond to the special interrogatories and for their insufficient responses. The court finds that Pavlovich's responses are evasive and incomplete and that he failed to comply with the court's June 1, 2023 order to provide further responses by July 7, 2023. The court also notes that Pavlovich failed to oppose the motion and did not justify his failure to fully respond to the special interrogatories.
