Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Guffey et al v. Rokit Inc, et al, a combination class and PAGA action alleging violations of wage and hour laws. The Judge has overruled the demurrer filed by Defendants, finding that the arguments raised are not persuasive at this stage, on this record. The Judge has also set a new deadline for filing the answer and ordered the parties to meet and confer and prepare a proposed case management order.

The Judge found that the Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled the ultimate facts regarding the doctrine of integrated enterprise, and that the "other action" argument is not persuasive. The Judge also found that the arbitration between Defendants and a different Plaintiff is not an "action" for demurrer purposes.

The Judge has set a case management conference for February 28, 2024, at 8:30 am, and has ordered the parties to meet and confer and prepare a proposed case management order in light of the guidance offered above.
