  Case Number:  21STCV37165    Hearing Date:   February 6, 2024    Dept:  14 Shaposhnik v. Select Portfolio Servicing Case Background
 
Plaintiff Shaposhnik alleges that
Defendants are improperly attempting to foreclose on her home.
 
On October 26, 2021, Plaintiff Orna
Shaposhnik (“Shaposhnik”), filed her Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) for (1) Violation
of Civil Code § 2923.5; (2) Violation of Civil Code § 2924(a)(1); (3)
Violation of Civil Code § 2923.6; (4) Violation of Civil Code § 2923.7;
(5) Violation of Civil Code § 2923.9; (6) Violation of Civil Code § 2923.10;
(7) Unfair Competition; (8) Cancellation of Instruments; (9) Wrongful Foreclosure;
and (10) Quiet Title against Defendants Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (“SPS”);
US Bank, N.A. as Trustee for WaMu Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates Series
2006-AR11 (“US Bank”); Quality Loan Service Corporation (“Quality Loan”); and
DOES 1-10. 
 
            On December
17, 2021, Plaintiff filed an “Amendment to Complaint” substituting Defendant Redwood
Holdings, LLC (“Redwood”) in lieu of DOE 1.
 
            On February
10, 2022, this court sustained the demurrer of Defendants SPS and US Bank to
the second, fourth, and fifth causes of action, with 30 days leave to amend. No
amendment was made.
 
            On March
29, 2022, Defendant Quality Loan filed its Answer. On April 19, 2022,
Defendants SPS and US Bank filed their joint Answer. 
 
            On June 17,
2022, this case was stayed pending bankruptcy proceedings. On October 19, 2022,
the stay was lifted pursuant to an order issued by Judge Martin Barash in
Bankruptcy Court.
 
            On February
23, 2023, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed Defendants SPS and US Bank, without
prejudice.
 
On April 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed her
Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) for (1) Violation of Civil Code § 2923.5;
(2) Violation of Civil Code § 2924(a)(1); (3) Violation of Civil Code
§ 2923.6; (4) Violation of Civil Code § 2923.7; (5) Violation of
Civil Code § 2923.9; (6) Violation of Civil Code § 2923.10; (7)
Unfair Competition; (8) Cancellation of Instruments; (9) Wrongful Foreclosure;
and (10) Quiet Title against Defendants SPS, US Bank, Quality Loan, Redwood, and
DOES 2-10. Only the second, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth causes of action
are asserted against Defendant Quality Loan. Only the tenth cause of action is
asserted against Defendant Redwood.
 
Because of the prior proceedings,
set forth above, Defendants SPS and US Bank remain dismissed without prejudice.
The case proceeds only against Defendants Quality Loan and Redwood.
 
On June 15, 2023, Defendant Redwood
filed its Answer.
 
On August 10, 2023, this court
granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of Defendant Quality Loan as to the
second, seventh, and tenth causes of action. The court granted 10 days leave to
amend as to the seventh cause of action, but Plaintiff elected to appeal
instead. The appeal was dismissed on January 4, 2024.

filed its First Amended Answer.
 
On February 5, 2024, Plaintff’s ex
parte application to Continue Trial was Granted.
 
Jury Trial is currently set for April

(1)       Motion to
Consolidate
 
Defendant Redwood
now moves this court for an order consolidating this case with Case No. 23 STCV
15231.
 
Decision
 
            Defendant
Redwood’s Request for Judicial Notice is GRANTED. 
 
The motion is DENIED.
 
Governing Standard
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure § 1048(a) provides that:
 
“When actions involving a common
question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint
hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may
order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.”
 
California Rules of Court Rule 3.350
provides:
 
“(a) Requirements of motion
(1) A notice of motion to
consolidate must:
(A) List all named parties in each
case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of their respective
attorneys of record;
(B) Contain the captions of all
the cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest numbered case shown first;
and
(C) Be filed in each case sought
to be consolidated.
(2) The motion to consolidate:
(A) Is deemed a single motion for
the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but memorandums,
declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in the lowest
numbered case;
(B) Must be served on all
attorneys of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the cases sought
to be consolidated; and
(C) Must have a proof of service
filed as part of the motion.
 
(b) Lead case
Unless otherwise provided in the
order granting the motion to consolidate, the lowest numbered case in the
consolidated case is the lead case.
 
(c) Order
An order granting or denying all or
part of a motion to consolidate must be filed in each case sought to be
consolidated. If the motion is granted for all purposes including trial, any
subsequent document must be filed only in the lead case.
 
(d) Caption and case number
All documents filed in the
consolidated case must include the caption and case number of the lead case,
followed by the case numbers of all of the other consolidated cases.”
 
Local Rule 3.3(g) provides in
relevant part:
 
“(1) Cases may not be consolidated
unless they are in the same department. A motion to consolidate two or more
cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in different
departments, have been related into a single department, or if the cases were
already assigned to that department. 
 
(2) Upon consolidation of cases,
the first filed case will be the lead case, unless otherwise ordered by the
court. After consolidation, all future papers to be filed in the consolidated
case must be filed only in the case designated as the lead case.”
 
Discussion
 
            Code
of Civil Procedure § 1048 gives courts discretion to consolidate cases
where that would serve two related purposes: avoiding unnecessary cost and
avoiding delay. Neither purpose would be served by consolidation of these
cases.
 
            The
two cases were related because the issues in each are virtually identical,
although the defendants are different. The lead case, bearing Case No. 21 STCV
37165, has been pending for more than two years. It has been through a series
of dispositive motions and is now on the eve of trial. In fact, trial documents
have already been filed. The second case, bearing Case No. 23 STCV 15231, is
only a few months old and not yet at issue. It has never had a trial date.
 
             Consolidating these cases would mean that the defendants
to the lead case would have to wait months, maybe years, before they could get
to the trial for which they have already prepared. And the result is going to
be a trial on the same issues, just with more defendants. Trying the lead case
on schedule, by contrast, will give full resolution to the defendants present
in that case, while also resolving most of the issues that would be tried in
the second case. The parties to the second case could then use the result in
the first case to help them settle or otherwise reach an early resolution in
their dispute.
 
Conclusion
 
            It
is time to resolve at least one of these cases. Consolidation will result in unnecessary
delay for the first case. It may well result in unnecessary cost for the
parties in the second case, as they proceed to litigate issues that could have
been resolved by a trial in the first case. Therefore, the motion to
consolidate is DENIED.
 
(2)       Motion to Compel Deposition
 
            Defendant
Redwood now moves this court for orders directing Plaintiff to sit for her
deposition and pay $1,416.50 in monetary sanctions.
 
Decision
 
            The
motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff is to sit for her deposition on or before February
13, 2024.
 
            Plaintiff
is also ORDERED to pay sanctions of $1,416.50 to Defendant Redwood’s counsel within
30 days.
 
Discussion
 
            According
to the moving papers, Defendant Redwood noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for Monday,
January 15, 2024. Plaintiff did not serve an objection. On the afternoon of
Friday, January 12, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel called Defendant Redwood’s
counsel to tell him that Plaintiff would not appear. At that point, it was too
late for Defendant Redwood to cancel the court reporter without incurring
cancellation fees. Plaintiff’s counsel did not offer an alternative date for
deposition.
 
            On
January 24, 2024, this court advanced this motion to be heard on this date.
Plaintiff was instructed to file her opposition, if any, on or before January
29, 2024. No opposition has been received. The lack of an opposition operates as a concession that the motion has
merit. See California Rules of Court Rule 3.1113(a); see also Rule 3.1320(f);
Herzberg v. County of Plumas (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1, 20.
 
            Therefore,
the motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff is to sit for her deposition on or before March
18, 2024. Plaintiff is also to pay sanctions of $1,416.50 to Defendant Redwood’s
counsel within 30 days.
