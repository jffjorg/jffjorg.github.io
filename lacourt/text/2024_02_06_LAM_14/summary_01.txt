And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses two motions: (1) a motion to consolidate this case with Case No. 23 STCV 15231, and (2) a motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Shaposhnik.

Regarding the motion to consolidate, the Judge finds that consolidating the two cases would cause unnecessary delay and cost, as the second case is not yet at issue and the defendants in the first case have already prepared for trial. The Judge grants the motion to compel deposition, ordering Plaintiff Shaposhnik to sit for her deposition on or before February 13, 2024, and to pay sanctions of $1,416.50 to Defendant Redwood's counsel within 30 days.
