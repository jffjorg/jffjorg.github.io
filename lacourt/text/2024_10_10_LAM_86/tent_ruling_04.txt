Case:                           Banco Agrícola,
S.A. v. Sigue Corporation et al. (24STCV10674)
  
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Banco Agrícola, S.A.’s UNOPPOSED
application for right to attach order with respect to defendant Sigue
Corporation is GRANTED. 
 
Pursuant to CCP §484.090, the Court finds:
 

the claim is one upon
     which attachment may be issued;
plaintiff has established
     the probable validity of the claim;
attachment is not sought
     for any purpose other than recovery on the claim; and
the amount to be attached
     is greater than zero.

 
On October 6, 2009, plaintiff Banco
Agrícola, S.A. and defendant Sigue Corporation entered into an International
Money Transfer Processing and Service Agreement (“Service Agreement”). (Magaña
Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. 1.) Under the Service Agreement, defendant transmitted
remittance orders to plaintiff, who then advanced monetary disbursements to
payees in El Salvador. (Magaña Decl. ¶ 5.) The Service Agreement required
defendant to pay transaction fees, as well as the amounts that plaintiff
advanced to payees based on defendant’s remittance orders. (Magaña Decl. ¶¶ 5-7
& Ex. 1 at Appx. A, C.) 
 
Beginning July 2023, defendant
began to untimely reimburse plaintiff for the remittances. (Magaña Decl. ¶ 8.)
In the fourth quarter of 2023, plaintiff warned defendant that it would be
forced to terminate the Service Agreement unless defendant became current on
its payment. (Magaña Decl. ¶ 9.) Defendant subsequently became current but
thereafter failed to pay for remittances for January 15-22, 2024, as well as
for transaction fees for December 2023 and January 2024. (Magaña Decl. ¶ 10.)
On January 22, 2024, plaintiff notified defendant that it was stopping services
and demanded immediate reimbursement of remittances and transaction fees in an
amount of $1,036,245.81 to date. (Magaña Decl. ¶ 10 & Ex. 2; see also Magaña
Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. 1 at § XI(d) [allowing for suspension of Service
Agreement].)
 
On January 26, 2024, defendant’s
Chief Executive Officer acknowledged that a total of $1,036,245.81 for
remittances and transaction fees was payable to plaintiff. (Magaña Decl. ¶ 11
& Ex. 3.) The total balance stated in the January 22, 2024 letter did not
include transaction fees up to the end of January 2024, which totaled
$3,460.50. (Magaña Decl. ¶ 13.) Accordingly, plaintiff seeks to attach a
principal sum of $1,039,706.31 ($1,036,245.81 balance as of 1/22/24 + $3,460.50
additional transaction fees for January 2024). 
 
Accordingly, the application will be granted in the amount
of $1,341,778.71, which includes $1,039,706.31 in principal, as well as $622.40
in costs and $301,450.00 for attorney fees. 
(See Linzer Decl. ¶¶ 9, 12-13 & Ex. B.)
 
The writ shall issue upon the posting of bond in the amount
of $10,000. (CCP § 489.220.) 
 
The Court will sign the proposed order, electronically
received on August 28, 2024.
