(23STCP00264) 
  
TENTATIVE
RULING:
 
Petitioner Tiffany Abraham’s UNOPPPOSED Motion to Enforce
Writ of Mandate Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1097 is GRANTED. 
 
I.                  
BACKGROUND
 
On 12/19/23, the Court granted petitioner’s Petition for
Writ of Mandate in part. The ruling stated, as relevant here: “Respondent shall
produce the 1,000 to 1,900 emails it is withholding. In addition, within 30
days hereof, respondent must use the search terms provided by petitioner in her
March 31, 2023 letter and produce the documents found pursuant to such search terms."
(Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. 1.) Notice was provided to respondents.
(Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. 1.) 
 
On 1/18/24, respondents informed petitioner that they
reviewed 75% of the potentially responsive emails, produced 1,340 emails, and
anticipated completing review and production within two weeks. (Gutierrez Decl.
¶ 6 & Ex. 4 [1/18/24 at 4:13 PM email].) On the same date, petitioner
responded by asking respondents whether they completed the search ordered by
the Court and whether the emails resulting from the search will be produced
within 30 days of the Court’s order. (Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 4 [1/18/24
at 8:31 PM email].) Petitioner also asked whether respondents will be producing
“the identified 10,103 emails containing 15,823 documents which [respondents]
identified to the Court during the December 19, 2023 hearing.” (Gutierrez Decl.
¶ 6 & Ex. 4 [1/18/24 at 8:31 PM email].) 
 
On 1/22/24, respondents indicated that they continue to
review the “balance of the approximately 10,000 emails [they] identified at the
hearing as being potentially responsive, and will produce the responsive emails
with two weeks.” (Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 4 [1/22/24 at 4:56 PM email].) Respondents
also confirmed that they conducted the email search ordered by the Court, would
review the emails for responsiveness, and would produce the responsive emails.
(Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 4 [1/22/24 at 4:56 PM email].) On the same date,
petitioner asked respondents how many emails did the Court-ordered search
yield. (Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 4 [1/22/24 at 6:06 PM email].) On
1/24/24, respondents replied, “I am in deposition today, but my understanding
is that there are about 2,550 emails, which are being reviewed for
responsiveness.” (Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 4 [1/24/24 at 3:52 PM email].) 
 
On 1/30/24, petitioner emailed respondents the following:
“Again, please advise whether you have completed the search for emails using
the parameters ordered by the court in Paragraph No. 1 of the Court's order. If
so, again please advise as to the number of emails that have been identified
after conducting the search. When we asked you previously you were only able to
provide a rough estimate as you were in a deposition. I believe it would be
helpful if your office would provide a summary list of emails found pursuant to
the search parameters.” (Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 4 [1/30/24 email].) On
2/6/24, respondents replied that the additional email search has been conducted
and that they are being reviewed for responsiveness. (Gutierrez
Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 4 [2/6/24 at 9:32 AM email].) Respondents expected
production to begin in about two weeks. (Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 4
[2/6/24 at 9:32 AM email].) On 2/6/24, petitioner asked respondents to state
the number of emails that were located using the search terms ordered by the
Court. (Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 4 [2/6/24 at 12:07 PM email].) Petitioner
asserted that respondents were not in compliance with the Court’s order, as
search and production was to be done within 30 days. (Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 6 &
Ex. 4 [2/6/24 at 12:07 PM email].)
 
On 3/5/24, respondents filed an objection to petitioner’s
proposed writ of mandate, proposing that with respect to the Court-ordered
search, production should be limited “to documents that are responsive to the
CPRA request and that are not privileged or subject to exemption.” (Gutierrez
Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. 3.) 
 
On 5/3/24 and twice on 6/17/24, petitioner asked respondents
for an update on compliance with the Court’s 12/19/23 order. (Gutierrez Decl. ¶
6 & Ex. 4 [5/3/24 email, 6/17/24 at 2:48 PM email, 6/17/24 at 10:17 AM
email].) Respondents have not stated for certain how many emails the
Court-order yielded. (Guiterrez Decl.. ¶ 6.)


On 5/23/24, judgment was entered in accordance with the
ruling. (5/23/24 Judgment.) Respondents’ proposed change allowing for a claim
of privilege or exemption was not part of the judgment. 
 
On 6/24/24, the Court issued a writ of mandate directing
respondents City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles World Airports to, as relevant
here, “produce the 1,000 to 1,900 emails it is withholding. In addition, within
30 days hereof, respondent must use the search terms provided by petitioner in
her March 31, 2023 letter and produce the documents found pursuant to such search
terms.” (Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. 2.) The writ of mandate directed
respondents to make and file a return to the writ of mandate by 7/25/24,
setting forth what they have done to comply. (Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. 2.)
On 8/14/24, petitioner personally served the writ of mandate on respondents. (8/15/24
Proofs of Service; Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 7.) 
 
II.               
MERITS
 
Petitioner moves for an order compelling respondents to make
a return of the writ of mandate, produce a list detailing the number of
documents and emails located using the search terms, and state the basis upon
which respondents are withholding any documents. 
 
CCP § 1097 states: “If a peremptory mandate has been issued
and directed to an inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, and it
appears to the court that a member of the tribunal, corporation, or board, or
the person upon whom the writ has been personally served, has, without just
excuse, refused or neglected to obey the writ, the court may, upon motion,
impose a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars. In case of persistence in a
refusal of obedience, the court may order the party to be imprisoned until the
writ is obeyed, and may make any orders necessary and proper for the complete
enforcement of the writ.”
 
As stated above, the writ of mandate was personally served
on respondents on 8/14/24. Further, the instant motion was served on
respondents. The Court thus concludes respondents have refused to comply
with the writ. 
 
Petitioner correctly states that no return has been filed to
the writ. The Court notes that, although the writ states that a return must be
made by 7/25/24, the writ was not personally served on respondents until
8/14/24. Nevertheless, respondents were on notice since 8/14/24, at the latest,
of the commands set forth in the writ. 
Indeed, the logical import of a compliance date that has passed is that
compliance is expected forthwith or within a reasonable period in the future;
it is not reasonable to conclude no compliance is expected at all.  Despite having received notice of the writ,
respondents have not filed any return to the writ or even asserted any sort of
explanation for its failures in an opposition or response this motion. 
 
Moreover, petitioner asked respondents to state how many
emails were returned as a result of the Court-ordered search. Although respondents’
counsel stated on 1/24/24 that 2,550 emails were retrieved (Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 6
& Ex. 4 [1/24/24 at 3:52 PM email]), the stated number was only his
“understanding” and petitioner subsequently sought confirmation of the number
of emails from respondents (Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 4 [2/6/24 at 12:07 PM
email]). Prior to filing this motion, petitioner sought an update from
respondents on compliance with the Court’s 12/19/23 order. (Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 6
& Ex. 4 [5/3/24 email, 6/17/24 at 2:48 PM email, 6/17/24 at 10:17 AM
email].) Respondents never responded or stated with certainty how many emails
the Court-ordered search yielded. (Guiterrez Decl. ¶ 6.) 
 
Further, on 3/5/24, respondents filed an objection to
petitioner’s proposed writ of mandate, seeking the right to withhold emails
based on privilege or exemption. (Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. 3.) The Court
rejected respondents’ proposal. (5/23/24 Judgment; Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 4 &
Ex. 2; see also Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. 1 [“Respondent has had
sufficient time to review the emails for exemption or privilege].) Accordingly,
to the extent that respondents are delaying production due to claims of
privilege or exemption, the delay is unwarranted. 
 
For the foregoing reasons, the motion is GRANTED. By no
later than 10/24/24, respondents City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles World
Airports shall make and file a return of the writ of mandate, produce a list
detailing the number of documents and emails located using the search terms
provided by petitioner in her March 31, 2023 letter, and state the basis upon
which respondents are withholding any documents.  Insofar as the failure to produced responsive
documents is based on privilege, respondents shall at the same time produce a
privilege log of the type required by CCP § 2031.240(c)(1), providing
sufficient information about the withheld document.  (See Catalina Island Yacht Club v.
Superior Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1130 [“A privilege log must
identify with particularity each document the responding party claims is
protected from disclosure by a privilege and provide sufficient factual
information for the propounding party and court to evaluate whether the claim
has merit”].)
