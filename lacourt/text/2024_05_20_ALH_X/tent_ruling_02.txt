BACKGROUND
 
             This claim arises out of Petitioner Mariya
Wrightsman’s (“Petitioner”) claim that the City of Gardena’s (“Respondent” or
“the City”) Ordinance 1854 is unlawful. Petitioner filed this petition on
December 11, 2023, asserting 13 grounds against the City. 
 
The Petition alleges the following,
among other things. Petitioner owns in the City 2 side-by-side parcels of land,
each improved with a duplex. (Petition, ¶ 34.) After month-to-month renters
destroyed her properties, Petitioner decided to try short-term rentals
(“STRs”). (Petition, ¶ 34.)  Petitioner
remodeled the garages of the duplexes and turned them into accessory dwelling
units (“ADUs”).  (Petition, ¶ 34.)  Subsequently, Petitioner placed 2 travel
trailers on each parcel of land, which were a hit (presumably with short-term
renters) and a cheaper way to hire lodging in the City.  (Petition, ¶ 34.)  Therefore, Petitioner had 8 units (i.e., 4
duplex units, 2 ADUs, and 2 trailers) that she could use to rent out as STRs.
(Petition, ¶ 38.)  Ordinance 1854, which
regulates STRs in the City, has caused Petitioner to lose approximate income of
$300,760 per year from the 8 units. (Petition, ¶ 38.) The ordinance defines
STRs as: “Any rental of a dwelling unit or any portion thereof for occupancy,
dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes for a period of 30 consecutive calendar
days or less which does not qualify as a home sharing rental.”  (Petition, p. 252 – a copy of the ordinance,
the bottom of the page.) A home sharing rental is a dwelling that is used for
“[r]enting, for a period of 30 consecutive days or less, of one or more
bedrooms in a dwelling unit that is the primary residence of the host, while
the host lives on site, in the dwelling unit, throughout the guest’s stay.”
(Petition, p. 252, the top of the page [defining home sharing and home sharing
rental.) The ordinance is unlawful because it, among other things, conflicts
with general laws, violates the United States Constitution, and the City failed
to prepare an Environment Impact Report (“EIR”) even though it was required to
do so by the California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”). 
 
TENTATIVE RULINGS
            
            The motion to strike the demurrer is DENIED. 
 
The demurrer is SUSTAINED as follows. The demurrer to the fifth
ground is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. The demurrer to the other grounds
is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. Petitioner is ordered to file and serve her
first amended petition within 30 days of this ruling. Responsive pleadings are
due 30 days from service of those pleadings. 
 
            The motion to strike portions of the petition is moot
given the Court’s ruling on the demurrer. 
 
The motion to dismiss the fifth cause of action with prejudice is
granted.  
 
I.         REQUESTS
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            On March 6,
2024, the City filed a request for judicial notice of the following documents
 
1.    
Exhibit
A: Notice of Exemption, filed with County Clerk/Recorder on September 14, 2023,
County document number 2023202371.
2.    
Exhibit
B: Proof of Service, filed by Plaintiff with this Court in the above-captioned
matter on December 26, 2023.
 
On March 28, 2024, Petitioner filed
a response to the request for judicial notice above. However, in that response,
Petitioner does not object to the request; she only raises arguments that
should have been included in her opposition to the demurrer. 
 
The City’s request is granted as to
all documents above (Exhibits A and B). (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d) [stating that a court can take judicial notice of
court records]; Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement System & Planning
Assn., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1367, fn. 8 [noting that Evidence Code
section 452, subdivisions (c), (g), and (h) have authorized the Court of Appeal
to take judicial notice of recorded documents and resolutions by a county’s
board of supervisors]; Poseidon Development, Inc. v. Woodland Lane Estates,
LLC (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1106, 1117 [“However, the fact a court may take
judicial notice of a recorded deed, or similar document, does not mean it may
take judicial notice of factual matters stated therein”].) 
 
On April 2, 2024, Petitioner filed
a request to take judicial notice of various documents and statutes in support
of her motion to strike the demurrer. On May 2, 2024, Petitioner re-filed two
(2) sets of the same request for judicial notice and also filed a document
titled “Exhibits in Support of Petitioner’s Request for Judicial Notice.” On
April 4, 2024, the City filed its objection to the request, arguing (among other
things) that the request and motion to strike the demurrer seek to turn the
demurrer into a motion for summary judgment. 
 
Petitioner’s request for judicial
notice is denied because the Court did not find those documents relevant in
ruling on Petitioner’s motion to strike the demurrer. 
 
            On May 2,
2024, Petitioner filed two (2) sets of a document titled “Response to
Respondent’s Request for Judicial Notice,” which is the same, if not identical,
to the response to request for judicial notice she filed on March 28, 2024 (see
above).
 
The Court will not consider those
documents because Petitioner should have raised the arguments contained therein
in her opposition to the demurrer. 
 
II.        MOTION TO
STRIKE DEMURRER 
 
            Petitioner filed a Motion to Strike
Demurrer or Portions Thereof to the Petition for Mandamus. 
 
A. LEGAL STANDARD
 
“Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading may serve
and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof ….” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1).) “The court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any
time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper:
 
(a)  
Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper
matter inserted in any pleading.
 
(b)  
Strike out all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an
order of the court.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) A demurrer is a
pleading and, therefore, can be struck pursuant to the above statute. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (a)(2) [“The term ‘pleading’ means a demurrer, answer,
complaint, or cross-complaint”].) 
“A notice of motion to
strike a demurrer, or a portion thereof, shall set the hearing thereon concurrently
with the hearing on the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (a)(3)
[emphasis added].)
B. MEET AND CONFER 
            “Before filing a motion to strike …,
the moving party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for the purpose
of determining if an agreement can be reached that resolves the objections to
be raised in the motion to strike.”  (Code
Civ. Proc. § 435.5, subd. (a).)
 
            Petitioner states that the parties
met and conferred regarding the motion to strike the demurrer. The City does
not dispute that contention. 
 
Accordingly, the Court finds Petitioner satisfied the meet and confer
requirement. 
C. DISCUSSION 
As an initial matter, the City argues that the Court should deny the
motion to strike the demurrer because Petitioner did not provide the City with
16-court-day notice before the hearing. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1005, subd. (b)
[“Unless otherwise ordered or specifically provided by law, all moving and
supporting papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court days before the
hearing. The moving and supporting papers served shall be a copy of the papers
filed or to be filed with the court. However, if the notice is served by mail,
the required 16-day period of notice before the hearing shall be increased by
five calendar days if the place of mailing and the place of address are within
the State of California …”].) The City argues that Petitioner filed the motion
on April 2 but then re-filed in on May 2, 2024. 
 
However, even if the Court were to
find that Petitioner did not give the City the required notice, that would not
be grounds for denying the motion. 
 
Case law holds that the Court can
simply continue the hearing to compensate for insufficient notice. (See Shields
v. Shields (1942) 55 Cal.App.2d 579, 584-585 [holding that lack of enough
notice under Section 1005(b) is a “technical one,” and, in any event, the party
raising that argument did not show they were prejudiced by the other party’s
failure to give them the statutory ten day’s notice instead of nine for the
notice of motion); see also Karz v. Karl (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 637, 648
[“Nothing in [one case], however, supports Karz’ contention that inadequate
notice cannot be remedied by continuing the hearing at which the opponent
appears and contests the motion on the merits. Under such circumstances, this
Division upheld the resulting order in [Shields v. Shields, supra, 55
Cal.App.2d at p. 584]”].) 
 
Here, there is no substantive
difference between the motion to strike Petitioner filed on April 2, 2024, and
the one she re-filed on May 2, 2024. The latter only eliminated the following
sentence included in the former: “Petitioner’s moving and responsive papers
were intended to be read in order, this is intended to be the fourth in line.”
(Motion filed April 2, 2024, p. 1:25-27 [emphasis removed].) 
 
In addition, the Court continued
the hearing for the motion to strike the demurrer from its initial hearing on
April 11, 2024, to May 20, 2024. 
 
Therefore, the City had ample time
to respond to the motion. 
 
Accordingly, the Court finds the
City’s lack of notice argument unpersuasive. 
 
Notwithstanding the above, the
Court finds it proper to deny the
motion to strike. As the City argues, the motion does not challenge
“irrelevant, false, or improper matter” in the demurrer. Instead, it makes
arguments that Petitioner should have raised in her opposition to the demurrer.
Further, Petitioner’s main argument in the motion, that it is improper for the
City to raise its statute of limitations defense on a demurrer, is unpersuasive.
Case law is clear that “statute of limitations is a ‘ground for objection to a
complaint’ … and, therefore, may be raised in a demurrer.” (Cavey v. Tualla
(2021) 69 Cal.App.5th 310, 325.) Accordingly, the motion is denied. 
 
C. CONCLUSION
 
            Petitioner’s Motion to Strike Demurrer or Portions Thereof to the Petition for
Mandamus is DENIED.
 
III.      DEMURRER
TO PETITION 
 
The City demurs the Petition, arguing that the Petition and each of the
13 grounds (A) fail to state facts upon which a valid cause of action can be
maintained and (B) are uncertain, unintelligible and/or ambiguous. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e) and (f).) 
 
A. LEGAL STANDARD
 
Generally, a party may demur a pleading on several
enumerated grounds, including that “the pleading does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action” and is uncertain, meaning
“ambiguous and unintelligible.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e) and
(f).) A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) “A
demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in
some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern
discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Indeed, such demurrers “are disfavored, and are granted
only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably
respond.” (Mahan v. Charles W. Chan Insurance Agency, Inc. (2017) 14
Cal.App.5th 841, 848.) 
When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Wilson v. Transit Authority of City
of Sacramento (1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21.)
A demurrer may be sustained
“only if the complaint fails to state a cause of action under any possible
legal theory.” (Sheehan v. San Francisco
49ers, Ltd. (2009) 45 Cal.4th 992, 998.) The defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or
via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the
evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs.
(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) 
 
“If a complaint does not state a cause of action, but there is a
reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment, leave to
amend must be granted.” (Milligan v. Golden Gate Bridge Highway &
Transportation Dist. (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1, 6.)
B. MEET AND CONFER
Before filing its demurrer, “the demurring party shall meet and confer
in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject
to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 430.41, subd. (a).)
 
Here, the Court finds that the City has satisfied the meet and confer
requirement. (See Declaration of Krista MacNevin Jee in Support of City’s
Demurer and Motion to Strike, filed March 6, 2024, ¶¶ 3-4.) 
C. DISCUSSION
Petitioner’s Objection to the Number of Pages in the Demurrer  
As an initial matter, Petitioner objects to the Demurrer, arguing that it
is 29 pages. 
However, as the City argues, California Rules of Court place a 15-page
limit only on the memorandum of points and authorities section of a demurrer,
not the entire demurrer. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(d) [“Except in a
summary judgment or summary adjudication motion, no opening or responding
memorandum may exceed 15 pages”].) 
Petitioner’s Argument that the Demurrer and Motion to
Strike are Untimely
Petitioner also argues that the Demurrer was late. (See Objection and
Response to Demurrer, filed May 2, 2024 (the “Opposition”), p. 1:15-24 [“A
Petition for Writ of Mandamus was filed, the proper procedure was noticed to
the City, in the prayer, ‘30 days from service, issue the peremptory writ of
mandamus’ [citation] as the time called for per Code Civ. Proc. § 1089.5 (‘the
respondent shall answer or otherwise respond within 30 days after service of
the petition.’) Id., § 1089 (‘On the date ... on which the application for the
writ is noticed,... the party upon whom the writ or notice has been served may
make a return by demurrer, verified answer or both. If the return is by
demurrer alone, the court may allow an answer to be filed within such time as
it may designate.’) The prayer was clear, seeking a peremptory writ, not an
alternative writ. The City waived its right to file a demurrer as it was merely
optional to file before the Court was requested to hear the petition for writ.
Which was noticed as 30 days after Dec. 20, 2023 making Jan. 19, 2024 the day
to be heard on the peremptory writ” (emphasis removed)].)
Indeed, the Court notes that on December 26, 2023, Petitioner filed a
“Proof of Service Summons,” stating that she served the City with the Petition
and other documents on December 20, 2023. 
On January 19, 2024, defense counsel Krista MacNevin Jee filed a
declaration pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 430.41 and 435.5,
stating that the parties were not able to meet and confer at least 5 days
before the 30-day deadline of filing the demurrer as required by statute and,
therefore, the City was entitled to an automatic 30-day extension to file a
responsive pleading. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41, subd. (1)(2) [“The parties
shall meet and confer at least 5 days before the date the responsive pleading
is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least 5 days before
the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party shall be granted
an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a responsive
pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a demurrer
would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a good faith
attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why the parties
could not meet and confer. The 30-day extension shall commence from the date
the responsive pleading was previously due, and the demurring party shall not
be subject to default during the period of the extension. Any further
extensions shall be obtained by court order upon a showing of good cause”];
435.5 [same but with regard to motions to strike].) 
Therefore, according to defense counsel’s declaration, the City’s
deadline to file its demurer and motion to strike the Petition was extended to
February 18, 2024 (i.e., 30 days from January 19, 2024). In her opposition,
Petitioner points out the statements in defense counsel’s declaration.
(Opposition, pp. 1:27-2:2.) On the other hand, the City does not address
defense counsel’s declaration stating that the deadline to file the demurrer or
motion to strike was automatically extended for 30 days from January 19, 2024,
or even dispute Petitioner’s implied argument that the 30-day deadline for the
demurrer was governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1089.5. (Code Civ.
Proc., s 1089.5 [“Where a petition for writ of mandate is filed in the trial
court pursuant to Section 1088.5, and where a record of the proceedings to be
reviewed has been filed with the petition or where no record of a proceeding is
required, the respondent shall answer or otherwise respond within 30 days after
service of the petition. However, where a record of the proceeding to be
reviewed has been requested pursuant to Section 11523 of the Government Code,
or otherwise, and has not been filed with the petition, the party upon whom the
petition has been served, including any real party in interest, shall answer or
otherwise respond within 30 days following receipt of a copy of the record”].)
            Accordingly, the demurrer and motion
to strike portions of the Petition are untimely because the City filed its
motion to strike and demurrer on March 6, 2024, instead of the February 18,
2024 deadline. 
First Ground (Violation of Gov. Code § 54954.2(a)(3)) 
 
“The purpose of the Ralph M. Brown Act is to ‘facilitate public
participation in local government decisions and to curb misuse of democratic
process by secret legislation.’ [Citations.] To achieve this goal, the Ralph M.
Brown Act imposes an ‘open meeting’ requirement on local legislative bodies …. [Citations.]”
(Julian Volunteer Fire Co. Assn. v. Julian-Cuyamaca Fire Protection Dist.
(2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 583, 600–601 (“Julian Volunteer Fire Co. Assn.”).)

 
Government Code “[s]ection 54960.1 permits interested persons to file
lawsuits seeking to invalidate a local entity decision reached in violation of
the Ralph M. Brown Act.” (Julian Volunteer Fire Co. Assn., supra,
62 Cal.App.5th at p. 601.)
 
“Among its provisions, the Brown Act requires that an agenda be posted at
least 72 hours before a regular meeting and forbids action on any items not on
that agenda.” (TransparentGov Novato v. City of Novato (2019) 34
Cal.App.5th 140, 147.) 
 
Under the first ground, the Petition alleges that the City violated the
following statute under the Brown Act: “No action or discussion shall be
undertaken on any item not appearing on the posted agenda, except that members
of a legislative body or its staff may briefly respond to statements made or
questions posed by persons exercising their public testimony rights under
Section 54954.3.” (Gov. Code, § 54954.2, subd. (a)(3).)
 
“Before commencing such an action, however, the district attorney or
interested person must make a demand of the legislative body, within 90 days
from the date the action was alleged to have been taken in violation of the
Act, to cure or correct the action.” (Ingram v. Flippo (1999) 74
Cal.App.4th 1280, 1287 (“Ingram”), disapproved on other grounds in Leon
v. County of Riverside (2023) 14 Cal.5th 910; see also Julian Volunteer
Fire Co. Assn., supra, 62 Cal.App.5th at p. 601 [“To prevail, the
plaintiff must show: (1) the local legislative body violated one or more Ralph
M. Brown Act provisions; (2) the legislative body took action in connection
with the violation; (3) a timely demand for the legislative body to cure or
correct the improper action; (4) the legislative body did not cure or
correct the action; and (5) prejudice from the Ralph M. Brown Act violation. [Citations.]
A very short limitations period (generally 15 days from specified dates)
applies to such action” (emphasis added)].)
 
“If the legislative body does not [cure or correct its action] within 30
days of receiving the demand, the district attorney or interested party may
file suit within 15 days to have the action declared null and void. ([Gov.
Code] § 54960.1, subds.(b) & (c).)” (Ingram, supra, 74
Cal.App.4th at p. 1288.)
 
Here, as the City argues, the Petition fails to allege facts showing that
Petitioner made a timely or even any written demand to the City regarding the
alleged Brown Act violation. (Demurrer, p. 15:5-10.) The Petition only alleges
in a conclusory manner that: “The usual requirement of a demand, as to this
case, squarely falls in the exception to the rule, ‘it appears that the demand
would have been futile.’ (Phelan v. Superior Court (1950) 35 Cal.2d 363,
372).” (Petition, ¶ 22.) In her opposition
filed on May 2, 2024, Petitioner does not address the
City’s timely written demand argument. 
 
The Court also finds the first ground is uncertain. Indeed, the Petition
cites portions of the City’s Regular Meeting Notice and Agenda on August 22,
2023, but fails to allege how the City violated the relevant statute. In other
words, Petitioner does not specify what action or discussion was undertaken
that did not appear on the agenda. 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the first ground is sustained, with leave to
amend. 
 
Fifth Ground (Failure to Prepare an EIR)
 
“CEQA generally provides that, before a public agency carries out or
approves any discretionary project—i.e., any activity that requires the
exercise of agency judgment or deliberation and foreseeably may cause physical
damage to the environment—the agency must first assess the project’s potential
environmental effects. ([Pub. Resources Code] §§ 21065, 21080, subd. (a),
21100, 21151; CEQA Guidelines, § 15357.)” (Stockton Citizens for Sensible
Planning v. City of Stockton (2010) 48 Cal.4th 481, 498 (“Stockton”).)
 
“If, after initial study, the agency determines that the project will
have no significant environmental effect, the agency may file a ‘negative
declaration’ reciting this determination, and further compliance with CEQA is
then excused. [Citations.]” (Stockton, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p.
498.)
 
 “Otherwise, the agency must
prepare or obtain, and consider, an EIR that assesses the potential
environmental impacts of the project as proposed, sets forth any feasible, less
harmful alternatives to the project, and identifies any feasible mitigation measures.
[Citations.] The agency may not thereafter approve the project as proposed if
there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures that would avoid or
substantially lessen the adverse environmental effects.” (Stockton, supra,
48 Cal.4th at p. 498.)
 
“However, CEQA expressly exempts certain projects from its reach.” (Stockton,
supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 498.)
 
“If a local agency determines that a project is exempt under section
21080, subdivision (b), ‘and the ... agency approves or determines to carry out
the project,’ the agency ‘may file [[a notice of exemption (“NOE”)] with the
county clerk of each county in which the project will be located.’ [Citation.]”
(Stockton, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 498.) 
 
“The NOE, which is not to be filed until after the project has been
approved, should include a brief description of the project; its location; a
finding that the project is exempt from CEQA, citing the appropriate statute or
Guidelines section; and a brief statement of reasons to support the finding of
exemption. Copies of the NOE, once filed, must be available for public
inspection. The notice must be posted within 24 hours of receipt by the county
clerk’s office and must remain posted for 30 days, after which the county clerk
must return it to the agency.” (Stockton, supra, 48 Cal.4th at
pp. 498-499.)
 
“‘An action or proceeding alleging that a public agency has improperly
determined that a project is not subject to this division [i.e., is exempt from
CEQA] pursuant to [section 21080, subdivision (b) ] ... shall be commenced
within 35 days from the date of the filing ... of the [NOE] authorized by ...
[section 21152(b) ].’ [Citations.]” (Stockton, supra, 48 Cal.4th at
p. 499 [italics removed].) “Among
the purposes of statutes of limitations are to prevent stale claims, give
stability to transactions, protect settled expectations, promote diligence,
encourage the prompt enforcement of substantive law, and reduce the volume of
litigation.” (Ibid.)
 
Here, the City demurs to the fifth ground, arguing that (1) the City
determined that the adoption of the ordinance was not a project subject to CEQA
and was also exempt from CEQA, (2) the City filed its NOE on September 14,
2023, (3) therefore, Petitioner was required to file her CEQA claim (i.e., the
fifth ground) within 35 days of the City’s filing of its NOE (i.e., by October
19, 2023), (4) Petitioner filed the lawsuit on December 11, 2023, and (5) consequently,
Petitioner’s CEQA claim is barred by the 35-day statute of limitations.
(Demurer, pp. 17:9-18:17.)
 
“Judicial notice may be taken of ‘the fact of a document’s recordation,
the date the document was recorded and executed, the parties to the transaction
reflected in a recorded document, and the document’s legally operative
language, assuming there is no genuine dispute regarding the document’s
authenticity. From this, the court may deduce and rely upon the legal effect of
the recorded document, when that effect is clear from its face.” (Linda
Vista Village San Diego Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Tecolote Investors, LLC
(2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 166, 184.)
 
Here, the Court has taken judicial notice of the NOE and notes that it
has a stamp stating it was filed on September 14, 2023. Petitioner has not
disputed the NOE’s authenticity or its contents. In fact, Petitioner does not
address this 35-day statute of limitation issue at all in her opposition filed
May 2, 2024. 
 
According to the legal effect of the NOE, Petitioner’s CEQA claim (i.e.,
the fifth ground) is barred by the 35-day statute of limitations because
Petitioner had 35 days from September 14, 2023, to file the claim but filed the
claim on December 11, 2023. 
 
Accordingly, the Court finds it proper to sustain the demurrer to the
fifth ground. In addition, since the Petitioner has not shown there is a
reasonable possibility that the 35-day statute of limitations defect can be
cured by an amendment, leave to amend is denied. 
 
The demurrer to the fifth ground is sustained, without leave to amend. 
 
The First Through Thirteenth Grounds 
 
The City also demurs the first through the thirteenth grounds in the
Petition, arguing that they fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action for the following reasons. 
 
Government Code section 65009, subdivision (c)(1)(B) (“Section
65009(c)(1)(B)”) states (among other things) that no action shall be maintained
to attack or void the decision of a legislative body to adopt a zoning
ordinance unless that action is commenced and service made on the legislative
body within 90 days after the legislative body’s decision. 
 
In Travis v. County of Santa Cruz (2004) 33 Cal.4th 757 (“Travis”),
the California Supreme Court noted that, “[i]n a facial challenge to a zoning
ordinance based on preexisting statutes or the Constitution, plaintiffs are
limited . . . to 90 days from the ordinance’s adoption.” (Id. at p. 774,
citing Gov. Code, § 65009, subd. (c)(1)(B); see also Id. at p. 767
[explaining that a legal challenge to an ordinance “is properly characterized
as facial … [if] it ‘considers only the text of the measure itself, not its
application to the particular circumstances of an individual.’ [Citation]”].) 
 
Here, Section 65009(c)(1)(B) applies to Petitioner’s remaining 12 grounds
because Ordinance 1854 is a zoning ordinance and each ground asserts only a
facial challenge to the ordinance. 
 
The City adopted Ordinance 1854 on September 12, 2023, and, therefore,
Petitioner had 90 days from the date of that adoption to bring the 13 grounds
but did not. 
 
Accordingly, the City concludes, the 90-day statute of limitations bars
all 13 grounds. 
 
However, the Court has disposed of the fifth ground above. 
 
As to the remaining 12 grounds, the Court finds it cannot conclude at
this time whether the 90-day statute of limitations bars those grounds. 
 
Indeed, the remaining grounds (with the exception of the second, third, fourth,
ninth, eleventh, and twelfth grounds) are uncertain as Petitioner’s allegations
in those grounds are not clear. The uncertainty of the first ground has been
discussed above. The fifth ground does not state what the City did wrong. The
sixth ground does not allege or explain how the City discriminated against
interstate commerce. The seventh ground does not explain how the ordinance
discriminates against the out of state residents. The eighth ground is
completely unintelligible. The tenth and thirteenth grounds are also unintelligible.
Given those uncertainties, the Court cannot find at this time that the 90-day
statute of limitations bars those claims. 
 
As for the second, third, fourth, ninth, eleventh, and twelfth grounds,
the Court finds that the 90-day statute of limitation applies to those claims. 
 
Granted, those grounds can arguably be considered “preemption” claims. 
 
In Travis, the California Supreme Court explained that the 90-day statute
of limitations did not apply to the preemption claim in that case. (See Travis,
supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 772 [“We agree with plaintiffs that their
challenge to the Ordinance, to the extent it is based on preemption by later
enacted state statutes (i.e., the Costa–Hawkins Act and Civil Code section
51.2), is subject to the three-year limit of Code of Civil Procedure section
338 rather than the 90–day limit of Government Code section 65009”].) 
 
However, as noted in one Court of Appeal case, a claim alleging
preemption of an ordinance would only be outside the perimeter of the 90-day
statute of limitations if the ordinance predated the preempting statute. (Cf. Coastal
Act Protectors v. City of Los Angeles (2022) 75 Cal.App.5th 526, 532–533
[distinguishing that case from Travis as follows: “The Coastal Act,
including its [coastal development permit (CDP)] requirements, predates the
Ordinance. Thus, even assuming the City had a mandatory duty to obtain a CDP
for application of the Ordinance to residences in the Venice coastal zone, as [Coastal
Act Protectors (CAP)] contends, that duty existed at the time the City enacted
the Ordinance. CAP’s petition, therefore, is an action to ‘attack, review, set
aside, void, or annul’ the City’s decision to adopt a zoning ordinance
applicable to the Venice coastal zone without first obtaining a CDP. (See [Gov.
Code] section 65009(c)(1)(B))”].)  
 
Here, the second and third grounds are based on the California
Constitution, the fourth ground alleges conflict with state laws, the ninth
ground alleges conflict with the California Constitution, the eleventh ground
alleges conflict with state law, and the twelfth ground alleges preemption of
the ordinance. 
 
In each of those grounds, the Petitioner does not, and cannot, allege
that constitutional or state law at issue was enacted after the ordinance. 
 
Accordingly, the Court finds that the 90-day statute of limitations
applies and bars the second, third, fourth, ninth, eleventh, and twelfth
grounds because (1) those claims seek to attack or void Ordinance 1854 and (2)
they were filed 90 days after the City adopted the ordinance on September 12,
2023. 
 
For those reasons, the demurrer to the second, third, fourth, ninth,
eleventh, and twelfth grounds is SUSTAINED, with leave to amend.   
 
Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Tenth, and Thirteenth Grounds
For the reasons discussed above, finding uncertainty in the sixth,
seventh, eighth, tenth, and thirteenth grounds, the demurrer to those claims is
sustained, with leave to amend.
D. CONCLUSION
 
            The demurrer is SUSTAINED as follows.
 
The demurrer to the fifth ground is SUSTAINED without leave to
amend. 
 
The demurrer to the other grounds is SUSTAINED with leave to
amend. Petitioner is ordered to file and serve her first amended petition
within 30 days of this ruling. Responsive pleadings are due 30 days from
service of those pleadings. 
 
IV.       MOTION TO
STRIKE PORTIONS OF PETITION 
 
In its motion to strike, the City “moves to strike the Real Parties in
Interest and related allegations in Plaintiff Mariya Wrightsman’s Complaint in
the above-captioned matter.” (Notice of Motion and Motion to Strike, p.
1:21-24.)
 
The motion to strike is moot given the Court’s ruling above, sustaining
the demurrer with leave to amend. Since the motion to strike is moot, the Court
need not address the Objection to Motion to Strike that nonparties Vera
Povetina and Yegor Kochetov filed on March 26, 2024, or the arguments in the
Notice of Real Party in Interest that nonparty Celina Mendez filed on April 9,
2024. 
 
V.        MOTION TO
DISMISS THE FIFTH “GROUND” WITH PREJUDICE 
 
The motion to dismiss the fifth ground with prejudice is granted because
the Court has sustained the demurrer to that ground without leave to amend.
(See Metabyte, Inc. v. Technicolor S.A. (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 265, 275
[“a dismissal without prejudice is not available if the demurrer is sustained
without leave to amend …”].) 
 
            The City’s motion to dismiss the fifth ground with
prejudice is GRANTED.
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
