 Case Number:  23SMCV01895    Hearing Date:   February 6, 2024    Dept:  I The court will not grant an ex parte application to
continue a hearing to coincide with a motion that has not yet been filed.
Were the motion for relief from waiver timely filed, the
court might consider continuing the motion to compel assuming the following:
(1) all documents to be produced in response to the RFP is produced at the same
time as the motion is made save for those that would be subject to the proposed
objections; (2) a privilege log is produced at the same time as the motion is
made that establishes a prima facie showing for any claim of privilege;
and (3) Strom has carefully considered the objections actually raised and is
confident as to their merit, even in light of the reply, such that there is no
boilerplate and that the responses clearly state what, if any, information is
being withheld based on each objection (meaning that the stock phrase “Without
waiving and subject to the foregoing objections, responding party states” will
not be used).
