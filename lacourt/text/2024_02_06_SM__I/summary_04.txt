And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Solis Design Studio. The ruling sustains the demurrer as to the breach of contract causes of action brought by the plaintiff against Solis individually, but only with leave to amend. The judge finds that the allegations of alter ego, which would allow the court to pierce the corporate veil and hold Solis personally liable, are insufficient at this time. However, the judge overrules the demurrer as to the contract actions brought against Solis Design Studio, finding that the elements of those causes of action are adequately pled.

The judge also sustains the demurrer as to the negligence per se cause of action, finding that negligence per se is not a separate cause of action and is merely an element of the cause of action. The judge finds that the other tort claims, including those for disgorgement and concealment, are sufficiently pled and survive the demurrer.

The judge grants the plaintiff 30 days to amend the breach of contract cause of action. The judge also denies the defendant's motion to strike the complaint and allows the plaintiff to seek punitive damages.

Overall, the ruling allows the plaintiff to move forward with most of its claims, but requires the plaintiff to provide additional facts to support its allegations of alter ego and breach of contract.
