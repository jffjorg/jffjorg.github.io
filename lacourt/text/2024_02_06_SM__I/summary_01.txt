And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the court will delay the auction and instead allow the parties to continue negotiating a contract between the plaintiff and the investment group. The Judge believes that if the negotiations are successful, the private sale can go forward and the auction can be cancelled. However, if the negotiations fail, the court will allow the auction to proceed. The Judge is skeptical of the investment group's ability to complete the purchase and is concerned that the plaintiff is being unreasonable in its demands. The Judge is ordering a new hearing for October to review the status of the case and will likely allow the parties to continue negotiating unless the private sale is not completed.
