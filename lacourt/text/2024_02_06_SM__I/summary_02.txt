And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a future court hearing. The judge has decided not to grant an ex parte application to continue a hearing to coincide with a motion that has not yet been filed. However, if the motion for relief from waiver is timely filed, the court may consider continuing the motion to compel under certain conditions. These conditions include producing all documents in response to the request for production (RFP) at the same time as the motion is made, except for those subject to proposed objections. The court also requires a privilege log to be produced at the same time, which must establish a prima facie showing for any claim of privilege. Additionally, the party seeking relief (Strom) must demonstrate that they have carefully considered the objections raised and are confident in their merit, even in light of any reply. The judge also notes that boilerplate responses will not be accepted and that the responses must clearly state what information is being withheld based on each objection.
