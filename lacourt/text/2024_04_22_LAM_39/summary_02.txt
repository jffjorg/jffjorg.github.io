And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application to deny the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant filed the motion on March 25, 2024, and the plaintiff argued that it was filed in violation of a court order. However, the court's order concerning discovery and motions deadlines did not prohibit the filing of a motion for summary judgment. The court's order stated that it would hear dispositive motions at the case management conference, and the court is required to hear timely motions for summary judgment. The plaintiff's application is denied, and the plaintiff's counsel must provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
