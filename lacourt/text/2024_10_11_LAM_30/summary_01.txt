And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to quash the deposition subpoena served on Plaintiff's counsel, Eve Brackmann, and has issued a protective order prohibiting Defendant from seeking further discovery from Counsel in this case. The judge's decision is based on the Spectra-Physics test, which sets a high standard for deposing opposing counsel. Defendant has failed to meet the three-prong test required for a deposition of opposing counsel, including showing that no other means exist to obtain the information, that the information sought is relevant and not privileged, and that the information is crucial to the preparation of the case. The judge has determined that the information sought by Defendant is primarily privileged and that Defendant has not shown that it is crucial to their case.
