And here is the text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant Daelin, Inc.'s demurrer to the first amended complaint is overruled. The judge found that Plaintiff Brian Whitaker's allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action under the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the California Disabled Persons Act. The judge agreed with Plaintiff that Defendant failed to comply with ADA standards, including inadequate toe clearance and other violations, which prevented Plaintiff from eating or drinking at the table without difficulty. The judge also found that Plaintiff's allegations were not conclusory and that he had sufficiently alleged a violation of the CDPA by violating the ADA. The judge therefore overruled Defendant's demurrer to both the first and second causes of action.
