And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Blair Lorien Waters' motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Aleksey Martynenko. The motion was filed after Defendant's counsel attempted to schedule a deposition with Plaintiff's counsel and received no response. The judge found that Plaintiff failed to provide any formal objection to the original deposition notice and failed to provide alternative dates or proceed with attempts to schedule the deposition. The judge also granted Defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $360 against Plaintiff and his counsel, representing 1.5 hours of attorney time and the filing fee. Defendant is ordered to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
