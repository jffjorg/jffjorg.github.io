TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


September
  18, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


20STCV35050




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Order Vacating and Setting Aside Default 




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Fermin Antonio Mazariego Jr. 




OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff
  Michael Greenwood 



 
BACKGROUND
 
On September 14, 2020,
Plaintiff Michael Greenwood (“Plaintiff”) a filed complaint. On March 15, 2022,
Plaintiff filed the operative first amended complaint (FAC) asserting causes of
action for assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress,
negligence, and negligent hiring and supervision. Plaintiff alleges he was
performing his duties as a security guard at a cargo facility at 18055 Harmon
Ave. Carson, California, when he was physically assaulted by Defendant Fermin
Antonio Mazariego Jr. (“Defendant”) (FAC ¶ 7, 10-11.)
 
The proof of service filed February
8, 2021, shows that Defendant was personally served the complaint and summons
on January 30, 2021.
 
On August 19, 2021, default was entered against Defendant. 
 
On July 24, 2024, the Court denied Defendant’s motion to set aside the
default based on Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) and 473.5. The Court
also noted that Defendant failed to discuss or set forth the requirements for
equitable relief, such as whether he has a meritorious defense or acted
diligently to set aside the default. (Min. Order, 7/24/24.) 
 
On August 9, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion, again seeking
to set aside the default, based on equitable relief. Plaintiff opposes. No
reply has been filed.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“After six months from default, a
trial court may still vacate a default on equitable ground even if statutory
relief is unavailable.”¿ (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975,
981.)¿ A party may obtain equitable relief from
an entry of dismissal based on an extrinsic mistake when the moving party: (1)
has a meritorious case, (2) articulates a satisfactory excuse for not
presenting a defense to the original action, and (3) demonstrates diligence in
seeking to set aside the dismissal once discovered.¿ (Id. at p. 982.)¿ 
 
An extrinsic
mistake is broadly defined “. . . to encompass almost any set of extrinsic
circumstances which deprive a party of a fair adversary hearing. It does not
seem to matter if the particular circumstances qualify as fraudulent or
mistaken in the strict sense.”¿(In re Marriage of Park (1980) 27 Cal.3d
337, 342.) An ‘extrinsic’ mistake means a mistake that deprived a party of the
opportunity to present a claim or defense while an ‘intrinsic’ mistake is one
that goes to the merits of a proceeding.¿ (In re Marriage of Stevenot (1984) 154
Cal.App.3d 1051, 1064-1065.)¿ 
 
A default cannot
be set aside when the complaining party’s negligence contributed to the rise to
the fraud or mistake.¿(See Kulchar v. Kulchar (1969) 1 Cal.3d 467,
473-474 [complaining party’s failure to investigate and assemble evidence at
trial as grounds for denying equitable relief sought].)¿An extrinsic mistake
may result from a disability when the disability renders the party incompetent or
incapacitated such that it deprives the party from asserting a claim or
defense. (See id. at pp. 471-472.)  
 
DISCUSSION
 
            As an
initial matter, neither party discusses the propriety of seeking to set aside
the default a second time, given that the July 24, 2024 motion was denied.[1]
Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 limits a party’s ability to file
repetitive motions. (Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1104.)
“This section specifies the court's jurisdiction with regard to applications
for reconsideration of its orders and renewals of previous motions, and applies
to all applications to reconsider any order of a judge or court, or for the
renewal of a previous motion, whether the order deciding the previous matter or
motion is interim or final. No application to reconsider any order or for the
renewal of a previous motion may be considered by any judge or court unless
made according to this section.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1008(e).) The burden under
Section 1008 for a motion to renew “is comparable to that of a party seeking a
new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence: the information must be
such that the moving party could not, with reasonable diligence, have
discovered or produced it at the trial.” (New York Times Co. v. Superior
Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-13; Even Zohar Construction &
Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, 833
[finding that Section 1008 imposes the special requirement of having to not
only show new or different facts, circumstances, or law, but also to “show
diligence with a satisfactory explanation for not presenting the new or different
information earlier…”].)
 
Nevertheless, even if the motion is
proper, Defendant has not shown sufficient grounds for equitable relief. 
 
Here, Defendant was served with the
summons and complaint on January 30, 2021. Default was entered on August 19,
2021. Defendant again asserts that given his lack of understanding of the
differences between civil and criminal law, he believed the summons was related
to his obligation to pay restitution in his criminal case regarding the same
underlying incident. However, while Defendant states he acted diligently, he
fails to state exactly when he discovered that the summons was related to the
civil case. Therefore, the Court cannot determine if Defendant acted diligently
since no facts sufficiently describe how he came to that realization.[2] 
 
Additionally, although Defendant
argues he failed to respond to the complaint due to a legal misunderstanding, he
fails to show this was justified given that the summons contained instructions
on how to respond. (See Stiles v. Wallis (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 1143,
1149 [“Although the respondent may have actually believed that he was correctly
defending his interests, we can not agree that such a belief was justified. The
instructions on the face of the summons sets forth the following: ‘A civil
complaint has been filed by the plaintiff against you. If you wish to defend
this lawsuit, you must, within 30 days after this summons is served on you,
file with this court a written response to the complaint.’ The notice was
calculated to inform anyone capable of reading English (or Spanish, since the
same instruction is set forth in that language) of the necessity of filing an
answer with the court.”].) Here, Defendant asserts that the “criminal case was
ongoing through the end of 2020.” (Mazariego Decl. ¶ 4.) He then was served on
January 30, 2021, and asserts that he was “ordered to pay restitution in [his]
criminal case which further confused [him] as to how [he] could be sued civilly
since [he] was already paying the plaintiff through restitution.” (Id. ¶
5, 7.) Yet, Defendant took no action on the civil case. Moreover, as Plaintiff
notes, Defendant was served with a request for entry of default entered on
August 19, 2021. Defendant does not reply to the opposition and has not
established grounds for relief.
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court DENIES Defendant’s Motion for Order Vacating
and Setting Aside Default. 
 
Defendant to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
