And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's motion to withdraw and/or amend the deemed admitted admissions. The Court has denied the motion, finding that the Plaintiff's counsel's failure to provide discovery was not excusable neglect. The Court has determined that the Plaintiff's counsel's claims of being engaged in multiple trials and having his office burglarized do not constitute excusable neglect under the reasonable person standard. The Court has also found that the Plaintiff's counsel's failure to provide discovery due to obligations in other cases was not excusable. Therefore, the Plaintiff's motion to withdraw and/or amend the deemed admitted admissions is denied.
