Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Fermin Antonio Mazariego Jr.'s motion to set aside default in a civil lawsuit filed by Plaintiff Michael Greenwood. The lawsuit alleges that Defendant physically assaulted Plaintiff while Plaintiff was working as a security guard at a cargo facility. Defendant was served with the complaint and summons in January 2021, but failed to respond and default was entered against him in August 2021. Defendant's motion to set aside default is denied because he has not shown sufficient grounds for equitable relief and failed to demonstrate diligence in seeking to set aside the default. The judge notes that Defendant's legal misunderstanding is not justified given the instructions on the summons and that Defendant took no action on the civil case despite being served with a request for entry of default.
