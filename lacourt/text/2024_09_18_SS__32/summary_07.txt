And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case between Kleinman, the plaintiff, and the City, the defendant. The City is seeking summary judgment, which would end the case without a trial. However, the judge is not granting the City's motion because it has failed to meet its burden of proof.

The judge notes that the City's expert witness, Maue, provided an opinion that the property is "private property," but this opinion is not admissible because it is not based on Maue's personal perception and is not helpful to understanding the testimony.

The judge also finds that the City's argument that Kleinman did not provide sufficient evidence to show how long the alleged condition existed is misplaced, as the City has the initial burden in this motion.

Finally, the judge notes that the City's argument that it did not have prior notice of the condition is not supported by the evidence, as the City's own records show that its workers had been in the area and did not notice the condition.
