And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Plaintiff's Counsel, Neil J. Berry, Esq., to be relieved as counsel for the Plaintiff, Moses Eduardo Garcia. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in attorney-client communication. Since no opposition has been filed, the judge has conditionally denied the motion. The judge has noted that the Plaintiff was personally served at a different address than what is indicated as his last known address, and Counsel must explain the reason for this discrepancy at the hearing. The judge has ordered Counsel to give notice and file a proof of service of the motion.
