And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant's motions to deem admitted Requests for Admissions, Set One, and to compel Plaintiff's responses to discovery requests. The motions are denied as procedurally defective due to the lack of notice served on Plaintiff at the correct address. The Court finds that Defendant failed to serve written notice of the motions, including the date, time, and location of the hearing, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1005. As a result, the motions are denied without prejudice. Defendant is ordered to provide notice of the Court's order and file a proof of service of such.
