[1] In
reply, City argues that Kleinman has no standing to oppose this motion.
However, the Court declines to reach this issue since City has failed to meet
its burden for the reasons stated herein. 


[2] A
layperson's opinion testimony is admissible only if it is “(a) Rationally based
on the perception of the witness; and (b) Helpful to a clear understanding of
his testimony.” (Evid. Code, § 800; Osborne v. Todd Farm Service (2016)
247 Cal.App.4th 43, 52.) Defendant argues in reply that Maue, the City
Engineer, was testifying in his capacity of the City’s person most qualified.
(Reply at p. 4.) However, he provided no basis for his conclusory opinion that the
property is “private property,” and his only opinion appears to be what the
City “considers” about the driveway apron.


[3] In
Reply, City argues that “Plaintiff supplied no admissible evidence to show how
long the alleged condition, other than speculation that the ‘subject curb was
already damaged’, let alone a sufficient amount of time.” (Reply at p. 10.)
However, City bears the initial burden in this motion for summary judgment. 


[4] City argues
that Heskel “found no constructive notice because there was a reasonable
system where San Diego’s complaint based sidewalk inspection program consisted
of City maintained records of citizen complaints and police reports related to
walkway conditions, neither of which showed any prior notice.” (Reply at pp.
8-9.) However, in Heskel, the City also provided declarations which
“showed that City workers had been in the area and did not see the condition
within at least the one-year period leading up to Heskel’s accident, and this
creates a reasonable inference that the condition was not obvious.” (Heskel,
supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at 318.) Here, City only presents facts that City
“received no reports or complaints” and that a database “with respect to claims
and lawsuits” is maintained. (UMF 11-12.)
