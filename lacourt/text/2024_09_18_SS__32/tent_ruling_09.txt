TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


September
  18, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


22STCV32266




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Withdraw and/or Amend Admissions




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Larry Finley




OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendant
  City of Carson 



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On
January 3, 2024, the Court granted Defendant City of Carson’s (“Defendant”)
motion to deem admitted Request for Admissions against Plaintiff Larry Finley
(“Plaintiff”). The Court also awarded monetary sanctions against Plaintiff’s
counsel of record for $337.50. The monetary sanctions were due within 30 days
to counsel for Defendant. 
 
On
July 17, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion to set aside the deemed
admissions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 473(b) and 2033.280. (Min.
Order, 7/17/24.)  
 
Plaintiff
now moves to withdraw and/or amend the deem admitted admissions under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.300. Defendant opposes. No reply has been filed.[1]
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.300(a) states, “A party may withdraw or amend an
admission made in response to a request for admission only on leave of court
granted after notice to all parties.” Section 2033.300(b) states, “The court
may permit withdrawal or amendment of an admission only if it determines that
the admission was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect,
and that the party who obtained the admission will not be substantially
prejudiced in maintaining that party’s action or defense on the merits.” The
“mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect” under section 2033.300 has
similar meanings as those words used in Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b).
(New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403,
1419.)¿¿Under section 473(b), the error must be “excusable” which means whether a
reasonably prudent person under the same or similar circumstances might have
made the same error. (Solv-All v. Superior Court¿(2005) 131
Cal.App.4th 1003, 1007.)  “‘Conduct falling
below the professional standard of care, such as failure to timely object or to
properly advance an argument, is not therefore excusable. To hold otherwise
would be to eliminate the express statutory requirement of excusability and
effectively eviscerate the concept of attorney malpractice.’” (Zamora v.
Clayborn Contracting Group, Inc. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 249, 258 [finding
excusable mistake where counsel provided a settlement offer for judgment
“against” his client, as opposed to “in favor of”, since this was a clerical
mistake].)  
¿ 
“Because the law
strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits, any doubts in applying
section 2033.300 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief.
Accordingly, the court's discretion to deny a motion under the statute is
limited to circumstances where it is clear that the mistake, inadvertence,
or¿neglect was inexcusable, or where it is clear that the withdrawal or
amendment would substantially prejudice the party who obtained the admission in
maintaining that party's action or defense on the merits.” (New Albertsons,
Inc. v. Superior Court¿(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1420–21.)¿ 
 
If the court grants a motion to withdraw an admission, it
may impose conditions that are just, including, but not limited to, “(1) An
order that the party who obtained the admission be permitted to pursue
additional discovery related to the matter involved in the withdrawn or amended
admission. (2) An order that the costs of any additional discovery be borne in
whole or in part by the party withdrawing or amending the admission.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2033.300 (c).)  
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff first appears to argue that Defendant’s motion to deem
admitted was gamesmanship since the same information was already provided in
Plaintiff’s responses to Special Interrogatories. (Motion, 3-4.) However,
Plaintiff provides no authority to support that Defendant was not also entitled
to propound Request for Admissions. Additionally, Plaintiff’s allegation is
speculative. 
 
Here, the
discovery was propounded on May 25, 2023. After several extensions, Plaintiff
provided verified responses on January 19, 2024, after the January 3, 2024
hearing. 
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel, Ronald J. Higgins, declares that when the discovery was due in June
2023, his office was burglarized and Plaintiff’s responses were destroyed.
(Higgins Decl. ¶ 4.) Additionally, he states he contracted COVID-19 and was
engaged in multiple murder trials. (Id. ¶ 5.) Counsel declares that from
November 28, 2023 to December 12, 2023, he was engaged in a murder trial, then
prepared for a preliminary hearing for another felony matter on December 28,
2023. (Id. ¶ 6.) During this time, he also was preparing for another
murder trial that began on April 8, 2024 and concluded April 19, 2024. Counsel
generally argues that due to obligations in other cases, he inadvertently overlooked
providing responses to the Request for Admissions. (Id. ¶ 7.) 
 
In
opposition, Defendant asserts that it granted multiple extensions for Plaintiff
and that by September 1, 2023, Plaintiff provided responses to Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production. (Imeri-Garcia
Decl. ¶ 13.) Defendants counsel informed Plaintiff of the missing Request for
Admissions. However, Plaintiff’s counsel informed them he was engaged in trial
and could not provide responses. (Id. ¶ 14.) 
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel’s declaration provides no evidence he was engaged in a trial on
September 1, 2024, and fails to show how he could not have provided responses
after he already provided responses to the remaining discovery. Additionally,
Plaintiff fails to show how the failure to provide discovery due to obligations
in other cases was “excusable”. (See Ambrose v. Michelin North America, Inc.
(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1354-55 [“Ambrose points to the ‘stresses of a
busy law practice,’ the ‘hurry to meet the deadline,’ and ‘several concurrent
obligations due to other pending litigation.’ Again, as in Garcia [v.
Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674], . . . the trial court here correctly
concluded that this does not constitute excusable neglect under the reasonable
person standard.”].) 
 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff’s
motion to Withdraw and/or Amend Admissions is DENIED.   
 
Plaintiff shall give notice of the Court’s
order and file a proof of service of such.
