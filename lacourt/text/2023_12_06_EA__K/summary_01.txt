And here is the summary in English text:

The Tentative Ruling denies the City of El Monte's Application for Default Judgment without prejudice. The ruling points out several defects in the application, including the fact that the proposed judgment seeks a different amount than the amount demanded in the complaint. The court also requests additional information from the City, including a copy of a specific municipal code chapter and an itemization of certain costs. The ruling notes that the City's prayer for punitive damages is unclear and requests further clarification.
