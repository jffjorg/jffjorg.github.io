And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion to continue and a demurrer filed by the parties. The motion to continue is denied because the plaintiff has not provided proof of service to the other parties and has not specified which hearing or proceeding they seek to delay. The judge notes that there is no trial date currently set in the case.

The demurrer filed by the defendant is sustained, meaning that the complaint is dismissed. The judge finds that the plaintiff's complaint is incomprehensible and that the plaintiff has had over a year to seek counsel and gather evidence, but has not done so. The judge notes that the plaintiff's pleadings have never improved and that there is no probability that the plaintiff will be able to amend to state a proper claim. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for a continuance and rejects the plaintiff's extraordinary writ and motion for continuance.
