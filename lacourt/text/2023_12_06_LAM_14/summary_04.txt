And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to stay the case and compel arbitration. The judge finds that the arbitration agreement signed by the parties provides for binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act and California Arbitration Act. The judge also finds that the parties have conceded that an arbitration agreement was indeed reached, and therefore, the issue of unconscionability should be decided by the arbitrator. The judge notes that the agreement is procedurally unconscionable as a matter of law, but the adhesive nature of the contract does not weigh strongly on the procedural side of the scale. The judge also finds that the agreement is not substantively unconscionable, as Plaintiff has not supplied sufficient evidence or argument to support that defense. As a result, the judge grants the motion and stays the case pending the outcome in arbitration.
