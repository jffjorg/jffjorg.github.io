And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to continue the hearing, as there is no proof of service indicating that the other parties have been notified of the motion. The plaintiff has also failed to specify which hearing or proceeding they seek to delay. The judge has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint, stating that the complaint is incomprehensible and the plaintiff has had ample time to seek counsel and gather evidence. The court has denied the plaintiff's request for a continuance and has refused to grant leave to amend the complaint, as it does not believe the plaintiff will be able to state a proper claim at this point.
