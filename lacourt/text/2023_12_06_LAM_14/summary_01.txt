And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to tax the request for attorney's fees included in the Memorandum of Costs. The Judge finds that the request was not properly made, as the defendant did not provide supporting documentation to establish the amount of their fees. The Judge also notes that even if the procedure adopted by the defendant had been proper, the burden would have been on the defendant to support their fee request. The Judge cites relevant statutes, including Code of Civil Procedure § 1033.5, and case law, including Active Properties, LLC v. Cabrera (2016) and Khavarian Enterprises, Inc. v. Commline, Inc. (2013). The Judge concludes that the motion is granted, without prejudice to a formal motion for attorney's fees.
