On September 6, 2024, plaintiff Hrayr
Brian Der Vartanian (“Plaintiff”) filed this motion to tax costs listed in defendant
Jaydon Douglas Paull’s (“Defendants”) memorandum of costs. Defendant’s cost
memo was filed on August 29, 2024 and listed $7,211.13 in deposition costs,
$821.50 for service of process, and $3,900 in court reporter fees, for a total
of $11,932.63.  
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5
sets forth the costs recoverable by the prevailing party. To recover a cost, it
must be reasonably necessary to the litigation and reasonable in amount. (Perko’s
Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (l992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.) If
the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is
on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or
necessary. (Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19
Cal.App.4th 761, 773-74.) On the other hand, if the items are properly objected
to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them
as costs. (Id.) A verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence
that the costs, expenses, and services therein listed were necessarily
incurred. (Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256,
266.)¿ A party seeking to tax costs must
provide evidence to rebut this prima facie showing. (Jones v. Dumrichob
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1266.) Mere statements unsupported by facts are
insufficient to rebut the prima facie showing that costs were necessarily
incurred. (Id.)¿
Plaintiff argues that the claimed cost
of $7,211.13 is unreasonable because Defendant only took one deposition which
was not used to support Defendant’s summary judgment motion. The sole
deposition taken was of Plaintiff, and defense counsel, William D. Bowen,
declares that the claimed cost encompasses 2 days of deposition during which
Plaintiff was questioned about any necessary repairs forming the basis for this
unlawful detainer action. (Bowen Decl., ¶ 5.) This testimony was also relevant
because an expert report was obtained to examine those claimed repairs. (Ibid.)
However, the invoices attached to Bowen’s declaration only show that the
deposition costs (without any finance charges) were $4,673.90, and there is no
explanation for why any finance charges were reasonable and necessary to the litigation.
Therefore, the motion to tax the deposition costs is GRANTED in the amount of $2,537.23.
Second, Plaintiff argues that Defendant
should not recover court reporter fees but conflates those fees with the cost
of transcripts not ordered by the court (which are not recoverable). (Motion,
p. 8.) In contrast, court reporter fees are allowable as costs “as established
by statute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (11).) In opposition, Defendant
submits copies of the invoices from court reporters and argues that the costs
incurred were reasonable in amount and reasonably necessary for the different
proceedings. Plaintiff did not file a reply explaining how any of the charges
were unreasonable in amount or unnecessary. The motion to tax court reporter
fees is DENIED. 
Plaintiff argues that $821.50 in
service of process costs are not reasonable because there were no trial
proceedings requiring subpoenas. In opposition, Mr. Bowen declares that this
amount was incurred when serving Plaintiff with Defendant’s written discovery responses
and responsive documents on October 31, 2023. (Bowen Decl., ¶ 4.) Specifically,
Defendant was “invoiced” for $821.50, of which $631.50 was for “printing
charges at 25 cents a page for 2526 pages.” (Bowen Decl., ¶ 4.) However, Code
of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(b)(3) prohibits recovery of photocopying
charges, which are essentially printing charges. Defendant also does not
explain the basis for incurring the remaining $190. Accordingly, the motion to
tax is GRANTED as to the service of process costs in the entire amount of $821.50.
          Plaintiff’s
motion is GRANTED in part and Defendant’s cost memorandum is taxed $3,358.73.
Accordingly, the Court awards Defendant costs in the amount of $8,573.90.
