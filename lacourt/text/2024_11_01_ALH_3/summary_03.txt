Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to tax costs, which was filed in response to the defendant's cost memorandum. The defendant's cost memorandum listed $11,932.63 in costs, including deposition costs, service of process costs, and court reporter fees. The plaintiff argues that the costs are unreasonable and seeks to tax them.

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to tax the deposition costs in the amount of $2,537.23, finding that the deposition was not used to support the defendant's summary judgment motion. The court has also granted the plaintiff's motion to tax the service of process costs in the amount of $821.50, finding that the costs were not reasonable because they were incurred for photocopying charges, which are prohibited under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(b)(3).

However, the court has denied the plaintiff's motion to tax the court reporter fees, finding that they are allowable as costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (11). The court has awarded the defendant costs in the amount of $8,573.90.

The parties who intend to submit on this tentative ruling must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit, and the opposing party may still appear at the hearing to argue the matter.
