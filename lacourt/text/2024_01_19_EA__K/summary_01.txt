And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the complaint is overruled as moot for the first cause of action and sustained without leave to amend for the third and seventh causes of action. The Judge also denies the motion for preliminary injunction. The case involves a dispute over a lease to purchase agreement for a property in Pomona, California, and the ownership of the property. The Plaintiff, Benjamin Kirk, alleges that the Defendant, Lucy Seh, failed to complete the legal paperwork to reflect their agreed-upon split of the equity in the property, and that Lucy and her son, Jonathan Seh, and the Peter Seh Living Trust 2001 are attempting to transfer the property and interfere with its operation. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has filed a verified complaint, and that the Demurrer to the complaint is overruled as moot for the first cause of action, but sustained without leave to amend for the third and seventh causes of action. The Judge also denies the motion for preliminary injunction, citing the lack of evidence supporting the relief requested.
