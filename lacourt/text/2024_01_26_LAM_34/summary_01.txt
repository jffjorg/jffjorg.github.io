Summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants George Santopietro's motion to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) with seven days' notice. The FAC aims to add a new cause of action for violation of Penal Code section 496 and clarify the pleading to remove Lia Vasdekis as a defendant. The judge finds that the motion complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, and that there is no significant risk of prejudice to the opposing parties. The judge also agrees to correct various procedural and substantive items in the proposed pleading, including clarifying the pleading to remove Lia Vasdekis, correcting the name of LA Estate Rentals LLC, and correcting the title, footer, lettering, and name of LA Estate Rentals LLC. The judge concludes that the motion is granted, subject to the changes listed above.
