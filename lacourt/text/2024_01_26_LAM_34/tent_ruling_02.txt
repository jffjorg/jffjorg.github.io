ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Evidentiary Objections
 
A.      Preliminary
Comments
 
        This is a relatively straight-forward Motion for Summary
Adjudication.  Yet the parties filed over
150 evidentiary objections.  “This is
hardly good advocacy, and it unnecessarily overburdens the trial court.” (Nazir
v. United Airlines, Inc. (2009)
178 Cal.App.4th 243, 254, fn. 3.) 
The Court suggests that both counsel re-read Nazir v. United Airlines
and take its admonitions to heart.
 
 
B.      Defendant’s Evidentiary Objections
 
Defendant filed evidentiary objections to
Plaintiff’s evidence. The following are the Court’s rulings on these
objections.

II.      
Request for Judicial Notice
 
A.      Plaintiff’s
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Plaintiff requests that the Court take
judicial notice of various conclusions; these conclusions allegedly stem from various
statutes, ordinances, and regulations. 
 
Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice is
actually asking for the Court to take judicial notice of legal conclusions,
such as when Plaintiff asks the Court to take judicial notice that “[i]t is
required that, in order for [Defendant] to perform truck wash, repair and
service on the Premises [Defendant] must obtain a permit from the City of
Carson Municipal Code §9141.1.” (Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice, ¶ 5.)
These requests are denied; the Court lacks the authority to take judicial
notice of legal conclusions. 
 
The Court DENIES judicial notice to these
items. The underlying sources of law may be cited in the memoranda. 
 
 
B.      Defendant’s
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Defendant requests that the Court take
judicial notice of various statutes, ordinances, and regulations. 
 
The Court GRANTS judicial notice to these
items. 
 
III.     Legal Standard
 
“A party may
move for summary judgment in an action or proceeding if it is contended that
the action has no merit or that there is no defense to the action or
proceeding. The motion may be made at any time after 60 days have elapsed since
the general appearance in the action or proceeding of each party against whom
the motion is directed or at any earlier time after the general appearance that
the court, with or without notice and upon good cause shown, may direct.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (1)(a).)
 
“[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion
that there is no triable issue of fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law. That is because of the general principle that a party who seeks
a court’s action in his favor bears the burden of persuasion thereon. There is
a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would allow a
reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party
opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.” (Aguilar
v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850, citation omitted.) 
 
“[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of
production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable
issue of material fact; if he carries his burden of production, he causes a
shift, and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of
his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of
material fact.” (Aguilar, supra, at p. 850; Smith v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 1463, 1474, [applying the summary judgment standards in Aguilar
to motions for summary adjudication].) 
 
“On a summary judgment motion, the court must therefore consider what
inferences favoring the opposing party a factfinder could reasonably draw from
the evidence. While viewing the evidence in this manner, the court must bear in
mind that its primary function is to identify issues rather than to determine
issues. Only when the inferences are indisputable may the court decide the
issues as a matter of law. If the evidence is in conflict, the factual issues
must be resolved by trial.” (Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 832, 839, citation omitted.) 
 
“The trial court may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a fact
finder to determine whose version is more likely true. Nor may the trial court
grant summary judgment based on the court's evaluation of credibility.” (Binder,
supra, at p. 840, citations omitted; see also Weiss v. People ex rel.
Dep’t of Transp. (2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding motions for
summary judgment or summary adjudication may not weigh the evidence but must
instead view it in the light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all
reasonable inferences in favor of that party”].) 
 
“On a motion for summary adjudication, the trial court has no
discretion to exercise. If a triable issue of material fact exists as to the
challenged causes of action, the motion must be denied. If there is no triable
issue of fact, the motion must be granted.” (Fisherman's Wharf Bay Cruise
Corp. v. Super. Ct. (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 309, 320, citation omitted.) 
 
IV.     
Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves the Court to grant
summary adjudication in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on the first
cause of action for ejectment-termination for breach of lease agreement in
Plaintiff’s Complaint. (Motion, pp. 1:24–28, 2:1–2, 9:17–18, 14:7–8.)
 
Plaintiff argues that summary
adjudication of this cause of action would be appropriate because there are no
disputes on the following issues: (1) that a lease exists between the Parties,
with a lease term that states change of motor oil on the premises is a
reportable use of hazardous substances; (2) that Defendant did not obtain prior
written consent from Plaintiff regarding reportable use of a hazardous
substance; (3) that Defendant did not comply with applicable requirements by
obtaining a permit or registration when engaging in an activity constituting
reportable use of a hazardous substance; and (4) that Defendant’s failure to
cure default under certain lease terms constituted breach and Plaintiff was
entitled to terminate the lease. (Motion, pp. 10:10–12, 11:13–14, 11:22–24,
13:23–24.)
 
Defendant disagrees, arguing: (1) that no
written lease exists between the Parties; (2) that the relief sought by
Plaintiff in its Motion is overbroad; (3) that the notice of default was
fatally flawed because the underlying conditions precedent to them were fatally
flawed; (4) that the motor oil was properly disposed of; (5) that Plaintiff
consented to the situation here; (6) that Defendant is not required to obtain
permits; and (7) that this case is actually about retaliation. (Opposition, pp.
10:13, 12:13, 13:7–8, 16:14, 17:19, 18:20, 21:21.)
 
        In its Reply,
Plaintiffs argues: (1) that Defendant’s argument that there is no lease is
itself meritless; (2) that the Motion and the relief sought in it are not
overbroad; and (3) that the notice of default is not flawed. (Reply, pp. 5:5–6,
6:6, 8:6–7.)
 
        Based upon a review of
the evidence submitted, the Court concludes that there are multiple triable
issues of material fact (including questions of mixed fact and law), such as:
(1) whether there is a lease; (2) whether Defendant engaged in activities that
violated the terms of that lease; (3) whether the presence or absence of
certain conditions made the notice of default void or voidable; (4) whether
Plaintiff consented to the harms it now complains of; and (5) whether Defendant
took actions that required a permit. 
 
Determinations on these issues of fact
are necessary prior to arriving at any legal conclusions on the cause of
action. Further, such determinations are inappropriate on a motion for summary
adjudication. Thus, summary adjudication is inappropriate here. 
 
V.        
Conclusion
 
The Motion for Summary Adjudication is DENIED.
