hearing_date: January 26, 2024
dept: 34
subject: Motion for Summary Adjudication
moving_party: Plaintiff
respondent: Defendant KLF Logistics, Inc.
background:
  - On September 22, 2022, Plaintiff KL Fenix Corporation filed its Complaint against Defendant KLF Logistics, Inc. and Steven Chang.
  - On November 16, 2022, Defendant KLF Logistics filed its Answer to the Complaint.
  - On November 17, 2022, Defendant Steve Chang filed his Answer to the Complaint.

analysis:
  - Evidentiary Objections:

    - Plaintiff's Evidentiary Objections: The Court overruled 56 objections and sustained 5 objections.
  - Request for Judicial Notice:
    - Plaintiff's Request for Judicial Notice: The Court denied the request, as it is asking for judicial notice of legal conclusions.
    - Defendant's Request for Judicial Notice: The Court granted the request.
  - Legal Standard:
    - The party moving for summary adjudication bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
    - The Court must consider what inferences favoring the opposing party a factfinder could reasonably draw from the evidence.
  - Discussion:
    - Plaintiff moves for summary adjudication on the first cause of action for ejectment-termination for breach of lease agreement.
    - Defendant disagrees, arguing that no written lease exists between the parties and that the relief sought by Plaintiff is overbroad.
  - Conclusion:
    - The Court concludes that there are multiple triable issues of material fact, including questions of mixed fact and law.
    - Summary adjudication is inappropriate, and the Motion for Summary Adjudication is DENIED.

The Court has also denied Plaintiff's request for judicial notice of legal conclusions and granted Defendant's request for judicial notice of various statutes, ordinances, and regulations. The Motion for Summary Adjudication is DENIED.
