And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a request for entry of default judgment from the plaintiff, Drew Hunthausen, against the defendant, Marina Pacific Hotel and Suites, LLC. The plaintiff claims that the defendant's website violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act and seeks $16,000 in statutory damages. The court is questioning the credibility of the plaintiff's statement that he attempted to book a room at the hotel's website four times, and believes that the plaintiff is actually a tester for ADA compliance, not a genuine customer. The court finds that imposing penalties for each of the four alleged attempts to access the website would be absurd and therefore imposes a penalty for one violation of the statute. The request for default judgment is granted in part, with a total award of $4,884, consisting of $4,000 in damages, $330 in attorney's fees, and $514 in costs.
