And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the petition filed by Swift Financial, LLC to confirm the arbitration award against Milky Way Catering, Inc. and Karine Malakyan. The petition complies with Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4, and the arbitration award was entered by the American Arbitration Association on March 13, 2023. The award is for the sum of $139,307.15, which represents the unpaid loan balance and loan fees, plus attorney's fees incurred in enforcing the Loan Agreement. The court notes that the prevailing party on a motion to confirm, correct, or vacate an arbitration award is entitled to a mandatory award of costs, but the petitioner does not provide the amounts sought, so the request is denied at this time. The court also rejects the request for prejudgment interest under Civil Code 3289, as the petitioner does not provide the amounts sought.
