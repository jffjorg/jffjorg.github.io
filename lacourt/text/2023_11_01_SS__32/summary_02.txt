And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by the Plaintiffs' counsel, Boris Sargsyan. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship because the Plaintiffs are in prison and are unable to attend further proceedings or respond to communications. However, the judge found that the motion was not properly filed, as counsel failed to provide proof of service of all moving papers and did not list all future hearing dates. The judge also noted that the declarations filed by counsel did not make sense, as they stated that counsel had personal contact with the Plaintiffs, but also stated that the motion was filed to withdraw due to the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The judge ordered counsel to provide notice of the ruling and file proofs of service of such.
