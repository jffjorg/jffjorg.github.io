And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissals of defendants Jose Arreguin, Jorge Arreguin, and Angel Huerta. The plaintiff had filed the complaint on September 21, 2020, but former counsel failed to appear personally at hearings, resulting in default and subsequent dismissals. The plaintiff's current counsel argues that the former counsel was suffering from a medical condition and that the dismissals were due to excusable neglect. However, the court finds that the motion is untimely and that the plaintiff has not demonstrated a meritorious case or a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action. The court also notes that the plaintiff's former counsel did not provide sufficient evidence of his medical condition or attempts to alert the court of his inability to appear personally. Therefore, the court denies the motion to set aside the dismissals.
