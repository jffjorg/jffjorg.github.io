And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel deposition of Maneh and Tina Karapetyan, daughters of Plaintiff Narine Karapetyan. The motion is denied as procedurally defective because Defendant did not serve a deposition subpoena, but rather a notice of deposition. The Court finds that the testimony of Maneh and Tina is relevant because they can describe the actual limitations Plaintiff presented on a day-to-day basis after the incident. However, the Court cannot compel the depositions because the proper procedure was not followed. The hearing on the motion to compel deposition of Tina Frangulyan is advanced to today's date and vacated. Defendant is ordered to give notice and file a proof of service of such.
