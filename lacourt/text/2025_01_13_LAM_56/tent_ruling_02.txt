BACKGROUND
             This action arises from an employment
relationship. On July 31, 2023, Plaintiff Kristine Baldwin (“Plaintiff”) filed
the operative complaint (“Complaint”) against defendant LuxUrban Hotels, Inc. (“Defendant”)
and Does 1 through 20 alleging causes of action for: (1) failure to pay wages
due [Labor Code §§ 204, 210, 510, 558, 1194, 1197, 1197.1]; (2) failure to
reimburse business expenses [Labor code § 2802]; (3) failure to provide rest
and meal periods [Labor code §§226.7, 512]; (4) failure to provide rest day [Labor
Code §§ 551, 552); (5) waiting time penalties [Labor Code §§201-203); (6)
failure to provide accurate itemized wage statements [Labor Code § 226(a)]; (7)
unfair business practices (Business & Professions code §§17200, et seq.); (8)
conversion; and (9) wrongful constructive termination in violation of public
policy. 
 
            On December 12, 2024, Farhoud Novian
and Lindsey Phipps of Novian & Novian LLP filed a motion to be relieved as counsel
for Defendant (the “Motion”). The Motion is unopposed. 
 
DISCUSSION
Code
of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 284 states that “the attorney in an
action…may be changed at any time before or after judgment or final
determination, as follows: (1) upon the consent of both client and attorney…;
(2) upon the order of the court, upon the application of either client or
attorney, after notice from one to the other.”¿ (CCP § 284; California Rules of
Court (“CRC”) 3.1362.)¿ The withdrawal request may be denied if it would cause
an injustice or undue delay in proceeding; but the court's discretion in this
area is one to be exercised reasonably.¿ (Mandell v. Superior (1977) 67
Cal.App.3d 1, 4; Lempert¿v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161,
1173.)¿
 
In
making a motion to be relieved as counsel, the attorney must comply with
procedures set forth in Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.¿ The motion must be
made using mandatory forms:¿ 
¿ 

Notice of Motion and Motion to be
     Relieved as Counsel directed to the client (MC-051);¿ 


Declaration “stating in general terms
     and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client
     relationship” the reasons that the motion was brought (MC-052);¿and 


Proposed Order (MC-053).¿ 

¿ 
The
forms must be timely filed and served on all parties who have appeared in the
case.¿ (CRC rule 3.1362.)¿ If these documents are served on the client by mail,
there must be a declaration stating either that the address where client was
served is “the current residence or business address of the client” or “the
last known residence or business address of the client and the attorney has
been unable to locate a more current address after making reasonable efforts to
do so within 30 days before the filing of the motion to be relieved.”¿ (CRC
rule 3.1362 subd. (d)(1).)¿ 
 
The
court has discretion on whether to allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion
to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  Withdrawal is
generally permitted unless there is a compelling reason to continue the
representation.  (Heple v. Kluge (1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 461,
462.)  
 
Counsel filed a filed a Notice of Motion
and Motion (MC-051), Declaration in Support of Motion (MC-052) and Proposed
Order (MC-053). As reason for the Motion, Counsel states “Due to a breakdown in
attorney-client communications, it has become unreasonably difficult for NOVIAN
& NOVIAN LLP ("NNLLP") and its attorneys to carry out the
representation effectively. NNLLP has exhausted its options for establishing
effective communications with the client and believes that an effective
attorney-client relationship has ceased to exist. NNLLP has lost confidence
that it will have sufficient communications with Client to represent Client in
this matter. So as to protect the attorney-client privilege and additional
privacy protections for the client, NNLLP can only supplement the supporting
declaration with in camera oral representations of counsel in chambers and
wishes to do so.” (MC-052, ¶ 2.) The forms were served on the client and
Plaintiff via e-service and mail on December 12, 2024. (MC-051, MC-052 and
MC-053, Proofs of Service) Counsel confirmed that the address was current by “checking
the California Secretary of State website for current mailing and entity
address of Client.” (MC-052, ¶ 3(b)(1)(d)) Finally, there is no showing that
withdrawal would cause injustice or undue delay in the proceedings as there are
no other hearings currently scheduled in this action and trial is not yet set. Thus,
the Court finds that the Motion sets forth an adequate basis for
withdrawal.  
 
Novian & Novian LLP’s Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel for LuxUrban Hotels, Inc. is GRANTED. Because Defendant is
a corporation, it cannot represent itself in this case.  The Court therefore sets an Order to Show
Cause re Representation for January 30, 2025 at 8:30 am to discuss Defendant’s
retention of counsel.  
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
