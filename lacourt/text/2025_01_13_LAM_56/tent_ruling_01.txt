MOVING
PARTY:  Defendants Hyundai Motor Company
and Hyundai Motor America (“Defendants”) 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiffs
Jose Luis Gonzalez Castillo et al (“Plaintiffs”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
             Plaintiffs filed the instant automobile
accident action on May 13,2021. The currently operative third amended
complaint (the “TAC”) alleges cause of action for: (1) negligence; (2) product
liability; and (3) wrongful death and survival action.  
 
            On October 3, 2024, Defendants filed
the instant motion to strike (the “Motion”). Plaintiffs filed an opposition to
the Motion (the “Opposition”) on December 30, 2024 and Defendants filed a reply
(the “Reply”) on January 6, 2025. 
 
MEET AND CONFER 
            The
parties have satisfied the meet and confer requirement. 
 
DISCUSSION
            The court may, upon a motion, or at
any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civil
Procedure (“CCP”), § 436(a).) The court may also strike all or any part of any
pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court
rule, or an order of the court. (CCP, § 436(b).) The grounds for a motion to
strike are that the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has
not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (CCP, § 436.) A Motion to
Strike is the proper procedure for testing the adequacy of a punitive damages
allegation because punitive damages are not a cause of action.  (Grieves v. Superior Ct. (1984) 157
Cal.App.3d 159, 164.)  
 
To obtain punitive damages in an action
for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, a plaintiff must
demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant is guilty of
oppression, fraud, or malice.  (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).)  The
clear and convincing evidence standard “requires a finding of high probability
. . . ‘so clear as to leave no substantial doubt’; sufficiently strong to
command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.”  (Lackner v. North (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th
1188, 1211.)
 
“Oppression” is defined as “despicable
conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious
disregard of that person’s rights.”  (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(2).) "[D]espicable”
connotes conduct that is ". . . so vile, base, contemptible, miserable,
wretched or loathsome that it would be looked down upon and despised by
ordinary decent people.”  (Lackner,
supra, 135 Cal.App.4th at p. 1210.)  “Malice” is defined as “conduct
which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.”  (Civ. Code, §
3294, subd. (c)(1).)  “Not only must there by circumstances of oppression,
fraud or malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to support such a
claim.”  (Grieves, supra, 157 Cal.App.3d at p. 166.)
 
            A request for punitive damages
against a corporation must allege that an officer, director, or managing agent
of the corporation was either personally responsible for the allegedly
despicable conduct or that an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation:
(1) had advance knowledge of the despicable conduct and consciously disregarded
it; or (2) authorized or ratified the despicable conduct.  (Civ. Code, §
3294, subd. (b).) 
 
            Defendants move to strikes certain
portions of the TAC on grounds that Plaintiffs have not alleged facts entitling
them to recover punitive damages and cannot recover survival damages for pain,
suffering, or disfigurement incurred by the decedent prior to her death. (Mot.
p. 1:9-25.) Specifically, Defendants move to strike paragraphs
83(b), 94, 96, 104, 106, 126, 138, 140, 151, 154, 167, 172 and prayer for
relief number 8
from Plaintiffs’ TAC. Plaintiffs concede that the non-economic damages
sustained by the decedent prior to her death should be stricken from the TAC
(Opp. p. 3:3-4.)
 
Upon review of Plaintiffs punitive damages
allegations, Plaintiffs fail to adequately allege that an officer, director, or
managing agent of the corporation: (1) had advance knowledge of the despicable
conduct and consciously disregarded it; or (2) authorized or ratified the
despicable conduct.  (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (b).)  There are no
facts alleged in the TAC addressing any conduct whatsoever by an officer,
director, or managing agent of Defendants.  
 
In the Opposition, Plaintiffs argue that the
Defendants “have not provided sufficient information in discovery for
Plaintiffs to identify officers, directors, or managing agents who participated
in, authorized, or ratified any malicious, oppressive, or fraudulent conduct by
these entities or their employees.” (Opp. p. 7:23-26) The Court notes, however,
that discovery in this action has been ongoing since 2021. The Plaintiffs have
had ample opportunity to uncover facts that could support a claim for punitive
damages; however, they have failed to uncover any indication of malicious conduct
by a corporate officer entitling them to punitive damages against Defendants. Moreover,
Plaintiffs have not set forth any additional allegations that they could make
that would transform a simple negligence/product liability/wrongful death and
survival action into a case that would potentially give rise to a punitive
damage claim.  Thus, the allegations of
the TAC are insufficient to support the request for punitive damages. 
 
The Motion to Strike is GRANTED, without
leave to amend.  Paragraphs 83(b), 94,
96, 104, 106, 126, 138, 140, 151, 154, 167, 172 and prayer for relief number 8 are
hereby stricken from the TAC. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
