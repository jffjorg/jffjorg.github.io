Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Novian & Novian LLP's motion to be relieved as counsel for LuxUrban Hotels, Inc. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in attorney-client communications, which has made it difficult for the attorneys to effectively represent the client. The attorneys have exhausted their options for establishing effective communications and believe that the attorney-client relationship has ceased to exist. The judge finds that the motion sets forth an adequate basis for withdrawal and grants the motion. The judge sets an Order to Show Cause re Representation for January 30, 2025, to discuss the defendant's retention of new counsel.
