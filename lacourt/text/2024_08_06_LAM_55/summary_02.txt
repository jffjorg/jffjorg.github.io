And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendant's counsel to be relieved as counsel in an employment discrimination case. The court finds that the motion is properly filed and that the declaration of moving counsel shows a cognizable ground for withdrawal, namely a breakdown of the working relationship. Since no opposing document has been filed showing any prejudice to the client, the court grants the motion and will sign an order submitted by counsel. The court will also set an order to show cause (OSC) re striking answer and entering default of the defendant for failure to obtain new counsel at the hearing.
