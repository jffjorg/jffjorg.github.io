Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Felix Antonio Ruiz, filed a lawsuit against the defendants, Pablo Torres, Marcos Torres, Pedro Torres, and Providencia LLC, alleging that he slipped on a wet floor at their restaurant and grocery store, Super Tiendas La Tapachulteca. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's claims are defective and that the plaintiff cannot assert alter ego liability against them because the plaintiff obtained a default judgment against Super Tiendas La Tapachulteca without properly serving a Statement of Damages. The defendants also argued that the plaintiff's fraudulent conveyance claim is past the seven-year statute of repose.

The judge found that the plaintiff's evidence does not support his claims and that the defendants have demonstrated that the plaintiff's complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against them. The judge also found that the plaintiff's fraudulent conveyance claim is barred by the statute of repose and that equitable tolling does not extend the time for filing a fraudulent transfer claim.

The judge granted the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, which means that the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law and that the case will be dismissed.
