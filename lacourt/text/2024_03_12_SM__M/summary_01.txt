And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Cohen v. Frye, et al., regarding a motion for sanctions. The plaintiff, Daniela Cohen, is seeking an order requiring the defendant, Richard Jordan Frye, and his counsel, Natalie Keshishian, to pay $7,611.50 in attorney's fees and costs for scheduling and then refusing to proceed with the deposition of Paul Frye.

The court has found that defendant's counsel failed to produce their own witness and refused to make a record of the issue at the deposition, wasting counsel and the court reporter's time. The court has concluded that a reasonable sanction in this matter would be $1,064.00, inclusive of costs, for fees incurred due to the mis-noticed deposition. The motion is granted, and sanctions are imposed only against defendant's counsel of record, Natalie Keshishian, who must pay the awarded amount within 30 days.
