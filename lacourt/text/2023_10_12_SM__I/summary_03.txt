And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to stay the entire case, including all motions, as the court is unsure whether it has jurisdiction over the case. The case involves a breach of fiduciary duty and a Special Motion to Strike (SMS) that was granted in part. The plaintiffs appealed the SMS, and the defendants cross-appealed. The defendants have served discovery on the plaintiffs, but only relating to one cause of action. The plaintiffs objected to the discovery, citing the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction. The judge believes that a stay makes sense, as the court is unsure whether the discovery is ancillary and whether the appeal will render the proceedings moot. The stay will expire 10 days after the remittitur issues, and the defendants may seek to re-calendar their motions once the stay is lifted.
