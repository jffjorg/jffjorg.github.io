 Case Number:  SC128330    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2024    Dept:  I The court is in receipt of the parties’ recent stipulation
regarding the stay.  The court is
inclined to approve the stipulation, but on condition that the five year
stipulation be extended to June 30, 2026, rather than January 25, 2026.  The court anticipates a trial before January
25, 2026, but in case that is not possible, the court does not want the parties
or the court to be under the gun.  The
court is disinclined to set a firm trial date at this time given the
uncertainty about the criminal matter, but rather will VACATE THE FSC AND TRIAL
DATES and set a TSC for some time in February 2025.  If the criminal trial is indeed moved to the
summer, the parties may, by stipulation and order, seek to continue the TSC to
a later date.  The court notes that if Fritsch
is found guilty and appeals, the court will be disinclined to continue the stay
or the trial through the appellate process. 
In light of the stipulation, the motion is MOOT.
