As for the summary in English text, here is a brief summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Judge believes that the wrongful conduct continued over time and that some of the alleged acts are within the statute of limitations, even with the COVID-extended period. The Judge also rejects the defendant's argument that they owe no duties outside the employment relationship and that the sexual assault was not related to gender. Additionally, the Judge finds that the defendant is liable for unpaid overtime and other labor code violations, regardless of whether they were personally aware of the issues. The Judge will not make a determination on these issues at this stage of the proceedings.
