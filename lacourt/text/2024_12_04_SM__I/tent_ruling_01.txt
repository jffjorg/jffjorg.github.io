  Case Number:  21STCV02566    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2024    Dept:  I The motion for judgment on the pleadings is DENIED.   
 
Preliminarily, the court has considered the motion on its
merits.  While there are limits on the
statutory motion, it is different for common law motion.
 
The major problem is that the wrongful conduct continued
over time.  And at least the most recent
are plainly within the statute of limitations, especially given the COVID
extension.  That is true even of the
Labor Code violations.  While there could
be a bar to some of the Labor Code issues that fall outside the statute of
limitations, that is not an issue that can be addressed by way of this
motion.  And the court does not believe
that the alleged assaults can be barred on statute of limitations even for those
outside the time period so long as plaintiff can prove at least one act within
the statutory period and that the conduct was part of a continuing course of
conduct.
 
Way seems to contend that he owes plaintiff no duties
outside the employment relationship.  The
court is not sure what defendant means. 
If defendant means that he did not owe plaintiff a duty not to sexually
assault her, the argument is frivolous. 
If it is something else, the court does not know what it is.  Similarly meritless is the argument that the
sexual assault had nothing to do with gender.
 
As to the allegations that defendant owes no duty regarding
the alleged unpaid overtime because he did not know plaintiff worked it, the
argument also fails.  The court cannot
determine that on this pleading motion. 
Nor is it a defense that defendant was personally unaware of the
OT.  If the OT was worked, it must be
paid.  The same is true regarding the
accuracy of the work statements and the waiting time penalties.
