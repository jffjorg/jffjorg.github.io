And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the parties' recent stipulation regarding a stay. The judge is inclined to approve the stipulation, but wants to extend the stay period from January 25, 2026, to June 30, 2026. The judge is uncertain about setting a firm trial date due to the ongoing criminal matter and prefers to set a tentative settlement conference for February 2025 instead. If the criminal trial is moved to the summer, the parties may request to continue the settlement conference to a later date. The judge notes that if the defendant is found guilty and appeals, the court will not continue the stay or trial through the appellate process. The motion is now moot in light of the stipulation.
