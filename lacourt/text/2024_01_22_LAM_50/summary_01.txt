And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled in favor of the defendant's motion to expunge the notice of lis pendens recorded against the property. The plaintiffs had alleged that the defendants misappropriated funds to purchase real properties, and that the plaintiffs have a vested legal interest in the properties. However, the judge found that the claims in the pleading do not affect title to or possession of specific real property, and therefore do not constitute a real property claim under California Code of Civil Procedure section 405.4. The judge also found that the plaintiffs did not meet their burden to show the existence of a real property claim, and therefore granted the defendant's motion to expunge the lis pendens.
