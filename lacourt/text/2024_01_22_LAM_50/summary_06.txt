And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Honorable Teresa A. Beaudet, discloses that she and her husband purchased a pickup truck 24 years ago that developed electrical problems. Despite the issues, the manufacturer and dealer agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price without going to court. The judge does not believe this experience will influence her decision in the current case, but allows parties to file a verified statement of disqualification if they believe otherwise. The hearing on the Case Management Conference is continued to March 6, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file the statement.
