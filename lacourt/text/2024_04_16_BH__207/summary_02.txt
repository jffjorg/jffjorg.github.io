And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by Defendant Beverly Hills Escrow (BHE) to the Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Fred Behfarin, is seeking specific performance and declaratory relief against BHE, alleging that BHE breached the agreement for the sale of real estate. The judge rejects BHE's demurrer to the first cause of action, finding that the complaint adequately alleges facts indicating that BHE agreed to act as the escrow provider and failed to comply with the escrow instructions. The judge sustains BHE's demurrer to the eighth cause of action for declaratory relief, finding that the relief sought is duplicative of the specific performance sought against BHE. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint, finding that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate how the complaint could be amended to state a cause of action for declaratory relief.
