And here is the English text summarizing the tentative ruling:

The court denies Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment without prejudice. The court finds two procedural issues with the motion. Firstly, default has been entered against Defendants Nicolai and Nicolai KK, and the proper procedural vehicle to obtain a judgment against them is to request a default judgment, not a summary judgment. Secondly, the proof of service indicates that Defendant Amanda, who is proceeding in pro per, was served the motion only electronically, but there is no consent to electronic service on file. Therefore, the court denies the motion for summary judgment as to Defendants Nicolai and Nicolai KK, and the motion was not properly served on Defendant Amanda.
