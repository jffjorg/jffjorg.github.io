Limitations Extended by Six Months (Emergency Rule 10); and to Determine the
Time for Expiration of the 5 Year Statute of Limitations Date under C.C.P. §

TENTATIVE RULING: 
Plaintiff’s Motion for an Order to Specially Set the Trial on a Date
Prior to June 10, 2024; to Continue the 5 Year Statute of Limitations Extended
by Six Months (Emergency Rule 10); and to Determine the Time for Expiration of
the 5 Year Statute of Limitations Date under C.C.P. § 583.310 Has Been and is
Tolled While the Case is Trailing and the Parties Wait for Courtroom
Availability (C.C.P. § 583.340.) is DENIED without prejudice to Plaintiff
raising the tolling issues in the future, if necessary to avoid the application
of Code of Civil Procedure 583.360(a). Counsel for Defendants to give notice.
Background 
 
On June 10, 2019, Joel Benjamin Fuentes filed this
action against Trencore Plastering, Brix Masonry, Trencore & Brix, and Jose
Quintana arising out of allegations that Plaintiff sustained head injuries when
Defendants threw the large metal frame of a scaffold from the upper floors of
an apartment building to the ground below. 
 
After several orders requiring amendments to the
parties’ long cause trial documents, Judge Lisa R. Jaskol issued a minute order
on March 20, 2024 stating, in part, “[t]his case has been accepted as a Long
Cause trial by Department 1. The case is being trailed for trial pending
assignment to a Long Cause Trial court by the Master Calendar, Department 1.” 
 
On
April 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for an Order to Specially
Set the Trial on a Date Prior to June 10, 2024; to Continue the 5 Year Statute
of Limitations Extended by Six Months (Emergency Rule 10); and to Determine the
Time for Expiration of the 5 Year Statute of Limitations Date under C.C.P. §
583.310 Has Been and is Tolled While the Case is Trailing and the Parties Wait
for Courtroom Availability (C.C.P. § 583.340.).
 
On
April 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed an ex parte application for an order or to
shorten time on the motion. On April 30, 2024, Judge Jaskol issued an order
providing, in relevant part, “[t]he Court finds this matter must be heard by
the Supervising Judge in Department 1, Stanley Mosk Courthouse.”
 
On
May 1, 2024, Judge Elaine Lu issued an order denying the ex parte application.  
 
On
May 24, 2024, Judge Jaskol issued an order providing: “[a]t the direction of
the Master Calendar Department, Department 1, this trial ready case is being
assigned to Judge Susan Bryant-Deason, Department 8, Spring Street Courthouse
for trial. Counsel and unrepresented parties are to report in person to that
Department on June 11, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. for Trial Setting Conference.” 
 
Discussion
 
As
described in the Notice of Motion, Plaintiff’s motion seeks “an Order to
specially set this case for trial on a date prior to June 10, 2024; to continue
the five year statute of limitations extended by six months (Emergency Rule
10); and to determine the time for expiration of the five year statute of
limitations date under C.C.P. §583.310 has been and is tolled while the case is
trailing and the parties wait for courtroom availability (C.C.P. §583.340).” 
 
Plaintiff’s
request to set a trial date prior to June 10, 2024 is not supported by
authority, relevant evidence, or a showing of good cause. (Cal. R. Ct., rule
3.1335 (“A party seeking to advance, specially set, or reset a case for trial
must make this request by noticed motion or ex parte application under the
rules in chapter 4 of this division [and] [t]he request may be granted only
upon an affirmative showing by the moving party of good cause based on a
declaration served and filed with the motion or application.”).) Plaintiff’s
request to set trial prior to June 10, 2024 appears based upon the belief that
the five-year deadline expires on June 10, 2024 absent a court order. As
Plaintiff notes, the statute was extended by Emergency Rule 10, and as stated
in Judge Lu’s order denying Plaintiff’s ex parte application for the same
relief, the six-month extension under Rule 10 is automatic by operation of law
and does not require a separate court order.
 
Judge
Lu’s order on the ex parte application applies equally here: “more than 7
months remain before the period within which trial must commence under CCP
section 583.310 lapses. Plaintiff has failed to identify any reason why there
is any pressing need to set his case for trial before June 10, 2024. Nor has
Plaintiff shown good cause why his trial should be advanced before other
long-cause trials for cases older than the instant one or other long-cause
trials that announced ready for trial earlier than Plaintiff did.” The Court
finds no basis to specially set trial before June 10, 2024. 
 
The
Court finds Plaintiff’s request to establish tolling pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 583.340 to be unnecessary and premature, in addition to being
more properly determined by the assigned trial judge if the dismissal statute
is invoked or the trial deadline is close to expiration. 
 
As
noted above, the action has been assigned to Judge Susan Bryant-Deason,
Department 8, Spring Street Courthouse for trial and a trial setting conference
has been scheduled. A case cannot be dismissed based upon the deadlines
provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310 absent a noticed motion.
(Code Civ. Proc. 583.360(a) (“An action shall be dismissed by the court on its
own motion or on motion of the defendant, after notice to the parties, if the
action is not brought to trial within the time prescribed in this article.”).) Plaintiff’s
request does not appear ripe for adjudication as the five-year statute has not
run and is not imminent, such that any potentially applicable tolling would be
necessary to avoid dismissal, and there are no pending motions to dismiss the
action. 
 
Plaintiff
solely relies upon Coe v. City of Los Angeles (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 88,
which reviewed the trial court’s dismissal pursuant to a motion to dismiss. If,
at the trial setting conference, trial is set beyond the facially applicable
trial deadline, Plaintiff may object. (See Lee v. Park (1996) 43
Cal.App.4th 305, 309 (“It was their obligation, as civil plaintiffs, to
exercise reasonable diligence in calculating the mandatory dismissal date under
section 583.310, and to request a trial date that is before the end of the
statutory period.”).) 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion is DENIED without prejudice to Plaintiff raising the tolling issues in
the future, if necessary to avoid the application of Code of Civil Procedure
583.360(a).
