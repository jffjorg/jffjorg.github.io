RADIOLOGY PHYSICIANS
Defendants’ Motion to Relate Cases
TENTATIVE RULING: 
Defendants’ Motion to Relate Four Lawsuits Filed by Allstate Regarding
Alleged Corporate Practice of Medicine by Imaging Centers is DENIED.  Counsel for Plaintiffs to give notice.  
Background of 20STCV42672 People v.
Discovery Radiology Physicians
 
On
November 5, 2020, People of the State of California, ex rel., Allstate
Insurance Company, Allstate Indemnity Company, Allstate Fire and Casualty
Insurance Company, and Allstate Northbrook Indemnity Company filed 20STCV42672
against Discovery Radiology Physicians, P.C., William Ira Feske, M.D., Amjad
Safvi, M.D., and Sattar Mirtabatabaee aka Sattar Mir for violation of the
California Unfair Competition Act.
 
On
March 9, 2021, Amjad Safvi, M.D. filed a cross-complaint against Discovery
Radiology Physicians and Mir for indemnity.
 
On
May 17, 2021, Judge William F. Fahey issued an order finding 20STCV45151 People v. OneSource Medical Diagnostics
and 20STCV42672 related pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.300 and
provisionally consolidated the two actions.
 
On
June 1, 2021, Plaintiff filed the Second Amended Complaint asserting causes of
action for: (1) violation of California Insurance Code section 1871.7; and (2)
violation of California Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq. The
SAC alleges Mir, an “unlicensed layperson,” improperly owned and operated a
professional medical corporation, Discovery Radiology Physicians, P.C. The
complaint alleges Defendants operated a “MRI brokering and patient referral
scam” rather than taking and interpreting the MRIs themselves, (SAC ¶ 67), and
improperly obtained insurance benefits at a substantial markup. 
 
On
October 20, 2021, the court entered Plaintiffs’ request to dismiss William Ira
Feske, M.D. and Amjad Safvi, M.D. The court entered Safvi’s request to dismiss
the cross-complaint on October 25, 2021.
 
On
January 23, 2024, Department 1 issued an order after Judge Fahey accepted a
peremptory challenge in 20STCV45151 providing: “[t]his Court finds that
interest of justice is not served by reassigning case number 20STCV42672 to a
new Judicial Officer. Therefore, this Court determines that cases 20STCV45151
and 20STCV42672 should no longer be related.” The cases were further reassigned
after the newly assigned judicial officers accepted additional peremptory
challenges. 
 
On
April 17, 2024, Judge Wendy Chang issued an order finding 20STCV42672 and
20STCV45151 were related and declined to relate 20STCV42672 and 22STCV11349 People
v. Benji and 23STCV19039 People v. Encino Open MRI. 
 
This
case is currently pending in Department 36 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.

breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The OneSource

Background of 22STCV11349 People v.
Benji
 
On April 4, 2022, People of the State of California, ex
rel., Allstate Insurance Company filed 22STCV11349 against Jaklin Benji,
Matthew Rashidi, Michael Rashidi, Precise MRI Corp. dba Precise Imaging, Stuart
E. Strausberg, D.O., Ranon Udkoff, M.D., and 
Yokhevet, LLC. The First Amended Complaint, filed November 9, 2023,
asserts causes of action for: (1) violation of California Insurance Code
Section 1871.7; and (2) violation of California Business and Professions Code
section 17200 et seq. This FAC alleges Precise MRI operated without the proper
licensing and utilized two different processes to provide unlicensed MRI
services, including contracting with Defendant Udkoff to interpret MRIs. The
FAC alleges Defendants Benji and Rashidi created Defendant Yokhevet to purchase
and hold real property for Precise MRI to use in its alleged fraud scheme.
Defendants further inflated their billings to the insurance companies. The FAC
identifies 5,416 claims that “contain multiple material misrepresentations and
concealment of material information.” (FAC ¶ 101.) 
 
On
April 29, 2024, Judge Randolph M. Hammock issued an order finding 22STCV11349
and 23STCV19039 were not related within the meaning of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.300. 
 
This
case is currently pending in Department 49 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse with
the next hearing set for July 3, 2024. 
 
Background of 23STCV19039 People v.

Inc., d/b/a Socal Imaging And Open MRI, SoCal MRI Centers LLC, d/b/a Montclair
Open MRI, Akhtar Golbahar, Harry Golbahar, Nick Golbahar, Bobak Kardan, Stanton
Kremsky, M.D., Alexander Grimm, M.D., and Ranon Udkoff, M.D. The complaint

Kardan operated six radiology facilities without the proper licenses and
submitted 1,502 false claims to Allstate. Defendants allegedly contracted with
Defendants Udkoff and Kremsky to “interpret . . . lay-rendered medical imaging
scans.” (Compl. ¶ 103.) 
 
This
case is currently pending in Department 58 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
 
Motion 
 
On Defendants Sattar “Mir” Mirtabatabaee, OneSource
Medical Diagnostics, 1st Source Capital, Jaklin Benji, Mathew Rashidi, Michael
Rashidi, Precise MRI Corp., Yokhevet, LA MRI Center, Inc., Burbank Imaging
& Open MRI, Inc., Total MRI, LLC, Akhtar Golbahar, and Nicky Golbahar filed
the instant motion seeking to relate 22STCV11349 and 23STCV19039
with previously related cases 20STCV42672 and 20STCV45151. 
 
Opposition
 
In opposition, Plaintiffs argue the two related
cases should remain related, but 22STCV11349 and 23STCV19039
are not related to either each other or the previously related cases.
 
Reply
 
In reply, Defendants reiterate their contentions
that the cases are related. 
 
The Court
does not consider Defendants’ improper reply declarations. (Jay
v. Mahaffey (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537 (“The general rule of
motion practice, which applies here, is that new evidence is not permitted with
reply papers.”); Valentine v. Plum Healthcare Group, LLC (2019) 37
Cal.App.5th 1076, 1089 (“New evidence is generally not permitted with reply
papers.”).) The declarations are not, as Defendants contend in reply,
supplemental evidence. (Reply at 4 n.3.) Rather, they are a belated attempt to
correct evidentiary deficiencies of their own making. (Jay, supra, 218
Cal.App.4th 1538 (noting proper supplemental evidence should “only fill[] gaps
in the evidence created by the limited partners' opposition.”).) 
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Defendants request the Court take judicial notice of
the pleadings and various minute orders entered in the cases at issue. The
request is GRANTED. (Evid. Code § 452(d).) 
 
Evidentiary Objections
 
May 10, 2024 Declaration of Kohli - Objections Nos.
3 and 4 are SUSTAINED and Objections Nos. 1, 2, and 5 are OVERRULED.
 
May 14, 2024 Declaration of Kohli – the objection to
the entirety of the May 14, 2024 declaration is SUSTAINED. The declaration is
untimely. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1005.) The Court shall not consider the untimely
supplemental declaration filed on May 14, 2024. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.1300(d).) 
 
Declaration of Sokolove – both objections are
SUSTAINED. 
 
Motion to Relate Cases
 
Standard 
 
In the event that the pertinent judge under California
Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1) does not relate any of the cases set forth in
a Notice of Related Case, Department 1 may relate the matters on noticed
motion. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D); LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3).) 
 
The
Court Declines to Relate  22STCV11349 and
23STCV19039 with Each Other or Either 20STCV42672 or 20STCV45151
 
As noted above, Judge Chang issued an
order declining to relate 20STCV42672 with 22STCV11349 and 23STCV19039 on April
17, 2024 and Judge Hammock issued an order declining to relate 22STCV11349 and
23STCV19039 on April 29, 2024. Accordingly, the motion is properly brought in
Department 1. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D), LASC Local Rule
3.3(f)(3).)   
 
Cases are related when they (1)
involve the same parties and are based on the same or similar claims, (2) arise
from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events
requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical questions of
law or fact, (3) involve claims against, title to, possession of, or damages to
the same property, or (4) are likely for other reasons to require substantial
duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct.,
rule 3.300(a).) Defendants’ motion contends the cases are related based upon
the first, second, and fourth grounds enumerated in Rule 3.300. 
 
As seen above, the cases do not
involve the same parties. Each case involves numerous defendants that are not
parties to the other cases, (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(1)), and Defendants’
motion concedes “the parties across all four actions are not identical.” (Mot.
at 7:4.) While the Plaintiffs in each case assert the same enumerated causes of
action under the same statues, they do not involve the same or substantially
similar claims. (Ibid.) Additionally, there are numerous claims in 20STCV45151,
brought via cross-complaints, that are not at issue in either 22STCV11349 or
23STCV19039. 
 
The two unrelated cases, 22STCV11349
or 23STCV19039, do not arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact as each other, or the
previously related cases: 20STCV42672 or 20STCV45151. (Cal. R. Ct., rule
3.300(a)(2).) Defendants contend the cases involve the same “theory of
liability,” the same questions of law, and substantially the same questions of
fact. (Mot. at 5:3-7:2.) Defendants also note they followed similar business
models. 
 
However, each case arises out of the
Defendants’ alleged operation of separate, unlawful MRI facilities and each
case is based upon the submission of different claims to Allstate. While
22STCV11349 and 23STCV19039 both name Ranon Udkoff, M.D. as a physician who
interpreted MRIs for the Defendants, Udkoff’s involvement is not sufficient to
relate the two cases. As noted by Plaintiff, Udkoff is alleged to have
“contracted with different entities and persons to provide radiological
services in each case, he interpreted and prepared different reports on
different company letterheads in each case, he was paid by different actors for
the services he rendered in each case, and the claims at issue in which he was
involved are separate and distinct in each case.” (Opp. at 7:3-6.) The limited
similarities between the cases, primarily arising from Defendants’ alleged
business model, do not render the cases related within the meaning of
California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a)(2), nor do shared general legal
theories. 
 
Finally, Defendants argue the cases
will require a substantial duplication of judicial resources if 22STCV11349 and
23STCV19039 remain unrelated because “different judges will be making
duplicative determinations regarding the same documents, with the same parties,
hearing duplicative evidence, and making duplicative discovery, evidentiary,
dispositive and motion in limine rulings about the same issues in simultaneous
and concurrent cases.” (Mot. at 8:18-9:9.) Defendants note there is a similar
issue regarding patient privacy in each case. (Ibid.) However, similar pretrial
motions addressed to similarly alleged pleadings are not sufficient to
demonstrate a substantial duplication of judicial resources. Each case will
primarily involve the application of the law to the facts specific to each
plaintiff, each defendant, and each allegedly fraudulent insurance claim at
issue. The individual issues of law and fact predominate and the cases are not
likely to result in a substantial duplication of judicial resources within the
meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a)(4).
 
The Court declines to relate
22STCV11349 and 23STCV19039 with each other or either of the previously related
20STCV42672 or 20STCV45151 and the motion is DENIED.
