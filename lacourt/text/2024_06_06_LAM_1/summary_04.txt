And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

"The court has reviewed the motion to relate two cases, 23STCV09780 and 23STCV10606, both of which involve the Amaad Institute as the defendant. The motion was filed by the Amaad Institute, arguing that the cases are related based on the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events. The court has reviewed the cases and finds that they do not involve the same parties, do not arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, and will require separate determinations of law and fact. Therefore, the court declines to relate the cases and the motion is denied."
