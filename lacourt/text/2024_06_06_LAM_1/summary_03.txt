And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion to transfer the case from the Stanley Mosk Courthouse to the Michael D. Antonovich Antelope Valley Courthouse. The defendant, Antelope Valley Healthcare District, is a local agency/public entity and argued that it is proper for the district to be transferred to Lancaster. However, the court found that Section 394 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which governs transfers between counties or cities and counties, is inapplicable in this case. The defendant also failed to meet its burden to demonstrate a transfer is warranted based on the convenience of witnesses and ends of justice. The court noted that the defendant's motion was untimely and that the supporting declaration lacked sufficient information to meet the burden. As a result, the motion was denied.
