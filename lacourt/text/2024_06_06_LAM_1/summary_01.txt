English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's motion to specially set the trial on a date prior to June 10, 2024; to continue the 5-year statute of limitations extended by six months; and to determine the time for expiration of the 5-year statute of limitations date. The Judge finds no basis to specially set the trial before June 10, 2024, and notes that the six-month extension under Emergency Rule 10 is automatic by operation of law. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff has failed to show good cause why the trial should be advanced before other long-cause trials. The Judge reminds the Plaintiff that if the five-year deadline expires, the action may be dismissed, and the Plaintiff should object at the trial setting conference.
