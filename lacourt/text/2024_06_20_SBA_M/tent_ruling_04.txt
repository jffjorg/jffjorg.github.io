PROCEEDINGS
 
            Andre Zepeda v. Alexander Barbra, et al.
23TRCV02025
1.     
Alexander
Barbra’s Demurrer to Complaint
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Alexander Barbra’s Demurrer to Complaint is sustained
with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Background
 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on June 22, 2023.
Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff hired Defendant to do cabinet
and stonework. Defendant’s work was defective, and Defendant abandoned the job.
Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action: 1. Breach of Contract; 2.
Negligent Construction and Design; 3. Rescission; 4. Restitution. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Defendant did not file a meet and confer declaration
in sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41. Generally, this Court would have
required that the demurrer be continued, the Defendant to meet and confer, and
to file a meet and confer declaration prior to the hearing of this demurrer.
However, it appears that the attorney who filed this demurrer has been
substituted out of this case and that the Defendant is in pro per. Thus, the
Court will simply proceed on the merits of this demurrer. The parties are informed
and/or reminded that any future demurrers require a meet and confer process and
a meet and confer declaration to be filed with the demurrer.
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Defendant’s request for judicial notice is granted in
part. The Court takes judicial notice of the existence of Exhibits 1 to 3 but
does not take judicial notice of the truth of any matters asserted therein. The
Court takes judicial notice of the Complaint although it is not necessary to do
so with a demurrer.
 
Demurrer

A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a
matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In
testing the sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of
(1) the properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably
inferred from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) 
The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of
fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.App.4th 634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of a complaint, the plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts
sufficient to establish every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw v. California Physicians
Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) 
Where the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County of
Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case
"with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to
acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of
action.”  (Gressley v. Williams
(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) 
"Whether the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is
irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer." 
(Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605,
609–610.)  Under Code Civil Procedure §
430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is “uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s
factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently apprise a
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
 
Defendant demurs to Plaintiff’s Complaint and the first
through fourth causes of action pursuant to CCP § 430.10(e) and (f) on the
grounds that the causes of action fail to state facts sufficient to constitute
a cause of action and uncertainty. 
 
The demurrer to the entire Complaint is sustained with
leave to amend. Plaintiff appears to acknowledge a misidentification of the
Defendant such that the properly named Defendant is actually Moderna Kitchen
Cabinets, LLC. (Opposition, page 5, lines 13-16.) Thus, the scope of leave to
amend upon the sustaining of this demurrer is to amend and/or correct the name
of the party Defendant(s).
 
The Court will also address each individual cause of
action as follows.
 
First Cause of Action for Breach of Contract
 
“The elements of a cause of action for breach of
contract are: (1) the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damages to
plaintiff.” Coles v. Glaser (2016) 2
Cal.App.5th 384, 391(internal quotations omitted). “[T]he complaint must
indicate on its face whether the contract is written, oral, or implied by
conduct. [...] If the action is based on an alleged breach of a written
contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the complaint or a
copy of the written instrument must be attached and incorporated by reference.”
Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452,
458–59.
 
The Court notes that it appears that Plaintiff has
adequately pled the elements of breach of contract as to Moderna Kitchen
Cabinets, LLC and attached the contract. The Court also notes that it does not
appear that Andrew Barbra, the individual, is a contracting party.
 
Second Cause of Action for Negligent Construction and
Design
 
“[C]onduct amounting to a breach of contract becomes
tortious only when it also violates a duty independent of the contract arising
from principles of tort law. An omission to perform a contract obligation is
never a tort, unless that omission is also an omission of a legal duty.” Erlich
v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 551 (internal citations and quotations
omitted).
 
Here, the breaches of duty outlined within this cause
of action are duties encompassed within the contract, and there is no showing
that a duty of care existed that is separate and distinct from the contractual
duties.
 
Thus, the demurrer to the second cause of action is
sustained on this basis as well.
 
Third Cause of Action for Rescission
 
Civ. Code, § 1689 states:
“(a) A contract may be rescinded if all the parties
thereto consent.
(b) A party to a contract may rescind the contract in
the following cases:
(1) If the consent of the party rescinding, or of any
party jointly contracting with him, was given by mistake, or obtained through
duress, menace, fraud, or undue influence, exercised by or with the connivance
of the party as to whom he rescinds, or of any other party to the contract
jointly interested with such party.
(2) If the consideration for the obligation of the
rescinding party fails, in whole or in part, through the fault of the party as
to whom he rescinds.
(3) If the consideration for the obligation of the
rescinding party becomes entirely void from any cause.
(4) If the consideration for the obligation of the
rescinding party, before it is rendered to him, fails in a material respect
from any cause.
(5) If the contract is unlawful for causes which do
not appear in its terms or conditions, and the parties are not equally at
fault.
(6) If the public interest will be prejudiced by
permitting the contract to stand.
(7) Under the circumstances provided for in Sections
39, 1533, 1566, 1785,1 1789,2 1930 and 2314 of this code,
Section 2470 of the Corporations Code,3 Sections 331, 338, 359, 447,
1904 and 2030 of the Insurance Code or any other statute providing for
rescission.”
 
“A party who sues for breach of contract thereby
affirms the contract's existence, and the damages awarded “compensate[ ] the
party not in default for the loss of his ‘expectational interest’—the benefit
of his bargain which full performance would have brought.” (Runyan, supra,
2 Cal.3d at p. 316, fn. 15, 85 Cal.Rptr. 138, 466 P.2d 682.) In contrast,
rescission is a remedy that disaffirms the contract. (Akin, at p.
296, 44 Cal.Rptr.3d 284; see also Lobdell v. Miller, supra, 114
Cal.App.2d at p. 343, 250 P.2d 357 [“The remedy of rescission necessarily
involves a repudiation of the contract”].) Rescission extinguishes the contract
(Civ.Code, § 1688), terminates further liability, and restores the parties to
their former positions by requiring them to return whatever consideration they
have received. (Nmsbpcsldhb v. County of Fresno (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th
954, 959–960, 61 Cal.Rptr.3d 425.) Thus, the “[r]elief given in rescission
cases—restitution and in some cases consequential damages—puts the rescinding
party in the status quo ante, returning him to his economic position
before he entered the contract.” Sharabianlou v. Karp (2010) 181
Cal.App.4th 1133, 1144–1145.
 
Here, Plaintiff has failed to allege facts to
establish a ground for rescission as stated in Civ. Code § 1689.  Plaintiff mentions failure of consideration, but
the allegations concern failure to furnish consideration by Defendant.  The statutory elements specifically state that
rescission may be proper if consideration of the rescinding party fails for
various reasons noted above. In addition, Plaintiff has failed to allege facts
to establish a valid remedy pursuant to rescission. The alleged damages appear
to repeat the same damages set forth in the Breach of Contract cause of action.

 
Thus, the demurrer to the third cause of action is
sustained for these reasons as well.
 
Fourth Cause of Action for Restitution
 
“Unjust enrichment, the term used by plaintiff, is
synonymous with restitution. (See Goff & Jones, The Law of Restitution
(1966) p. 12; 1 Palmer, The Law of Restitution (1978) § 1.1, pp. 2–3; id.
(1988 supp.) p. 3; Rest., Restitution (1937) § 1.) [I]n any event, ... there is
no particular form of pleading necessary to invoke the doctrine” of
restitution.” Dinosaur Development, Inc. v. White (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d
1310, 1314–1315 (internal quotations omitted).
 
“A cause of action for quasi-contract invokes
consideration of equitable principles, rather than of contract. “‘... [It] is
an obligation ... created by the law without regard to the intention of
the parties, and is designed to restore the aggrieved party to [its] former
position by return of the thing or its equivalent in money. The doctrine
focuses on equitable principles; its key phrase is “‘unjust enrichment,’” which
is used to identify the “transfer of money or other valuable assets to an
individual or a company that is not entitled to them.” Welborne v.
Ryman-Carroll Foundation (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 719, 725 (internal citations
and quotations omitted).
 
Unjust Enrichment is not a cause of action.  See, Hill v. Roll Int'l Corp. (2011)
195 Cal.App.4th 1295, 1307.  The Court
may, however, recognize a cause of action based on quasi-contract to obtain the
remedy of restitution.  See, McKell v.
Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1490.  "The elements of an unjust enrichment
claim are the receipt of a benefit and [the] unjust retention of the benefit at
the expense of another."  Peterson
v. Cellco Partnership (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1583, 1593-94. 
 
While typically, a quasi-contract cause of action is
not necessary when a valid contract is in place, the Court would allow
Plaintiff to proceed on a theory of quasi-contract as an alternative theory
should the contract somehow be declared void or invalid.
 
Thus, Defendant’s demurrer is sustained with 20 days
leave to amend.
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
