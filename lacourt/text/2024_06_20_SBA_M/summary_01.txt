The judge has granted the motion of Counsel Grant Nigolian to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Shinya Ii. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the relationship between the parties, with the client engaging in conduct outlined in the California Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.16(b). The judge found that the attorney had shown sufficient reasons for withdrawal and had followed the proper procedures for filing the motion. As a result, the attorney is relieved as counsel of record for the client, effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed order upon the client.
