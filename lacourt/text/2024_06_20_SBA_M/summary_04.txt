English-text summary:

Judge Gary Y. Tanaka issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the Complaint in the case of Andre Zepeda v. Alexander Barbra, et al. The defendant, Alexander Barbra, filed a demurrer to the Complaint on the grounds that the causes of action fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and are uncertain. The court sustained the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend. The court also granted the defendant's request for judicial notice. The plaintiff, Andre Zepeda, alleged that the defendant failed to perform defective work and abandoned the job. The court ruled that the plaintiff failed to plead facts to establish a ground for rescission and that the cause of action for restitution was not properly pleaded. The court also found that the plaintiff failed to plead facts to establish a breach of contract and that the defendant was not a contracting party.
