And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies without prejudice the motion to compel compliance with the deposition subpoena and request for sanction. The motion was filed by Defendants Reza Tehrani, et al. to compel the custodian of records for Andrew Fox, M.D. to produce documents related to the care and treatment of Plaintiff Cheryl Monsegue-Leeds. However, Andrew Fox, M.D. was not properly personally served with a deposition subpoena, and instead, the subpoena was served on Plaintiff's counsel by mail. As a result, the court cannot compel the production of documents or Andrew Fox, M.D.'s attendance at a deposition. The court orders Defendants to give notice of this ruling.
