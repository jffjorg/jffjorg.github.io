And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Edward Luis Zavala v. General Motors LLC. The plaintiff's motion to compel deposition of the defendant's person most qualified is denied without prejudice, as the plaintiff failed to set forth a meet and confer declaration stating that the plaintiff contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance. The plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to request for production of documents, Set One, is deemed moot, as the defendant served further responses on October 31, 2023. The parties are informed and/or reminded that Department M requires that an informal discovery conference be scheduled and heard prior to the hearing of any discovery motion that concerns compelling further responses to discovery requests.
