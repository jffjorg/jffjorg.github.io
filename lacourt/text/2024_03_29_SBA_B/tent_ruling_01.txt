BACKGROUND
            On December 20, 2023, U.S. Bank
National Association dba U.S. Bank Equipment Finance filed a complaint against
Kate Holding, Inc. and Anthony John Logan for (1) breach of written agreement,
(2) breach of personal guaranty, (3) indebtedness, (4) account stated, (5)
unjust enrichment, (6) claim and delivery, and (7) conversion.
            On February 27, 2024, a default was
entered against Kate Holding.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
            CCP §512.010 sets forth the
requirements in an application for writ of possession.  CCP §512.010(b) states: “The application
shall be executed under oath and shall include all of the following:   (1) A
showing of the basis of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is
entitled to possession of the property claimed. If the basis of the plaintiff's
claim is a written instrument, a copy of the instrument shall be attached.
            (2)
A showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, of the
manner in which the defendant came into possession of the property, and,
according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of
the reason for the detention.
            (3)
A particular description of the property and a statement of its value.
            (4)
A statement, according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the
plaintiff, of the location of the property and, if the property, or some part
of it, is within a private place which may have to be entered to take
possession, a showing that there is probable cause to believe that such
property is located there.
            (5)
A statement that the property has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or
fine, pursuant to a statute; or seized under an execution against the property
of the plaintiff; or, if so seized, that it is by statute exempt from such
seizure.”
CCP §512.040(b) states:  “The writ will be issued if the court finds
that the plaintiff's claim is probably valid and the other requirements for issuing
the writ are established.  The hearing is
not for the purpose of determining whether the claim is actually valid.  The determination of the actual validity of
the claim will be made in subsequent proceedings in the action and will not be
affected by the decision at the hearing on the application for the writ.” 
CCP §511.090 states:  A “claim has probable validity where it is
more likely than not that plaintiff will obtain judgment against defendant on
that claim.”
            Further, “[a]t the hearing, the
court shall make its determinations upon the basis of the pleadings and other
papers in the record; but, upon good cause shown, the court may receive and
consider additional evidence and authority produced at the hearing or may
continue the hearing for the production of such additional evidence, oral or
documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or points and authorities.”  CCP §512.050.
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff seeks a writ of possession
against each defendant for two 2016 Freightliner Cascadia 125 6x4 truck
tractors.
            The complaint alleges under the
first cause of action that on May 20, 2022, plaintiff and defendant Kate
Holding, Inc. entered into an Equipment Finance Agreement for two 2016
Freightliner Cascadia 125 6x4 Sleeper Truck Tractors, VIN: 1FUJGLD56GLHF8884 and
VIN: 3AKJGLBG9GSGW1773, for which defendant was to make 45 monthly payments of
$2,937.15.  Complaint, ¶7, Exh.1.
Defendant breached the terms of the EFA by failing to make the monthly payment
due June 26, 2023 or any payment due thereafter pursuant to the EFA.  Plaintiff accelerated the balance, declaring
the full amount due and owing.  Id., ¶9.  Based upon the uncured default in the EFA,
Kate Holding is liable to plaintiff for the total amount outstanding of
$105,036.96 together with interest at the rate of 12%.  Id., ¶10. 
Under the second cause of action, plaintiff alleges that defendant
Anthony John Logan breached the personal guaranty.  Id., ¶¶13-16.
            The court finds that the applications
comply with the requirements set forth in CCP §512.010.  See Terrica Vorvick decl.  Plaintiff has met its burden to establish the
probable validity of its claim.  
            Plaintiff is not required to post an
undertaking as defendants have no positive interest in the vehicle.  There is currently due the sum of $105,036.96
plus interest, and the fair market value of the sleeper trucks is approximately
$70,000.  See Vorvick decl.  Pursuant to CCP §515.020, the amount of
defendants’ undertaking is set at $105,000. 

            The applications are GRANTED.
 
ORDER
            The applications for writ of
possession are GRANTED.  Defendants’
undertaking is set at $105,000.  See
Order on CD-120 to be submitted by plaintiff.
            Plaintiff is to give notice of
ruling.
