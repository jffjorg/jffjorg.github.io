Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the applications for writ of possession filed by U.S. Bank National Association against Kate Holding, Inc. and Anthony John Logan. The applications seek possession of two 2016 Freightliner Cascadia 125 6x4 truck tractors that were the subject of an Equipment Finance Agreement between the plaintiff and defendant Kate Holding, Inc. The defendant breached the terms of the agreement, and the plaintiff accelerated the balance, declaring the full amount due and owing.

The judge found that the applications comply with the requirements set forth in CCP §512.010 and that the plaintiff has met its burden to establish the probable validity of its claim. The court set the amount of defendants' undertaking at $105,000, which is the amount of the outstanding balance plus interest. The plaintiff is to give notice of the ruling.
