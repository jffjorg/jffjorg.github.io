The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant's motion to compel responses to supplemental discovery requests. The plaintiff was properly served with discovery requests but failed to respond, and the defendant moved to compel responses and award sanctions. The judge granted the motion and ordered the plaintiff to serve verified responses to the defendant's supplemental interrogatory within 15 days. The judge also awarded the defendant attorney fees and costs and imposed sanctions on the plaintiff and their counsel. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if no agreement is reached, the parties should appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
