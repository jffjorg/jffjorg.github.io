And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the unopposed motion to quash service of summons filed by defendant Tyrei Lacy. The motion was filed on April 27, 2023, and no opposition was filed by the time the motion was due on January 22, 2024. The judge finds that the plaintiff, Kai Smith, failed to meet the burden to establish that service on Lacy was proper. Lacy declares that she was not served with process by the Los Angeles Sheriff Department on March 28, 2023, and that "Kiona-Manager" is not a person authorized to accept service on her behalf. The judge notes that the filing of a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper, but the plaintiff did not provide competent evidence to establish that the service was proper. As a result, the motion to quash service of summons is granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
