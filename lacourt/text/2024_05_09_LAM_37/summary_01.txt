The court also denies the motion to strike, which was brought by the Stevens Defendants. The court finds that the Plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action for professional negligence and that they failed to prove proximate causation. The court grants the Plaintiffs 30 days leave to amend to fix the deficiencies in their complaint.
