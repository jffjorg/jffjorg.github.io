 Case Number:  20STCV33026    Hearing Date:   November 20, 2024    Dept:  B Petitioner Mary Tuccio’s Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a DisabilityRespondent: NO OPPOSITIONTENTATIVE RULINGPetitioner Mary Tuccio’s Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability is GRANTED.BACKGROUNDThis action arises from a November 22, 2019, incident in which Claimant Anthony Ramirez (“Claimant”) alleges Defendant Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District (“Defendant”) negligently owned and maintained public property, causing Claimant to sustain injury as a result.On August 31, 2020, Claimant filed an action against Defendant for four causes of action: (1) dangerous condition of public property; (2) negligence; (3) negligent infliction of emotional distress; and (4) negligent hiring, supervision, or retention of an employee.On September 1, 2020, Petitioner Mary Tuccio (“Petitioner”)’s application for appointment as Claimant’s guardian ad litem was granted.On November 4, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant Petition to Confirm Minor’s Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability on behalf of Claimant.ANALYSISPetitioner seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive $99,000.00 from Defendant.Legal StandardAn enforceable settlement of a minor’s or incompetent’s claim can only be consummated with court approval. (Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) For thispurpose, a petition for approval must be presented to the court and until it is granted, there is no final settlement. (Scruton v. Korean Air Lines Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1606.) Any settlement agreement therefore is voidable by the minor’s guardian ad litem. (Id., at p. 1606.)Probate Code section 3600, et seq., governs how the settlement proceeds are to be paid. Pursuant to Probate Code section 3601, the order shall approve payment of reasonable expenses from the settlement as follows:The court making the order or giving the judgment referred to in Section 3600, as a part thereof, shall make a further order authorizing and directing that such reasonable expenses (medical or otherwise and including reimbursement to a parent, guardian, or conservator), costs, and attorney’s fees, as the court shall approve and allow therein, shall be paid from the money or other property to be paid or delivered for the benefit of the minor or incompetent person. (Prob. Code, § 3601, subd. (a).)In cases pursuant to Probate Code section 3601, “unless the court has approved the fee agreement in advance, the court must use a reasonable fee standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s fees payable from money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person with a disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955, subd. (a)(1).) In doing so, “[t]he court must give consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made between the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a disability and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made, except where the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a disability contemplated that the attorney's fee would be affected by later events.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955, subd. (a)(2).)DiscussionPetitioner seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive $99,000.00. Of the $99,000 settlement, $10,678.19 is to be deducted for medical expenses, $24,750.00 for attorney’s fees, and $29,488.19 for costs. Therefore, Claimant’s proposed net settlement amount is $34,083.62.The Petition sets forth information that bears upon the reasonableness of the compromise pursuant to CRC Rule 7.950. (MC-350 Attachment 8 [medical records].) Additionally, attorney’s fees represent 25% of the total settlement agreement. (MC-350 Attachment 13a.) Claimant’s counsel provides their retainer agreement as Attachment 17a. Costs are reasonable considering the extent of litigation.The Petition requests an additional order, requiring Petitioner to use Claimant’s settlement for Claimant’s private school tuition and “nothing else.” (MC-350 Item 20.) The order would also require Petitioner to inform the Court immediately if Claimant ceases to attend private school. The Court finds this additional order reasonable and in the best interest of Claimant.CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the petition to confirm minor’s compromise.Petitioner to give notice. Court will sign the proposed Order.
