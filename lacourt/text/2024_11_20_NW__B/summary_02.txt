This tentative ruling grants the petition to confirm the compromise of a claim or action or disposition of proceeds of judgment for a minor or a person with a disability. The petition was filed by Mary Tuccio, the guardian ad litem of Anthony Ramirez, a minor who was injured in an incident on November 22, 2019, allegedly caused by the negligence of the Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District. The settlement agreement provides for a payment of $99,000.00 to the minor, with $10,678.19 deducted for medical expenses, $24,750.00 for attorney's fees, and $29,488.19 for costs. The court finds the settlement reasonable and approves it, with an additional order requiring the guardian to use the settlement for the minor's private school tuition and to inform the court immediately if the minor ceases to attend private school.
