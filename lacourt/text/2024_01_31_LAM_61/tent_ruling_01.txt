MOTION TO
COMPEL
A propounding party may demand a responding
party to produce documents that are in their possession, custody or control.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010.) A party may likewise conduct discovery by
propounding interrogatories to another party to be answered under oath. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.010, subd. (a).) The responding party must respond to the
production demand either by complying, by representing that the party lacks the
ability to comply, or by objecting to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.210.) The responding party must respond to the interrogatories by
answering or objecting. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) If the
responding party fails to serve timely responses, the propounding party may
move for an order compelling responses to the production demand and
interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) 
 
A
party who fails to serve a timely response to interrogatories or a demand for
inspection waives any objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
2031.300.) 
Defendants Yale Management Services, Inc. and
A and L Associates, LLC (Defendants) served Plaintiff Paul S. Neese (Plaintiff)
with Form and Special Interrogatories on August 22, 2023, with responses due on
November 14, 2023, by agreement of the parties to extend the deadline multiple
times. (Fischer Decl. ¶¶ 2–9.) No responses have been received. (Fischer Decl.
¶ 10.) 
Defendants have shown the service of
discovery, without timely response from Plaintiff. No opposition to the motion
has been filed.
The motion is GRANTED.
