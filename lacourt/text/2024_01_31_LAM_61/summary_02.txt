And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, NewRez LLC dba Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing and The Bank of New York Mellon, have moved for a judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiff, Kristi Courtois, lacks standing to bring the action. The plaintiff's standing is based on her status as executor of the decedent's estate, but the defendants argue that this status is no longer valid since the plaintiff's petition for probate of will was denied and her special letters of administration had expired. The plaintiff has since filed a new petition to administer the decedent's intestate estate, but the court notes that the resolution of this petition is uncertain.

The court has tentatively ruled that the resolution of the present motion depends on the resolution of the plaintiff's petition. If the petition is denied, the motion shall be granted, without leave to amend. If the petition is granted, the motion shall be denied. The court will not grant or deny the motion until the plaintiff's petition to administer the estate is decided.
