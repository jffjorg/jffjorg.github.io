**Significant Statements**
```
- "The court shall grant a motion for a physical or mental examination under Section 2032.310 only for good cause shown."
- "The purpose of an IME is to furnish the parties with discoverable information, and there is no authority for the proposition that the conclusions of the examiner are binding upon the litigants."
- "The proposed conditions and amendments to the IME that Plaintiff offers in opposition are of varying quality. They are, however, all matters upon which Plaintiff could have conferred with Defendants before electing total opposition the IME, and for which Defendants indeed invited Plaintiff's input before the motion became necessary."
- "The court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiff's proposed all-verbal test accommodation is impracticable for the reasons stated by Dr. Stein, and need not be adopted."
- "The parties are directed to meet and confer concerning Plaintiff's hand neuropathy and accommodations for the same."
