And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is considering a defendant's motion to take judicial notice of a probate court's ruling. The plaintiff objects to this, arguing that the request for judicial notice does not specify which facts in the ruling the court is requested to take notice of. However, the court finds this objection unpersuasive, as the defendant is only asking the court to take notice of the ruling and the asserted basis therefore, which is within the scope of judicial notice. The court also notes that it need not take notice of the underlying truth of the presumption of fraud. The petition was filed on September 5, 2023, and the defendant's motion was filed the following day. The court will consider the motion and the petition in further proceedings.
