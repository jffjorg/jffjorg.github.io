I.                  
MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS
 
A party may move for a judgment on the pleadings as to an
entire complaint or as to a particular cause of action in a complaint. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 438 subd. (c)(2)(A).) If a defendant moves for a judgment on
the pleadings and argues that a complaint does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action against that defendant, then the court should
grant a defendant’s motion only if the court finds as a matter of law that the
complaint fails to alleges facts sufficient to constitute the cause of action.
(See id., § 438 subd.
(c)(1)(B)(ii); see also Mechanical Contractors Assn. v. Greater Bay Area Assn.
(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 672, 677.) 
 
“The standard for granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings is
essentially the same as that applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under
the state of the pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially
noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Bezirdjian v. O’Reilly (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 316, 321.) When considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings,
the court not only should assume that all facts alleged in the SAC are true but
also should give those alleged facts a liberal construction. (See Gerawan Farming, Inc. v.
Lyons (2000) 24 Cal.4th 468, 515–516, 101 Cal.Rptr.2d 470, 12 P.3d 720.) In
particular, the court should liberally construe the alleged facts “‘with a view
to attaining substantial justice among the parties.’ [Citation.]” (See Alliance
Mortgage Co. v. Rothwell (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1226, 1232, 44
Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 900 P.2d 601.)
 
The present motion mirrors in many respects the prior motion
for judgment on the pleadings this court granted with leave to amend on
December 8, 2023.Defendants NewRez LLC dba Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing and The
Bank of New York Mellon fka The Bank of New York, as Trustee for the
Certificate holders of CWALT, Inc., Alternative Loan Trust 2007-6, Mortgage
Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-6 (Defendants) move for judgment on the
Third Amended Complaint (TAC) on the grounds that Plaintiff Kristi Courtois’
(Plaintiff) remaining claims for elder abuse, violation of the Homeowners Bill
of Rights (HBOR), Business & Professions Code § 17200 (UCL), and negligence
are barred by her lack of standing.
 
As with the previous motion, Defendants contend that
Plaintiff’s claim to standing rests upon her status as executor of Decedent
Austeene G. Cooper’s estate, when Plaintiff has not in fact been appointed as
same. Although Defendants acknowledge that Plaintiff was granted Special
Letters of Administration from the probate court to prosecute the present
action, they note that on August 4, 2023, the probate court denied Plaintiff’s
petition for probate of will on the grounds that Plaintiff had drafted the will
in which she was appointed, and therefore her petition was barred by “the
conclusive presumption of fraud” under Probate Code § 21380, subd. (a) and (c).
(RJN Exh. B.) In the same order, the court noted that Plaintiff’s special
letters of administration had expired in June 2023, and declined to renew them.
(Ibid.) Defendants therefore argue that Plaintiff’s basis for standing
has failed. (Motion at pp. 5–6.)[1]
 
Plaintiff in opposition argues that the disposal of her
petition to probate the will does not deprive her of standing, as she has since
filed[2] a
new petition to administer the Decedent’s intestate estate, supported by
the declaration of Brand Cooper, Decedent’s brother and one of his
heirs-at-law. (Opposition at pp. 3–4.) As with Plaintiff’s prior opposition to
Defendant’s earlier motion for judgment on the pleadings, she contends that the
present lack of standing may be cured if the probate court grants her petition.
(Ibid.)
 
Defendants in reply contend that Plaintiff’s appointment of
intestate executor is unlikely, as Probate Code § 8402 states that “a person is
not competent to act as personal representative in any of the following
circumstances,” thereafter listing, among other bases, “[t]here are grounds for
removal of the person from office under Section 8502.” (Prob. Code § 8402,
subd. (a)((3).) Probate Code § 8502, meanwhile, states that a personal
representative may be removed from office for “commit[ing] a fraud on the estate.”
(Prob. Code § 8502, subd. (a); Reply at p. 4.) Thus Defendants contend that
Plaintiff’s new petition to be administrator of the estate is “unlikely
speculation.” (Reply at p. 4.)
 
The judicially noticeable materials make clear that
Plaintiff, at present, lacks standing. She has since filed a new petition to be
appointed the executor of Decedent’s intestate estate. Defects in standing may
be cured (Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39
Cal.4th 235, 243), but the resolution of Plaintiff’s new petition is uncertain.
Plaintiff in her request for judicial notice contends that the hearing date on
the petition is November 16, 2023.
 
Accordingly, the resolution of the present motion depends
upon the resolution of Plaintiff’s petition, and this court may not grant or
deny the motion until Plaintiff’s petition is decided. If the petition is
denied, the motion shall be GRANTED, without leave to amend. If the petition is
granted, this motion shall be DENIED.
 
 
Defendants to give notice.
