Summary in English text:

The Judge grants Defendant Prada USA Corp.'s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production against Plaintiff Lindsey Sterling. The Plaintiff is ordered to provide further responses within 30 days. Sanctions are awarded against the Plaintiff and her counsel in the amount of $2,550.00 for unsuccessful opposition to the motion. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's responses to the requests are inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, and that her statements of inability to comply are false. The Defendant seeks the native electronic format of the updated resume, which the Plaintiff claims to have lost. However, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff has simply refused to produce the native files, which are in her possession. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff's opposition is riven with flagrant misrepresentations, damning admissions, and baffling inconsistencies, and therefore sanctions are awarded against the Plaintiff and her counsel.
