And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motions to compel further responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories, as well as their request for sanctions. The plaintiff, Leorna Shevorna Johnson, had failed to provide complete and substantive responses to the discovery requests, despite extensions and meet and confer efforts. The defendants have requested that the court compel further responses and impose sanctions.

The court grants the motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories, ordering the plaintiff to provide complete and substantive responses by August 23, 2024. The court also grants the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, but will entertain oral argument on the scope and burden objections to certain interrogatories.

The court denies the request for sanctions in the amount of $896, pending clarification on the discrepancy in the amount requested. The court will consider the defendants' request for sanctions at a later date.
