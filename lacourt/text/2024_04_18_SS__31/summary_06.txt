And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's request for default judgment against Defendant Gilbert Oscar Munoz. The Plaintiff, Interinsurance Exchange of The Automobile Club, is seeking a court default judgment against Munoz for $38,348.27 in damages, $4,758.34 in interest, and $575 in costs. However, the Judge has denied the request due to defects in the Plaintiff's submissions. Specifically, the Judge notes that the Plaintiff's declaration from Dwight Clifford, the custodian of records and subrogation examiner, is not applicable to the Plaintiff as he refers to the wrong plaintiff, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, instead of the actual plaintiff, Interinsurance Exchange of The Automobile Club. Additionally, the Judge notes that the Plaintiff's declaration from Jocelyn Perez Sasan does not properly explain the relationship between her and George Sansan, the owner of the motor vehicle. The Judge has given the Plaintiff until a later date to correct these defects and resubmit a new default judgment package.
