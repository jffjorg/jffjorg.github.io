The motion is denied because the issue of service has not been resolved, and the defendants have failed to submit a meet and confer declaration. The judge is ordering the defendants to resolve the issue of service and to submit the meet and confer declaration before the court can proceed on the merits. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
