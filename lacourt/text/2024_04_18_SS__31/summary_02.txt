Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion for terminating sanctions filed by defendant Cody Araghachi against plaintiff Abigail Grey. The court finds that while Grey's failure to complete her deposition was due to unforeseen circumstances, including a flat tire and severe neurological issues, the court does not find it necessary to impose terminating sanctions at this time. However, the court awards monetary sanctions of $750 to the Uber Defendants for the time and effort spent in preparing the motion and appearing at the hearing. The court also orders the parties to meet and confer on a mutually agreeable date to resume Grey's deposition, to be completed within the next 30 days.
