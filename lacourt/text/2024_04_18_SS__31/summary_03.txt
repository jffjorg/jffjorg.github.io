And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to be relieved as counsel, filed by Plaintiff's attorney, David Yerkanyan, Esq. The motion was opposed by the Defendant, Hawthorn Regency Apartments, LLC, who claimed that they were not served with the motion and that there was no proof of service demonstrating that the motion was served on the Plaintiff. The Judge denied the motion for two reasons: first, there was a procedural deficiency regarding the lack of proof of service, and second, Counsel was unable to confirm the Plaintiff's current address and serve the moving papers on the Clerk of the Court.
