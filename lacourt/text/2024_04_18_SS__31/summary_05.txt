And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Samuel Carcamo's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) without prejudice. The motion was denied due to Plaintiff's failure to comply with California Rules of Court (CRC) Rule 3.1324(a) and (b). Plaintiff's proposed amended pleading did not include the proposed additions or deletions to the previous pleading, and there was no separate declaration accompanying the motion. The judge noted that the proposed amendment states a valid cause of action as a matter of law, but the failure to comply with the rules is a sufficient reason to deny the motion. The judge also noted that Defendant's opposition contests the merits of the proposed allegations and causes of action, but the court will not consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading in ruling on the motion. The judge encouraged the parties to meet and confer to resolve the dispute.
