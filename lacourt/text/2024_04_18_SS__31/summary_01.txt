And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court's tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion for evidentiary and issue sanctions, but grants monetary sanctions. The plaintiff failed to appear for a neurological examination with Dr. Amos, despite a court order to do so. The defendants seek to preclude the plaintiff from claiming and introducing evidence of neurological injuries or damages at trial. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to appear was not a result of any malicious intent, but rather a mistake. Therefore, the court denies the motion for evidentiary and issue sanctions. However, the court grants monetary sanctions in the amount of $750, which is the fee for the missed examination. The court also orders the plaintiff to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by the defendants as a result of the plaintiff's misconduct. The court sets a new trial date and requires the parties to meet and confer on a mutually agreeable date for the plaintiff's examination with Dr. Amos to be completed within the next thirty days.
