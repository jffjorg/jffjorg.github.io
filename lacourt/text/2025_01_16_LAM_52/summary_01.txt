And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted plaintiff Steve Yoonsoo Kim's motions to compel responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories. Defendant Chris Au is ordered to serve verified responses without objections to these discovery requests within 30 days. Additionally, the court has imposed $1,320 in sanctions against defendant for failing to respond to the discovery requests. The sanctions are reduced by $1,215, representing 2.7 hours of attorney fees, as defendant did not file an opposition and plaintiff did not file a reply.
