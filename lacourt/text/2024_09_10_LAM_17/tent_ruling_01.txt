 Case No.: 
  19STCV42388 
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  September 10, 2024




 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
 
On
11/25/2019, Plaintiffs  Vahram (Vahram)[1]
and Ara Sevacherian (Ara) (collectively, Plaintiffs) initiated this action. On
12/6/2019, Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint (FAC) against Khosrov
Madenjian, trustee of the Madenjian Family Trust (Defendant), seeking
partition.
 
On 5/22/2024,
Plaintiff Ara Sevacherian moves for summary judgment of the FAC. 
 
            The
motion is unopposed. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
argues that she is entitled to partition as a matter of law. 
 
A co-owner of
real or personal property may bring an action for partition. (CCP § 872.210.)
“The primary purpose of a partition suit is, as the terminology implies, to
partition the property, that is, to sever the unity of possession.” (Schwartz
v. Shapiro (1964) 229 Cal.App.2d 238, 257.) “Partition is a remedy much
favored by the law.” (LEG Investments v. Boxler (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th
484, 493.)
 
A co-owner of
property has an absolute right to partition unless barred by a valid waiver.
(CCP § 872.710, subd. (b).) (LEG Investments v. Boxler, supra,
183 Cal.App.4th at p. 493.)
 
The two real
properties at issue in this partition action are the San Gabriel Property and
the Greenwood Property. 
 
The San
Gabriel Property is an apartment building located in the City of San Gabriel,
California, commonly known as 6230 North San Gabriel Blvd., San Gabriel,
California, A.P.N. 5374-001-021, and legally described as follows:

OF LOT “A” OF TRACT NO. 2254, AS PER MAP RECORDED IN BOOK 23, PAGE 36 OF MAPS,

WITH THE WEST LINE OF SAID LOT, 95 FEET; THENCE WESTERLY PARALLEL WITH SAID
NORTHERLY LINE, 300 FEET TO A POINT IN THE WESTERLY LINE OF SAID LOT; THENCE

            (SS
No. 3.) 
 
            The
Greenwood Property is an industrial building located in the City of Montebello,
California, commonly known as 1125 S. Greenwood Avenue, Montebello, CA 90640,
and legally described as follows: 
 
ALL THAT
PORTION OF LOT 53 OF EL CARMEL TRACT, IN THE CITY OF MONTEBELLO, AS PER MAP
RECORDED IN BOOK 7, PAGES 134 AND 135 OF MAPS, IN THE OFFICE OF THE COUNTY
RECORDER OF SAID COUNTY, LYING SOUTHWESTERLY OF THE SOUTHWESTERLY LINE OF THE
NORTHEASTERLY 306.62 FEET OF SAID LOT. EXCEPT THE NORTHWESTERLY 93.80 FEET OF

OF ENTRY AS RESERVED IN DEED DATED MARCH 10, 1956 AND RECORDED MARCH 15, 1956,
IN BOOK 50607, PAGE 265, OFFICIAL RECORDS. SAID LAND IS SHOWN AS PARCEL 1 ON
PARCEL MAP RECORDED IN BOOK 1, PAGE 58 OF PARCEL MAPS, IN THE OFFICE OF THE
COUNTY RECORDER OF SAID COUNTY APN: 6353-019-013
            
            (SS
No. 11.) 
 
 
            Plaintiff
submitted evidence that the owners of the fee simple interest in the San
Gabriel Property and the respective percentage interests are as follows:
 
-        
ARA SEVACHERIAN, Trustee of the Ara
Sevacherian Irrevocable Trust u/t/d April 26, 2007: Twenty-five Percent (25%)
(SS No. 6);
 
-        
HELEN MADENJIAN and CINDY MADENJIAN,
successors in interest of defendants KHOSROV MADENJIAN and ANNIE MADENJIAN,
Trustees of THE MADENJIAN FAMILY TRUST, Schedule “2” Assets, dated June 14,
2007: Fifty Percent (50%) (SS No. 7); and
 
-        
The successor in interest of VAHRAM
SEVACHERIAN, to be determined: twenty-five percent (25%) (SS No. 8).
 
            Plaintiff
submitted evidence that the owners of the fee simple interest in the Greenwood
Property and the respective percentage interests are as follows:
 
-        
ARA SEVACHERIAN: thirty-three percent
(33%) (SS No. 14);
 
-        
HELEN MADENJIAN and CINDY MADENJIAN,
successors in interest of defendants KHOSROV MADENJIAN and ANNIE MADENJIAN,
Trustees of THE MADENJIAN FAMILY TRUST, Schedule “2” Assets, dated June 14,
2007: thirty-three percent (33%) (SS No. 15); and
 
-        
The successor in interest of VAHRAM
SEVACHERIAN to be determined: thirty-three percent (33%) (SS No. 16.)
 
“If the court
finds that the plaintiff is entitled to partition, it shall make an
interlocutory judgment that determines the interests of the parties in the
property and orders the partition of the property and, unless it is to be later
determined, the manner of partition.” (CCP § 872.720, subd. (a).)
 
In lieu of
dividing the property among the parties, the court shall order the property be
sold and the proceeds divided among the parties in accordance with their
interests in the property if the parties agree to such relief or the court
determines sale and division of the proceeds would be more equitable than a
division of the property. (CCP § 872.820.)
 
Here,
Plaintiff submitted evidence that all parties have admitted that sale of the
Subject Properties by private sale and division of the net proceeds is more
equitable than division of those properties in kind, which is not feasible in
the present case because the Subject Properties are not physically divisible.
(SS Nos. 9 and 17.) 
 
The motion is
unopposed, and thus the Court considers this a concession by Defendants to the
merits of the motion. 
 
As such, the
Court enters an interlocutory judgment ordering partition of the Subject
Properties by sale and division of the proceeds among the owners according to
their interests. (CCP. § 872.820.)
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment is granted. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
