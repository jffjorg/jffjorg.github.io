And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in plain English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case between Jordan Alaimo and Reichman & Associates, P.C. regarding the enforcement of a deposition subpoena and the production of business records. The court has granted the defendant's motion to enforce the deposition subpoena and is ordering the defendant to produce all responsive documents within 20 days. The court has also sanctioned the defendant $700 for its failure to comply with the subpoena.

Additionally, the court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the production of a person most qualified (PMQ) for deposition. The defendant had refused to produce its PMQ, citing its previous production of documents. However, the court found that this refusal was not sufficient and that the defendant must produce its PMQ for deposition.

The court has given the parties until September 10, 2024, to submit their objections to the tentative ruling. If no objections are received, the tentative ruling will become the final order.
