And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Martha Gonzalez's motion to compel California Commission for Teacher's Credentialing (CTC) to produce business records related to her claims against Doe Unified School District.

The judge grants the motion in part, finding that CTC must produce business records that it can authenticate and that are relevant to Plaintiff's claims. However, the judge denies the motion in part, finding that CTC need not produce documents that it cannot authenticate and that are protected by the Deliberative Process privilege.

The judge also finds that CTC's refusal to produce documents prepared by third parties is improper, as these documents are not shielded from disclosure by section 1561 of the Evidence Code. Additionally, the judge finds that CTC's argument that it cannot corroborate the authenticity of the withheld documents is unpersuasive, as the CTC has a substantial interest in the accuracy of those documents.

The judge declines to find that the Official Informational Privilege applies, as CTC has not shown that the withheld documents are protected by this privilege. Finally, the judge orders that CTC comply with the majority of Plaintiff's Subpoena requests, but not produce documents that are "actually... related to the process by which policies are formulated" or "inextricably intertwined with policy-making processes."
