And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Vahram Sevacherian, et al., initiated this action against the defendant, Khosrov Madenjian, trustee of the Madenjian Family Trust, seeking partition of two real properties, the San Gabriel Property and the Greenwood Property. The properties are not physically divisible, and the parties agree to sell the properties and divide the proceeds.

The judge has held that the plaintiff is entitled to partition as a matter of law, citing California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 872.210 and other relevant statutes. The judge has also held that the parties have conceded the merits of the motion, as it is unopposed.

Accordingly, the judge has entered an interlocutory judgment ordering partition of the properties by sale and division of the proceeds among the owners according to their interests.
