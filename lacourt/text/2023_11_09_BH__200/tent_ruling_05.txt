[1] Plaintiffs have not sued for fraud the current owner
of the park, JDH Capital, or JDH Investments that owned the Park from October
2016 to January 2017. Plaintiffs purchased their homes before October 2016. MZL
is also the property manager for the JDH companies at the park. 


[2] Plaintiffs also point to Civil Code sec. 798.74.5,
which provides that within two business days of receiving an application for
residency the lessor shall provide the prospective lessee information that a fully
executed lease agreement is required prior to completion of the purchase of a
mobile home, as well as Civ. Code sec. 798.15 for the proposition that a lease
agreement with MZL would be implied even if a lease was not provided by MZL. 


[3] It is not clear to the Court how plaintiffs believe
Civ. Code sec. 798.15 implies MZL will have entered a lease with plaintiffs. That
said, a lease may be implied in MZL accepting rent from a tenant. The Court has
no information as to the latter issue.
