And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the information presented and is issuing a tentative ruling. The plaintiffs have not sued JDH Capital or JDH Investments, the former owners of the park, for fraud. The court notes that the plaintiffs purchased their homes before October 2016, when JDH Capital and JDH Investments owned the park. MZL is the property manager for the JDH companies. The plaintiffs are pointing to California Civil Code sections 798.74.5 and 798.15, which relate to the provision of lease agreements and the implication of a lease through conduct. However, the court is unclear how the plaintiffs believe section 798.15 implies a lease agreement between MZL and the plaintiffs. The court notes that a lease may be implied if MZL accepts rent from a tenant, but has no information on this issue. The court's tentative ruling will be finalized after considering further arguments and evidence.
