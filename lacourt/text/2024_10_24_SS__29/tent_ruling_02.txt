Background
On June 22, 2021, Eva Hererra (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Kathy Scott (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 10 for general
negligence arising out of an alleged dog attack incident on June 24, 2019.
 
On July 7, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.
 
On September 16, 2024, Defendant filed
these four discovery motions: to compel Plaintiff to respond to Form
Interrogatories (Set Two), Supplemental Interrogatories, Demand for Production
(Set Two), and Supplemental Demand for Production. 
 
On October 11, Plaintiff filed
oppositions.  Defendant has not filed a
reply.
 
The Court is aware that a fifth
discovery motion filed by Defendant on September 16 is set for hearing on
October 25, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
“In addition to the number of interrogatories permitted
by Sections 2030.030 and 2030.040, a party may propound a supplemental
interrogatory to elicit any later acquired information bearing on all answers
previously made by any party in response to interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.070, subd. (a).)
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
“In addition to the demands for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling permitted by this chapter, a party may propound a
supplemental demand to inspect, copy, test, or sample any later acquired or
discovered documents, tangible things, land or other property, or
electronically stored information in the possession, custody, or control of the
party on whom the demand is made.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.050, subd. (a).)
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On July 12, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff
with Supplemental Form Interrogatories and Supplemental Demand for Production;
on July 20, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with Form Interrogatories (Set
Two) and Demand for Production (Set Two). (Morand Decls., ¶ 2.)  
Plaintiff served responses, without
objections, on October 11, 2024. (See Exhibits to Oppositions.)
Accordingly, the four motions to compel are
denied as moot.
Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions.
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery” but
does not independently authorize sanctions for such conduct.
In the chapters of the Civil Discovery Act governing
interrogatories and requests for production, the Legislature has authorized
sanctions in the context of a motion to compel initial responses “against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion to compel.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) &
2031.300, subd. (c).) 
Plaintiff has not unsuccessfully
opposed the motions.  Accordingly, the
requests for sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300
are denied
Conclusion
The Court DENIES
AS MOOT the Motions to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories (Set Two), Supplemental Interrogatories, Demand for Production
of Documents (Set Two), and Supplemental Demand for Production of Documents. 
The Court
DENIES Defendant’s requests for sanctions.
Moving party is ORDERED to
give notice.
