And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiff to respond to four discovery requests, including form interrogatories, supplemental interrogatories, demand for production of documents, and supplemental demand for production of documents. The motions are denied as moot because the plaintiff has already responded to the discovery requests without objections. The defendant also sought monetary sanctions against the plaintiff for failing to respond to the discovery requests, but the judge has denied these requests because the plaintiff has not unsuccessfully opposed the motions.
