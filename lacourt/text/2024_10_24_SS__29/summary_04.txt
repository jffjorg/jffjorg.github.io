Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion of the City of Los Angeles to contest the application of the defendants, Hugo Vilchez and Hugo Vilchez Trust, for a determination of good faith settlement. The court finds that there has been a failure of proof on the good faith settlement issue, as the parties have not provided sufficient evidence regarding the nature and extent of the plaintiff's injuries and potential recovery. The court also notes that the defendants have not carried their initial burden of producing evidence in support of their request for a good faith settlement determination. Therefore, the court denies the application for a good faith settlement determination without prejudice.
