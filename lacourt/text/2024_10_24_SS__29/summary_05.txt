And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies, without prejudice, the defendant's motion to consolidate the Squire Action (Case No. 23STCV03841) with the Resendiz Action (Case No. 23EVCV01021). The two cases arise out of the same motor vehicle accident on March 12, 2021, and were initially filed in different departments. The defendant filed the motion to consolidate on September 30, 2024, but failed to comply with the procedural requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a)(1)(C), by not filing a notice of motion in the Resendiz Action. The Judge notes that the court may consolidate actions where there is a common question of law or fact, but that the motion must comply with the procedural requirements of the rule. The denial of the motion is without prejudice, meaning that the defendant may refile the motion if the procedural requirements are met.
