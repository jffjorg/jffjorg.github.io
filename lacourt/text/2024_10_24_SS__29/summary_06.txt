And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic School and the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, have filed a motion to continue the trial in this case. The trial was originally set for January 10, 2025, but the defendants want to delay it so that their motion for summary judgment can be heard first. The judge has considered the motion and believes that the defendants have shown good cause for the continuance. Therefore, the judge grants the motion and continues the trial to a date on or after July 15, 2025. The judge also resets the final status conference and all deadlines based on the new trial date.
