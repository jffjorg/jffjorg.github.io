Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motions to compel compliance with subpoenas for business records served on three nonparty deponents, Dr. Susan Mandel, Therese Moriarty, Psy.D., and Dr. Jacob Tauber. The defendants had sought to compel the deponents to produce business records related to the plaintiff's treating physicians. The court found that the service of the motions on the nonparty deponents was improper, as they were served by overnight mail rather than personal service. The court also noted that the proof of service on the subpoena directed to Dr. Jacob Tauber was not completed or signed. As a result, the motions to compel are denied without prejudice.
