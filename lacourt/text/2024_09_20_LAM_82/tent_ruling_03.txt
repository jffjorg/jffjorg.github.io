INTRODUCTION 
 
            Petitioner Ecobat Resources
California, Inc. (“Petitioner”) operates a battery recycling facility and
received a “temporary authorization” from the California Department of Toxic
Substances Control (the “Department” or “DTSC”) to use new equipment in its
operations.  DTSC found that the dewatering equipment “will facilitate
the protection of human health and the environment before action is likely to
be taken on a modification request” and will allow Petitioner “to better and
more safely manage its wastes without the delay associated with a permit
modification request, public comment period, and final decision, which could
take between 6 months and a year from start to finish.”  (45 AR 943-944.)  DTSC also found that there was compliance
with the California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”).  (45 AR 944.) 
The Board did not conclude that these findings were clearly erroneously,
so they are not at issue in this proceeding. 

 
Rather, the real party in interest, Clean Air Coalition of
North Whittier and Avocado Heights (“Real Party” or “CAC”), appealed the
decision to the Board of Environmental Safety (“Respondent” or the “Board”)
challenging the propriety of issuing a temporary authorization in this case.  The Board found that DTSC erred in doing so, concluding
that the need for a “rapid response” to address
“pressing conditions at the facility is a necessary element for issuance of the
temporary authorization under the applicable regulation.  The Board also found that the DTSC must make
“a fact-specific justification based on particular facts that distinguished the
Ecobat facility from every other facility that is subject to hazardous waste
permitting requirements.”  (AR
4385.)  Therefore, the Board granted
the appeal and vacated the decision to issue the temporary authorization.  Petitioner now challenges that decision of
the Board. 
 
The court finds
that the Board erred in its interpretation of the applicable regulation governing
the issuance of temporary authorizations. 
The regulation requires DTSC to find that the temporary authorization is
“necessary” to implement corrective action or protect health and the
environment “before action is likely to be taken on a modification
request.”  This plain language controls,
not the Board’s interpretation of these requirements.  Therefore, the court issues the writ directing the
Board to set aside its decision and Final Order dated December 19, 2023, and to
reconsider the case in light of the court’s opinion and judgment.  The court takes no position on how the Board
exercises its discretion, per Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5(f).   
BACKGROUND 
 
A.        Petitioner’s Facility
 
Petitioner,
formerly known as Quemetco, Inc., operates a battery recycling facility in the
City of Industry (the “Facility”).  (Petition
for Writ of Mandate (“Pet.”) ¶ 12; Board Answer 
¶ 12; CAC Answer ¶
12; see also 164 AR 4380.)[1]  “The Facility recycles lead-acid batteries
from vehicles in order to reclaim materials for reuse in new batteries and
other products.”  (Pet. ¶ 12; Board
Answer ¶ 12; CAC Answer ¶ 12.)  “The
Facility’s recycling process generates lead-bearing materials saturated with
liquids, all of which are regulated as hazardous waste.”  (Pet. 
¶ 25; CAC Ans. ¶
25; see also 2 AR 558-560.)  The
Facility stores liquid hazardous lead waste battery wrecker material in a
containment building referred to as the “batch house.” (2 AR 558 [description
of containment building in draft permit dated June 2001]; 29 AR 736.)  
 
B.        DTSC Enforcement
Proceedings 
 
DTSC inspected the
Facility between 2015 and 2017 and cited Petitioner for violations of California’s
Hazardous Waste Control Law (“HWCL”) related to the batch house, including: 
(1) a
non-functioning leak-detection system in the batch house, (2) failure to
construct an adequate groundwater monitoring system, and (3) failure to
minimize the possibility of releases of hazardous lead into the environment.  (See 83 AR 2344-45 [Press Release]; see
also 70 AR 1989-93; 72 AR 2019-21; 79 AR 2282-83; and 81 AR 2302-04
[Statements of Violations] and 75 AR 2030-31 [Enforcement Order].)  In 2018, DTSC filed
a civil complaint against Petitioner for 29 alleged violations of the HWCL identified
during these inspections.  (83 AR 2344-45; 82
AR 2305-43.)  
 
In a Final
Judgment for Civil Penalties and Permanent Injunction on Consent in December
2022, Petitioner agreed to undertake certain “Batch House Corrective Measures,”
including “to install a new primary and secondary barrier and leak detection
system for the Batch House.”  (87 AR 2397-2416
[Final Judgment].)  As relevant to this
writ petition, Petitioner also “submitted a request for temporary authorization
and an application for permit modification for authorization to operate a
compression auger and centrifuge, which [Petitioner] anticipates will
significantly reduce the amount of hazardous liquids entering the Batch House
and thus reduce the need for secondary containment with leak detection.”  (87 AR 2404-05.)  The court, like the parties, hereafter refers
to the compression auger and centrifuge described in this corrective measure as
“dewatering equipment.”  (See Opening
Brief (“OB”) 8-9; Board Oppo. 8-9.)[2]
 


 
C.        Regulatory
Process for Permit Modifications and Temporary Authorizations 
 
DTSC determines
whether to issue operating permits and permit modifications for facilities
managing hazardous wastes.  (Health &
Safety Code § 25201(a); Cal. Code Regs. (hereafter “CCR”), tit. 22, §
66270.42.)  Permit modifications range
from Class 1 (least significant) to Class 3 (most significant). (22 CCR §
66270.42(a)-(c).)  Outside of the permit
modification process, a regulated facility may apply for a temporary
authorization. (Id. 
§ 66270.42(e)).  A temporary authorization is limited to 180
days but may be extended for another 180 days if the operator applies for a
Class 2 or 3 modification. (Id. § 66270.42(e)(1) & (4).)  To
issue a temporary authorization, DTSC “shall” make the following findings: 
 
(A) the authorized activities are in compliance with the
standards of chapter 14 of this division;
 
(B) the temporary authorization is exempt from the
requirements of CEQA under Title 14,
CCR section 15061, or the
applicable requirements of CEQA have been met with respect to the temporary
authorization;
 
(C) the temporary authorization is necessary to
achieve one of the following objectives before action is likely to be taken on
a modification request:
 
1. to facilitate timely implementation of closure or
corrective action activities;
 
2. to allow treatment or storage in tanks,
containers, or in containment buildings in accordance with chapter 18 of this
division;
 
3. to prevent disruption of ongoing waste management
activities;
 
4. to enable the permittee to respond to sudden
changes in the types or quantities of the wastes managed under the facility
permit; or
 
5. to facilitate other changes to protect human
health and the environment.
 
(22 Cal. Code Regs. § 66270.42(e)(3).)
 
            The Board
was established by the California Legislature in 2021 to “hear and decide”
appeals of hazardous waste facility permit decisions of DTSC.  (Health & Safety Code § 25125.2(b).)  The pertinent regulations describe the
Board’s standard of review, in relevant part, as follows: 
 
(c) Decision on the
Merits.  The Board shall decide the issues raised in the petition and
accepted for review pursuant to subsection (b) of this section at a public
hearing conducted pursuant to article 10 of chapter 4.5 of division 3 of title
2 of the Government Code.  The appellant shall bear the burden at
the hearing to establish that the Department's final permit decision is based
upon one or more of the following:
 
(1) a finding of fact
or conclusion of law which is clearly erroneous; or
 
(2) an abuse of
discretion concerning an exercise of discretion or an important policy
consideration within the Board’s jurisdiction, which the Board should, in its
discretion, review; or 
 
(3) A significant
procedural error, including but not limited to a failure to proceed in a manner
that is required by law or regulation.   
 
(d) Final
Order…. If the Board concludes that the appellant has satisfied its burden as
set forth in subsection (c) of this section, it shall grant the petition, and
enter an order vacating and setting aside the final permit decision in full or
in part ….
 
(22 Cal. Code Regs. § 66271.72(c) & (d).)  
 
D.        The First
Temporary Authorization Application 
 
In February 2021, Petitioner submitted its first application
for a temporary authorization to operate the dewatering equipment.  DTSC granted the application in April
2021.  (25 AR 721.)  CAC appealed that decision.  (48 AR 1058.) 
On January 26, 2022, the permit appeals officer vacated DTCS’s decision.  The permit appeals officer reasoned, in
pertinent part, as follows: 
 
Considering
that the Facility has been placing hazardous waste containing free liquids on
the floor of the containment building since at least 2001, [Petitioner] has not
explained why a temporary authorization is necessary [before action is likely
to be taken on a modification request] for the addition of the two new
miscellaneous units.
 
(29 AR 735-736.)
 
E.         Petitioner’s
Application for a Class 2 Permit Modification 
 
In August 2021, while the first temporary authorization
application was pending, Petitioner submitted a Class 2 permit modification
request to operate the dewatering equipment on a permanent basis.  (135 AR 2952-53.)  After a public comment period and public
meeting, DTSC granted the Class 2 modification. 
(Ibid.)  On March 28, 2022,
CAC appealed that decision.  (AR 137 AR
3718-3726.)  On June 24, 2022, Petitioner
withdrew its request for the Class 2 permit modification “to voluntarily
resubmit permit modification requests to DTSC that proactively address the
arguments raised by Earthjustice in their previous appeals of the Dewatering
Project.”  (51 AR 1245-49.)   
 
F.         The Second Temporary
Authorization Application 
 
Petitioner submitted a second application for a temporary
authorization on June 9, 2022.  Petitioner’s
second application spanned 169 pages and included detailed technical materials,
including: (1) engineering schematics of the equipment; (2) a flow diagram
depicting the location of the dewatering equipment within the battery wrecker
process; and (3) field data from another of Petitioner’s facilities “demonstrating
the effectiveness of the Compression Auger and Centrifuge’s treatment.”  (See 50 AR 1077-1081, 1088-1093,
1227-1244.)  Petitioner also explained,
in some detail, why Petitioner contends that a temporary authorization is
necessary to achieve the regulatory objectives of section 66270.42(e)(3)(C)(1)
and (5), specifically “to facilitate timely implementation of corrective action
activities …, and to facilitate changes to protect human health and the
environment,” before action is likely to be taken
on a request for a permanent modification. 
(50 AR 1081-84.)
 
In July 2022, DTSC approved Petitioner’s second application
for a temporary authorization.   (45 AR
942.)  DTSC explained its decision, in
pertinent part, as follows: 
 
…. [T]he
purpose of the Miscellaneous Units is to eliminate free liquids from the
hazardous waste that is stored on the floor of the Containment Building. The
presence of free liquids requires the Containment Building to operate with
containment and leak detection systems that if failed could potentially result
in hazardous liquids coming into contact with groundwater beneath the facility.
The compression auger will compress waste received from the sink float tank
(WSF-1) before sending it to the centrifuge. The centrifuge will then spin the
waste to remove any residual liquids before the waste is placed in the
Containment Building. Residual liquids collected by the centrifuge will drain
to a reactor tank (DR-3) or to the battery wrecker sump (WS-1). 
 
The
Miscellaneous Units will allow the facility to improve the removal of liquids
from wrecker material via a controlled process in an enclosed transfer system,
such that all free liquids will be removed from the wrecker material prior to
storage in the Containment Building. The removal of free liquids from the
Containment Building results in a significant environmental improvement to the
storage and treatment of the wrecker material, minimizing the risk of a release
from the Containment Building, and resulting in a clear benefit to human health
and environment. The Miscellaneous Units will also help address violations
related to the Containment Building’s leak detection system. 
 
In
accordance with section 66270.42(e)(3) of title 22 of the California Code of
Regulations (CCR), DTSC finds … the changes will facilitate the protection of
human health and the environment before action is likely to be taken on a
modification request. DTSC hereby approves your temporary authorization request….
[¶]
 
DTSC
concludes that approving [Petitioner’s] Temporary Authorization request is
necessary before action is likely to be taken on a modification request…. At any time during
the operating life of a facility, new technologies or methods may become
available that allow a hazardous waste facility to operate in a more protective
manner. Facilities have the option of requesting such changes via a Temporary
Authorization before a Permit Modification is requested and processed. The
addition of the Miscellaneous Units above will allow [Petitioner] to better and
more safely manage its wastes without the delay associated with a permit
modification request, public comment period, and final decision, which could
take between 6 months and a year from start to finish. Thus, to support DTSC’s
mission, the Miscellaneous Units are necessary to be installed and operated at
least temporarily before action is likely taken on a modification request. 
 
(45 AR 942-944.)
 
G.        The Board’s
Decision 
 
CAC appealed
DTSC’s decision to grant the second temporary authorization application.  (52 AR 1250-1257.)  The Board considered the appeal at its public
meeting held on November 29, 2023.  (162
AR 3995-4375 [transcript of Board meeting].) 
At the meeting, the Board voted, four members to one, to grant CAC’s
appeal and vacate the temporary authorization on the grounds that DTSC’s
decision “was clearly erroneous because there was not enough evidence to
establish the necessity of a rapid response.” 
(162 AR 4273-74; 164 AR 4382.)  
 
In its Final Order
issued December 19, 2023, the Board made the following relevant findings: 
 
3. … Section 66270.42 of Division 4.5 of the Title 22
Regulations is California’s counterpart to the Federal Regulation found at
Section 270.42 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations. In adopting its
version of the regulation, California chose to adopt a conforming regulation,
which used identical language in many respects, including with respect to the
element of necessity for issuance of the Temporary Authorization…. Since
precisely the same language appears in both the state and federal regulations, guidance
issued by the federal government explaining the meaning of the words chosen in
the federal regulation is helpful for gaining a better understanding of the
meaning of the identical language in the California regulation. According to
the United States Environmental Protection Agency, a temporary authorization is
a procedural device allowing the facility operator to make a “rapid response”
to pressing conditions at the facility.
 
4. … In line with the underlying purpose of a
temporary authorization, to allow the facility operator to make a “rapid
response” to particular conditions, DTSC was required to find that the
dewatering project addressed an issue at the facility with enough urgency to
justify abridging the ordinary permit modification process and the standard
delays it entailed…. CAC showed that DTSC had already issued a Class 2
Modification for the dewatering project, which Ecobat withdrew after that
decision was appealed by CAC…. Thus, DTSC could not support its finding based
on the need to avoid permitting delay, having issued a modification for the
same equipment only a few months before. It was therefore clearly erroneous for
DTSC to find that granting the Temporary Authorization was necessary before
action could be taken on a modification.
 
….[¶¶]
 
9. In her motion to grant the appeal, Member Bhatia
cited the need for a rapid response as a necessary element for issuance of the
Temporary Authorization. Such an element gives effect to the language in
Section 66270.42(e)(3)(C) requiring DTSC to find that the Temporary
Authorization is “necessary to achieve [an objective] before action is likely
to be taken on a modification request.” This finding of an element of necessity
requires a showing of particular circumstances distinguishing Ecobat from other
permit applicants similarly situated. The justifications offered by DTSC in
defense of the Decision did not support such a finding. The existence of a need
for corrective action, while not common, does not make the Ecobat facility
unique among permitted facilities. Similarly, the problem of permitting delay
confronts every permitted facility, and can be exacerbated by the inability of
facility operators to satisfy applicable requirements in a timely and diligent
manner. While regrettable, the delays lamented by DTSC and Ecobat allow for
public participation, which serves important public functions of informing
community members and ensuring that decisions of the Department take community
concerns into account. The Board views these permitting functions to have
particular value for those facilities, like Ecobat, which experience high
amounts of community opposition.
 
10. Because it allowed Ecobat to avoid the standard
process of public review inherent in the permit modification process, DTSC’s
Decision to grant the Temporary Authorization required a facility-specific
justification based on particular facts that distinguished the Ecobat facility from
every other facility that is subject to hazardous waste permitting
requirements. After holding a public hearing, a majority of the Board found
that the Department failed to identify such facts in its Decision, and on that
basis the Board determined that the Decision was clearly erroneous.
 
(164 AR
4383-4385.)  
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Because Board’s
decision is quasi-judicial in nature, and follows an administrative hearing
required by law (see 22 Cal. Code Regs. § 66271.72(c)), the petition is
governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5.  (See Bunnett v. Regents of University of California (1995) 35
Cal.App.4th 843, 848.)  Under section
1094.5(b), an abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not
proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not supported by the
findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(b).)[3]
 
 “In
an administrative writ proceeding that, like this one, does not involve a
fundamental vested right, the trial court reviews the agency’s factual findings
for substantial evidence and its legal conclusions de novo.”  (Reznitskiy v. County of Marin (2022)
79 Cal.App.5th 1016, 1023; accord E.W.A.P.,
Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 310, 325.)  Substantial evidence is relevant evidence
that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion (California Youth Authority v. State
Personnel Board (2002) 104 Cal. App. 4th 575, 584-85), or evidence of
ponderable legal significance which is reasonable in nature, credible, and of
solid value. (Mohilef v. Janovici (1996)
51 Cal. App. 4th 267, 305 n. 28.)  “Courts
may reverse an [administrative] decision only if, based on the evidence …, a
reasonable person could not reach the conclusion reached by the agency.”  (Sierra
Club v. California Coastal Com. (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 602, 610.)   
 
However, on
questions of law arising in mandate proceedings, the court exercises
independent judgment and conducts a de novo review.  (Christensen
v. Lightbourne (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.)  The interpretation of statute or regulation
is a question of law.  (See State Farm
Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Quackenbush (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65, 77.)
 
EVIDENTIARY ISSUES 
 
            The Board’s
objection to the declaration of Mark Hoffman is sustained.  “As a general rule, a hearing on a writ of
administrative mandamus is conducted solely on the record of the proceeding
before the administrative agency.”  (Richardson v. City and County of
San Francisco (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 671, 702.)  “[E]xtra-record evidence can never be
admitted merely to contradict the evidence the administrative agency relied on
… or to raise a question regarding the wisdom of that decision.”  (Western States Petroleum Assn. v. Sup.Ct.
(1995) 9 Cal.4th 559, 579.)  Although there is a procedure for augmenting the administrative
record, Petitioner did not file a motion or demonstrate that the requirements
of section 1094.5(e) are satisfied.  Petitioner
argues that the Hoffman declaration is relevant to prove its “beneficial interest.”
 (See OB 13:4 and Petitioner’s
Response to Board’s Evidentiary Objection.) 
Neither CAC nor the Board have raised any argument concerning
Petitioner’s standing and, therefore, the Hoffman declaration is not relevant
for the purpose asserted by Petitioner.  
 
            The court
grants Petitioner’s requests for judicial notice, dated July 24 and September
6, 2024.  Respondent does not object to
these requests, though the exhibits do not appear relevant to the issue before
this court.  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
A.        Scope of Review 
 
1.         There is only one issue on review, one
of statutory interpretation   
 
At the outset, the court defines the issues for judicial review.  The Board found that the DTSC’s decision was “clearly
erroneous” under section 66271.72(c)(1). 
The Board found that the DTSC erred in issuing the temporary
authorization because the need for a “rapid response” is a necessary element
for issuance of the temporary authorization under section 66270.42(e)(3)(C).  Specifically, the DTSC must make “a
fact-specific justification based on particular facts that distinguished the
Ecobat facility from every other facility that is subject to hazardous waste
permitting requirements.”  (AR 4385.)  This is the issue on review. 
 


 
2.         The Board cannot re-write its
decision and create new grounds 
In opposition, counsel for the Board argues (unpersuasively)
that the Board also found that DTSC committed “an abuse of discretion concerning an exercise of discretion
or an important policy consideration within the Board’s jurisdiction,” within
the meaning of section 66271.72(c)(2).  (See
Board Oppo. 17-19, Sec. II.)  CAC
does not appear to join this argument and only argues that the Board found that
DTSC’s decision to issue the temporary authorization was “clearly
erroneous.”  (See CAC Oppo.
7:11-12.)  The Board improperly redefines
its decision, after the fact, to include a finding under section 66271.72(c)(2).  CAC did not appeal on this ground, see 52 AR 1250-1257, and the Board’s
decision below was limited to whether DTSC committed “clear error” within
respect to conclusions of law.  The Board
fails to show that its arguments concerning an alleged abuse of discretion
under section 66271.72(c)(2) can be raised for the first time on writ
review.  
 
3.         DTSC found that the dewatering
equipment protects the environment  
 
As quoted above, DTSC made findings of fact regarding the
dewatering equipment, its beneficial impact on the Facility, and its protection
of human health and the environment.  (164
AR 943-944.)  DTSC found that the
dewatering equipment “will facilitate the protection of human health and the
environment before action is likely to be taken on a modification request” and
will allow Petitioner “to better and more safely manage its wastes without the
delay associated with a permit modification request, public comment period, and
final decision, which could take between 6 months and a year from start to
finish.”  (Ibid.)  In its decision on appeal, the Board did not
conclude that these factual findings in DTSC’s decision were “clearly
erroneous” or were not supported by substantial evidence in the administrative
record.  (164 AR 4380-85.)  Therefore, these findings are not at issue in
this proceeding.
 
                        4.         DTSC
found that there was compliance with CEQA 
 
In its decision on the second application for a temporary
authorization, dated July 22, 2022, DTSC found “the activities in the temporary
authorization request to be in compliance with the standards of CCR, title 22,
division 4.5, chapter 14.”  (45 AR
943.)  DTSC stated that, to comply with
CEQA, a final environmental impact report had been filed.  (45 AR 944.)  In its decision, the Board did not conclude
that these findings in DTSC’s decision were “clearly erroneous” or did not
satisfy the requirements to obtain temporary authorization under section
66270.42(e)(3)(A) and (B).  (164 AR
4380-85.)  Therefore, these findings are
not at issue in this proceeding.
 
B.        Interpretation
of Section 66270.42(e)(3)
 
At the Board
hearing on November 29, 2023, the Board voted to grant a motion to vacate the
temporary authorization on the grounds that DTSC’s decision “was clearly
erroneous because there was not enough evidence to establish the necessity of a
rapid response.”  (162 AR 4273-74.)  In its Final Order issued December 19, 2023,
the Board made that same finding, that the DTSC must find a “necessity of a
rapid response” in order to address “pressing conditions at the facility.”  (AR 4383-4385.)  The Board also found that DTSC failed to
provide “a facility-specific justification based on particular facts that
distinguished the Ecobat facility from every other facility that is subject to
hazardous waste permitting requirements.”  (164 AR 4384-85.)  Petitioner contends that the Board erred
because it “imposed requirements found nowhere in the plain language of the
applicable regulation.”  (OB 7:13-14; see
also OB 13-15, 17-18 and Reply 15-18.) 
Thus, the court must decide the proper interpretation of section
66270.42(e)(3)(C) of DTSC’s regulations. 

 
1.         The rules of statutory construction  
 
The rules governing the interpretation of statutes and regulations are well-settled
and clear:    
 
We begin with the
fundamental premise that the objective of statutory interpretation is to
ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.  To determine legislative intent, we turn first
to the words of the statute, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.  When the language of a statute is clear, we
need go no further. However, when the language is susceptible of more than one
reasonable interpretation, we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including
the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to be remedied, the
legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous administrative
construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.  
 
(Nolan v. City of Anaheim (2004)
33 Cal.4th 335, 340, citations omitted.) 
These same rules apply to the interpretation of a regulation.  (County of Sacramento v. State Water
Resources Control Board (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1579, 1586.)  “When
interpreting statutory language, we may neither insert language which has been
omitted nor ignore language which has been inserted.”  (See People
v. National Auto. and Cas. Ins. Co. (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 277, 282.)  “[I]nterpretations which render any part of a statute [or
regulation] superfluous are to be avoided.”  (Young v. McCoy (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
1078, 1083.)  
            
In interpreting statutes or regulations an administrative agency is
responsible for enforcing, the court exercises its independent judgment, “taking
into account and respecting the agency’s interpretation of its meaning.”  (Housing
Partners I, Inc. v. Duncan (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1335, 1343; see also Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. Of
Equalization (1998) 19 Cal.4th 1, 11.) 
How much weight to
accord an agency’s construction is “situational,” and depends on the
circumstances.  (See American Coatings Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist. (2012)
54 Cal.4th 446, 461-462.)  
 
2.         The plain language of the regulation 
 
Section 66270.42(e)(3)(C) states that in order to issue a temporary
authorization, DTSC must find that “the temporary authorization is necessary to
achieve one of the following objectives before action is likely to be taken on
a modification request,” i.e., before DTSC makes a final decision on the
dewatering equipment.  (22 Cal. Code
Regs. § 66270.42(e)(3)(C).)  The
regulation states that the temporary authorization must be necessary to: (1) “facilitate
the timely implementation of closure or corrective action activities;” (2) “allow
treatment or storage in tanks, containers, or in containment buildings;” (3)
“prevent disruption of ongoing waste management activities;” (4) “enable the
permittee to respond to sudden changes in the types or quantities of wastes
managed under the facility permit; or (5) “facilitate other changes to protect
health and the environment.”  (Ibid.)  This plain language is clear, and the Board’s
two additional requirements are not contained within the regulation.  
 
                        a.         “Rapid response”
 
The regulation does not require DTSC to find a need for a “rapid
response” in order to address “pressing conditions at the facility.”  This does not mean there are no exigency or
timing requirements in the statute.  To
the contrary.  In order to issue a
temporary authorization, DTSC must find that the temporary authorization is
“necessary” to achieve one of the objectives before any decision “is likely to
be made on a modification request,” i.e., it is “necessary” to implement
corrective action or protect health and the environment before any decision is
likely to be made on the request. 
Similarly, DTSC must find that the temporary authorization is
“necessary” to facilitate the “timely implementation” of corrective action, i.e.,
the corrective action must occur before the permitting process will
conclude.  
 
The court acknowledges that these requirements may appear identical to
the Board’s interpretation, and that the Board may have intended to communicate
the same thing as the court.  But there
is a subtle difference between the Board’s phraseology and the regulation’s
plain language.  The “rapid response”
requirement has no objective definition. 
When interpreting a statute or regulation, the court may not “insert
language which has been omitted.”  (See People v. National Auto. and Cas. Ins. Co. (2002)
98 Cal.App.4th 277, 282.)  By contrast, the
regulation defines exigency.  There is
exigency when the temporary authorization is “necessary” to implement
corrective action or to protect health and the environment before the
permitting process will conclude.  
 
                        b.         “A facility-specific justification”
 
The regulation
does not require DTSC to provide “a facility-specific justification based on
particular facts that distinguished the Ecobat facility from every other
facility that is subject to hazardous waste permitting requirements.”  Again, this requirement is contained within
the plain language of the regulation, i.e., DTSC must make findings why
the conditions at the particular facility are such it is necessary to take
action “before action is likely to be taken on a modification request.”  But again, there is a difference between the
Board’s phraseology and the regulation’s plain language.  The Board’s interpretation would require DTSC
to find that the facility is truly unique compared to every other
facility.  That is not the
requirement.  DTSC need only find that the
specific circumstances at the facility are such that action is necessary to
implement timely corrective actions or protect health and the environment
before the permitting process would conclude (without regard to whether other
facilities are in the same position).  
 
3.         Legislative history and other extrinsic
aids
 
The court does not
find section 66270.42(e)(3)(C) to be ambiguous, so
the court need not consider the legislative history or other extrinsic
aids.  Nevertheless, the legislative
history and other extrinsic aids support the court’s view that there is an
exigency requirement, as defined by the regulation, i.e., DTSC must find
that action is necessary before the permitting process would conclude.     
 
The Board and the CAC quote certain statements from the federal
rulemaking history for 40
C.F.R. section 270.42(e), on which section
66270.42 is modeled.  (CAC Oppo. 17;
Board Oppo. 7, 14-15.)  The federal
rulemaking history summarizes the purposes of temporary authorizations, as
follows: 
 
Today’s rule provides
the Agency with the authority to grant a permittee temporary authorization,
without prior public notice and comment, to conduct activities necessary to
respond promptly to changing conditions.  (See § 270.42(e).)  It is expected that temporary authorizations
will be useful in the following two situations: (1) To address a one-time or
short-term activity at a facility for which the full permit modification
process is inappropriate; or (2) to allow a facility to initiate a necessary
activity while its permit modification request is undergoing the Class 2 or 3
review process…. An Agency-issued temporary authorization may be obtained for
activities that are necessary to: (i) Facilitate timely implementation of
closure or corrective action activities; (ii) allow treatment or storage in
tanks or containers of restricted wastes in accordance with Part 268; (iii)
avoid disrupting ongoing waste management activities at the permittee's
facility; (iv) enable the permittee to respond to changes in the types or
quantities of wastes being managed under the facility permit; or (v) carry out
other changes to protect human health and the environment.  
 
(47 AR 1016.)  The Board argues
that federal temporary authorizations were developed “to allow a rapid
response” and to “conduct activities necessary to respond promptly to changing conditions.”
(Board Oppo. 14:23-24, quoting 53 Fed.Reg. at pp. 37919-20.)  The Board reads too much into the quoted statements.  The federal rulemaking uses the phrase
“rapid response” once and in a general section discussing the purpose of
temporary authorizations. (47 AR 1017 [“Given that temporary authorizations
were developed to allow a rapid response without the limitations of a formal
permit modification….”].)  The federal
rulemaking also states, in a general discussion, that a temporary authorization
is intended to allow the permittee “to conduct activities necessary to respond
promptly to changing conditions.”  (47 AR
1016.)  The rulemaking does not state
that a “need for a rapid response” is a required finding to grant a temporary
authorization.  The
discussion of temporary authorizations from the federal rulemaking is
consistent with the plain language of section 66270.42(e)(3)(C), as discussed.  It does not provide any reason to interpret
the state regulation to include the additional requirements found by the Board
in its decision.
(162 AR 4273-74; 164 AR 4384-85.)   
 
                        4.         The amount of deference owed to the
Board
 
The amount of dereference to an
agency’s interpretation of a statute or regulation is situational.  (American
Coatings Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist. (2012) 54
Cal.4th 446, 461-462.) 
Greater weight may be appropriate when an agency has a “comparative
interpretative advantage over the courts,” e.g., when the regulation is
“technical, obscure, complex, open-ended, entwined with issues of fact, policy,
and discretion.”  (Ibid., citation
omitted.)  Additionally, “consistent administrative
construction of a statute [or regulation], especially when it originates with
an agency that is charged with putting the statutory machinery into effect, is
accorded great weight.’”  (Ste. Marie v. Riverside County Regional Park
& Open-Space Dist. (2009) 46 Cal.4th 282, 292-293; accord Thornton v.
Carlson
(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1249, 1257.)  
 
Here, the temporary authorization regulation, section 66270.42, was
promulgated by DTSC in 1991 pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 25150
and has not been amended since the Board was established in 2021.  (See Credits to § 66270.42 in Barclays
California Code of Regulations, found on Westlaw.)  Given that the Board was established in 2021,
the Board does not show that it has a “consistent administrative construction”
of section 66270.42(e)(3)(C).   Further,
the regulatory language at issue is not “technical, obscure, complex, open-ended, or entwined with
issues of fact, policy, and discretion.” 
The Board does not have a “comparative interpretative advantage over the
courts.”  For these reasons, the Board
and CAC do not show that the Board is entitled to deference in its interpretation
of section 66270.42(e)(3)(C).
 
            5.         Public policy considerations  
 
The court has considered the public policy arguments by the parties, but
none changes the court’s interpretation of the regulation.  To the extent CAC contends that section 66270.42(e)(3)(C)
should include additional requirements, such policy arguments should be
directed at the Legislature, not this court. 

 
            C.        The Parties’ Remaining Contentions 
 
1.         The court reviews the Board’s decision 
 
The parties dispute whether the court reviews the Board’s decision,
DTSC’s permitting decision, or both.   (See
e.g. Board Oppo. 10-12.)  In this
ruling, the court has reviewed the Board’s decision, as that was the final
administrative decision and the one challenged in the petition.  (See § 66271.72(c)-(f).)  
 
            2.         The board did not make additional
findings 
 
The Board argues that “there is substantial evidence that the factual
findings permitting staff made about equipment availability and the permitting
timeline are clearly erroneous.”  (Board
Oppo. 12:21-23.)  In particular, the
Board focuses on DTSC’s allegedly erroneous finding that the dewatering
equipment “will allow [Ecobat] to better and more safely manage its wastes
without the delay associated with a permit modification request . . . .”  (Id. 16:23-26.)  As discussed, in its decision, the Board did
not make any finding that the approval of the temporary authorization was based
on clearly erroneous findings of fact. 
Nor did the Board find that substantial evidence did not support any
factual findings made by the permitting staff with regard to equipment
availability or the permitting timeline. 
In an administrative writ proceeding, the court reviews the findings
that were made by the Board in its administrative decision, not a post hoc rationalization
asserted by the Board’s attorney on writ review.  (See e.g. Motor Vehicle
Mfrs. Assn. v. State Farm Mut. (1983) 463 U.S. 29, 50 [“It is
well-established that an agency's action must be upheld, if at all, on the
basis articulated by the agency itself”]; see also Shenouda v. Veterinary Medical Bd. (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 500, 513 [the petitioner “must identify (with
citations to the record) the factual findings made by the board that he or she
is challenging....”]; Fukuda v. City of
Angels (1999) 20 Cal. 4th 805, 817 [“a trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings”].)
 
            3.         The
Board’s finding that the condition had existed for many years 
 
CAC and the Board cite a discussion between Board members and DTSC’s
representatives regarding evidence that dumping of hazardous liquids on the
floor of the containment building had occurred since at least 2001.  (CAC Oppo. 18-19 and Board Oppo. 16-17; see
e.g. 162 AR 4080-81.)  This
discussion is referenced in special finding 6 of the Board’s decision, which
states in full:
 
6. Board members
questioned DTSC regarding the factual circumstances surrounding the Decision.
Board members noted that the condition of liquid pooling on the floor of the
battery wreaker building had existed for many years. In light of this, Board
members asked DTSC to explain the specific condition that presented itself in
2022 that necessitated a rapid response. DTSC answered this question by
explaining that the problem of liquid pooling on the floor was a significant
concern to DTSC, which they wanted to remedy in as little time as possible.
Further questioning from Board members highlighted that this problem had been
documented in an inspection performed six years earlier, in 2016, but the
dewatering project that Ecobat proposed to address it was not presented to the
Department until 2021.
 
(164 AR 4384.)  
 
      This
finding was relevant to the Board’s determination that DTSC’s
decision “was clearly erroneous because there was not enough evidence to
establish the necessity of a rapid response.” 
(162 AR 4273-74.)  As discussed, the
Board incorrectly interpreted the regulation. 
The correct standard is whether action was necessary to implement
corrective action or protect health or the environment before the permitting
process could conclude.  On remand, the
Board is free to consider this finding in relation to the correct
standard.  
 
                        4.         Petitioner’s withdrawal of the
application for a Class 2 modification 
 
Both CAC and the
Board highlight the fact that Petitioner withdrew its application for a Class 2
modification.  (CAC Oppo. 19-20; Board
Oppo. 17.)  Neither CAC nor the Board has
developed a persuasive argument that Petitioner’s withdrawal of the application
is material to this case.  
 
            D.        The
Remedy
 
            Based upon the foregoing, the court
issues the writ directing the Board to set aside its decision and Final Order dated
December 19, 2023, and to reconsider the case in light of the court’s opinion
and judgment.  (See Code Civ. Proc. §
1094.5(f).)  The court’s judgment
“shall not limit or control in any way the discretion legally vested in the
respondent.”  (Ibid.)  Simply, the court takes no position on the
issue whether the Board issues the same decision to vacate DTSC’s decision to
issue a temporary authorization under the correct standard, or whether the
Board issues a different decision.
 
            Petitioner asks the court to
reinstate the temporary authorization.  This
would not be appropriate at this stage. 
The court merely orders reconsideration under the correct standard
contained in section 66270.42(e)(3).  The
Board may reach the same decision to vacate the DTSC’s issuance of a temporary
authorization.  The court notes that
section 66271.71(a) provides for an automatic stay of the permit decision
pending appeal to the Board.  Therefore,
it would not be appropriate to reinstate the temporary authorization while the
appeal is still pending.    
 
            E.         Declaratory Relief 
 
            Petitioner also seeks
declaratory relief in the prayer for relief. 
(See Pet. Prayer ¶¶ 1-2 and 4.) 
The prayer for declaratory relief is entirely derivative of the writ
cause of action.  The court declines to
issue a declaratory judgment because Petitioner has an adequate remedy in the
writ cause of action.  (See General of
America Ins. Co. v. Lilly (1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 465, 470-471; Hood v.
Sup.Ct. (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 319, 324.)
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER  
 
            Based
upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The court grants the petition for writ
of mandate.
 
            2.         The court directs the Board to set aside its
decision and Final Order dated December 19, 2023, and to reconsider the case in
light of the court’s opinion and judgment. 
(See Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(f).) 
The
court’s judgment “shall not limit or control in any way the discretion legally
vested in the respondent.”  (Ibid.)  Simply, the court takes no position on the
issue whether the Board issues the same decision to vacate DTSC’s decision to
issue a temporary authorization under the correct standard, or whether the
Board issues a different decision.
 
            3.         The
court declines to issue a declaratory judgment. 

 
            4.         The
parties shall meet-and-confer and shall lodge a proposed judgment forthwith.
 
            5.         Petitioner’s
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of service with the court.  
 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED
