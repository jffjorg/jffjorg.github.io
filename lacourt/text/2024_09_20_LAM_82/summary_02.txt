And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a petition for a writ of mandate. The petition was filed by Petitioner, who is seeking access to certain documents. The documents were previously redacted due to attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine. The judge reviewed the unredacted documents and found that every redaction was supported by attorney-client privilege. The judge also found that the redacted communications did not reflect furtherance of any crime or fraud. However, the City objected to the judge's proposed approach of reviewing the privileged communications. The judge rejected Petitioner's argument that the work product doctrine was waived when the redacted communications were disclosed to supervisor Healey. The judge concluded that LADBS properly redacted the information based on the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine.
