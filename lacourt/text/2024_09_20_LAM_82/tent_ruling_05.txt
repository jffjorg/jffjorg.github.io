Order Denying
Petition for Relief from Government Code section 945.6
 
BACKGROUND
 
            Petitioner
Larry Bess (“Petitioner”) alleges that he was involved in a motor vehicle
collision with a school bus owned and operated by the Los Angeles Unified
School District (the “LAUSD”) on June 2, 2023. 
Petitioner filed an untimely government claim on April 15, 2024.  Petitioner did not submit an application for
permission to file a late claim.  Now,
Petitioner seeks relief from the government claim requirement under Government
Code section 945.6.  The petition is
denied because, first, Petitioner did not submit a late-claim application under
Government Code section 911.4, which is jurisdictional, and, second, Petitioner
does not demonstrate excusable neglect under Government Code section
946.6(c)(1).  
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Government Code section 911.2(a)
states that “a claim relating to a cause of action for death or for injury to
person or to personal property . . . shall be presented . . . not later than
six months after the accrual of the cause of action.”  If a claimant fails to make a claim within
six months, the claimant may make a written application to the board of the
public entity for permission to present a late claim within a reasonable time
but not to exceed one year from the accrual of the cause of action.  (Gov. Code § 911.4(a)-(b).)  If, pursuant to the provisions of Government
Code section 911.6, the board denies the application to present a late claim,
the claimant may petition the Court for relief from the requirements of
Government Code section 945.4.  (Gov.
Code § 946.6(a).)
 
Government Code section 946.6(b)
requires that the petition to the court must show each of the following: (1)
that the late claim application made to the board was denied or deemed denied;
(2) the reason for failure to present the claim within six months of the
accrual of the cause of action; and (3) the contents of the claim as required
by Government Code section 910.  The
petition must be filed within six months after the application to present a
late claim to the board was denied or deemed to be denied.  (Ibid.) 

 
The petitioner bears the burden
of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the late-claim application
was made within a reasonable time and that one of the statutory requirements
under Government Code section 946.6(c) was met. 
(Drummond v. County of Fresno
(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1406, 1410.)  Under
section 946.4(e), the trial court must make its determination upon the
petition, “relying upon any affidavits in support of, or in opposition to, the
petition and any additional evidence received at hearing on the petition.”  (Ebersol
v. Cowan (1983) 35 Cal.3d 427, 431.) 

 
DISCUSSION 
 
            A.        Petitioner Did Not Submit a Late-Claim Application

 
            Petitioner
does not allege that he ever submitted an application for permission to file a
late claim, per Government Code section 911.4. 
Nor did he file a reply brief or present rebuttal evidence in response
to Respondent’s opposition on this point. 
This application is a mandatory prerequisite to the instant
petition.  “[F]iling a late-claim
application within one year is a jurisdictional prerequisite to a claim-relief
petition.  (Santee v. Santa Clara
County Office of Educ. (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 702, 713; see also Munoz v.
State of California (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1779.)  Therefore, the petition is denied on this
basis.
 
            B.        Petitioner Does Not Demonstrate
Excusable Neglect
 
            In the
alternative, the petition is denied on the merits because Petitioner does not
demonstrate mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, as required
by Government Code section 946.6(c)(1). 
Simply, Petitioner articulates no facts and provides no declarations
establishing this requirement. 
Petitioner merely argues that he retained counsel on October 30, 2023,
shortly before the six-month deadline, but he articulates no reasons why the
claim could not have been submitted between October 30, 2023, and December 2,
2023.  
 
            C.        Petitioner Does Not Demonstrate any
Tolling of the Statute 
 
            Petitioner
argues that the Governor issued the following executive orders relating to the
pandemic: (1) Executive Order N-35-20 on March 21, 2020, which extended the
time to present a government claim by 60 days; (2) Executive Order N-65-20 on
May 19, 2020, which extended the time to present a government claim by 60 days;
and (3) Executive Order N-71-20 on June 30, 2020, which extended the time to
present a government claim by 60 days. 
 
            Plaintiff
cites no authority suggesting these executive orders are still in effect, over
four years later.  Rather, the executive
orders have long expired.  Executive
Order N-35-20 extended the government claims deadline by 60 days.  Then, Executive Order N-65-20 stated: “The
time frame set forth in Executive Order N-35-20, Paragraph 11, is extended for
an additional 60 days from the date of this Order.”  That executive order was dated May 19, 2020,
meaning that the 60-day extension was in effect until Saturday, July 18, 2020
(or Monday, July 20, 2020).  Then, Executive
Order N-71-20 stated that this paragraph in Executive Order N-65-20 was “withdrawn
and superseded by the following text: The timeframes set forth in Executive
Order N-35-20, Paragraph 11, are extended by an additional 60 days.”  That executive order was dated June 30, 2020,
meaning that the 60-day extension was in effect until Saturday, August 29, 2020
(or Monday, August 31, 2020).  Putting
aside the plain language of these executive orders, the Governor issued a
proclamation terminating the state of emergency on February 28, 2023.  Petitioner’s motor vehicle collision occurred
on June 2, 2023.  Finally, even if
Petitioner was entitled to a 60-day extension of his deadline to submit a
government claim, this would have only extended the deadline from December 2,
2023, to February 2, 2024.  Petitioner
did not submit a government claim until April 15, 2024. 
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Based upon the foregoing, the court
orders as follows:
 
            1.         Petitioner’s petition for relief from Government
Code section 945.6 is denied.
 
            2.         Either party may lodge a proposed
judgment if necessary.
 
            3.         The court’s clerk shall provide notice.
 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED
