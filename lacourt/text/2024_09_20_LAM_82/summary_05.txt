And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling denies Petitioner Larry Bess's request for relief from the government claim requirement under Government Code section 945.6. The Petitioner was involved in a motor vehicle collision with a school bus owned and operated by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) on June 2, 2023. However, he did not submit an application for permission to file a late claim and instead filed an untimely government claim on April 15, 2024. The Court finds that the Petitioner did not demonstrate excusable neglect and did not meet the jurisdictional requirements for a late claim. Additionally, the Court concludes that the Petitioner did not demonstrate tolling of the statute, as the executive orders extending the deadline for filing a government claim have long expired. The Court orders that the petition for relief from Government Code section 945.6 be denied.
