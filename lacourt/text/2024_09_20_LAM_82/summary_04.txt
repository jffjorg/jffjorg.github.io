And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a petition filed by an unknown party. The petition raises legal questions about the construction of sections 66270.42 and 66271.72 of certain regulations. The court will review the petition de novo, regardless of whether it is governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 or section 1094.5. The administrative record, which consists of 164 volumes, was prepared and includes information about the dewatering equipment used (also referred to as "miscellaneous units"). The court notes that the petition does not require an "evidentiary hearing" and will construe the regulations accordingly. The judge cites a previous case, Christensen v. Lightbourne, to support this conclusion.
