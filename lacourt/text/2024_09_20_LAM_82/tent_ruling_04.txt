alternative, even if the Board was not required to hold an “evidentiary
hearing” and the petition is instead governed by Code of Civil Procedure
section 1085, the court reaches the same result in this case.   The
petition raises purely legal questions concerning the proper construction of
sections 66270.42 and 66271.72 of the pertinent regulations.  The court reviews those questions de novo regardless
of whether the writ petition is governed by section 1085 or section
1094.5.  (See Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.)
