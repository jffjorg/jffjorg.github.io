**Case Information**

* Case Number: 24STCP00282
* Hearing Date: September 20, 2024
* Dept: 82
* Judge: Stephen I. Goorvitch

**Parties**

* Ecobat Resources California, Inc. (Petitioner)
* Board of Environmental Safety (Respondent)
* Clean Air Coalition of North Whittier and Avocado Heights (Real Party, CAC)

**Facts**

* Ecobat Resources California, Inc. operates a battery recycling facility in the City of Industry.
* The facility generates lead-bearing materials saturated with liquids, which are regulated as hazardous waste.
* The facility stores liquid hazardous lead waste battery wrecker material in a containment building referred to as the "batch house".
* In 2018, DTSC filed a civil complaint against Ecobat Resources California, Inc. for 29 alleged violations of the HWCL.
* In December 2022, Ecobat Resources California, Inc. agreed to undertake certain "Batch House Corrective Measures".

**Regulations**

* California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 4.5, Chapter 14 (CCR)
* Section 66270.42(e)(3) of the CCR requires DTSC to find that a temporary authorization is "necessary to achieve one of the following objectives before action is likely to be taken on a modification request":
	+ To facilitate timely implementation of closure or corrective action activities
	+ To allow treatment or storage in tanks, containers, or in containment buildings in accordance with chapter 18 of this division
	+ To prevent disruption of ongoing waste management activities
	+ To enable the permittee to respond to sudden changes in the types or quantities of the wastes managed under the facility permit
	+ To facilitate other changes to protect human health and the environment

**Board's Decision**

* The Board granted CAC's appeal and vacated the temporary authorization on the grounds that DTSC's decision was "clearly erroneous" because there was not enough evidence to establish the necessity of a rapid response.
* The Board found that DTSC failed to provide a facility-specific justification based on particular facts that distinguished Ecobat Resources California, Inc. from every other facility that is subject to hazardous waste permitting requirements.

**Court's Ruling**

* The court finds that the Board erred in its interpretation of section 66270.42(e)(3)(C) of the CCR.
* The court holds that the regulation requires DTSC to find a "necessity of a rapid response" in order to address "pressing conditions at the facility".
* The court concludes that the Board's decision is not supported by the evidence and is an abuse of discretion.

**Intentions**

* The court's intention is to effectuate the legislative intent and to ensure that the regulation is interpreted in a way that is consistent with the plain language of the statute.

**Significant Statements**

* "The courts may reverse an administrative decision only if, based on the evidence ..., a reasonable person could not reach the conclusion reached by the agency." (Sierra Club v. California Coastal Com.)
* "When interpreting statutory language, we may neither insert language which has been omitted nor ignore language which has been inserted." (People v. National Auto. and Cas. Ins. Co.)
* "Interpretations which render any part of a statute [or regulation] superfluous are to be avoided." (Young v. McCoy)
