[1] At that hearing,
the court proposed to resolve the petition for writ of mandate by reviewing the
privileged communications and making the final determination whether Petitioner
is entitled to any of the documents at the hearing.  Petitioner agreed to that approach.  The court’s review of the unredacted documents
makes clear that every redaction is supported by attorney-client privilege, and
the redacted communications do not reflect that they were made in furtherance
of any crime or fraud.  Inexplicably,
however, the City objected to that approach, so the court decides this petition.


[2] There was nothing
in the redacted portions that support Petitioner’s argument. 
 


[3] Petitioner also contends that the work product doctrine was waived when
the redacted communications were disclosed to supervisor Healey.  (OB 13-14.) The court rejects this argument
for the same reason.
 


[4] As discussed, having reviewed the records in camera, the court
concludes that LADBS properly redacted the information based on the
attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine.
