And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the petition for a writ of mandate directing the City of Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (LADBS) to provide all records responsive to Lin Ouyang's request under the California Public Records Act (CPRA). The court found that LADBS satisfied its initial burden of establishing that certain redacted communications are covered by the attorney-client privilege. Petitioner contends that the communications were not privileged and that LADBS waived the privilege, but the court concludes that Petitioner has not made a prima facie showing of fraud or other criminal activity related to any of the redacted communications. The court also finds that LADBS did not waive the attorney-client privilege when the communications were forwarded to supervisors, who were LADBS employees. Finally, the court concludes that Petitioner's claim that attorney Lie's confidential communications were part of a fraudulent conspiracy to withhold or improperly redact public records is speculative and not supported by evidence.
