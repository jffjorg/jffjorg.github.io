  Case Number:  21STCV23573    Hearing Date:   September 19, 2024    Dept:  74 Ledesma
v. Moradzadeh, et al.
Defendant Arash
Moradzadeh’s Motion to Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary
Adjudication.
 
            In July 2016, Defendant Dr. Arash Moradzadeh
performed a rhinoplasty on Plaintiff Julian Perner Ledesma, which Dr.
Moradzadeh caused to be videorecorded. Dr. Moradzadeh thereafter published the
video on his social media account. In June 2021, Plaintiff Julian Perner
Ledesma filed a complaint against, among others, Dr. Moradzadeh for having
posted the video, alleging causes of action for: (1) Violation of
Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, (2) Invasion of Privacy – Public
Disclosure of Private Facts, (3) Violation of Civil Code § 3344, et seq., (4)
Common Law Commercial Misappropriation, (5) Violation of Business and
Professions Code § 17200, et seq., (6) Breach of Contract, (7) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty, (8) Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (10)
Fraud, (11), Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, (12) Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress, and (13) Negligence.
Dr. Moradzadeh moves for summary judgment, or alternatively summary
adjudication. The court denies the motion in its entirety. 
 
DISCUSSION 

            Triable Issues Exist Whether Plaintiff’s
Claims are Time Barred 
The recording and posting on social media of plaintiff’s rhinoplasty
took place in July 2016. Plaintiff filed his complaint in June 2021. Dr.
Moradzadeh contends plaintiff’s causes of action are time barred. Assuming solely
for the sake of argument that Dr. Moradzadeh has carried his prima facie
burden, his contention fails because triable issues exist. Plaintiff presents his
deposition testimony during which he was asked when he became aware that the
video at issue was taken of him to which he replied, “I believe it was around a
year ago.” (Id.) Plaintiff was subsequently asked “So around July 2021?”
and he answered, “I believe so.” (Id.) This corroborates Plaintiff’s
argument that his claims are tolled due to the delayed discovery rule. (Amadi
Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1 – Ledesma Depo at 79:10-23.)
Plaintiff additionally contends the video was republished because the
purpose of Instagram and hashtags is to republish and deliver posts to new and
different audiences. Plaintiff submits Instagram Help Page, which shows how Instagram
Feed AI system works. (PSSDF No. 34 – Amadi Decl., ¶, Ex. 7.) Plaintiff also
presents his declaration and Sarah Belkziz’s declaration. In his declaration, Plaintiff
states the video at issue was republished and recirculated on Instagram. (Amadi
Decl., ¶7, Ex. 6 – Ledesma Decl., ¶11, Ex. 3.) Likewise, Belkziz states on or
about May 12, 2021, Defendant Dr. Moradzadeh’s Instagram page appeared on her
feed despite her not following him and she saw the video at issue, which had
5,563 views. (Amadi Decl., ¶6, Ex. 5 – Belkziz Decl., ¶¶5-9.) Thus, Plaintiff
has shown that a triable issue of material fact exists whether Plaintiff’s
claims are time-barred.
Triable Issues Exist Whether Plaintiff Consented to the Video’s
Recording and Posting
Dr. Moradzadeh states prior to surgery on July 11, 2016, Plaintiff
signed informed consent forms to the rhinoplasty surgery and to being recorded.
But in his deposition, Plaintiff testified he told Dr. Moradzadeh he did not
want the before and after photos taken of him used and Dr. Moradzadeh replied,
“Yeah. Don’t worry about it. It’s just for before and afters.” (Amadi Decl.,
¶2, Ex. 1 – Ledesma Depo at 144:3-145:18.) (PSSDF Nos. 20-21, 26.)  Plaintiff also testified he had no reason to
believe the video at issue was posted because he never used Instagram. (06/14/24
Errata Re Exhibits, Ex. 5 – Ledesma Depo. Vol. II at 118:20-119:5.) In
addition, Plaintiff submits his declaration and Amadi’s declaration. (PSSDF
Nos. 4-7.) In his declaration, Plaintiff states Dr. Moradzadeh never showed him
the video and he never authorized its disclosure. (Amadi Decl., ¶, Ex. 6 –
Ledesma Decl., ¶12.) Similarly, Plaintiff testified at his deposition that he
did not recognize the signature on the consent forms as being his own. (Amadi
Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1 – Ledesma Depo at 63:5-21, 64:12-65:10, Ex. 4.) As such, a
reasonable jury could find that the alleged signatures on the informed consent
forms are not Plaintiff’s signature and that Plaintiff did not see the video
until 2021 such that prior approval did not occur. Thus, Plaintiff has shown
that a triable issue of material fact exists whether he expressly consented to
and approved disclosure of his private/confidential medical information. 
Plaintiff also cites Dr. Moradzadeh’s deposition in which Dr.
Moradzadeh testified the Instagram account is used for showing current patients
and prospective patients what type of treatments Dr. Moradzadeh offers, that
some patients became aware of his treatments through social media, and that he
is still posting on social media. (Amadi Decl., ¶3, Ex. 2 – Moradzadeh Depo at
99:4-100:15, 105:20-106:4, 107:7-13.) As such, a reasonable jury could find
that the video at issue was posted for a commercial purpose, not just
educational reasons.
 
CONCLUSION 
The court denies Arash Moradzadeh’s motion for summary adjudication
of (1) Violation of Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, (2) Invasion of
Privacy – Public Disclosure of Private Facts, (3) Violation of Civil Code §
3344, et seq., (4) Common Law Commercial Misappropriation, (5) Violation of
Business and Professions Code § 17200, et seq., (6) Breach of Contract, (7)
Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (8) Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing, (10) Fraud, (11), Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, (12)
Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress, and (13) Negligence.
The court denies Arash Moradzadeh’s motion for summary judgment.
Defendant shall give notice.
