And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Dr. Moradzadeh's motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The court has found that there are triable issues of material fact regarding whether the plaintiff's claims are time-barred. The plaintiff testified in his deposition that he became aware of the video around a year ago, which suggests that his claims are tolled due to the delayed discovery rule. The court has also found that there are triable issues of material fact regarding whether the plaintiff consented to the video's recording and posting. The plaintiff testified that he told Dr. Moradzadeh that he did not want the before and after photos taken of him used, and that he never authorized the disclosure of the video. The court has denied the motion on all counts, and Defendant Dr. Moradzadeh shall give notice.
