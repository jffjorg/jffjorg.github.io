And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The motion was filed over a year late and the defendant has already filed an answer to the operative complaint. The court notes that the motion lacks sufficient grounds for striking the alleged damages and that the defendant's argument is better pursued as an affirmative defense rather than a challenge to the complaint. The court also notes that the Answer to the FAC filed by defendant in this matter in fact alleges an affirmative defense of superseding cause. The motion is denied in its entirety.
