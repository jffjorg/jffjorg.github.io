And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's unopposed motion for an order directing the Office of the Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk to disclose and provide copies of the confidential marriage certificate and records of plaintiff Diane Flessas to Russell Rowland. The defendant seeks to evaluate plaintiff's standing as the surviving spouse of decedent Russell Rowland and believes that the marriage records will directly bear on this issue. The defendant has attempted to obtain the records directly from plaintiff, but was unable to do so, and has been informed that the Registrar would not comply with a subpoena absent a court order. The judge finds that good cause exists to order disclosure of the records and that a court order is necessary to obtain them. The motion is granted, and the order is issued as requested.
