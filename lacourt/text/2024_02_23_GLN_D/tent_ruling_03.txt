Greystar Real Estate Partners, LLC, et al.MOTIONS TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY (3 Motions) Moving Party:  Defendant Electrolux Home Products, Inc.  Responding Party: Plaintiff Sashile Wood (No Opposition)  RELIEF REQUESTED:Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One   CHRONOLOGYDate Discovery served:     May 22, 2023   Extensions to Respond to: October 11, 2023 (Ex. D) Date Responses served:  NO RESPONSES SERVED  Date Motion served:   January 24, 2024    Timely OPPOSITION:  No opposition.   ANALYSIS:Under CCP § 2030.290, “If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,” that party “waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings...as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product...”  Under subdivision (b), “The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.”  CCP §2031.300 contains similar provisions with respect to requests to produce documents.In this case, interrogatories and document production demands have been directed to plaintiff and plaintiff has failed to serve timely responses.  Propounding party defendant Electrolux Home Products, Inc. has appropriately moved for orders to compel.  Accordingly, plaintiff has waived the option to produce writings, as well as all objections, and is ordered to respond.  SanctionsWith respect to interrogatories, under CCP § 2030.290(c), “The court shall impose a monetary sanction… against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  A similar provision applies to document demands.  See CCP § 2031.300(c).CCP § 2023.010 provides that misuse of the discovery process includes “(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where there has been such conduct, under CCP § 2023.030(a), “The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct....If a monetary sanction is authorized” by the statute, “ the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that the other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” CCP § 2023.030(a).  Under CRC Rule 3.1348(a): “The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.”The burden is on the party subject to sanctions to show substantial justification or injustice.  Mattco Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young & Co. (1990, 2nd Dist.) 223 Cal.App.3d 1429, 1436.  In this case, plaintiff has failed to respond to authorized methods of discovery and defendant has submitted evidence that it has incurred expenses as a result of the conduct. Since the motions are unopposed, there is no evidence that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust.  Defendant requests $3,157.50 for each of the three motions.  These appear high for motions of this nature.  The time includes 2 hours at $295/hour for each motion to prepare replies, when no oppositions have been filed, so the replies should be brief, and 4 hours to attend the hearing for each motion, when the three motions will be heard together, and can be attended remotely.  The sanctions will be adjusted accordingly as follows: no replies were necessary since no oppositions were filed and the court reduces by ½ hours the time to prepare each motion for a total of 4 hours at $295.00 hourly rate for attorney time for each motion or $1,180.00 per motion for attorneys’ fees.  The court adds one hour at $295.00 per hour to one motion only for remote attendance at the hearing.  RULING:[No opposition]Defendant Electrolux Home Products, Inc.’s UNOPPOSED Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Set One is GRANTED.  Plaintiff Sashile Wood is ordered to serve verified responses to Form Interrogatories— General, Set No. One, without objection, within 10 days.Monetary sanctions requested by moving party:  Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is $1,475.00 (5.0 hours @ $295 per hour) [10.5 hours sought] plus $60.00 filing fee plus one hour attorney time to attend hearing remotely [Amount Requested $3,157.50], which sum is to be awarded in favor of defendant Electrolux Home Products, Inc. and against plaintiff Sashile Wood, payable within 30 days.  CCP sections 2030.290(c), 2023.010(d), 2023.030(a), and CRC Rule 3.1030(a).Defendant Electrolux Home Products, Inc.’s UNOPPOSED Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set One is GRANTED.  Plaintiff Sashile Wood is ordered to serve verified responses to Defendant Electrolux Home Products, Inc.’s Special Interrogatories, Set One to Plaintiff Sashile Wood, without objection, within 10 days.Monetary sanctions requested by moving party:  Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is $1,180.00 (4.0 hours @ $295 per hour) [10.5 hours sought] plus $60.00 filing fee [Amount Requested $3,157.50], which sum is to be awarded in favor of defendant Electrolux Home Products, Inc. and against plaintiff Sashile Wood, payable within 30 days.  CCP sections 2030.290(c), 2023.010(d), 2023.030(a), and CRC Rule 3.1030(a).Defendant Electrolux Home Products, Inc.’s UNOPPOSED Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One is GRANTED.  Plaintiff Sashile Wood is ordered to serve verified responses to Defendant Electrolux Home Products, Inc.’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One, to Plaintiff Sashile Wood, without objection, and to permit inspection and copying, within 10 days.Monetary sanctions requested by moving party:  Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is $1,180.00 (4.0 hours @ $295 per hour) [10.5 hours sought] plus $60.00 filing fee [Amount Requested $3,157.50], which sum is to be awarded in favor of defendant Electrolux Home Products, Inc. and against plaintiff Sashile Wood, payable within 30 days.  CCP §§ 2031.300(c), 2023.010(d), 2023.030(a), and CRC Rule 3.1030(a).DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCESPlease make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.  Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.  However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED. If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.
