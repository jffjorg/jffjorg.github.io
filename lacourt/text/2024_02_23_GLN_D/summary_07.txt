And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by the Judge regarding a writ of possession application by Ally Bank against BDR Marketing Inc. and Michael J. Greenberg. The application is unopposed, but the Judge has concerns about the plaintiff's standing to pursue the writ, as there is no documentation of an assignment and the security holder appears to be Ally Financial, not Ally Bank. The Judge notes that the plaintiff has the right to immediate possession of the vehicle under the contract, but the writ will not issue until the plaintiff files an undertaking in the amount of $176,787.38. The Judge also requires the plaintiff to establish the probable validity of its claim to possession of the property.
