Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings and has sustained the plaintiff's objections to the defendant's request for judicial notice. The judge has also granted the plaintiff's request for judicial notice.

The defendant had argued that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the government claims requirement rendered the complaint defective. However, the judge has ruled that the plaintiff's allegations that they are exempt from the claims presentation requirement due to the legislative changes made in 2020 are sufficient to withstand judgment on the pleadings.

The judge has also rejected the defendant's argument that the revival provision in the legislation is unconstitutional. The judge has held that the legislation was a constitutional exercise of the Legislature's power to prescribe the conditions for liability for childhood sexual assault, including public entities' liability.

The judge has also denied the defendant's request for judicial notice of minute orders issued in unrelated superior court actions. The judge has held that these orders have no precedential value and are not relevant to the case.

The judge has also noted that the legislative intent to excuse victims from complying with the government claims requirement retroactively is clear. The judge has also held that the court will not annul a statute passed by the Legislature unless it can be said of the statute that it positively and certainly is opposed to the constitution.
