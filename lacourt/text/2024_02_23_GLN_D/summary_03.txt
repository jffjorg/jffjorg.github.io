And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Electrolux Home Products, Inc., has moved to compel the plaintiff, Sashile Wood, to respond to discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The plaintiff has failed to serve timely responses, and the defendant has submitted evidence that it has incurred expenses as a result of the plaintiff's conduct.

The court finds that the plaintiff has waived the option to produce writings and all objections, and therefore grants the defendant's motion to compel responses to discovery. The court also awards sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $1,475.00, $1,180.00, and $1,180.00 for the three separate motions, respectively.

The court notes that the defendant's requested sanctions of $3,157.50 appear high for motions of this nature, and therefore adjusts the sanctions accordingly. The court also finds that the plaintiff has failed to respond to authorized methods of discovery and has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, which justifies the imposition of sanctions.

The court orders the plaintiff to serve verified responses to the defendant's discovery requests within 10 days and awards the defendant sanctions in the amounts specified above. The court also encourages the use of audio or video appearances for future hearings and notes that advance registration is required.
