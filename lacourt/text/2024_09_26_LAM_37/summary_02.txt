Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration without prejudice. The plaintiff, Sanjay Kalra, disputes the electronic signature and claims that he did not use a computer to access the onboarding documents. The defendants failed to show that the electronic signature is attributable only to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff did not have knowledge of the arbitration agreement. Therefore, the plaintiff did not impliedly consent to the agreement. The judge found that the defendants did not meet their burden of showing that the plaintiff electronically signed the arbitration agreement, and therefore, the motion to compel arbitration is denied.
