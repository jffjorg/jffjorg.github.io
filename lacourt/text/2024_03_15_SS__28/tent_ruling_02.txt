 Case Number:  21STCV36941    Hearing Date:   March 15, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court rules as
follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
October 6, 2021, Plaintiff Oliver Gabay (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Sidney Hales (“Hales”), The Express Group Inc. dba Westwood Express
Messenger Service (“Express”), and Does 1-20 for negligence. 
On
March 21, 2022, Plaintiff amended the complaint to include Defendants Marco
Raygoza as Doe 1 (“Raygoza”) and Uber Technologies, Inc. as Doe 2 (“Uber”). 
On
July 1, 2022, Raygoza filed an answer. On July 29, 2022, Uber filed an answer. 
On
September 27, 2022, the Court granted Uber’s motion to compel Plaintiff to
arbitrate his claims against Uber and stayed the entire case pending
arbitration.  (The Court does not appear
to have lifted the stay.) 
On
January 25, 2023, the Court dismissed Uber without prejudice at Plaintiff’s
request. 
On
February 9, 2023, Express filed an answer. On February 24, 2023, Hales filed an
answer. 
On
February 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel Hales’s responses to
request for production, to be heard on March 15, 2024. On March 8, 2024, Hales
filed an untimely opposition. Also on March 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply. 
Trial
is scheduled for June 27, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to order Hales to respond to the request for production of
documents contained in the deposition notice served on him. 
Defendant
asks the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.480 provides in part: 
“(a) If a deponent fails to answer any question or to
produce any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing
under the deponent’s control that is specified in the deposition notice or a
deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery may move the court for an
order compelling that answer or production. 
“(b) This motion shall be made no later than 60 days
after the completion of the record of the deposition, and shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(c) Notice of this motion shall be given to all
parties and to the deponent either orally at the examination, or by subsequent
service in writing. If the notice of the motion is given orally, the deposition
officer shall direct the deponent to attend a session of the court at the time
specified in the notice. 
* * *
 “(h) Not less than five days prior to the hearing on
this motion, the moving party shall lodge with the court a certified copy of
any parts of the stenographic transcript of the deposition that are relevant to
the motion. If a deposition is recorded by audio or video technology, the
moving party is required to lodge a certified copy of a transcript of any parts
of the deposition that are relevant to the motion. 
“(i) If the court determines that the answer or
production sought is subject to discovery, it shall order that the answer be
given or the production be made on the resumption of the deposition. 
“(j) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel an answer or
production, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. . . .” 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.480, subds. (a), (b), (c), (h), (i), (j).)    
DISCUSSION 
On
December 13, 2023, Plaintiff served a notice of taking Hales’s deposition,
including a request for production of documents.  The deposition took place on February 6, 2024. 
Plaintiff
asserts that Hales failed to produce any documents or respond to the request
for production.  When Plaintiff’s counsel
asked about the lack of response, Hales’s counsel stated: “Any documents have
been produced and we have nothing else.”
In
opposition, Hales states that he “does not have any additional responsive
documents besides the photos and other documents he has already produced.”  (Opposition p. 2.)  Hales also argues that Plaintiff failed to
meet and confer before filing the motion. 
It
is undisputed that Plaintiff did not meet and confer with Hales before filing
the motion to compel.  Plaintiff argues that
he was not required to meet and confer because Code of Civil Procedure section
2024.450 does not contain a meet and confer requirement.  Yet Plaintiff cites Code of Civil Procedure
section 2024.480, which contains a meet and confer requirement, as authority
for his motion.  (Motion p. 4; see Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (b) [meet and confer declaration required].)  Because the deposition took place, Code of
Civil Procedure section 2024.480 applies to this issue. 
The
Court denies the motion because Plaintiff has not complied with the meet and
confer requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480, subdivision
(b). 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff Oliver Gabay’s motion to compel
Defendant Sidney Hales to produce documents and respond to the request for
production of documents included in the deposition notice served on December
13, 2023. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
