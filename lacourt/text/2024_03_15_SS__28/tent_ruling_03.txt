LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part: 
“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party
to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party,
or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance. 
*
* *
 “(g) (1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . ." 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (a), (b), (g)(1).) 
DISCUSSION 
Beginning
in September 2023, White has asked Plaintiff for dates on which
Plaintiff could attend her deposition. 
Not receiving responses, White twice noticed Plaintiff’s deposition.  In response to the first deposition notice, Plaintiff’s
counsel served objections but did not provide alternative dates. In response to
White’s second deposition notice, Plaintiff notified White one day before the December
14, 2023 scheduled deposition that Plaintiff would not appear.  Plaintiff did not provide alternative dates
and did not appear for deposition on December 14, 2023.  White took a certificate of non-appearance. 
After
White filed this motion on December 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed an “Opposition to Sanctions for Failing to Appear at
Deposition” on March 12, 2024.  Plaintiff
states that she is willing to attend a deposition on March 25, 2024 and asks
the Court not to impose sanctions because she previously lacked representation. 
The
Court grants the motion and orders Plaintiff to attend a deposition within 20
days. 
White
requests sanctions of $2,197.00 based on five hours of attorney time at a rate
of $325.00 per hour, a $72.00 filing fee, and $500.00 for the certificate of
non-appearance.  Counsel spent three
hours drafting the motion and anticipated spending one hour to prepare a reply
and one hour to attend the hearing. 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (g)(1), the Court must
impose sanctions unless the Court “finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) The Court does not find
that Plaintiff acted with substantial justification in failing to attend or cooperate
in scheduling a deposition.  
Whether
“circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust” is a closer
question. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)  Plaintiff
asserts that the Court granted her previous counsel’s motion to be relieved on
November 15, 2023, and she retained new counsel in late February 2024.  According to Plaintiff, White and Plaintiff have
agreed to proceed with a March 25, 2024 deposition. 
Litigants
who represent themselves are expected to comply with the procedural rules that govern
litigation, including the rules that apply to discovery.  Without more, the lack of representation by
counsel does not necessarily exempt a litigant from sanctions based on violation
of the discovery rules.  Here, Plaintiff
has not identified any other circumstances that would make imposition of
sanctions unjust.  By agreeing to attend
a deposition on March 25, 2024, Plaintiff has simply complied with her legal
obligation to cooperate in the discovery process; this fact does not show that
imposition of sanctions would be unjust. 
Therefore, the Court grants White’s request for sanctions. 
The
Court awards sanctions of $1,061.65 based on two hours of attorney’s time at a
reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour, the $500.00 non-appearance fee, and a
$61.65 filing fee. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Defendant Kimberlee “Kim” White’s motion to
compel Plaintiff Valerie Roberts’s deposition.  The Court orders Plaintiff Valerie Roberts to
appear for deposition within 20 days of the hearing on the motion.  Defendant Kimberlee “Kim” White is ordered to
make any necessary arrangements to ensure that the deposition takes place by
this deadline. 
The Court GRANTS Defendant Kimberlee
“Kim” White’s request for sanctions and orders Plaintiff Valerie Roberts to
pay Defendant Kimberlee “Kim” White $1,061.65 within 30 days of the date of the
hearing on this motion. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
