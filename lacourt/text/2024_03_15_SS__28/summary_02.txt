And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion to compel responses from Defendant Sidney Hales. The plaintiff, Oliver Gabay, seeks to compel Hales to respond to a request for production of documents included in the deposition notice served on December 13, 2023. The deposition took place on February 6, 2024, and Hales failed to produce any documents or respond to the request for production. Hales argues that he has already produced the requested documents and that the plaintiff failed to meet and confer before filing the motion. The Court finds that the plaintiff did not comply with the meet and confer requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480, subdivision (b). Therefore, the Court denies the motion to compel responses.
