LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Demurrer 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.10 provides in part: 
* * *
“(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action
“(f) The pleading is uncertain. As used in this
subdivision, ‘uncertain’ includes ambiguous and unintelligible. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10,
subds. (e), (f).) 
In a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or by judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a) [“When any ground
for objection to a complaint, cross-complaint, or answer appears on the face
thereof, or from any matter of which the court is required to or may take
judicial notice, the objection on that ground may be taken by a demurrer to the
pleading”].) 
“For
the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer
admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded (i.e., all ultimate facts
alleged, but not conclusions, deductions, or conclusions of facts or
law).”  (L. Edmon and C. Karnow, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 7:43, p. 7(l)-25 (Cal.
Practice Guide), emphasis omitted.) 
B.   Gross negligence 
“[O]rdinary
negligence ‘consists of a failure to exercise the degree of care in a given
situation that a reasonable person under similar circumstances would employ to
protect others from harm.’ ”  (Anderson
v. Fitness International, LLC (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 867, 881, quoting City
of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court (2007) 41 Cal.4th 747, 753-754 (Santa
Barbara).)  “ ‘ “[M]ere nonfeasance,
such as the failure to discover a dangerous condition or to perform a duty,” ’ amounts
to ordinary negligence.” (Ibid., quoting Frittelli, Inc. v. 350 North
Canon Drive, LP (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 35, 48.)  “However, to support a theory of ‘ “[g]ross
negligence,” ’ a plaintiff must allege facts showing ‘either a “ ‘want of even
scant care’ ” ’ or ‘ “ ‘an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of
conduct.’ ” [Citations.]’ ” (Ibid., quoting Santa Barbara, supra,
41 Cal.4th at p. 754.) “ ‘ “ ‘[G]ross negligence’ falls short of a reckless
disregard of consequences, and differs from ordinary negligence only in degree,
and not in kind . . . .” ’ ” (Ibid., quoting Gore v. Board of Medical
Quality Assurance (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 184, 197.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   The first amended complaint 
The
first amended complaint alleges the following: 
“Defendant
negligently owned, leased, occupied, and/or controlled the property located at
32250 West Triunfo Canyon Road, Westlake Village, CA 91361. Defendant was
grossly negligent in the manner in which they owned, leased, occupied,
controlled, maintained, managed, leased, and/or operated the described
property, including the subject tennis court where the incident involved in
this case took place. Defendant showed an extreme departure from what a
reasonably careful athletic center and establishment would do in the same
situation. They willfully and knowingly placed a light pole within the area of
tennis play which was too close to the tennis court, which they knew based on
prevailing industry standards would subject tennis players, who were playing
with due caution and consideration, to severe injury to players by striking the
object while playing, without making it safe through padding or failing to
ensure the flooring was proper. Furthermore, despite knowing this risk of
severe injury to players, knowing about the prevailing standards of clear
distance around a court, Defendant failed to execute caution and preventative
measures so as to allow a dangerous condition to exist causing Plaintiff
Richard Friedman to sustain serious injuries [on May 9, 2022].  Defendants also built, designed, and/or
created the dangerous condition which was known to them and concealed said
dangerous condition from Plaintiff Richard Friedman, causing Mr. Friedman to
sustain serious injuries.” 
B.   The demurrer
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff cannot state a claim for gross negligence unless
Plaintiff alleges a “statutory basis” for the claim.  (Demurrer p. 6, citing Eriksson v. Nunnink
(2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 826, 856, fn. 18 (Eriksson).) 
The
Supreme Court rejected this proposition in City of Santa Barbara,
observing that “despite the absence of statutory authorization, California case
law clearly distinguishes between the concepts of ordinary negligence and
other, aggravated forms of misconduct such as gross negligence and
recklessness.”  (Santa Barbara, supra,
41 Cal.4th at p. 779; see id. at p. 780 [describing decisions which, “in
offhand dicta,” stated general proposition that “ ‘California does not
recognize a distinct cause of action for ‘gross negligence’ independent of a
statutory basis’ ”].)  Indeed, Eriksson,
on which Defendant relies, cites Saenz v. Whitewater Voyages, Inc.
(1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 758, 766, footnote 9, whose “offhand dicta” the Court noted
in City of Santa Barbara. 
Defendant
also asserts that the first amended complaint is uncertain.  Yet Defendant has not shown that it cannot
understand what Plaintiff is alleging. 
Instead, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff in fact “tripp[ed] [over] his
own foot while chasing after a ball during a game of competitive doubles tennis”
and is attempting to evade his waiver of liability.  (Demurrer p. 4.)  The Court cannot consider these alleged facts
in ruling on a demurrer. 
“Gross
negligence is pleaded by alleging the traditional elements of negligence: duty,
breach, causation, and damages.” (Rosecrans v. Dover Images, Ltd. (2011)
192 Cal.App.4th 1072, 1082.)  “However,
to set forth a claim for ‘gross negligence’ the plaintiff must allege extreme
conduct on the part of the defendant.” (Ibid.) 
The
first amended complaint does not allege facts showing extreme conduct by
Defendant.  With respect to gross
negligence, the first amended complaint alleges only factual and legal conclusions.  Therefore, the Court sustains the demurrer
with leave to amend. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court SUSTAINS Defendant Westlake Village Athletic Club, LP, dba Westlake
Athletic Club’s demurrer with 30 days leave to amend. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
