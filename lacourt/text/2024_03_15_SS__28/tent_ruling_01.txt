  Case Number:  21STCV00383    Hearing Date:   March 15, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court  rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On  January 6, 2021, Plaintiffs Irma Cardenas Lopez and Gloria Avalos Arteaga ("Plaintiffs") filed  this action against Defendants Olivia Camacho Chopin (“Defendant”) and Does  1-10 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence.  On  January 23, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a proof of service showing substituted  service on Defendant of the summons, complaint, and statement of damages on  January 23, 2023.  On  May 25, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an amended proof of service.  Also  on May 25, 2023, the clerk entered Defendant’s default.  On  February 14, 2024, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants with prejudice at  Plaintiffs’ request.  Also  on February 14, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a request for Court judgment to be heard  on March 15, 2024.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Plaintiffs  Irma Cardenas Lopez and Gloria Avalos Arteaga ask the Court to enter a default  judgment against Defendant Olivia Camacho Chopin and award Plaintiffs  $188,173.90, consisting of $150,000.00 in general damages, $37,688.90 in  special damages, and $485.00 in costs.  LEGAL STANDARD  A.   Default judgment  “[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party  seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry  of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following  must be included in the documents filed with the clerk:  “(1)  Except in  unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and  the nature of plaintiff's claim;  “(2)   Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested;  “(3)  Interest  computations as necessary;  “(4)  A memorandum  of costs and disbursements;  “(5)  A  declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is  sought;  “(6)  A proposed  form of judgment;  “(7)  A dismissal  of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate  judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579,  supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment;  “(8)  Exhibits  as necessary; and  “(9)  A request  for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1800(a).)  B.   Damages            “Where a cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff  merely needs to introduce evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice  Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶  5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser  (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the  evidence standard].)            The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's  default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal  injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the amount  listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a), 585,  subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure  fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27  Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases  which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may  be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is  demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in  court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p.  493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of  the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at  p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258,  p. 5-70.)  DISCUSSION  In  her declaration, Plaintiff Gloria Avalos Arteaga states that she has incurred “approximately  $53,853.63 in medical expenses” and also requests $50,000.00 in damages for pain  and suffering.  However, the statement of  damages attached to her declaration lists only $3,853.63 in medical  expenses.  The Court may not award special  damages that exceed the amount specified in the statement of damages.  The  JUD-100 form states that Plaintiff Gloria Avalos  Arteaga is seeking judgment for $54,096.13.   Because this figure includes $50,000.00 in general damages and $242.50  in costs, it seems likely that the $53,853.63 figure listed in the declaration  is an error.  The  CIV-100 and JUD-100 forms are not affected by the apparent error in Plaintiff Gloria Avalos Arteaga’s declaration.  The Court finds that Plaintiffs have submitted  a complete default judgment packet with all required attachments.  The Court grants the application.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS the application of Plaintiffs Irma  Cardenas Lopez and Gloria Avalos Arteaga for default judgment against Defendant  Olivia Camacho Chopin filed on February 14, 2024.  The Court enters judgment against Defendant Olivia  Camacho Chopin for $188,173.90.  Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
