Here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the application of the plaintiffs, Irma Cardenas Lopez and Gloria Avalos Arteaga, for a default judgment against the defendant, Olivia Camacho Chopin. The plaintiffs are seeking a judgment of $188,173.90, which includes $150,000.00 in general damages, $37,688.90 in special damages, and $485.00 in costs. The court finds that the plaintiffs have submitted a complete default judgment packet with all required attachments, and grants the request for default judgment. The court also notes that the figure of $53,853.63 listed in the declaration as medical expenses appears to be an error, but this does not affect the court's decision.
