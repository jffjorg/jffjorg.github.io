And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Richard Friedman v. Westlake Village Athletic Club, LP, dba Westlake Athletic Club. The case involves allegations of gross negligence and premises liability stemming from an incident that occurred on May 9, 2022, in which the plaintiff was injured while playing tennis at the defendant's facility.

The defendant has filed a demurrer, arguing that the plaintiff cannot state a claim for gross negligence without alleging a statutory basis for the claim. The judge has rejected this argument, citing a previous Supreme Court decision that distinguished between ordinary negligence and gross negligence.

The judge has also found that the first amended complaint does not allege facts showing extreme conduct by the defendant, and therefore sustains the demurrer with leave to amend. The judge orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days.
