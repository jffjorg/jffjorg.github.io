On

property damages and $50,000 in uninsured motorist bodily injury payments, for
a total of $59,037.98. 
On
November 3, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted
service on Ayala of the summons, complaint, statement of damages and other
documents on October 26, 2022. 
On

(erroneously sued as My Car Enterprises) filed an answer. 
On
January 11, 2024, the Court entered Ayala’s default. 
On
January 18, 2024, the Court dismissed Defendant My Car Enterprises without
prejudice at Plaintiff’s request.  On
February 1, 2024, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
January 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed an application for default judgment against
Ayala. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
Progressive Direct Insurance Company asks the Court to enter a default judgment
against Defendant Thomas Adrian Ayala and award Plaintiff $59,556.98,
consisting of $59,037.98 as the demand of the complaint and $519.00 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and
the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A memorandum
of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal
of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.   Damages 
          “Where a cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff
merely needs to introduce evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶
5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser
(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the
evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's
default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal
injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the amount
listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a), 585,
subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in
court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p.
493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of
the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at
p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258,
p. 5-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff has not explained the basis for its payment
of $50,000.00 in uninsured motorist benefits to its insured.  Assuming the payment covered the insured’s
medical expenses resulting from the accident, Plaintiff has not provided copies
of medical records, medical bills, or similar evidence showing that Plaintiff
is entitled to recover this amount in a default judgment against Defendant. 
The Court denies the application. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES the application of Plaintiff
Progressive Direct Insurance Company for default judgment against Defendant
Thomas Adrian filed on January 30, 2024. 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
