And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment against defendant Thomas Adrian Ayala and has denied the application. The judge notes that plaintiff Progressive Direct Insurance Company has not explained the basis for its payment of $50,000.00 in uninsured motorist benefits to its insured and has not provided evidence to support recovery of this amount. The judge also notes that the relief sought in the default judgment exceeds the amount demanded in the complaint. As a result, the judge denies the application for default judgment and orders plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
