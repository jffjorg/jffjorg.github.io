Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition for a writ of mandate brought by Lawrence L. Welk, Jr. against Vanowen GenPar, LLC, WRE Vanowen L.P., Wilshire GenPar, LLC, WRE Wilshire L.P., Welk Real Estate, Inc., and Welk Group, Inc. The petition seeks to compel the respondents to produce certain documents, including a complete list of bank account numbers, banking records, and QuickBooks data.

The court finds that the respondents have produced some documents, but the petitioner claims that they have not fully produced all requested documents. The court orders the respondents to produce the list of bank account numbers and the QuickBooks data, but denies the petition with respect to the banking records.

The court also notes that the respondents are willing to perform their duties without the coercion of the writ, but the court will not grant the petition without requiring the respondents to produce the requested documents. The court will review the petition again on July 26, 2024, and will grant the petition if the petitioner files certain documents as directed.
