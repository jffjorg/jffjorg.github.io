And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a dispute between Petitioner and Respondents regarding Petitioner's role as Manager of two LLCs. Petitioner claims to be the sole Manager based on the Operating Agreements, while Respondents assert that Petitioner was replaced as Manager on March 7, 2023. The judge notes that the deadline for serving and filing the opening brief was May 15, 2024, but that Respondents do not oppose the brief on grounds of untimeliness. The judge also notes that Petitioner alleges not to have resigned as Manager, but that this issue is not dispositive of the petition. The judge will consider the relevant laws and facts in making a final decision.
