[1]           Petitioner asserts that, in the Operating
Agreements of both LLCs, he is designated as the sole Manager. (Opening Br. at
3:14-16.) Respondents agree that petitioner was the initial manager but asserts
that petitioner was replaced as Manager effective March 7, 2023. (Baird Decl. ¶
9 & Ex. 5.) Petitioner alleges that he has not resigned as Manager of both
LLCs. (Pet. ¶ 14.) Whether petitioner is Manager is not dispositive of the
instant Petition. 
 


[2]           Pursuant to stipulation, the deadline
for petitioner to serve and file the opening brief was May 15, 2024. (5/22/24
Order.) Only the declaration of Renee Smith was filed on May 15, 2024. On May
22, 2024, petitioner filed an errata indicating that certain documents were not
filed due to an error in the caption. From the proofs of service, it appears
that the moving papers were timely served on May 15, 2024. Respondents do not
oppose the opening brief based on untimeliness.

Corporations Code, unless otherwise stated.
