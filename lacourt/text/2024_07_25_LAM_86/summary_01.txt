And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petitioners' motion for a protective order, which sought to limit the scope of discovery in an administrative mandamus proceeding. The petitioners, Supporters Alliance for Environmental Responsibility, argue that the respondents, Long Beach, et al., are trying to go on a "fishing expedition" and seek information that is not relevant to the issue of standing. The judge disagrees, finding that the respondents have a right to conduct discovery and that the petitioners' attempts to limit discovery are unreasonable.

The judge notes that the respondents are seeking to examine the petitioners' standing, which is a crucial issue in the case. The judge finds that the respondents' discovery requests are reasonably tailored and are not overly broad. The judge also rejects the petitioners' argument that certain information is privileged and should not be disclosed.

The judge concludes that the motion is denied and that the respondents are entitled to conduct discovery on the issue of standing. The judge's ruling allows the respondents to continue their discovery efforts and to examine the petitioners' standing in more detail.
