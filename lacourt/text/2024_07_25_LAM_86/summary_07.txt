And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The respondent County of Los Angeles' demurrer to the petition for a writ of mandate is sustained. The court finds that the Civil Service Commission lost jurisdiction to hear the petition's appeal because the petitioner, Eric Pelton, retired in March 2022 while the appeal was pending. The court relies on the Zuniga rule, which holds that a civil service commission has only the special and limited jurisdiction expressed in the charter, and that once an employee voluntarily separates from service, the commission is without jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of any appeal.

The court rejects the petitioner's argument that the Hudson case, which involved a disability retirement, is applicable to this case. The court finds that the Hudson case is an exception to the Zuniga rule, and that the facts of this case do not warrant an exception.

The court also rejects the petitioner's allegations that his retirement was obtained by duress, fraud, or undue influence, and that he was encouraged to retire to procure a minimal retirement benefit. The court finds that the petitioner failed to allege that he appealed the acceptance of his retirement, and that he cannot argue that his retirement is void.

The court sustains the demurrer in its entirety, and the petitioner fails to state a claim for administrative mandamus or traditional mandamus. The court will hear a proffer from the petitioner as to how the petition can be amended to address the defects set forth in the ruling.
