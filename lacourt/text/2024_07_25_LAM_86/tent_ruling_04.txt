[1]           Pursuant to stipulation, the deadline
for petitioner to serve and file the opening brief was May 15, 2024. (5/22/24
Order.) Only the declaration of Renee Smith was filed on May 15, 2024. On May
22, 2024, petitioner filed an errata indicating that certain documents were not
filed due to an error in the caption. From the proofs of service, it appears
that the moving papers were timely served on May 15, 2024. Respondent does not
oppose the opening brief based on untimeliness.
