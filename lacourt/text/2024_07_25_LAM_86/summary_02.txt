Significant Statements:
  - "The CPRA defines 'public records' as 'any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public's business prepared, owned, used, or retained by any state or local agency regardless of physical form or characteristics.'"
  - "The critical question in determining if a petitioner is seeking public records is 'whether the information contained therein relates to the conduct of the public's business.'"
  - "The public's interest in the qualifications and conduct of peace officers is substantial, a circumstance that both diminishes and counterbalances any expectation officers may have that their names and employment as peace officers will be confidential."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the Los Angeles Sunshine Coalition is entitled to inspect and receive copies of public records, specifically secondary employment forms for officers at Hollywood Station. The City of Los Angeles had claimed that the forms were exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act (CPRA), but the judge has found that the forms are public records and that the City has failed to demonstrate the application of any exemption.

The judge has based his ruling on the fact that the forms contain information about the officers' secondary employment, which is a public function regulated by the City. The judge has also found that the public has an interest in learning about the secondary employment of peace officers, including whether it contributes to fatigue or interferes with their duties.

The judge has rejected the City's arguments that the disclosure of the forms would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy or increase the threat to officer safety. Instead, the judge has found that the public interest in secondary employment outweighs any interest in nondisclosure.
