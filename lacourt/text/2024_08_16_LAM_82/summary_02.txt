And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's ex parte application to stop levy on bank accounts and motion for preliminary injunction. The plaintiff, Suzanne Rene Aslanyan, is seeking to stop further levies and withdrawals from her bank accounts by the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) to satisfy her husband's tax debt. The court has reviewed the martial agreement between Suzanne and her husband, which states that each partner's property is separate.

The court has found that the plaintiff does not demonstrate a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits. The tax debt was incurred during the marriage, and the plaintiff has not shown that all assets and liabilities were separate property before the separation. The court also notes that the CDTFA's lien is not addressed in the martial agreement.

The court denies the plaintiff's ex parte application for a temporary restraining order. The plaintiff's counsel shall provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
