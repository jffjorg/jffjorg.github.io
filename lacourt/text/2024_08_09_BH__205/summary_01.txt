And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside a default and default judgment in a breach of contract case. The plaintiff, SOMA SURGERY CENTER, INC., and the defendant, BYRON SANDOVAL, et al., entered into a written contract wherein the plaintiff agreed to provide medical examinations and treatment to the defendant's personal injury clients on a lien basis. The defendant failed to pay, and a default was entered on January 22, 2024. The defendant then filed an answer and cross-complaint on January 26, 2024, and is now seeking to set aside the default.

The court has discretion to set aside a default under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง473, subdivision (b), which provides for two types of relief: discretionary and mandatory. The discretionary relief provision allows the court to set aside a default if there is a showing of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The mandatory relief provision requires the court to set aside a default if the defaulting party's attorney files an affidavit attesting to the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.

In this case, the court finds that the defendant's attorney, Marilu Moreno-Schlicht, was seriously ill and mostly bedridden during the period when the default was entered, and that her staff failed to inform her of the default. The court also finds that the defendant agreed to set aside the default if an answer and cross-complaint were filed quickly, which they were. Therefore, the court grants the motion to set aside the default.
