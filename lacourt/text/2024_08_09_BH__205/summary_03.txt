And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the arguments presented by the parties in a case involving elder abuse. The plaintiff, Ken Listoe, alleges that he was a resident at a facility operated by the defendants, WG Hacienda SH LP dba Atria Hacienda and Atria Management Company LLC, and that he suffered falls and pressure injuries due to the defendants' negligence and failure to provide adequate care. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's claims lack sufficient allegations of recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice.

The Judge agrees with the defendants that the plaintiff's allegations do not meet the requirements for an elder abuse claim under the Welfare and Institutions Code. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's allegations of negligence are not sufficient to support a claim for elder abuse, and that the plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendants were guilty of recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice in the commission of the alleged neglect.

The Judge also finds that the plaintiff's allegations of corporate ratification are conclusory and lack specific facts. The Judge notes that the plaintiff has not alleged any specific facts to show that the defendants authorized or ratified the alleged misconduct, and that the plaintiff's allegations of policy or practice of understaffing or undertraining are not supported by specific facts.

The Judge sustains the defendants' demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff has 20 days to revise and resubmit the complaint to address the deficiencies identified by the Judge.
