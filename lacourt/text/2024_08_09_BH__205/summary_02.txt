And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the City of Culver's demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The City argues that the plaintiff's claim for inverse condemnation fails because it is based on a property damage claim based on negligence. The judge agrees with the City and sustains the demurrer without leave to amend. The judge finds that the plaintiff's claim for inverse condemnation is not valid because it is based on allegations of negligent maintenance, which does not constitute a claim for inverse condemnation. The judge notes that the plaintiff has not pleaded that the alleged property damage resulted from a deliberate design, and that the allegations of negligent maintenance are not sufficient to state a claim for inverse condemnation.
