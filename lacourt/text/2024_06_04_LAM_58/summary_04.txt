And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The court has ruled that the motion to strike the request for punitive damages is granted. The court finds that the punitive damages request is based on the same conduct as the underlying statutory claims, and therefore, the court grants the motion to strike. Additionally, the court has granted the motion to strike the allegations that the plaintiff revoked acceptance and canceled the lease, as the plaintiff accepted the goods by purchasing the vehicle after the lease term ended. The court has also granted the motion to strike the prayer for recission, reimbursement, and/or restitution of all monies expended.
