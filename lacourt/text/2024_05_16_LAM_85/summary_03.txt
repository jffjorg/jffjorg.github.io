And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Court has granted the Plaintiff's request for confirmation of the appointment of a Receiver to take possession of the properties and collect rents from tenants and subtenants. The Receiver, David P. Stapleton, is fully qualified to serve in this capacity. The Court has also granted the Plaintiff's request to expand the Receiver's duties to include entering into leases with new tenants and evicting defaulting tenants, demanding that the Defendants turn over security deposits and prepaid rent, and paying property taxes from sources other than rent.

The Court's decision is based on the Plaintiff's evidence that the properties are vacant and not being professionally managed, which puts them at risk of vandalism, break-ins, and loss of value. The Court also notes that the Defendants are delinquent on property taxes and that the Receiver will be able to address these issues.

The Court has scheduled a hearing to discuss the issues and the date for a Receivership status conference.
