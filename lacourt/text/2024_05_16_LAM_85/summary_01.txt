The judge rules that the case is moot due to the abatement of the violations at the Property. The plaintiff, 7520 S. Broadway, LLC, sought a writ of administrative mandamus compelling the County of Los Angeles to vacate the Notice and Order to Comply of August 3, 2022. The judge finds that the case is moot because the violations at the Property have been abated, and the court cannot grant the plaintiff any effectual relief. The judge orders the case dismissed as moot.
