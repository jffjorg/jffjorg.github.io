[1] Broadway purports to seek
attorney fees pursuant to CCP section 128.5 and 1021.5, and Govt. Code section
800.  CCP section 128.5 provides for an
award of attorney fees during the
conduct of litigation.  Govt. Code
section 800(a) concerns review of an administrative proceeding.  Despite Broadway’s Petition, it never had an
administrative proceeding.  Finally,
Broadway cannot meet the elements of CCP section, which require in part that it
confer a significant benefit on the public or large group of persons.  No attorney fees will be awarded to Broadway.
