2. Course of Proceedings
Defendants Carlotta USA, Beethoven 9, Beethoven 10, Journo,
and Compagnie filed an Answer on April 18, 2024. 
On April 16, 2024, the court appointed Stapleton as a rents
and profits receiver only and issued an order to show cause (“OSC”) re
confirmation of receiver as to possession of Defendants’ properties. 
 
B. Applicable Law
Pursuant to CCP
section 564(b), “[a] receiver
may be appointed by the court in which an action or proceeding is pending, or
by a judge of that court,…(11) [i]n an action by a secured lender for specific
performance of an assignment of rents provision in a deed of trust, mortgage,
or separate assignment document. The appointment may be continued after entry
of a judgment for specific performance if appropriate to protect, operate, or
maintain real property encumbered by a deed of trust or mortgage or to collect
rents therefrom while a pending nonjudicial foreclosure under power of sale in
a deed of trust or mortgage is being completed.”  CCP § 564(b)(11).
“[T]he appointment
of a receiver rests in a large measure in the sound discretion of the court.
However, such power is not entirely uncontrolled and must be exercised with due
regard to the facts presented in each particular case. And because the remedy
of receivership is so drastic in character, ‘Ordinarily, if there is any other
remedy, less severe in its results, which will adequately protect the rights of
the parties, a court should not take property out of the hands of its owners.”  Alhambra-Shumway Mines, Inc. v. Alhambra
Gold Mine Corp. (1953) 116 Cal.App.2d 869, 873; see also Medipro Medical
Staffing LLC v. Certified Nursing Registry, Inc. (2021) 60 Cal.App.5th 622,
628.
 
C. Statement of Facts
1. Plaintiff
Bank’s Evidence
The Properties are
adjacent and contain several parking lots, a bakery, a financial lending store,
and other retail tenants.  Ibarra Decl.,
¶38.  The Property is largely
vacant.  Ibarra Decl., ¶39.  Defendants have not provided clarity whether
the Property is being professionally managed or has professional security to
safeguard against potential vandalism, break-ins, and other acts that could significantly
diminish the value of the Property, as well as, loss of tenants.  Ibarra Decl., ¶39.  A property manager is necessary to maximize
occupancy as much of the value of the Property is being wasted due to lack of
occupancy.  Ibarra Decl., ¶41.
Defendants and/or
their agents are also continuing to collect thousands of dollars in monthly
rents from the Property despite having stopped paying any debt service to Bank
on the subject loans.  Ibarra Decl.,
¶40.  Further, Defendants are severely
delinquent on real estate property taxes, which also put the Property at
risk.  Ibarra Decl., ¶42.  As of January 29, 2024, Carlotta USA owes at
least $466,828.97 in property taxes on the Carlotta Property, consisting of a
delinquent amount of $233,414.51 and penalties assessed in the amount of
$23,341.42.  Ibarra Decl., ¶42.  As of January 30, 2024, the Beethoven
Defendants owe at least $127,103.40 in property taxes on the Beethoven Property,
consisting of a delinquent amount of $63,551.72 and penalties assessed in the
amount of $6,355.16.  Ibarra Decl., ¶43.
Stapleton is fully
qualified to serve as Receiver and to take control of the Property and the
revenues, issues and profits thereof, and preserve it for the estate.  Stapleton Decl., ¶¶ 1-12, 17.  Stapleton has no involvement with any of the
parties to this action that would create a conflict of interest if he were to
be appointed as the receiver.  Stapleton
Decl., ¶15.  Neither is Stapleton related
to any judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court by consanguinity or affinity
within the third degree.  Stapleton Decl.,
¶15.  
 
2. Defendants’
Evidence 
Dave Torres
(“Torres”) is a licensed California Broker and Chief Financial Officer of Heidt
Torres Co., a property development and management company specializing in
property and asset management.  Torres
Decl., ¶1.  Torres has served as a
property manager for Defendant Compagnie’s following properties: (1) 608 and 610
New High Street, Los Angeles (aka 615-631 North Spring Street, Los Angeles,
CA), (2) 648 New High Street, Los Angeles, CA, and (3) 677/679 North Spring
Street, Los Angeles, CA (the “Properties”) since the beginning of 2020.  Torres Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.  
Torres’ company
provides maintenance and general building upkeep at the Properties.  Torres Decl., ¶4.  The company keep the Properties sealed off
from trespassers, changing the locks when necessary to prevent trespass and
inspecting the Properties regularly for any sign of trespass.  Torres Decl., ¶4.  The company also takes immediate action to
address the discovery of any trespass and secure the Properties.  Torres Decl., ¶4.  Furthermore, the company addresses issues of
graffiti and conduct regular maintenance to remove any graffiti on the
Properties.  Torres Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.  The company continuously monitors the
Properties to address any vandalism as well. 
Torres Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.
Torres’s company
also responds to any requests related to the Properties as they arise in a
prompt manner.  Torres Decl., ¶6.  Some of these requests come directly from the
Chinatown Business Improvement District, which is aware that Torres’s company
is responsible for the maintenance of the Properties.  Torres Decl., ¶6. 
 
D. Analysis
Plaintiff Bank seeks confirmation of the appointment of
Receiver to take possession of the Properties and collect the rents from the
tenants and subtenants.
Defendants have filed an opposition in which they do not
oppose receivership for the purpose of collecting rent and paying property
taxes from collected rent but do oppose expansion of Receiver’s duties to
maintain the Properties.  They argue that
Bank’s concern about vandalism, break-ins, and harm is speculation and
inconsistent with Defendants’ evidence that the Properties have been
professionally managed since 20210.  Opp.
at 5-6.
Bank replies that it agrees that Defendants’ management can
maintain the Properties but wants Receiver to have the powers of a rents and
profits receiver per the Judicial Council Form RC-200 of (1) entering into
leases with new tenants and evicting defaulting tenants, (2) demanding that
Defendants turn over any security deposits, prepaid rent, other rental or lease
payments, and funds in property management bank accounts, and (3) demand that
Defendants turn over books and records. 
Bank also wants Receiver to be able to pay property taxes, which
currently total over $620,000, from sources other than rent.  Reply at 1, 3.
The application for
confirmation of the appointment of Receiver is granted.  The court will discuss the above issues,
as well as the date for a Receivership status conference, with counsel at
hearing.
