of Los Angeles; 
23STCP03230

Tentative decision on petition for
writ of mandate:  dismissed as moot




 



Petitioner 7520 S. Broadway, LLC (“Broadway”) seeks a writ
of administrative mandamus compelling Respondent County of Los Angeles
(“County”) to vacate the Notice and Order to Comply of August 3, 2022. 
The court has read and considered the County’s opposition, has
read Broadway’s “trial brief” and County’s objection, and renders the following
tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Petition
Petitioner Broadway filed the Petition for administrative
mandamus against Respondent County on September 5, 2023.  The Petition alleges in pertinent part as
follows. 
Broadway holds title to the real property and improvements
located at 7520 S. Broadway, Los Angeles, CA 90003 (the “Property”).  Pet., ¶ 1. 
Respondent County operates the Department of Public Health (“DPH”).  Pet., ¶ 2.
On August 3, 2022, DPH Inspector Maria Diaz Padilla
(“Padilla”) inspected Units F and G of the Property, as well as the exterior of
the Property as part of a “Routine Inspection.” 
Pet., ¶ 3.  Reinspection was set
for August 25, 2022.  Pet., ¶ 3.
On August 25, 2022, Inspector Padilla inspected the Property
and issued a “Official Inspection Report” confirming resolution of the 30
“Non-Critical Violations” in the August 3, 2022 report.  Pet., ¶ 4. 
Padilla added three new violations and set an inspection date of
September 15, 2022.  Pet., ¶ 4. 
On September 23, 2022, Inspector Padilla inspected the
Property and closed the violations from the August 25, 2022 inspection.  Pet., ¶ 5. 
Padilla added three more violations and set a telephonic “Compliance
Review” with Chief Inspector Bria Nash (“Nash”) on September 28, 2022 to
discuss outstanding violations in Units F and G.  Pet., ¶ 5.
The telephonic “Compliance Review” was held on September 28,
2022, and Chief Inspector Nash indicated that the units at the Property had to
be fumigated monthly rather than four units per month.  Pet., ¶ 6. 
An inspection was scheduled for October 14, 2022.  Pet., ¶ 6.
On October 14, 2022, Inspector Padilla inspected the
Property and closed several violations, leaving 12 Non-Critical Violations
pending and adding new violations.  Pet.,
¶ 8.  Padilla set an inspection date for
October 18, 2022. 
On October 18, 2022, Inspector Padilla inspected the
Property and closed several violations, leaving five violations pending,
including new violations.  Pet., ¶
9.  Padilla set an inspection date for
November 9, 2022.  Pet., ¶ 9.
On October 24, 2022, Broadway spoke with DPH’s Chief
Inspector Nash to address concerns regarding Inspector Padilla’s approach to
the inspection process.  Pet., ¶ 10.  Broadway claimed that Padilla predetermined
what new violations would be included in the inspection report before the
inspection began.  Pet., ¶ 10.  Broadway asked that Padilla be replaced as
the inspector for the November 9, 2022 inspection.  Pet., ¶ 10. 
DPH refused to replace Padilla but agreed to assign another inspector to
jointly inspect the Property with Padilla on October 27, 2022.  Pet., ¶ 10.
On October 27, 2022, Inspectors Padilla and Martinez arrived
at the Property for an inspection.  Pet.,
¶ 11.  The Inspectors declined to inspect
the units because the tenants were absent. 
Pet., ¶ 11.  Broadway emailed
Chief Inspector Nash to complain that the inspection could have proceeded
without the tenants present and the Inspectors’ refusal to proceed in the
tenants’ absence indicated a pattern of unfair conduct favoring tenants.  Pet., ¶ 11, Ex. 8.  Broadway voiced these same concerns in an
email sent on October 31, 2022.  Pet., ¶
12, Ex.9.
In response, Chief Inspector Nash set a new inspection date
of November 10, 2022.  Pet., ¶ 12.  Nash indicated during a phone conversation
that DPH would accept photographs of completed work and close the inspection if
the tenants were not present on November 10, 2022.  Pet., ¶ 10, Ex. 9. 
On November 9, 2022, Nash advised Broadway that it would
have to fumigate for rodents, explaining that the prior services were for
roaches.  Pet., ¶ 13.  Broadway responded by e-mail to Nash and
complained that the process seemed pointless because DPH refused to accept and
trust the reports of third party vendors. 
Pet., ¶ 13.
On November 10, 2022, Inspectors Padilla and Martinez
inspected the Property.  Pet., ¶ 15.  Afterwards, DPH issued a report adding a new
violation for rodents only, clearing all other violations and providing a new
inspection date of November 24, 2022. 
Pet., ¶ 15, Ex.11.
On November 14, 2022, Broadway and DPH’s agents had a
conference call.  Pet., ¶ 16.  Broadway voiced concern over the method by
which DPH’s inspectors were conducting the inspections.  Pet, ¶ 16. 
Broadway also indicated that the tenants had been planting evidence for
the violations to keep the case file on the Property open.  Pet., ¶ 16. 
DPH’s agents indicated Broadway would have to walk the Property with the
pest control company to determine potential paths of rodent entry, have the
pest company revisit the Property to verify the work, and provide a clean
report indicating there were no outstanding issues with rodent entry.  Pet., ¶ 16, Ex. 12.
Broadway complied with DPH’s orders regarding the rodent
entry issues and all repairs and pest control company inspections were
completed on December 8, 2022.  Pet., ¶
17.  Broadway forwarded a completed
report from Pest Innovations to DHP Branch Director Contreras on December 13,
2022.  Pet., ¶ 17, Ex. 13.  On December 21, 2022, Chief Inspector Nash
requested more pictures of the work completed, about which Broadway complained
on December 23, 2022.  Pet., ¶ 18, Ex.
14.
On January 12, 2023, Inspectors Castillo and Nareh
Derhartounyan inspected the Property. 
Pet., ¶ 19.  Although there were
no rodents found, new violations were issued for rat droppings not cleaned up
by the tenants.  Pet., ¶ 20.  A February 8, 2023 e-mail to Broadway
scheduled an inspection for the next day, February 9, 2023.  Pet., ¶ 21.
On February 9, 2023, Inspectors Castillo and Derhartounyan
inspected the premises.  Pet., ¶ 22.  The violations for rodent droppings from the
January 12, 2023 inspection were closed. 
Pet., ¶ 22.  A new violation for
rodent droppings in a new location in the unit was added and an inspection date
was set for February 23, 2023.  Pet., ¶
22, Ex. 9.
The inspection was rescheduled for March 9, 2023 at
Broadway’s request.  Pet., ¶¶ 23-27.  On March 9, 2023, Inspectors Carillo and
Jordan Teramae inspected the Property and all violations were closed except for
one based on a tenant complaint that there were roaches inside an electrical
outlet.  Pet., ¶ 27.  Another inspection was set for March 29, 2023
and later rescheduled for April 6, 2023. 
Pet., ¶ 27.
On April 6, 2023, Inspectors Castillo and Vasquez inspected
the Property and added seven new violations. 
Pet., ¶ 30.  An inspection was set
for April 20, 2023.  Pet., ¶ 30.  The inspection was rescheduled for May 9,
2023.  Pet., ¶ 31.
On May 9, 2023, Inspectors Castillo and Vasquez inspected
the Property and added more violations, including a damaged and removed screen
door on the balcony.  Pet., ¶ 31.  An inspection was scheduled for May 23, 2023
and rescheduled for June 6, 2023.  Pet.,
¶¶ 32-33.  Broadway asked that the
inspection be rescheduled, and DPH unilaterally set the inspection date for
July 25, 2023.  Pet., ¶ 34.  The inspection date was rescheduled for
August 15, 2023 by Inspector Castillo. 
Pet., ¶ 34.
Broadway e-mailed DHP on August 3, 2023, objecting to the
fact that the inspection had been open for one year and yet DPH refused to
close the inspection.  Pet., ¶ 34.  Broadway also asked that the inspection date
be rescheduled.  Pet., ¶ 34.
Broadway did not receive a response rescheduling the
inspection date.  Pet., ¶ 37.  Broadway's agent awaited the DPH inspectors
at the Property on August 15, 2023. 
Pet., ¶ 37.  No agent appeared.  Pet., ¶ 38. 
On August 23, 2023, Broadway emailed DPH, objecting to the
failure of its inspectors to maintain neutrality in inspecting the Property.  Pet., ¶ 38. 
Broadway also alleged that the tenants were sabotaging the inspections
to keep the DPH file open on the Property. 
Broadway requested a meeting regarding the DPH file on the Property.  In response, DPH manager Michelle Tsiebos, threatened
an enforcement action against Broadway if the violations set forth in the May
9, 2023 inspection report remained unresolved. 
Pet., ¶ 38, Ex. 32.
After this threatened enforcement action, Broadway filed the
Petition on September 5, 2023.
 
a.      Prayer
for Relief
Petitioner Broadway asks that a writ of mandate issue
pursuant to CCP section 1094.5, compelling Respondent County to vacate the Notice
and Order to Comply of August 3, 2022. Broadway also asked the court to state

this matter. Broadway seeks an award of fees and costs pursuant to CCP section
1021.5.
 
2. Course of Proceedings
On September 14, 2023, Petitioner Broadway served Respondent
County with the Petition by personal service. 
On November 13, 2023, Respondent filed a demurrer.  On February 1, 2024, the court overruled the
demurrer and ordered Respondent to file an Answer in 20 days. 
On February 21, 2024, Respondent filed their Answer. 
 
B. Governing Law
1. Los Angeles
County Code
The County of Los
Angeles director of public health, by and through authorized representatives, shall
have the authority and duty to make periodic and routine surveys and
inspections of all buildings and other premises and places used or intended for
use for living quarters, and shall enforce ordinances of Los Angeles County
pertaining to the public health and sanitary matters, and statutes relating to
the public health.  Los Angeles County
Code §§ 11.02.030, 11.02.040.
 
2. Attorney Fees
“A trial court may
order a party, the party’s attorney, or both, to pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred by another party as a result of actions or
tactics, made in bad faith, that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary
delay. This section also applies to judicial arbitration proceedings under
Chapter 2.5 (commencing with Section 1141.10) of Title 3 of Part 3.” CCP §128.5(a).
“Upon motion, a
court may award attorneys’ fees to a successful party against one or more
opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an
important right affecting the public interest if: (a) a significant benefit,
whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, has been conferred on the general public or
a large class of persons, (b) the necessity and financial burden of private
enforcement, or of enforcement by one public entity against another public
entity, are such as to make the award appropriate, and (c) such fees should not
in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery, if any. With respect to
actions involving public entities, this section applies to allowances against,
but not in favor of, public entities, and no claim shall be required to be
filed therefor, unless one or more successful parties and one or more opposing
parties are public entities, in which case no claim shall be required to be
filed therefor under Part 3 (commencing with Section 900) of Division 3.6 of Title
1 of the Government Code.” CCP § 1021.5. 
“In any civil action
to appeal or review the award, finding, or other determination of any
administrative proceeding under this code or under any other provision of state
law, except actions resulting from actions of the Department of General
Services, if it is shown that the award, finding, or other determination of the
proceeding was the result of arbitrary or capricious action or conduct by a
public entity or an officer thereof in his or her official capacity, the
complainant if he or she prevails in the civil action may collect from the
public entity reasonable attorney’s fees, computed at one hundred dollars
($100) per hour, but not to exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars
($7,500), if he or she is personally obligated to pay the fees in addition to
any other relief granted or other costs awarded.” Gov. Code § 800(a).
 
D. Analysis
Petitioner Broadway seeks
a writ of administrative mandamus compelling Respondent County to vacate the
Notice and Order to Comply of August 3, 2022. 
At the February 15, 2024 trial setting conference, the court
set trial on May 16, 2024.  The parties’
counsel agreed that they would stipulate to a briefing schedule.  Broadway’s counsel was directed to lodge a
trial notebook, a memory stick containing the parties' briefs in editable
Microsoft Word format, and evidence binder no later than May 6, 2024.
Following the trial setting conference, County’s counsel sent
an email to Broadway’s counsel suggesting that the case be dismissed in light
of the abatement of the August 3, 2022 violations at issue, as reflected in a
February 13, 2024 DHP inspection report. 
Jensen Decl., ¶2.  Receiving no
response, County’s counsel sent March 29 and April 5 emails, and March 29 and
made April 17 phone calls, to the office of Broadway’s counsel.  Jensen Decl., ¶6.  He reached a paralegal on April 19 and
discussed briefing deadlines, but with no date for Broadway’s opening
brief.  Jensen Decl., ¶6.  
County’s counsel spoke again with the paralegal on April 25,
but again no indication was forthcoming on when Broadway would file its opening
brief.  Jensen Decl., ¶7.  Although he and the paralegal agreed to speak
on April 29, there was no contact that week. 
Jensen Decl., ¶8.
County’s counsel prepared and filed an opposition on May 3,
2024.  Jensen Decl., ¶8.  At that time, Broadway had not filed an
opening brief.  Jensen Decl., ¶8.  County’s counsel also lodged the
administrative record and a memory stick. 
Jensen Decl., ¶9.
On May 7, the Dept. 85 clerk emailed all counsel about the
failure of Broadway’s counsel to lodge a trial notebook, memory stick, and
evidence binder.  Jensen Decl., ¶10.  Broadway’s counsel did not respond to the
clerk’s email.  Jensen Decl., ¶10.  On May 7, 2024, Broadway served its trial
brief by email.  Jensen Decl., ¶10.
County objects to Broadway’s trial brief, filed on May 7,
2024.  Broadway’s trial brief was not
filed pursuant to a stipulated briefing schedule as counsel agreed, and in fact
is untimely even under CCP section 1005 as it was filed seven court days, not
16 court days, before the instant trial date. 
The objection is sustained, and the trial brief is stricken.
County explains that the case is mooted by a February 13,
2024 reinspection which determined that the violations at the Property have
been abated.  “Although a case may
originally present an existing controversy, if before decision it has, through
the acts of the parties or other cause, occurring after commencement of the
action, lost that essential character, it becomes a moot case or question which
will not be considered by the court.”  Wilson
v. Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission, (1952) 112 Cal.App.2d 450,
453; Colony Cove Props., LLC v. City of
Carson, (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 1487, 1509. 
"The pivotal question in determining if a case is moot is []
whether the court can grant the plaintiff any effectual relief."  Giles
v. Horn, (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 206, 227 (claim that county failed to make
required findings to approve contracts rendered moot by contract extensions
which were the operative agreements); Eye Dog Foundation v. State Bd. of Guide Dogs
for the Blind, (“Eye Dog Foundation”) (1967) 67 Cal. 2d 536,
541.     
The case is ordered dismissed as moot.[1]
