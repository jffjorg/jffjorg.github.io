TENTATIVE RULING

Torrance First Presbyterian Church Corporation’s Motions
to Compel The Hot Mopper’s Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and for Monetary Sanctions are moot, in part, and
denied, in part. 
 
Background
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint was filed on January 9, 2023. The
Second Amended Complaint was filed on October 5, 2023. Plaintiff alleges the
following facts. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into an agreement whereby
Plaintiff agreed to do roofing work on Defendant’s building. Defendant failed
to pay for goods and services rendered. Defendant filed a Cross-Complaint on
November 7, 2023.
 
Motions to
Compel
 
CCP § 2030.290 states: “If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following
rules apply…The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories.” (CCP § 2030.290(b).)  
 
Defendant served upon Plaintiff Form Interrogatories,
Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One on January 29, 2024. (Decls., Cindy
J. Lee, ¶¶ 3-5.) Defendant contends that no responses were served to the
requests. (Id.) On April 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed written oppositions to the
motions and attached the verified responses that were apparently served on
March 13, 2024.
 
Therefore, the motions to compel responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One are deemed moot.

 
Sanctions
 
Defendant’s requests for monetary sanctions are denied.
 
Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.040 states, in relevant part:
“A request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every
person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify
the type of sanction sought.” 
 
Here, the notices of the motions failed to identify
every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanctions are sought.
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
