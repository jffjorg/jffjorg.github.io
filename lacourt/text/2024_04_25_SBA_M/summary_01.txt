And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the motions to compel responses to interrogatories and for monetary sanctions. The motions are deemed moot because the plaintiff has already served responses to the interrogatories. The request for monetary sanctions is denied because the notice of motion failed to identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanctions are sought.
