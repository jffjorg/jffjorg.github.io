And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and complaint. The defendant, Hector Gramajo dba Swiss Cleaners, claimed that he was not properly served with the summons and complaint. The plaintiff, Green Bay Properties, LP, argued that the defendant was properly served via substituted service on December 13, 2023, after four attempts to personally serve him. The judge found that the declaration of diligence by the process server, Frank Navarro, established that the summons and complaint could not be personally delivered to the defendant after four attempts. The judge also found that the defendant's claims that he was not present on the dates and times of service and that the subject address was not his business address were not credible. The judge concluded that the defendant was properly served and denied the motion to quash.
