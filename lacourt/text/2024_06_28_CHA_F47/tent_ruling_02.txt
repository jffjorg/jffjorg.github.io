SERVICE OF SUMMONS
 
Motion filed on 5/23/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Hector Gramajo dba Swiss Cleaners
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Green Bay Properties, LP
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order quashing service of
summons and complaint on Defendant Hector Gramajo dba Swiss Cleaners.  
 
RULING: The motion is denied.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On 12/8/23, Plaintiff Green Bay Properties, LP (Plaintiff)
filed this commercial unlawful detainer action against Defendants Hector
Gramajo dba Swiss Cleaners (Hector) and Edwin Gramajo dba Swiss Cleaners
(Edwin).  
 
On 1/8/24, Plaintiff filed a proof of service of summons
which indicates that after 4 failed attempts to personally serve Hector at the
subject property address (9065 Woodman Avenue, Pacoima, CA 91331), Hector was
served via substituted service on 12/13/23 at 1:04 p.m. (the fourth attempt) by
leaving the summons and complaint and related documents with “Carmen Doe, authorized
employee to accept service of process” at the property address and thereafter
mailing the documents to the same address. 

 
On 5/23/24, Hector filed and served the instant motion to
quash service of summons which originally had a 1/15/25 hearing date.  On 5/31/24, Plaintiff filed and served an
opposition to the motion to quash.  On 6/13/24,
the Court granted Plaintiff’s ex parte application to advance the hearing date
on the motion to quash and specially set the hearing for 6/21/24 ordering any
opposition to be filed by 6/18/24 and any reply to be filed by noon on 6/20/24.  (See 6/13/24 Minute Orders and Nunc
Pro Tunc Order).  The Court mailed notice
of the ruling on 6/14/24.  (See
Certificate of Mailing filed 6/13/24).
 
On 6/21/24, the hearing was continued to 6/28/24, based
on representations that defense counsel was unaware of the 6/21/24 hearing
date.  (See 6/21/24 Minute
Order).  On 6/21/24, Plaintiff filed and
served a Notice of Errata for Plaintiff’s Opposition to the motion.  On 6/26/24, Hector filed and served a reply
to the opposition to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
When a defendant challenges the court’s personal
jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process, the plaintiff bears
the burden of establishing jurisdiction with facts showing effective
service.  See Summers
(2006) 140 CA4th 403, 413 citing Dill (1994) 24 CA4th 1426, 1439-1440.  The fact that defendant has notice of the
action is not sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction on the defendant.  MJS Enterprises, Inc. (1984) 153 CA3d
555, 557.
 
Hector contends that he was not properly served in this
matter.  Despite the declaration of
diligence attached to the proof of service on Hector, Hector contends that
Plaintiff did not attempt to personally serve him, as required, before serving
him via substituted service.   (See
Hector Gramajo Decl.; German Decl.).  Additionally,
Hector contends that substituted service on him at the subject address is
improper because although he signed a lease for the premises in 2014, that
lease expired and he has not worked at the premises for 12 years. (See
Hector Gramajo Decl.).  
 
Plaintiff opposes the motion on the ground that it was
scheduled for hearing more than 7 days after the filing of the notice.  See CCP 1167.4.  Plaintiff further contends that Hector was
properly served via substituted service as evidenced by the declaration of a
California registered process server which creates a presumption that the
service was valid.  See Evidence
Code 1271; Government Code 26662, 71265; Business & Professions Code 22350;
CCP 415.20(b)
 
CCP 415.20(b) provides: 
 
“If a copy of the summons and
complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the
person to be served, as specified in Section
416.60, 416.70, 416.80,
or 416.90,
a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the
person's dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or
usual mailing address other than a United States Postal Service post office
box, in the presence of a competent member of the household or a person
apparently in charge of his or her office, place of business, or usual mailing
address other than a United States Postal Service post office box, at least 18
years of age, who shall be informed of the contents thereof, and by thereafter
mailing a copy of the summons and of the complaint by first-class mail, postage
prepaid to the person to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and
complaint were left. Service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete on
the 10th day after the mailing.”
 
The Court finds that the declaration of diligence by
California registered process server, Frank Navarro, is sufficient to establish
that the summons and complaint could not with reasonable diligence be
personally delivered to Hector Gramajo after 4 attempts.  Since Hector was not present on those dates
and times, he cannot attest to whether service attempts were made as
claimed.  While Carmen Maria Lugo German
states that her regular working hours are from 7 am to 5 pm, Monday through
Saturday and she claims that she is not aware of anyone coming to the subject
premises before 5/8/24 to serve the lawsuit, German does not state that she is
the only one present during those times and/or that she was present on the
specific dates and times Navarro attempted to personally serve Hector.  (See German Decl.).
 
Hector’s claim that the subject address is not his
business address also does not ring true. 
Hector has filed the motion as Hector Gramajo dba Swiss Cleaners
indicating that he still does business as Swiss Cleaners which seemingly still
occupies the premises.  (See
Motion, p.1:25).  Additionally, contrary
to Hector’s assertion, the lease he signed in May of 2014 was for 5 years, not
1 year.  (See Complaint, Ex.1, ¶2;
Hector Gramajo Decl. ¶7).  Also, the
lease provides that if the tenant, with the landlord’s written consent, holds
over after the termination of the lease, the tenant becomes a month-to-month
tenant.  (See Complaint, Ex.1,
¶19).  Further, Hector’s claim that he
has not worked at the premises for 12 years does not make sense because he
signed a 5-year lease for the premises approximately 10 years ago, in May of
2014.  (Hector Gramajo Decl. ¶8;
Complaint, Ex.1).
 
For the reasons set forth above, Hector and German’s
claims that the summons and complaint were not mailed to the subject address
also lack credibility.  
 
As such, the Court finds that Hector was properly served
with the summons and complaint in this action via substituted service.
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The motion is denied.
