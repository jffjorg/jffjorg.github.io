SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of the care and treatment provided
to Plaintiff Vladimir Angulo Sanchez 
(Plaintiff) by Defendants Jaime D. Hernandez, M.D. (Dr. Hernandez);
Northridge Hospital Medical Center (Northridge Hospital) and Dignity Health (collectively,
Defendants) after Plaintiff was struck by a motor vehicle on or about 11/24/22.
 
After Plaintiff was admitted to the emergency room at
Northridge Hospital, diagnostic studies revealed a comminuted displaced
fracture of Plaintiff’s left huermal head and neck.  (Complaint ¶12).  Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Hernandez was
consulted on 11/29/22, and recommended that Plaintiff undergo an open reduction
internal fixation (ORIF) for the left humeral fracture.  (Complaint ¶13).  Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Hernandez performed
the ORIF surgery on 11/29/22.  The
procedure involved the placement of hardware and screws.  (Complaint ¶14).  Plaintiff then alleges that he developed
pain, discomfort and limitation of range of motion in his left shoulder
following the surgery.  (Complaint ¶16).  Plaintiff alleges that he continued to have
pain and that on 4/21/23, it was “discovered that the fixation screw projecting
into the glenohumeral joint space was the likely cause of his pain, discomfort
and limited range of motion in plaintiff’s left shoulder.”  (Complaint ¶20).  Plaintiff alleges that “on October 3, 2023,
Plaintiff was scheduled for and underwent a second surgery (hardware removal).  Plaintiff reported significant relief
following the October 3, 2023, hardware removal surgery.”  (Complaint ¶23). 
 
On 2/27/24, Plaintiff filed this action against
Defendants for: (1) Professional Negligence, (2) Breach of Fiduciary Duty and
(3) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.  After Plaintiff’s counsel failed to respond
to Northridge Hospital’s counsel’s meet and confer efforts regarding the issues
Northridge Hospital has with the complaint, on 5/8/24, Northridge Hospital
Medical Center (erroneously sued as “Northridge Hospital Medical Center” and
“Dignity Health”) (Northridge Hospital) filed and served the instant demurrer
to the 2nd and 3rd causes of action and the motion strike
which seeks to strike the prayer for punitive damages.  (See Reid Decl.).  Plaintiff has opposed the demurrer and motion
to strike and Northridge Hospital has filed replies to the oppositions.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
2nd cause of action – Breach of Fiduciary
Duty
 
The elements of a breach of fiduciary duty cause of
action are: (1) a fiduciary duty owed by defendant to plaintiff, (2) breach of
that duty, and (3) damage caused by the breach. 
Stanley (1995) 35 CA4th 1070, 1086.  Plaintiff has failed to allege facts to
establish that Northridge Hospital owed him a fiduciary duty.  
 
To support the argument that Plaintiff has properly
stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Northridge Hospital,
Plaintiff cites the following case law:
 
The doctor-patient relationship is
an archetypal fiduciary relationship. (See Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 748, 54 Cal. Rptr. 3d 527 ["The doctor-patient
relationship is a fiduciary one and as a consequence of the physician's
'fiducial' obligations, the physician is prohibited from misrepresenting the
nature of the patient's medical condition"]; Mathis v. Morrissey (1992)
11 Cal.App.4th 332, 339, 13 Cal. Rptr. 2d 819 ["a physician has a
fiduciary duty to disclose all information material to the patient's
decision" to consent to treatment]; Moore v. Regents of the Univ. of
California (1990) 51 Cal.3d 120, 129, 271 Cal. Rptr. 146, 793 P.2d 479.
 
(See Opposition, p.5:5-10).
 
Based on the opposition, it appears that Plaintiff is
attempting to impose respondeat superior liability on Northridge Hospital for
the conduct allegedly committed by Dr. Hernandez.  
However, Plaintiff has not alleged any facts to establish
that Dr. Hernandez is an employee or agent of Northridge Hospital.  (See Complaint, generally).    
 
Even if Plaintiff had alleged that Dr. Hernandez was an
employee/agent of Northridge Hospital, as set forth in the Court’s order
sustaining Dr. Hernandez’s demurrer to the 2nd cause of action,
Plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to support a finding that Dr.
Hernandez breached a fiduciary duty owed to Plaintiff.  (See 5/29/24 Minute Order).  Specifically, Plaintiff has failed to plead
any facts indicating that Dr. Hernandez misrepresented the nature of
Plaintiff’s medical condition and/or failed to disclose all information
material to Plaintiff decision to consent to treatment.  (See Complaint, generally).  Additionally, as previously noted by the
Court in its 5/29/24 ruling, Plaintiff has not alleged any facts to indicate
that in seeking Plaintiff’s consent for treatment, Dr. Hernandez failed to
disclose any personal interests unrelated to Plaintiff’s health, whether
research or economic, that may have affected Dr. Hernandez’s medical judgment.  See Moore, supra at 129,
131-132.  Similarly, Plaintiff has failed
to allege any facts to support the conclusion that “the conduct of Dr.
Hernandez was intentional and meant to mutilate and injure the plaintiff.”  (See Complaint ¶38).  The general allegations of the complaint only
refer to the alleged “negligent conduct” of the defendants, not any intentional
misconduct aimed at injuring Plaintiff. 
(See Complaint ¶24).     
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient
facts to support a finding that Northridge Hospital owed him a fiduciary duty or
breached a fiduciary duty owed to him which are necessary elements of a breach
of fiduciary duty cause of action.  See
Stanley, supra; Pellegrini (2008) 165 CA4th 515, 524.  
 
3rd cause of action – Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress
 
The elements of an intentional infliction of emotional
distress cause of action are: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the
defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the
probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff’s suffering
severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of
the emotional distress by the defendant’s outrageous conduct.  Plotnik (2012) 208 CA4th 1590, 1609; Hughes
(2009) 46 C4th 1035, 1050-1051.  To
support the first element of the claim, the alleged conduct must be “so extreme
as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized
community.”  Cochran (1998) 65
CA4th 488, 494; See also Melorich Builders, Inc. (1984) 160 CA3d
931, 936.
 
Plaintiff has failed to plead any facts which show
Northridge Hospital committed the type of extreme and outrageous conduct
necessary to support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress
or that Northridge Hospital intended to cause Plaintiff emotional distress.  
 
To the extent Plaintiff relies on conduct allegedly
committed by Dr. Hernandez to support a claim for intentional infliction of
emotional distress against Northridge Hospital, as noted above, Plaintiff has
failed to plead any facts to support imposing vicarious liability on Northridge
Hospital for Dr. Hernandez’s conduct. 
Additionally, even if Plaintiff had alleged that Dr. Hernandez was an
employee or agent of Northridge Hospital, Plaintiff has failed to plead any
facts to support the conclusory allegations that Dr. Hernandez’s actions were
intended to cause Plaintiff emotional distress and/or that Dr. Hernandez
deliberately attempted to mutilate and/or harm Plaintiff emotionally and/or
acted maliciously.  (See Complaint
¶¶41, 45).  
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer is sustained.  Due to the liberal policy of allowing leave
to amend and because this is only the original complaint, Plaintiff is given
the opportunity to try to cure the defects in his 2nd and 3rd
causes of action.  
 
The motion to strike is moot as it seeks to strike the
Prayer for punitive damages in relation to  the 3rd cause of action and the non-existent
4th cause of action.  
 
A First Amended Complaint is due on or before Monday,
7/15/24.  The Court notes that on
5/29/24, the demurrer of Dr. Hernandez was sustained with 45 days leave to
amend making an amended complaint due on or before 7/15/24 as the 45th
day fell on Saturday, 7/13/24.
