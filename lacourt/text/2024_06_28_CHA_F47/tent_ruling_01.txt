RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Marco A. Rodriguez
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
setting aside the default entered against Defendant Maryam Soheili on 11/27/23
and allowing Defendant to file an answer to the complaint.  
 
RULING: The motion is granted.  Defendant Maryam Soheili is ordered to
separately file her Answer to the Amended Complaint which is attached to the
motion as Ex.F.
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises from Plaintiff Marco A. Rodriguez’s
(Plaintiff) claim that a wrought iron fence and pillar from the neighboring
property, owned by Defendant Maryam Soheili (Defendant), are encroaching on his
property.  Plaintiff’s operative Amended
Complaint contains causes of action against Defendant for:
(1) Injunction to Remove Continuing Encroachment and (2) Injunction to Abate
Continuing Nuisance.  
 
On 10/16/23, Plaintiff filed a proof of service which
indicates that Defendant was served by substituted service at 17603 Sunburst
Street, Northridge, CA 91325 on 8/18/23 at 7:22 pm by leaving the Amended
Summons, Amended Complaint and various other documents with “Maryam ‘Jane Doe’
Soheili, claimed she was not defendant Maryam Soheili after she had already
claimed she was.”  (See Proof of
Substituted Service filed 10/16/23).  On
10/16/23, the documents were mailed to the same address where the substituted service
was effected.  Id.  
 
On 11/27/23, default was entered against Defendant.  After attempts to have Plaintiff stipulate to
have the default set aside failed, on 5/15/24, Defendant filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order setting aside the default entered against
Defendant on 11/27/23 and allowing Defendant to file an answer to the
complaint.  (See McCall
Decl).  Plaintiff has opposed the motion
and Defendant has filed a reply to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
The opposition seems to argue that Defendant had actual
notice of the lawsuit because she was personally served with same in August of
2023.  While the process server has
declared: “I know it was [Defendant] because Defendant identified her self
[sic] as Maryam and instructed to drop the documents in the mail box [sic]
right before service.  Claimed after she
was not Maryam,” the process server still marked the box indicating that
Defendant was served with the amended summons and amended complaint in this matter
by substituted service, not by personal service.  (See Proof of Service filed 10/16/23
and Declaration attached thereto).  
 
CCP 473(b) is to be liberally construed with any doubts
as to the propriety of setting aside the default to be resolved in favor of
deciding an action on the merits.  Berman
(1971) 17 CA3d 900, 910; Mink (1992) 2 CA4th 1338, 1343.  Therefore, the Court finds that it must view
the contradiction within the proof of service in favor of Defendant.  As such, the Court finds that Defendant was
served by substituted service (i.e., the documents were not delivered to
Defendant) which was not complete until 10 days after mailing on 10/16/23.  CCP 415.20(b).  
 
Plaintiff does not refute that Defendant was out of the
country at the time service was complete in October 2023 or that Defendant did
not return home/to the United States until mid-December 2023 which was after
the default was entered on 11/27/23.  (See
Soheili Decl. ¶11; Rastegar Decl. ¶¶4-6); (Opposition, generally).  Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that
Defendant did not have actual notice of the action in time to defend.  CCP 473.5. 
Alternatively, Defendant has made a sufficient showing that the default
was entered as a result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise and/or excusable
neglect.  CCP 473(b).  Similarly, the Court finds that Defendant has
made a sufficient showing that she failed to discover the documents had been
mailed to her until late January/early February 2024 as a result of excusable
neglect.  (Soheili Decl. ¶12).  
 
The Court also finds that Defendant and her attorney
acted reasonably in seeking to informally have the default set aside and filing
the instant motion once their efforts proved unsuccessful.  As such, the motion was timely filed within 6
months of the entry of default.  See
CCP 473(b); CCP 473.5(a)  
 
The Court finds that sanctions against Defendant are not
warranted as Plaintiff could have avoided the fees and costs incurred in opposing
the motion by stipulating to have the default set aside considering Plaintiff’s
proof of service shows that the Defendant was served by substituted service
which was not complete until Defendant was out of the country and default was
entered before Defendant returned.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Defendant is ordered to separately file her answer to the Amended
Complaint on or before 7/1/24.   
   
The Court notes that both Defendant and Plaintiff have failed to
electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to their papers.  See CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  The parties are warned that failure to comply
with this rule in the future may result in matters being continued so that
papers can be resubmitted in compliance, papers not being consider
