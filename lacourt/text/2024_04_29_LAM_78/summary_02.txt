**Demurrer Sustained**

The court sustains the demurrer to the second amended complaint (SAC) filed by Plaintiffs against Defendants Wilmington Trust, Wells Fargo, and Structured Asset Mortgage Investment II Trust 2007-AR7, Inc.

**Grounds for Demurrer**

The demurrer is sustained on the grounds that:

1. Defendants Wilmington Trust and Wells Fargo to submit a proposed judgment within 10 days after the date of this order.
