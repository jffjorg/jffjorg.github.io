Plaintiff alleges that he purchased a home after obtaining a mortgage from American Home Mortgage Investment Corp. After the lender filed for bankruptcy, Chase, without consideration, falsely conveyed the deed to a Chase entity called SAMI II, a pool of mortgages bundled together by a pooling agreement. In November 2012, Chase initiated nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings against Plaintiff. After Plaintiff transferred the property to Soames Lane Trust, the trust filed for bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court lifted the automatic stay in 2020 and again after the trust filed for bankruptcy a second time. Chase held a foreclosure sale in October 2022. PROCEDURAL HISTORY On December 5, 2022, the first amended complaint was filed naming as defendants the moving parties and others.On June 13, 2023, the Court sustained demurrers to the first amended complaint. filed by the moving parties. Plaintiffs were given leave to amend.On November 9, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”).On January 8, 2024, Defendants the Wilmington Trust and Wells Fargo (“Movants”) filed this demurrer to the SAC.On April 16, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their opposition.On April 22, 2024, Movants filed their reply.DISCUSSION Movants demur to the SAC on the grounds that (1) Plaintiffs lack standing to bring this action, (2) Structured Asset Mortgage Investment II Trust 2007-AR7, Inc. does not exist, and (3) the SAC fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for wrongful foreclosure against Movants.A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 (internal citations omitted).)Meet and ConferA party filing a demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., section 430.41(a).) “The parties shall meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least five days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why the parties could not meet and confer.” (Code Civ. Proc., section 430.41(a)(2).) A failure to meet and confer does not constitute grounds to sustain or overrule a demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc., sections 430.41 (a)(4).)Here, Movants’ Counsel testifies that prior to filing the demurrer, he met and conferred with Plaintiffs’ counsel and the parties could not resolve their dispute over the SAC. (Fink Decl., ¶6.) Movants have satisfied meet and confer requirements.Judicial NoticeMovants request judicial notice of the following:1.

(Exh. 14.)Plaintiffs also request judicial notice of the following:1. LASC Unlawful Detainer Case Summary Case No. 23STUD046062. SAMI II Supplemental Prospectus filed with the SEC on September 17, 2007The requests are GRANTED. However, the Court is not considering the judgment and commitment order which has no relevance here. Analysis1. StandingMovants first demur to the SAC on the grounds that Grover Henry Colin Nix IV (Nix IV) does not have standing to bring any cause of action. Movants also allege that Grover Henry Nix III (Nix III) lacks any individual standing to sue. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 367, “every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest, except as otherwise provided by statute.”   “Generally, the real party in interest is the person who has the right to sue under the substantive law. It is the person who owns or holds title to the claim or property involved, as opposed to others who may be interested or benefited by the litigation…Real party in interest issues are often discussed in terms of plaintiff’s ‘standing to sue.’” “The purpose of the real party in interest requirement is to assure that any judgment rendered will bar the owner of the claim sued upon against relitigating. ‘It is to save a defendant, against whom a judgment may be obtained, against further harassment or vexation at the hands of some other claimant to the same demand.’” (O’Flaherty v. Belgum (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 1044, 1094.)  Here, as with Movants’ first demurrer, Nix IV lacks standing to bring this action because he no longer owns the subject property because he transferred title to the subject property to the Soames Trust. Nix IV is neither the Trustee of Soames, nor is he a party to the Promissory Note or Deed of Trust. (SAC Exhs. B-E.) Because Nix IV lacks standing to bring this action, the demurrer is sustained as to Nix IV. A demurrer should be sustained without leave to amend if there is no reasonable possibility the issues can be cured. The burden is on a plaintiff to demonstrate how the complaint may be amended to cure the deficiencies. This is the second time that the Court has sustained a demurrer on this issue. Plaintiffs failed to cure the problem and offer no cure for the defect now. Movants also demur to the SAC on the grounds that Nix III lacks any individual standing to sue. Although Nix III is not the owner of the subject property, he is a party to the Promissory Note and Deed of Trust because he signed those documents in his individual capacity, not as Trustee for Soames. Because Nix III is a party to those contracts, he has standing regarding enforcement of the Promissory Note and Deed of Trust.The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend as to Nix IV and overruled as to Nix III on this ground.2. SAMI IIMovants next argue that the SAC improperly named Structured Asset Mortgage Investment II Trust 2007-AR7, Inc. as a defendant because such an entity does not exist. Currently, Structured Asset Mortgage Investment II Trust 2007-AR7, Inc. is only named in the SAC. Plaintiffs have not yet effectuated service on this entity, likely because it does not exist. This issue has been raised before and an OSC Re: Sanctions for Failure to Timely to File Proof of Service is set for June.  The Court overrules the demurrer as to Structured Asset Mortgage Investment II Trust 2007-AR7, Inc. as premature. 3. Wrongful ForeclosureMovants finally argue that the SAC fails to plead facts that support a wrongful foreclosure cause of action. “A wrongful foreclosure is a common law tort claim. It is an equitable action to set aside a foreclosure sale, or an action for damages resulting from the sale, on the basis that the foreclosure was improper.”¿ (Sciarratta v. U.S. Bank Nat’l Assn. (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 552, 561.)  The plaintiff must allege that: “(1) the trustee or mortgagee caused an illegal, fraudulent, or willfully oppressive sale of real property pursuant to a power of sale in a mortgage or deed of trust; (2) the party attacking the sale (usually but not always the trustor or mortgagor) was prejudiced or harmed; and (3) in cases where the trustor or mortgagor challenges the sale, the trustor or mortgagor tendered the amount of the secured indebtedness or was excused from tendering.” (Id. at 561-62.)¿“[M]ere technical violations of the foreclosure process will not give rise to a tort claim; the foreclosure must have been entirely unauthorized on the facts of the case.”¿ (Id. at 562.)¿ Here, the SAC has not changed the allegation that Nix IV did not make mortgage payments for 33 months after entering into a loan modification agreement with Chase. (SAC ¶83.) As before, the facts of this case are most similar to those in Kalnoki v. First American Trustee Servicing Solutions, LLC (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 23, 33 (Kalnoki). There, the plaintiffs were in default on their mortgage when their creditor assigned its interest in the deed of trust on the disputed property to another creditor. The plaintiffs sued, alleging the underlying assignment was fraudulent or otherwise invalid and that the deed of trust was never properly assigned to the new creditor. The court held:An assignment merely substituted one creditor for another, without changing the Kalnokis' obligations under the note. The Kalnokis do not dispute that they defaulted on their loan. They have pleaded no facts indicating that the foreclosure sale, which has already occurred, would have been averted but for the alleged deficiencies in the foreclosure process nor that the original lender would have refrained from foreclosure under the circumstances presented.(Kalnoki at p. 48-49.) Here, as was the case in the first amended complaint to which Movants successfully demurred, the SAC states that the loan was in default because Nix IV failed to make payments on the loan. Like Kalnoki, Plaintiffs here also allege that the foreclosure was irregular because the underlying assignment to SAMI II was void. The SAC does not add any other facts alleging the foreclosure would have been averted but for the fraudulent transfer. Therefore, the SAC fails to state a cause of action for wrongful foreclosure against Movants. Plaintiffs focus on their argument that the assignment to the SAMI II trust was void and fail to address this defect in their opposition. The demurrer is sustained as to this cause of action. A demurrer should be sustained without leave to amend if there is no reasonable possibility the issues can be cured. The burden is on a plaintiff to demonstrate how the complaint may be amended to cure the deficiencies. This is the second time that the Court has sustained a demurrer on this issue. Plaintiffs failed to cure the problem and offer no cure for the defect at issue. Therefore, leave to amend is denied.The Court declines to rule on Movants’ remaining arguments.DATED: April 29, 2024__________________________Hon. Jill Feeney Judge of the Superior Court
