DISCUSSION
 
I.                   
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR EVIDENTIARY SANCTIONS,
ISSUE SANCTIONS, TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH THE COURT’S ORDER AND/OR TO COMPEL
FURTHER RESPONSES AS TO FORM INTERROGATORIES SETS ONE AND TWO PROPOUNDED
AGAINST DEFENDANT ANZA MANAGEMENT COMPANY 
 
Plaintiffs Clauda Calderon and Carlos Araujo
move this court for an order against Defendant Anza Management Company for
terminating sanctions, or alternatively, evidentiary sanctions and issue
sanctions to compel compliance with the court’s discovery order of December 8,
2023 and/or to compel further responses as to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories,
Set One and Set Two, based on Defendant’s ongoing willful failure and/or
refusal to comply in good faith with its discovery obligations. 
 
This is a text-book example of lawyers
over litigating a case, failing to cooperate in the discovery process, and
engaging in sloppy lawyering.   Both
sides are guilty, in different ways, for this behavior.  As explained below, the upshot of counsel’s
failure to work together and to communicate has been a huge expenditure of time
and effort with little to be shown for it on either side. 
As pointed out by plaintiff,
defendants’ opposition was untimely, as it was filed only two days before the
hearing.  This seems to be the order of
the day at defendant’s law firm, since the initial responses at issue in the
underlying motions to compel were served at 3 a.m. on the date of the hearing
(December 8, 2023) to consider plaintiff’s motion for further responses.  Nonetheless, plaintiff was able to file a
reply to the opposition on May 22.  In
the interest of deciding the case on the merits (particularly in light of the
severe request for terminating sanctions), the court continued the hearing on
the motion for terminating sanctions to June 11.  Rather than accepting defense counsel’s
explanation that his office was understaffed and that they made a calendaring mistake,
plaintiff then wasted time, excoriating counsel for not identifying which of
the attorney’s in his office actually had a dying or dead family member, or
using the paralegals they were able to discern worked for the firm.  This attack was unnecessary and simply poured
more fuel on the controversy between counsel.  

 
The court exercises its discretion to
consider the opposition so as to try to resolve this discovery dispute once and
for all.
 
Where a party fails to obey an order
compelling answers to discovery, “the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction.”  (CCP §§ 2030.290(c), 2023.010(c); R.S.
Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) 
The Court may impose a terminating sanction against anyone engaging in
conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process.  (CCP §
2023.030(d).)  Misuse of the discovery process includes failure to respond
to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying a court order to provide
discovery.  (CCP § 2023.010(d), (g).)  A terminating sanction may be
imposed by an order dismissing part or all of the action.  (CCP §
2023.030(d)(3).)   
 
The court should consider the totality
of the circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine if the actions
were willful, the determent to the propounding party, and the number of formal
and informal attempts to obtain discovery.  (Lang v. Hochman (2000)
77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)  If a lesser sanction fails to curb abuse, a
greater sanction is warranted.  (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) However, “the unsuccessful imposition of a lesser
sanction is not an absolute prerequisite to the utilization of the ultimate
sanction.” (Deyo v. Killbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771,
787.) Terminating sanctions should not be ordered lightly, but are
justified where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and
there is evidence that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
the discovery rules.  (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) 
 
Before any sanctions may be imposed the
court must make an express finding that there has been a willful failure of the
party to serve the required answers.  (Fairfield v. Superior Court for
Los Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.)  Lack of diligence
may be deemed willful where the party understood its obligation, had the
ability to comply, and failed to comply.  (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 787; Fred Howland Co. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles
County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605, 610-611.)  The party who failed to
comply with discovery obligations has the burden of showing that the failure
was not willful.  (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 788; Cornwall
v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500,
605.) 
 
Plaintiff seeks terminating sanctions
or, alternatively, evidentiary sanctions and/or issue sanctions precluding
Defendant from employing certain affirmative defenses since Defendant has
refused to provide code-compliant discovery responses relating to FROG
involving said affirmative defenses as the court ordered it to do in its
December 8, 2023 Order. Notwithstanding whether the court decides to assess
terminating, issue, and/or evidentiary sanctions, Plaintiffs request an award
of monetary sanctions in the amount of $7,935.00 against Defendant and its
attorneys of record, Ronald S. Whitaker, Esq. (current counsel) and Amie
Jacoby, Esq. (former counsel during many of these proceedings), and whatever
law firm or company they may belong, jointly and severally, to compensate them
for the expenses incurred in bringing the subject Motion. 
 
As explained in Defendant Anza’s opposition,
defendant actually served further responses to the underlying  discovery requests on December 8, with
verifications provided on January 3.  At
the hearing on December 8, defense counsel stated that they were willing to
provide further responses and that the further responses had been served in the
early morning hours.  Not surprisingly,
Plaintiff’s counsel stated at the hearing that they had not yet received
them.  The court then ruled simply that
the further responses had to be provided within 20 days.  The minute order does not clearly state that
the further responses defendant was willing to provide had to be served or the
responses plaintiff was requesting had to be served.  It could be read either way, and this court
has no recollection of what was actually stated or meant by the court’s
order.   In any event, it was not
unreasonable for defendant to conclude that it had complied with the court’s
December 8 order to provide further responses when it served further responses
that same day.  Thus, there is no
evidence of defendants deliberately disobeying a court order.  
 
After the December 8 hearing,
plaintiff’s counsel was apparently dissatisfied with the responses served that
same date.  A series of meet and confers
ensued.  Plaintiff was given various
extensions of time in which to bring a motion to compel further responses.  As best the court can determine, any motion
to compel further responses would have to have been brought within 45 days of
January 3, the date on which the verifications were served, which turns out to
be February 21, 2024 (due to service by email). 
That date could have been extended by mutual agreement of the parties,
even after February 19. (C.C.P. 2030.330(c); 2031.310(c).)  
 
Defendants argue that the agreement
they apparently reached on February 22, granting an extension to bring a  motion to compel, has no meaning.  The court discourages efforts to interpret an
agreement in such a convoluted manner as to render it meaningless.  Defendants do not deny that the agreement was
made.  The reasonable interpretation of
the agreement was that plaintiffs had 45 days from defendant providing further
supplemental responses (to remedy what was wrong with the December 8
responses), and that defendants had to provide those responses within 21
days.  If no responses were provided,
plaintiffs had 66 days to move to compel further responses to the original
December 8 responses.  Plaintiffs met
that deadline.   
 
            As
for the form interrogatories at issue, the court determines that further
responses are required for Form Interrogatory No. 4.1.  Defendant is ordered to answer this question
without further objection or delay.  No
protective order is required. As for Interrogatory No. 15.1, and 16.3, further
responses are required.  As for the
remaining interrogatories, the supplemental responses are sufficient and need
not be supplemented.   The request for monetary
sanctions is denied.  
 
II.                 
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR EVIDENTIARY SANCTIONS,
ISSUE SANCTIONS TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH THE COURT’S ORDER AND/OR TO COMPEL
FURTHER RESPONSES AS TO FORM INTERROGATORIES SETS ONE AND TWO AGAINST DEFENDANT
14600 SATICOY STREET LLC 
 
The
motion for terminating sanctions against 14600 Saticoy Street LLC is identical
to that against Anza Management.  The
court adopts its ruling set forth above as to the motion against Anza based on
the form interrogatories.   The request
for sanctions is denied.  
 
III.               
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR EVIDENTIARY SANCTIONS,
ISSUE SANCTIONS TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH THE COURT’S ORDER AND/OR TO COMPEL
FURTHER RESPONSES AS TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES SET ONE AGAINST DEFENDANT ANZA
MANAGEMENT COMPANY  
 
Plaintiff seeks for terminating
sanctions or, alternatively, evidentiary sanctions and/or issue sanctions
precluding Defendant from employing certain affirmative defenses since
Defendant has refused to provide code-compliant discovery responses relating to
SROGs inquiring into Defendant’s affirmative defenses as the court ordered it
to do in its December 8, 2023 Order. Notwithstanding whether the court decides
to assess terminating, issue, and/or evidentiary sanctions, Plaintiffs request an
award of monetary sanctions in the amount of $6,360.00 against Defendant and
its attorneys of record, Ronald S. Whitaker, Esq. and whatever law firm or
company they may belong, jointly and severally, to compensate them for the
expenses incurred in bringing the subject Motion. 
 
The court’s analysis of the request for
terminating sanctions is the same as for the proceeding motions.  As for the request for further responses, the
court rules as follows: Further responses are required for Special
Interrogatory No. 11 (defendant to provide the name of the manager(s) for March
2008); Special Interrogatory No. 68  and
69; Special Interrogatory No. 70; Special Interrogatory No. 98; Special
Interrogatory No. 99; Special Interrogatory No. 100; Special Interrogatory. No.
112; and Special Interrogatories 113-117. 
  
The
other interrogatories are either vague, overbroad or have been adequately
responded to by this defendant.  
  
IV.              
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR EVIDENTIARY SANCTIONS,
ISSUE SANCTIONS TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH THE COURT’S ORDER AND/OR TO COMPEL FURTHER
RESPONSES AS TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES SET ONE AGAINST DEFENDANT 14600 SATICOY
STREET LLC  
 
The motion for terminating sanctions
against 14600 Saticoy Street LLC is identical to that against Anza
Management.  The court adopts its ruling
set forth above as to the motion against Anza based on the special interrogatories.   The request for sanctions is denied.  
 
As for the request for further
responses, the court rules as follows: Further responses are required for Special
Interrogatory No 68  and 69; Special
Interrogatory No. 70; Special Interrogatory No. 98; Special Interrogatory No.
99; Special Interrogatory No. 100; and Special Interrogatory. No. 112.  
 
The other interrogatories are either
vague, overbroad or have been adequately responded to by this defendant.  
 

 
 
 
V.                
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION

ISSUE SANCTIONS TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH THE COURT’S ORDER AND/OR TO COMPEL
FURTHER RESPONSES AS TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE AGAINST
DEFENDANT ANZA MANAGEMENT COMPANY  
 
Plaintiffs
seek for terminating sanctions or, alternatively, evidentiary sanctions and/or issue
sanctions to compel compliance with the court’s order and/or to compel further
responses as to Plaintiff’s RPDs. That request is denied for the reasons set
forth above.  With respect to the
substantive requests for further responses, the court rules as follows:  
 
As for Requests No. 2, 4, 9, 18, 19, 21, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30,
31, 32, 33, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43. 44, 
48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 56, 57, 63, 64, 89, 90, 91. 92-99, 100,   Defendant is ordered to provide further
responses and all responsive documents to these requests for the periods
specified in each request.  If documents
are withheld as privileged, they must be listed on a code compliant privilege
log.   For the other requests for production, the
court either finds that the request is overbroad or it has been adequately
responded to by defendant.  
 
The requests for sanctions are denied as both parties’
positions were substantially justified, in light of the other parties’
intransigence.  
 
VI.
