The court has reviewed the motion filed by Counsel, Theodore H. Ravan, to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff, Christina Geraci. Counsel contends that there has been a breakdown in attorney-client communication and that they are no longer able to represent the Plaintiff. Counsel has filed forms MC-051 and MC-052, but has failed to file the mandatory form MC-053. The court will grant the motion to be relieved if Counsel can provide proof of mailing the MC-053 and a copy of the form prior to the date of the hearing.
