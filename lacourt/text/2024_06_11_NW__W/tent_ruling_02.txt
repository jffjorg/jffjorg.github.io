FACTUAL
BACKGROUND
 
This action involves a motor vehicle collision. On August 30,
2023, Plaintiff Keon Hollifield filed a complaint against Defendant Rafael
Delgado for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence. 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant
Rafael Delgado to Provide Further Responses to Request for Admissions, Set One
is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff Keon Hollifield moves the court for an order compelling
Defendant Rafael Delgado to serve on Plaintiff further answers to Plaintiff’s
Request for Admissions, Set One and for an order imposing a monetary sanction
of $2,560.00 against Defendant Rafael Delgado and his counsel for record Chad
G. Chapman for failure to provide a response. The motion is made on the grounds
Defendant has served evasive objection only responses. 
 
A motion to compel further responses be brought based on responses to
requests for admission (“RFA”) that: (1) provide evasive or incomplete answers;
or (2) make unmeritorious or overly-generalized objections.  (CCP §
2033.290(a).)  However, a motion to compel further responses cannot compel
the admission of matters already denied.  (Holguin v. Superior Court
(1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 812, 821.) 
 
On January 9, 2024, Plaintiff
propounded a set of written discovery to Defendant Delgado, including Request
for Admissions, Set One. (Green Decl., ¶3, Exh. 1.) Defense requested a 30 day
extension to respond to the discovery, making them due on March 12, 2024.
(Green Decl. ¶4, Exh. 2.) Plaintiff’s counsel agreed. (Green Decl. ¶5, Exh 3.)
On March 15, 2024, three days after the extension had expired, Defendant served
objection only responses to the written discovery. (Green Decl. ¶6, Exh. 4.)
Plaintiff sent a meet and confer letter stating the responses were objection
only, which started Plaintiff’s 45 day to compel. (Grene Decl. ¶7.) Defendant
never responded. Upon review of the Request for Admissions, Set One, the court
finds the objections without merit. 
 
The court therefore GRANTS Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Admission, Set One. 
 
Sanctions
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.290(d) provides for mandatory monetary sanctions “against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further response, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (CCP §
2033.290(d).)   
 
Plaintiff requests $2,560.00 in
sanctions for 3 hours preparing the motion, 1 hour in anticipation of reviewing
opposition and preparing reply, and 1 hour attending the hearing we as well as
the $60 filing fee. Counsel’s hourly rate is $500. 
 
The court GRANTS
Defendant’s request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,560.00.
