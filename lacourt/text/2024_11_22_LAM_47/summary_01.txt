And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made tentative rulings on various motions in limine filed by the defendant, Rochelle Sterling. Defendant's Motion in Limine No. 1, seeking to exclude all evidence, argument, and testimony referencing Donald Sterling, was denied. Defendant's Motion in Limine No. 2, seeking to exclude all evidence, argument, and testimony referencing Defendant's assets, wealth, or financial condition, was denied in part, with the court allowing Plaintiffs to offer testimony or other evidence tending to show that Defendant Rochelle Sterling was negligent in her oversight of Plaintiffs' apartment.

Defendant's Motion in Limine No. 3, seeking to exclude all evidence, argument, and testimony concerning unrelated litigation against Defendant or her agents, representatives, or family members, was denied without prejudice, as the motion did not identify any "unrelated litigation" sought by Plaintiff to be offered as evidence in this case.

Defendant's Motion in Limine No. 4, seeking to exclude all evidence, argument, and testimony concerning any insurance held by Defendant covering the property at issue, was granted, as such evidence is not relevant and its minimal relevance is outweighed by its prejudicial impact and likelihood to consume undue time.

Defendant's Motion in Limine No. 5, seeking to exclude any opinion evidence or testimony by Plaintiff Ken, Shelley, or Liam Kenneith Hoang as to the cause and/or source of Plaintiffs' claimed health conditions, was granted in part, with the court allowing Plaintiffs to offer testimony about the correlation between the housing conditions and their symptoms as a way to show a potential link between them that is probative of causation.

Defendant's Motion in Limine No. 6, seeking to exclude any evidence not disclosed during discovery, was denied without prejudice, as there has been no showing that any of Plaintiff's discovery responses were willfully false or incomplete.

Defendant's Motion in Limine No. 8, seeking to exclude any references to Plaintiffs' earlier unsuccessful pregnancy, was denied without prejudice, as the relevance of the prior pregnancy as probative evidence about the parents' behaviors and reactions outweighs any prejudice that Defendant will experience.

Defendant's Motion in Limine No. 9, seeking to limit Plaintiffs' cumulative use of photos during opening and trial, was granted in part, with the court requiring Plaintiffs to choose a reasonable selection of photographs for presentation at trial cognizant of the fact that, if they offer too many, their ability to introduce additional photographs will be limited by Defendants' justifiable objections that they are cumulative.

Defendant's Motion in Limine No. 10, seeking to exclude or limit Plaintiff Liam Houang's trial testimony, was denied, with the court holding a hearing under Evidence Code section 402 to determine the probative value, if any, of Liam's testimony about events and conditions that existed between 2 and 3 years ago.
