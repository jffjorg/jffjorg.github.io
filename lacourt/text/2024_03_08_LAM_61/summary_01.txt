Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has ruled on several motions in this case. First, the motion to quash the service of summons filed by Ikenna Mmeje is GRANTED. Mmeje was added as a defendant on September 19, 2023, and the Court finds that he was aware of the alleged wrongdoing and did not wait unreasonably long to file his response.

Second, the motion for sanctions filed by Mmeje is DENIED. The Court finds that Plaintiff's failure to allege facts concerning Mmeje in the complaint and the delay in adding Mmeje as a defendant are not sufficient grounds for sanctions.

Third, the demurrer filed by Lynette Scherer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. The Court finds that Plaintiff's claims against Scherer for harassment and intentional infliction of emotional distress are not legally sufficient.

Finally, the motion to strike filed by Scherer is MOOT. The Court has already sustained Scherer's demurrer to the complaint, and the motion to strike is no longer necessary.
