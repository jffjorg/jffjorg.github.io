**Significant Statements:**

* "A petition to vacate an award or to correct an award shall be served and filed not later than 100 days after the date of the service of a signed copy of the award on the petitioner." (CCP § 1288)
* "Equitable tolling is a judge-made doctrine 'which operates independently of the literal wording of the Code of Civil Procedure' to suspend or extend a statute of limitations as necessary to ensure fundamental practicality and fairness." (California State Univ., Fresno Assn., Inc. v. Cnty. of Fresno)
* "Notably, SDS had 100 days to serve SCE with the petition. It did not begin the process in earnest until the 99th day and provided no explanation for that delay. This lack of reasonable diligence opened the possibility that even minor hiccups in service could render the petition untimely."
