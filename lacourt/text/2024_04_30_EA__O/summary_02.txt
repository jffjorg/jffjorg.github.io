And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling states that as of April 24, 2024, no motion to set aside entry of default has been filed by Villa. Therefore, Villa is not entitled to take any affirmative steps in the action. The judge notes that the Act replaces the Heirs Act, which eliminated the requirement that the property be "heirs property". The plaintiff has provided three real estate appraisers, Donald Mowery, Babken Azizyan, and James Lewis Property Appraisals, to support their claim. The judge cites several court cases, including Bailey v. Citbank, N.A. and Steven M. Garber & Assocs. V. Eskandarian, to support their ruling.
