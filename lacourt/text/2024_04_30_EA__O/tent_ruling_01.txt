  Case Number:  23PSCV00993    Hearing Date:   April 30, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling   Plaintiff  Andrade Financial’s MOTION FOR APPRAISAL AND VALUATION OF SUBJECT REAL PROPERTY  is GRANTED.    Background   This is a  real property case.    On April 5,  2023, Plaintiff ANDRADE FINANCIAL, a California corporation, filed suit against  Defendants CAMILO ALEXANDER ALBERTO (“Alberto”); RAYMUNDO D. VILLA (“Villa”);  NBS DEFAULT SERVICES, LLC (“NBS”); MILL CITY MORTGAGE LOAN TRUST 2018- 3 (“Mill  City Trust”); LOS ANGELES COUNTY TREASURER AND TAX COLLECTOR for partition by  sale of real property owned by Plaintiff, Alberto, and Villa, each which have a  one-third interest.    On May 10,  2023, Defendant Alberto filed his answer.    On May 11,  2023, NBS filed a ‘Declaration of Non-Monetary Status’ indicating that it has  been named solely in its capacity as Substitute Trustee; NBS has to be named  because of its interests, legal or equitable, in the property.    On May 26,  2023, default was entered against Raymundo D. Villa.    On May 30,  2023, Mill City Trust filed its answer.   On August 10,  2023, a Stipulation Regarding Lien Priority And Non-Participation Of Mill City  Mortgage Loan Trust 2018-3, Wilmington Savings Fund Society, Fsb, As Trustee In  This Action was filed.    On December  14, 2023, the court granted Counsel Ronald E. Norman’s motion to be relieved as  counsel for Alberto.    On February  28, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion.   On March 15,  2024, Alberto filed a ‘substitution of attorney’ indicating that Counsel  Bledstein is his new counsel.   On March 15,  2024, the court held a CMC. The minute order provides the following: “Defense  Counsel David Lupoff appears on behalf of Defense Counsel I. Mark Bledstein.  David Lupoff informs the Court that I. Mark Bledstein had a medical emergency  and is requesting a continuance. The Court finds that Defense Counsel I. Mark  Bledstein has not yet substituted in on the matter. Plaintiff's Counsel  represents to the Court that the last day for Defendant Camilo Alexander  Alberto to oppose the Motion set on April 30, 2024, is April 17, 2024. Order  to Show Cause Re: Why the Court Should Not Strike Defendant's Answer is  scheduled for 03/25/2024 at 09:00 AM in Department O at Pomona Courthouse  South. The Defendant Camilo Alexander Alberto is Ordered to by physically  present on the next court date.” (emphasis added).    On March 25,  2024, the court held an OSC Re: Why the Court Should Not Strike Defendant's  Answer; Informal Discovery Conference (IDC). The minute order, in pertinent  part, provides the following: “The Court notes that Attorney of Record for  Camilo Alexander Alberto, Mr. Bledstein, is not present, which bars the Court  from having a meaningful Informal Discovery Conference (IDC). Accordingly,  Plaintiff is authorized to file Motion to Compel as necessary. Plaintiff's  Counsel shall contact the courtroom staff to reserve a date for said motion.  Mr. Lupoff, standing in for Mr. Bledstein, represents that his client is  amenable to appraisal of the property at issue. Defendant Villa is admonished  that he is in default and he must decide what his next steps in this action are.”  (emphasis added).[1]   To date, though discovery  hearings have been scheduled, no discovery motions have been filed.    Legal  Standard   Plaintiff  brings forth the motion pursuant to the Partition of Real Property Act (“the  Act”), which is codified by Code of Civil Procedure section 874.311 et seq.[2]    The Act  applies where, as here, (i) real property is held by tenants in common and there  is no agreement of record binding upon the co-tenants regarding partition of  the property, and (ii) an action for partition of real property has been filed  on or after January 1, 2023. (Code of Civil Procedure §§ 874.311(a) &  874.313.)    The process  begins with the court’s determination of the fair market value of the property  by ordering an appraisal. (§874.316 (a)&(d).) If the court orders an  appraisal, the court “shall appoint a disinterested real estate appraiser  licensed in the State of California to determine the fair market value of the  property assuming sole ownership of the fee simple estate”. (§ 874.315, subd.  (d).)[3]  Then, the appraiser files its appraisal with the Court. Two things happen once  the appraisal is filed with the court. First, the court notifies each  party of the property’s appraised fair market value, and of the parties’  right to object to the appraisal within 30 days. (§ 874.316, subd.  (d)&(e).) Second, regardless of whether any objection to the appraisal is  filed, “the court shall conduct a hearing to determine the fair market value of  the property.” At this hearing, the court may consider any other evidence of  value offered by a party; and shall thereupon determine the fair market value  of the property, and send notice to the parties of that value and of the right  of other co-tenants to purchase the interests of the cotenants who had  requested partition by sale. (§§ 874.316(f)&(g) and 974.317(a).)   Discussion   Based upon  the foregoing process, Plaintiff requests that the court do the following:   1. order an immediate appraisal of the Subject Real Property to be  conducted, the costs of which are to be paid 50% by Andrade Financial and 50%  by Alberto, said Appraisal Report to be filed with the Court pursuant to §§  874.315 and 874.316;    2. continue the current hearing approximately 30 days;    3. immediately upon filing of the Appraisal Report, notify each party of  the filing of the report, the property’s appraised fair market value, and the  parties’ right to object to the appraisal within 30 days, per section 874.316,  subd. (d)&(e); and    4. on the continued hearing date, conduct a hearing to determine the  fair market value of the property, and thereupon send notice to the parties of  that value and of Mr. Alberto’s right to purchase as per  sections.316(f)&(g) and 974.317(a).    Here, absent  an opposition, the court finds no problems with the request. After the court  determines the value of the subject real property, the parties will be  notified, and the respective steps will ensue.    Notwithstanding, the court finds it of import to  correct something in the motion. Plaintiff contends that after notice of the value is sent to the  parties, Alberto has the “right to purchase Andrade Financial’s 50% interest  in the Subject Real Property at that value, as per sections.316(f)&(g) and  974.317(a).” (Motion p. 4:19-22,  emphasis added.) Plaintiff,  however, does not hold a 50% interest in the property; Plaintiff,  as with Villa and Alberto, holds a 33-1/3% interest in the property. While  Villa is in default which precludes him from objecting to the partition  by sale itself, he does not, absent any authority otherwise, lose his  interest in the property.    Conclusion   Based on the  foregoing, the motion is granted.
