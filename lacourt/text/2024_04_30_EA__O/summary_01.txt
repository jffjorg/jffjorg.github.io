English summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for appraisal and valuation of the subject real property. The court has ordered an immediate appraisal of the property, with the costs to be paid 50% by Andrade Financial and 50% by Alberto. The court will continue the current hearing approximately 30 days. After the appraisal report is filed, the parties will be notified of the filing and their right to object to the appraisal within 30 days. The court will then hold a hearing to determine the fair market value of the property and will send notice to the parties of that value and Mr. Alberto's right to purchase. The court notes that Villa is in default and has not objected to the partition by sale, but he does not lose his interest in the property.
