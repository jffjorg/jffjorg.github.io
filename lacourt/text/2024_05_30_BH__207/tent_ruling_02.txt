[1] The Court does not address the parties’ arguments
that Plaintiffs have altered the Wall Fence by placing signage on it,
instructing Defendant’s workers not to alter or demolish the Wall Fence,
because that issue is not relevant to Defendant’s request for clarification,
and is not properly before the Court.
