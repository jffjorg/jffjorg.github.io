Background
This is a shareholder derivative action. The instant case
was filed on August 8, 2019. On May 16, 2022, Plaintiff Myung Sik Kim
(“Plaintiff”) filed a second amended complaint against Defendant S&H
Business Management, Inc. (“Defendant”) alleging: (1) Involuntary Dissolution
of a Corporation; (2) Accounting; (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (4) Aiding and
Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (5) Breach of Fiduciary Duty- Duty of Care,
Loyalty, and Good Faith; (6) Constructive Trust; and (7) Declaratory Relief.
On May 11, 2023, Plaintiff propounded Special
Interrogatories, Set Two (“SROG 2”) on Defendant S&H Business Management,
Inc. (“S&H”) (Ex A, Declaration of Angie Kim (“AKIM Decl.”). Plaintiff also
propounded Requests for Production Set 2 (“RFP 2”). SROG 2 contained 149
contention interrogatories to S&H (Nos. 175 to 323) consisting of 51 interrogatories
requesting specific facts (“Fact Interrogatories), 49 interrogatories
requesting witnesses to the responses to Fact Interrogatories (“Witness
Interrogatories”), and 49 interrogatories requesting specific documents in
support of the responses to Fact Interrogatories (“Document Interrogatories.”)
(Ex 2, AKIM Decl.)
On July 11, 2023, Plaintiff received S&H’s Responses to
Special Interrogatories (Set Two). 
On October 16, 2023, Plaintiff moved to compel further
responses to 38 of the 49 Witness Interrogatories, 4 of the 49 Document
Interrogatories, and 4 of the 51 Fact Interrogatories that Defendant purportedly
failed to supplement. 
Discussion 
“On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order
compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any
of the following apply: (1) A state of compliance with the demand is
incomplete. (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive. (3) An objection in the response is without merit or
too general.” (CCP §2031.310(a).) 
A motion to compel further responses to a request for
production “shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the inspection demand.” (CCP §2031.310(b).) 
“If the propounding party,
on receipt of a response to interrogatories, deems that (1) an answer to a
particular interrogatory is…incomplete…or (3) an objection to an interrogatory
is without merit or too general, that party may move for an order compelling
further response.” (CCP §2030.300(a).)
The propounding party must, in addition, establish that it
complied with its obligation to “meet and confer.” (CCP §§2016.040,
2030.300(b); 2031.210(b).) Further, the propounding party is required to file a
Separate Statement that sets forth each item to which further responses are
requested, and that the factual and legal reasons for compelling it. (CRC Rule
3.1345(c).) 
Plaintiff has propounded 323 Special Interrogatories upon
Defendant S&H. (Choi Decl., ¶ 5.)  Plaintiff
has filed two separate motions to Compel Further Responses to Special
Interrogatories (Set Two), both scheduled for January 23, 2024.  Plaintiff argues that as a 50% owner of S&H,
she has a right to review S&H’s records but Defendants are denying her all
access to them.  Defendants argue that
Plaintiff is abusing the discovery process by propounding a “massive” amount of
discovery.  Defendants contend Plaintiff has
twice been given access to tens of thousands of documents under the authority
of Corporations Code Section 1600.  Plaintiff
seeks $17,600.00 in monetary sanctions against Defendants and Defendants seek
$4,200.00 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff for misuse of the discovery
process.
Six
additional motions to compel further responses are reserved for March 30, 2024,
three additional motions to compel further responses are reserved for July 16,
2024, a Motion to Compel In Person Deposition of Person Most Qualified is
reserved for August 15, 2024, and three additional Motions to Compel Further
Discovery Responses are reserved for September 5, 2024.  The court has already
addressed two prior motions for further responses and a motion to vacate the
order to compel further responses. Prior meet and confer efforts have
failed.  
 
Absent agreement of all parties, courts
may not make blanket referrals, except “in the unusual case where a majority of
factors” favor reference, including: “(1)
there are multiple issues to be resolved; (2) there are multiple motions to be
heard simultaneously; (3) the present motion is only one in a continuum of
many; (4) the number of documents to be reviewed (especially in issues based on
assertions of privilege) make the inquiry inordinately time-consuming.” (Taggares v. Superior Court (1998) 62 Cal.
App. 4th 94, 105.  “Where one or more of the above factors unduly impact
the court’s time and/or limited resources, the court is clearly within its
discretion to make an appropriate reference.” (Id. at p. 106.) “When the court in any pending action
determines that it is necessary for the court to appoint a referee to hear and
determine any and all discovery motions and disputes relevant to discovery in
the action and to report findings and make a recommendation thereon.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 639, subd. (a)(5).) Appointment requires
a court finding of “exceptional circumstances.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 639, subd. (d)(2).) 
 
Here, the court would find exceptional circumstances based upon
the number of discovery requests propounded, the number of motions involved,
the volume of documents at issue, and the number of issues involved (including
an investigation of Defendants by the Dept. of Insurance).  Accordingly, the court on its own motion schedules
an OSC re: Discovery Referee for February 13, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.
 
If
the parties wish to stipulate to the appointment of a discovery referee before the
February 13 hearing, the court invites such an agreement.  Allocation of costs may be worked out among
the parties.  The parties may seek a
continuance of the MSC, FSC and Trial in Dept. SE-F.  If the
parties decline to stipulate to the appointment of a discovery referee, the
parties may file and serve any opposition to such appointment no later than February 5, 2024.
