 Case Number:  23NWCV03548    Hearing Date:   January 19, 2024    Dept:  C Teachers
Insurance v. Blue Atlantic Partners
 
Plaintiff Teachers Insurance and Annuity
Association of America’s (Plaintiff) Ex Parte Application for an Order
Advancing Hearing on its Motion to Compel the Deposition of Defendant,
currently scheduled for September 12, 2024 is GRANTED.
Plaintiff requests that the hearing be advanced to January 24, 2024,
stating that the statutory 5 days notice under CCP § 1170.8 was provided when
it served its Motion on January 17, 2024. However, the Motion served on January
17, 2024 provides that the hearing is on September 12, 2024. Thus,
Defendant would have 3 days notice if the Court were to advance the
hearing today to the 24th. The next available hearing day
is January 30, 2024 which would provide the required 5 days
notice.  Further, this is the only hearing date before trial, thus
Defendant should be prepared to sit for deposition on that date should the
Motion be granted. Therefore, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel the Deposition of
Defendant is advanced to this date and continued to January 30, 2024 at
9:30 AM in Dept C.
