The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's request to advance the hearing on its Motion to Compel the Deposition of Defendant from September 12, 2024 to January 30, 2024. The Plaintiff had served the Motion on January 17, 2024, providing 5 days notice under CCP § 1170.8, but the Motion itself indicated that the hearing was to be held on September 12, 2024, which would only provide 3 days notice if the hearing were advanced to January 24, 2024. The Judge has ordered the hearing to be continued to January 30, 2024, which would provide the required 5 days notice and is the next available hearing date before trial.
