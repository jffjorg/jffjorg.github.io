And here is a summary in English text:

The court has continued the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication to November 19, 2024, due to the defendants' inability to obtain essential evidence to oppose the motion. The defendants had requested a continuance to allow for further discovery, citing the need to take depositions of the plaintiff and cross-defendants. The court granted the defendants' request for judicial notice of certain documents and declarations. The plaintiff had sought summary adjudication of certain causes of action, including fraud, conversion, and breach of fiduciary duty, while the defendants had filed a cross-complaint against certain individuals and companies. The court will continue to consider the motion for summary adjudication at the next hearing date.
