And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion to compel the Defendant, Dino's Burgers Fast Food, Inc., to provide further responses to the Plaintiff's Request for Production of Documents, Set One. The Judge has also granted the Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the Defendant in the reduced amount of $2,670. The Defendant is required to provide verified responses within 30 days and pay the sanctions to the Plaintiff's counsel within 30 days of the date of the order. The Judge based the ruling on the Plaintiff's allegations that the Defendant failed to respond adequately to the discovery requests and did not make a good faith effort to comply with the requests. The Judge also noted that the Defendant failed to file opposition to the motion, which created an inference that the motion was meritorious.
