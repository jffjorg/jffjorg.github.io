On September 13, 2022, Sheridan Sheree Bood

Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon request
by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Code of
Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(c)),
and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel filed
and served the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be Relieved as Counsel on May
15, 2024.
All papers for a
motion must be served at least 16 court days prior to the hearing, plus two
additional court days for electronic service or five additional days for mail
service.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1005, subd.
(b); 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B); & 1013, subd. (a).)
For a June 6
hearing, all papers needed to be served by May 14 (if by personal service) or
May 10 (if by electronic service) or May 9 (if by mail service).  
Service here was
untimely.  Accordingly, the motion is DENIED
without prejudice.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.Moving counsel is ordered to give notice.
