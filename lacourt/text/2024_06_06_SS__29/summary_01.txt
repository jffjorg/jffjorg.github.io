And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motions to compel further responses to discovery, filed by the defendant, City of Los Angeles. The judge has ruled that the motions are untimely, as they were filed months ago and were set for hearing too close to the trial date. Additionally, the judge has found that there has been no informal discovery conference, as required by the court's procedures. Therefore, the judge has denied the motions.
