And here is the summary in English text:

A tentative ruling has been issued in a case involving the death of Eternity Smith, who was killed by her mother, Akira Smith, in 2020. The case was filed by Eternity's siblings, who are minors, and are represented by their guardian ad litem, Pamela Hill. The County of Los Angeles has filed a demurrer, arguing that the case is time-barred and that the plaintiffs have not properly pleaded their claims. The court has rejected the demurrer, finding that the plaintiffs' causes of action are not time-barred and that the county's rejection of the plaintiffs' claims is ineffective. The court has also rejected the county's argument that the plaintiffs' survival and wrongful death claims are properly pleaded.

The court has considered the pleadings and the evidence presented by the parties and has determined that the case is not time-barred and that the plaintiffs have properly pleaded their claims. The court has also rejected the county's request to take judicial notice of certain documents, finding that the documents are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.

The court has overruled the county's demurrer and has granted the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint to comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 377.32.
