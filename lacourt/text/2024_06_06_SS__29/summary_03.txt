And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for monetary sanctions and evidence sanctions. The plaintiff's objections to the deposition notices were not properly handled, and the plaintiff did not follow the proper procedures for resolving the dispute. The court finds that the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions is not properly supported by a declaration from counsel supporting the amount of the requested sanctions. The court also finds that the plaintiff's motion for evidence sanctions is denied, as the plaintiff chose not to attend the deposition and did not file a motion to stay the deposition and quash the notice. The court denies the defendant's request for monetary sanctions as well. The court's decision is without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to object to the use of the deposition at trial.
