Summary of the tentative ruling:

The court denies the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the claim of medical negligence. The plaintiff failed to provide expert opinion testimony that establishes whether the defendant's employees breached the standard of care. The court also finds that the plaintiff failed to address and establish how the defendant is liable for the alleged negligence of its employees in light of the defendant's discovery responses.
