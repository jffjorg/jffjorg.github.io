 Case Number:  23PSCV00412    Hearing Date:   November 9, 2023    Dept:  G Plaintiff Jeffrey Ito’s Motion for Summary Judgment Respondent: Defendant Kaiser  Foundation Health Plan, Inc. TENTATIVE RULING Plaintiff Jeffrey Ito’s Motion for Summary Judgment is  DENIED. BACKGROUND This  is an action for medical malpractice. From April 2021 to May 2022, Plaintiff  Jeffrey Ito received healthcare insurance coverage through Defendant Kaiser  Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (Kaiser). In June 2021, Ito met with John Darrell  Waldren, M.D. and requested a consultation with an expert neuroscientist who  could properly diagnose ongoing issues with Ito’s brain. In particular, Ito  alleges people were spying on the contents of his conscious experience with  holography or connectionism. Ito alleges Dr. Waldren failed to make the  referral to a neuroscientist, diagnosed Ito with obsessive compulsive disorder  (OCD), and referred Ito to a psychiatrist. In  July 2021, Ito met with Rhiana Roque, M.D. and again requested help from an  expert neuroscientist and high-resolution brain imaging. In response to Ito’s  request, Ito alleges Dr. Roque diagnosed Ito with “schizophrenia vs. delusional  disorder” and prescribed ziprasidone. In February 2023, Ito alleges a CT scan  demonstrated there was no organic cause for Ito’s brain issues. Ito then  alleges Dr. Waldren and Dr. Roque still refused to refer Ito to a neurologist. On  February 14, 2023, Ito filed a complaint against Defendant Kaiser Permanente,  alleging a cause of action for medical negligence. On  March 20, 2023, Ito filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against Kaiser, alleging  the same cause of action. On  July 25, 2023, Ito filed the present motion for summary judgment. On October  24, Kaiser filed their own motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. A  hearing on Ito’s motion for summary judgment and a case management  conference/status conference re: ADR are set for November 9, 2023. A hearing on  Kaiser’s motion is set for January 9, 2024. ANALYSIS Ito  moves for summary judgment on Ito’s sole cause of action for medical  negligence. For the following reasons, the court DENIES Ito’s motion. Legal Standard Summary  Judgment A  motion for summary judgment provides “courts with a mechanism to cut through  the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their  allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar  v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) It must be granted  “if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from  the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that  there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is  entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.  (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119, quoting Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)  To establish a triable issue of material fact, the opposing party must produce  substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68  Cal.App.4th 151, 166.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of  the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence  in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39  Cal.4th 384, 389.) Medical Negligence A  cause of action for medical negligence consists of the following elements: “(1)  the duty of the professional to use such skill, prudence and diligence as other  members of his profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that  duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the  resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage resulting from the  professional’s negligence.” (Turpin v. Sortini (1982) 31 Cal.3d 220,  229-230, quoting 4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Torts, § 488 et  seq., p. 2749.) “In  professional malpractice cases, expert opinion testimony is required to prove  or disprove that the defendant performed in accordance with the prevailing  standard of care [Citation], except in cases where the negligence is obvious to  laymen. [Citation.]” (Kelley v. Trunk (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 519, 523.)  And “[w]hen a defendant moves for summary judgment and supports [their] motion  with expert declarations that [their] conduct fell within the community  standard of care, [they are] entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff  comes forward with conflicting expert evidence.” (Munro v. Regents of  University of California (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 977, 985, quoting Hutchinson  v. United States (9th Cir. 1988) 838 F.2d 390, 392.) Similarly, “[w]here  the complexity of the causation issue is beyond common experience, expert  testimony is required to establish causation.” (Garbell v. Conejo Hardwoods,  Inc. (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1563, 1569.) Plaintiffs must establish “that  defendants’ breach of the standard of care was the cause, within a reasonable  medical probability, of [their] injury.” (Bushling v. Fremont Medical Center  (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 493, 509.) Discussion In this case,  Ito failed to provide any expert opinion testimony that establishes whether Dr.  Waldren and Dr. Roque breached the applicable standard of care. Instead, Ito  argued such evidence is unnecessary in light of Kaiser’s admissions. But while  Ito claims Kaiser admitted “to the breach of the standard of care and/or the  causation of harm,” Ito failed to point to a single discovery response or piece  of evidence that establishes Kaiser made such an admission. In fact, Kaiser’s  responses to Ito’s requests for admissions state the opposite. In them, Kaiser stated  it does not provide healthcare services or medical treatment and instead  contracts with the Southern California Permanente Medical Group to provide  those services. (MSJ, p. 46:21-24, 50:14-20, 51:4-10, 51:22-28, 53:23-54:1,  54:13-19, 55:21-27, 56:12-18, 57:3-12, 57:24-58:2, 58:14-20, 59:4-10,  59:22-60:1, 60:13-20, 61:4-11, 61:22-62:1, 62:13-19, 63:2-7, 63:19-24, 64:9-15,  65:16-22, 66:6-12, 66:25-67:2, 67:14-20, 68:4-9.) Kaiser also denied that it  and its employees were responsible for treating and diagnosing Ito. (MSJ, p. 46:26-47:9.) Because Ito failed  to provide any expert opinion testimony that establishes whether Dr. Waldren  and Dr. Roque breached the applicable standard of care, the court finds Ito failed  to carry the burden of demonstrating an absence of triable issues of material fact  that justifies the granting of Ito’s motion for summary judgment. Furthermore,  Ito failed to address and establish how Kaiser is liable for Dr. Waldren and  Dr. Roque’s alleged negligence in light of Kaiser’s discovery responses. Accordingly,  Ito’s motion is DENIED. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the  court DENIES Ito’s motion for summary judgment.
