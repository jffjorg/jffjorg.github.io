  Case Number:  20PSCV00883    Hearing Date:   November 9, 2023    Dept:  G Plaintiff City of El
Monte’s Application for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff City of El
Monte’s Application for Default Judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of
$699.114.45.
BACKGROUND
This
is a nuisance abatement action. On June 28, 2017, the El Monte Police
Department were executing a search warrant at a property in El Monte when they
discovered a commercial marijuana grow operation that was being conducted
illegally.
On
December 22, 2020, the City of El Monte (the City) filed a complaint against
Shida Deng, Xiu Ying Feng, and Does 1-100 alleging the following causes of
action: (1) narcotics abatement, (2) public nuisance, (3) violation of El Monte
municipal code, (4) violation of Unfair Competition Law, and (5) violation of
MAUCRSA. On February 14, 2022, the City’s registered process server personally
served Deng and Feng in Rosemead.
On
April 12, 2022, default was entered against Deng and Feng. On February 14,
2023, the City submitted an application for default judgment that the court
denied on May 17. On July 11, the City submitted another application for
default judgment and resubmitted the application on August 7. After the court
requested additional declarations on October 3, the City instead submitted the
present application on November 6.
An
OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for November 9, 2023.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
The
City seeks default judgment against Deng and Feng in the total amount of $708,911.25,
including $686,020 in damages, $18,547 in attorney fees, and $4,344.25 in costs.
Because the City has provided sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS the City’s application for
default with the following modification. While the City requests $18,547 in
attorney fees, the City failed to provide an accounting or itemization of how
the fees were incurred. Because the City failed to do so, the court cannot
determine if this amount was reasonable.
Thus,
the court reduces the requested attorney fees to $8,750.20 in accordance with
Local Rule 3.214.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the
City’s application for default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount
of $699.114.45.
