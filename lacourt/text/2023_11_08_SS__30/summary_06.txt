And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling deals with a motion to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff, Jason Mota. The motion is continued due to several issues: the parties stipulated to continue trial, but the proposed order contains outdated hearing dates; the Defendant has not been served with the motion, declaration, and proposed order; and the proposed order incorrectly states the purpose of a hearing scheduled for December 13, 2023. To resolve these issues, the counsel for the plaintiff is ordered to file a new motion, declaration, and proposed order, which must accurately reflect the current hearing dates and the reason for the hearing, and serve the client and Defendant. Proof of service must also be filed, and notice must be given to the moving party.
