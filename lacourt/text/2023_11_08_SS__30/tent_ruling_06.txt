Counsel for Plaintiff’s counsel has submitted all of the mandatory judicial council forms (i.e., MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053). However, because the parties stipulated to continue trial, there are outdated hearing dates for the FSC and trial on the proposed order and declaration. In addition, the proposed order incorrectly states that the hearing on December 13, 2023 is for a case management conference, when it is for a discovery motion. Further, Defendant has not been served with the motion, declaration and proposed order.As such, counsel is ordered a file a new motion, declaration and proposed order, ensuring that all hearing dates are current and accurately setting forth the reason the hearing is scheduled, serve the client and Defendant, then file proof of service.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
