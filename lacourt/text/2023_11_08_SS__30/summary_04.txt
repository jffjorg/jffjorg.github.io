And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition to confirm the compromise of a disputed claim by a minor (Kaylee Franco, age 15) and has identified several errors that prevent the granting of the petition at this time. The court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem and allows counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call. The petition is continued for 60 days to a date convenient to the court and the parties. The court orders counsel to file a new petition, proposed order, and order to deposit into a blocked account, correcting all identified errors. The moving party is required to give notice.
