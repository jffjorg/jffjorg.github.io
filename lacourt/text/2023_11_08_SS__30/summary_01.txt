And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the attendance of the defendant, Guillermo Belloso, at a deposition in his capacity as Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) for Belloso Transport, LLC. The judge finds that CCP section 2025.610, subdivision (c)(1) applies, which allows for a subsequent deposition of a person who has previously been examined as an officer, director, or employee of a corporation designated to testify on its behalf. The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to compel the production of documents, as the plaintiff did not show good cause to justify the request. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant, finding that the dispute over the application of CCP section 2025.610, subdivision (c)(1) was in good faith. The defendant is ordered to appear for deposition as PMK within 20 days of the order.
