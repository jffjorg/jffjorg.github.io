The motion was made by the defendants, who are unable to conduct Plaintiff's independent medical examination before the deadline for exchanging expert witness information. Additionally, Plaintiff's counsel agreed to a trial continuance via email. The judge finds that good cause exists to continue the trial, as the defendants need time to conduct IMEs and the interests of justice are best served by a continuance. The trial is now scheduled for May 21, 2024, with a final status conference on May 7, 2024.
