 Case Number:  20STCV32461    Hearing Date:   November 8, 2023    Dept:  30 KAYLEE FRANCO, A MINOR BY AND THROUGH HER GUARDIAN AD LITEM, et al. vs LISA WISCOMBEPetition to Confirm Minor's CompromiseTentative Ruling:  The Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call. The petition is CONTINUED 60 days to date convenient to Court and parties. Counsel is ordered to file a new petition, proposed order, and order to deposit into blocked account, correcting all of the errors below-identified.  Moving party to give notice. Discussion:  The Court has reviewed the Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim of a Minor (Kaylee Franco, Age 15).  No corrections have been made since the Court's non-appearance review on October 20, 2023. The Court finds the following defects preclude the granting of the petition at this time:(1) Defendant has not been served with the petition.(2) The Court finds that on the current record, and in consideration of the factors set forth in Cal Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(b), a fee of 25% of the gross settlement is reasonable.(3) Item 13a of the petition indicates that counsel is seeking $38,400 in attorney fees. However, in Attachment 13(a), counsel indicates he is seeking $32,866.85 in fees. Further, the declaration is not signed and counsel’s name is not on it.(4) Item 13b of the petition indicates that One Legal fees were incurred totaling $99,431. When compared to the previous MC-350 filed in this matter, it appears the total should state $944.31. This incorrect amount has caused the total costs to be listed as $110,166 on Item 13b of the petition.(5) Items 16b and 16d of the petition indicate that the medical expenses are $1,800,793. This appears to be a typographical error.(6) Medical expenses total more than $18,007.93, which is the amount that is listed on the petition.(7) The agreements to reduce medical expenses must be filed.(8) Item 16 of the petition has incorrect settlement figures.(9) Item 6 of the proposed order incorrectly states that the gross settlement amount is $9,600,000.(10) Item 8a(1) of the proposed order incorrectly states attorney’s fees are $3,840,000.(11) Item 8a(2) of the proposed order incorrectly states costs are $510,522.(12) Item 8a(3) of the proposed order incorrectly indicates that the medical, hospital, ambulance, nursing, and other similar expenses payable directly to providers is $5,793. All medical expenses must be listed here.(13) Item 8a(5) of the proposed order is not filled out.(14) Page 3-4 of the proposed order is not filled out.
