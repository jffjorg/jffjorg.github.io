Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer by the Trust and Accountancy Corp to the Cross-Complaint's third, fourth, and fifth causes of action is sustained. The Cross-Complainants alleged that the Trust and Accountancy Corp waived their right of first refusal (ROFR) to purchase the property, but the Trust and Accountancy Corp claim that they provided notice to the Cross-Complainants of the potential sale and met their contractual obligation.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action for indemnity because the Cross-Complainants do not allege a contractual relationship between the parties or a law giving rise to an indemnity claim. The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for contribution because the Cross-Complainants do not allege that a money judgment has been rendered jointly against two or more defendants or that they have paid more than their pro rata share of the judgment.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for declaratory relief because the Cross-Complainants do not allege an actual controversy involving justiciable questions relating to the rights or obligations of a party.

The judge has ordered the Cross-Complainants to file and serve an amended cross-complaint, if any, within 20 days of the date of this order. If no amended cross-complaint is filed, the Demurring Parties must file and serve a proposed judgment of dismissal within 30 days of the date of this order.
