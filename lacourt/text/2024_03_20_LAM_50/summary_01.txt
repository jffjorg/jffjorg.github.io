And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Court has reviewed the motion filed by The Ancient Temple of Wings (ATW) to set aside the Court's January 6, 2023 Order denying ATW's motion to quash service of summons, dismiss the action on the grounds of an inconvenient forum, or stay the action. The Court has also reviewed the minute order denying ATW's motion to set aside entry of default on September 1, 2022.

The Court finds that ATW has not demonstrated grounds for the Court to set aside the January 6, 2023 Order. The Court notes that ATW filed two separate motions on April 13, 2022, and that the Court denied the motion to set aside entry of default on September 1, 2022.

The Court will not set aside the January 6, 2023 Order and will deny ATW's motion. The Court will give notice of this Order to the parties.

This is a tentative ruling, and the parties may file objections before the hearing on March 20, 2024.
