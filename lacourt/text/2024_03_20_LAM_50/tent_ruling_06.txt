[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: 
 
MOTION TO DEEM
  ADMISSIONS ADMITTED AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS



 
Background
Plaintiff Immigrant
Rights Defense Council, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on August 15, 2023
against Defendant Angelica Cendejas (“Defendant”). The Complaint alleges one cause of action for
violation of the Immigration Consultant Act. 
Plaintiff indicates that on August 28, 2023, Plaintiff served Request
for Admissions, Set One, on Defendant. (Medvei Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. 1.) On November 3,
2023, Plaintiff filed this motion before participating in an informal discovery
conference.   
On March 6, 2024, the parties participated in an Informal Discovery
Conference. The Court’s March 6, 2024 minute order provides, inter alia,
that “[t]he parties attended the Informal Discovery Conference. The Parties
agreed and the Court ordered as follows: On or before May 6, 2024, Defendant
will serve Plaintiff with verified responses without objection to Plaintiff’s
first set of requests for production, requests for admissions and form
interrogatories and produce any responsive documents.”  It appears that Plaintiff did not take the
instant motion off calendar after securing the order at the IDC. Plaintiff’s
motion “for an order deeming each request for admission admitted by [Defendant]
in response to Request for Admissions, Set One, served on August 28, 2023” is
moot. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion “for
an order deeming each request for admission admitted by [Defendant] in response
to Request for Admissions, Set One, served on August 28, 2023” is denied as
moot. 
Plaintiff is ordered to
give notice of this Order.
