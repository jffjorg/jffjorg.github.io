[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
ANCIENT
  TEMPLE OF WINGS CHURCH’S MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM ORDER ENTERED ON 1/6/2023
  PURSUANT TO C.C.P. §473(b)




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Background
Plaintiff Curtis R. Olson (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on December
23, 2019 against a number of defendants, including The Ancient Temple of Wings
(“ATW”).  Plaintiff filed the operative
Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) on November 17, 2020, alleging ten causes of
action.
On August 29, 2023, Jane Doe filed a Cross-Complaint in this action
against, inter alia, Plaintiff. The Cross-Complaint alleges nine causes
of action. 
As noted in the Court’s January 6, 2023 Order in this matter, default
was entered against ATW on November 4, 2021. In addition, ATW previously moved for an order setting aside service
of the summons on ATW, dismissing this action on the grounds of an inconvenient
forum, or in the alternative, staying the entire action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 410.30 and 418.10. (See
January 6, 2023 Order.) On January 6, 2023, the Court issued an Order denying
the motion. The Court’s January 6, 2023 Order provides, inter alia, as
follows:
 
“As set forth above, ATW moves to quash service of the summons, dismiss
this action on the grounds of an inconvenient forum, or in the alternative, stay the action. As a threshold matter, the Court
notes that “[t]he
entry of a default terminates a defendant’s rights to take any further
affirmative steps in the litigation until either its default is set aside or a
default judgment is entered.” ((Devlin v.
Kearny Mesa Amc/Jeep/Renault (1984)
155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385.) Entry of default
also deprives the court of jurisdiction to consider any motion other than a
motion for relief from default. ((W.A. Rose
Co. v. Municipal Court for Oakland-Piedmont Judicial Dist. (1959) 176 Cal.App.2d 67, 72 [“The
subsequent untimely filings by appellant and motions made by respondent did not
affect the duty of the clerk to enter default when requested, nor did they
restore the jurisdiction to the court which was lost when default should have
been entered.”].) Accordingly, because default was
entered against ATW before ATW filed the instant motion, the Court finds that
it has no jurisdiction to consider the motion.” (January 6, 2023 Order at p.
2:14-25.) 
ATW now moves for an
order setting aside the Court’s January 6, 2023 Order. Plaintiff opposes. 
Discussion
In the instant motion, ATW cites to Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b)¿, which provides in pertinent part:¿¿ 
 
“The court
may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time,
in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.” 
In the
instant motion, ATW notes that on April 13, 2022, it filed a “Motion to Set
Aside Entry of Default.” The caption page of this motion states, inter alia,
“Concurrently filed: Motion to Quash Service of Summons; To Dismiss on
the Grounds of an Inconvenient Forum; Or in the Alternative for a Stay of
Entire Action.” (See ATW’s April 13, 2022 Motion to Set Aside Entry of
Default, p. 1.) ATW also filed another motion on
April 13, 2022, specifically, the “Motion to Quash Service of Summons; to
Dismiss on the Grounds of an Inconvenient Forum; or in the Alternative for a
Stay of Entire Action.” 
In the instant motion, ATW argues that “Counsel’s
intent was that the Motion to Set Aside Default be considered as the motion in
chief, and that the Motion to Quash, etc. be considered only if the Motion to
Set Aside were granted. Instead, it appears that the Court construed the motions
in the reverse, ruling only on the Motion to Quash, etc., that it lacked
jurisdiction to hear that motion. Had the Court construed the motions as
intended, and the Motion to Set Aside granted, the Motion to Quash would then
have been considered on its merits.” (Mot. at p. 4:15-21.) In the instant
motion, ATW seeks an “order setting aside the Court’s Order of January 6,
2023,” and requests that the court consider the “Motion to Set Aside Entry of
Default” attached to the instant motion for relief. (Mot. at p. 5:2-4.) 
It is unclear why ATW contends the Court “construed
the motions in the reverse,” (Mot. at p. 4:18), or how the Court could have purportedly
done so. As set forth above, ATW filed two separate
motions on April 13, 2022. ATW filed a motion to set aside entry of default that
was  noticed for hearing on May 19, 2022.[1] ATW also filed a motion to quash service of summons, to
dismiss on the grounds of an inconvenient forum, or in the alternative for a
stay of entire action, which was noticed for hearing on October 11, 2022.[2] Thus, ATW filed two separate motions to be heard at
two separate hearings.  
Moreover, to the extent ATW is arguing that the Court did not
rule on ATW’s April 13, 2022 motion to set aside entry of default, that is not
the case. As set forth above, the Court’s September 1, 2022 minute order in
this action provides, inter alia, that “[t]he Motion to Set
Aside/Vacate Default filed by THE ANCIENT TEMPLE OF WINGS, on 04/13/2022 is
Denied. without prejudice.” As noted by Plaintiff, this September 1, 2022 minute order on ATW’s motion to set aside
entry of default was issued several months before the Court’s January 6, 2023 Order
(that ATW seeks to set aside). 
In light of the foregoing, it is unclear how Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b)
is applicable to the circumstances here. The Court does not find that ATW has
demonstrated grounds for the Court to set aside the January 6, 2023 Order. 
Conclusion
Based
on the foregoing, ATW’s motion is denied.  
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this Order.
