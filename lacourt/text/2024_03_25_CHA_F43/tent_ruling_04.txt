SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
August 6, 2021, Defendant Candice Borquez allegedly hit Plaintiffs Marissa Gee,
Roslynd Gee, and Alayna Gee with her motor vehicle when they were using a
crosswalk. On July 28, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their complaint for Motor Vehicle
and Negligence.
 
Plaintiff Marissa Gee, as a parent of the minor, submits a petition
for approval for minor’s compromises on behalf of Alayna Gee (4) for a settlement
with Defendant for $12,248.86. Petitioner represents total deductions of $3,062.21
for attorney fees, thereby leaving a net balance of $9,186.64. Marissa Gee and
Roslynd Gee also have settlements with Defendant.
 
It appears that everything is in order to approve the Minor’s
Compromise. The petition and proposed order were filed on the MC-350 and MC-351
forms. The petitions comply with CCP § 372; Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600-3613;
and Cal. Rules of Court Rules 3.1384, 7.101, 7.950-7.952.
 
The Court approves the Petition to Confirm Minor’s
Compromise filed on behalf of Alayna Gee.
 
The Court will set a date at the hearing for proof of
purchase of the proposed annuity. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
