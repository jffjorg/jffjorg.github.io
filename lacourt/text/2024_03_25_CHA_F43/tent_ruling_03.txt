PARTY: No response has been filed RELIEF REQUESTEDDefendant’s
further responses to certain requests for production, as well as sanctions RULING:
Motion to compel further responses is granted. SUMMARY OF
ACTIONThis action
arises from Plaintiff Brenda Vela’s (Plaintiff) purchase of an allegedly
defective 2021 Jeep Compass. On February 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint
against Defendant FCA US LLC (Defendant) and DOES 1 through 10, inclusive,
alleging causes of action for: (1) violation of the Song-Beverly Act—breach of
express warranty and (2) violation of the Song-Beverly Act—breach of implied
warranty. On April 3,
2023, Defendant filed an Answer to the Complaint. On October 6,
2023, Plaintiff filed and served this unopposed motion to compel further
responses to requests for production and for monetary sanctions against
Defendant and its attorneys of record, Ongaro P.C., in the amount of $2,685.00. On March 18,
2024, Plaintiff filed and served a notice of non-opposition to Plaintiff’s
motion to compel.  As of March 20,
2024, Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed. Any opposition to the motion was required to
have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (CCP
§ 1005(b).) ANALYSISPlaintiff
argues that Defendant has not provide code-compliant responses to Plaintiff’s
Requests for Production numbers 16-32 and 45-46 pursuant to CCP § 2031.310.
Plaintiff represents that some of Defendant’s responses state that they are
contingent on a protective order, but Defendant has not responded to
Plaintiff’s meet and confer efforts and has not submitted a protective order
for execution, despite Plaintiff agreeing to the Los Angeles County Superior
Court Model Protective Order. Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s current
responses fail to provide a proper statement of compliance, so Plaintiff now
seeks an order for Defendant to provide further code-compliant responses. The Discovery
Act allows “[a]ny party [to] obtain discovery . . . by inspecting, copying,
testing, or sampling documents . . . and electronically stored information in
the possession, custody, or control of any other party to the action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.010, subd. (a).) The demanding party may designate the
documents sought “by reasonably particularizing each category of item.” (CCP §
2031.030(c)(1).) The responding party must then “respond separately to each
item or category of item” with an agreement to comply, representation of
inability to comply, or an objection. (CCP § 2031.210.) If the demanding party
deems that “(1) [a] statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete,” (2)
“[a] representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or
evasive.” (3) “[a]n objection in the response is without merit or too general,”
the demanding party may seek an order compelling code-complaint responses. (CCP
§ 2030.310(a).) Plaintiff
argues in her motion that the motion is proper because it was timely filed and
she engaged in sufficient meet and confer by sending the letter that Defendant
did not respond to. Plaintiff also argues that the information sought in the
requests for production is material and relevant to Plaintiff’s claims. Next, CCP §
2031.240 states that two requirements must be satisfied for a responding party
to properly object to a demand. First, a party must “[i]dentify with
particularity any document, [or] tangible thing . . . to which an objection is
being made.” (CCP § 2031.240(b)(1).) Second, a party must “[s]et forth clearly
the extent of, and the specific ground for, the objection.” (CCP §
2031.240(b)(2).) “Even where a party deems a demand to be objectionable, [that
party] still must identify those items which fall into the category of item in
demand to which an objection is made.” (Standon Co. v. Sup. Ct. (1990)
225 Cal.App.3d 898, 901.) Plaintiff
argues that Defendant’s responses violate the Code because its responses to the
requests for production do not identify with particularity any documents that
are being withheld subject to a specific objection. Defendant failed to
identify what documents are being withheld in requests 18 and 45-46 and only
relies on objections. Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s objections are improper
because Plaintiff’s requests are reasonably particularized. A party must
respond to a request for production of documents with one of the following: (1)
an agreement to comply, (2) a representation that the party lacks the ability
to comply with a particular demand; or (3) an objection to all or part of the
demand. (CCP § 2031.210(a).) Rather than
respond in this manner, Defendant responded to several of the requests by
saying that it would comply pursuant to a protective order. This is not the
proper method by which to respond to a discovery request, nor the proper method
for moving for a protective order. (See CCP § 2031.060.) Defendant responded in
the manner to Requests 16-17 and 19-32. Defendant must
provide code-compliant responses to Requests 16-32 and 45-46. For the requests
to which Defendant objects, Defendant must include a statement indicating what
documents, if any, it is withholding. If Defendant wishes for a protective
order to be in place, Defendant must move for one in the proper manner. Plaintiff’s motion
to compel further discovery responses is granted for Requests 16-32 and 45-46. SanctionsCCP § 2023.030
authorizes the Court to issue sanctions against a party engaging in conduct
that is a misuse of the discovery process. Failure to respond to discovery,
evasive responses, and objections lacking substantial justification are
“misuses of the discovery process.” (CCP § 2023.010(d)-(f); CCP § 2031.310(h).) Plaintiff has
requested sanctions in the total amount of $2,685.00 against Defendant and
Defendant’s counsel of record. The amount was based on $1,125.00 in attorney
fees (at $375.00 an hour for 3 hours), $60.00 in costs, an expected $750.00 for
reviewing the opposition and preparing a reply, and an expected $750.00 for
attending the hearing. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 8.) Because no opposition and no reply
were filed, the Court will only impose an additional $750.00 for attorney fees
for the hearing on this matter. That makes the total amount of sanctions $1,875.00. Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel of record is
granted in the total amount of $1,875.00. ORDER1.      Plaintiff’s
