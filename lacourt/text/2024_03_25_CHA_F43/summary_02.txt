And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to give her consent to release the text message records. The defendant had previously produced call records for the relevant time period, but refused to consent to the release of the text message records. The judge found that good cause exists to obtain the text message records, as they may show whether the defendant was texting at the time of the accident and whether she was in violation of Vehicle Code § 23123. The judge also found that there is no serious invasion of privacy implicated by the release of the text message records.

The judge denied the defendant's motion for a protective order, finding that there is no good cause for the order and that the plaintiff has already produced his call logs for the relevant time period.

The judge granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant and her attorneys of record in the amount of $6,435, plus an additional $250 for the defendant's alleged bad faith discovery tactics.
