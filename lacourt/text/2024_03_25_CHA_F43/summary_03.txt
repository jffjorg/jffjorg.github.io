Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to certain requests for production. The plaintiff had requested that the defendant provide code-compliant responses to certain requests, but the defendant failed to do so. The judge finds that the defendant's responses were inadequate and did not comply with the discovery requests. The judge orders the defendant to provide further code-compliant responses to the requests for production and to identify what documents, if any, are being withheld.

The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant and the defendant's counsel. The plaintiff had requested sanctions in the amount of $2,685.00, which was based on attorney fees, costs, and the time spent reviewing the opposition and preparing a reply. The judge reduces the amount of sanctions to $1,875.00, which is the amount of attorney fees for the hearing on this matter.

The judge orders the defendant and the defendant's counsel to pay the sanctions to the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days. The judge also orders the defendant to serve supplemental responses to the requests for production within 30 days.
