  Case Number:  20STCV15518    Hearing Date:   September 18, 2024    Dept:  29 Bello v. Maisch
20STCV15518
Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
This action arises from an automobile accident
that occurred on April 25, 2018, involving Plaintiff Brad Bello (“Plaintiff”)
and Defendant Francisco Jose Maisch (“Defendant”). Plaintiff filed the complaint
in this action on April 23, 2020, against Defendant and Does 1 through 30,
asserting one cause of action for motor vehicle
negligence.  Defendant filed his answer on November 19, 2021.
On April 28, 2023, the Court granted the motion
of Plaintiff’s counsel to be relieved.  Since that time, Plaintiff
has been representing himself.
On April 3, 2024, Defendant filed motions to
compel Plaintiff to respond to form interrogatories and special
interrogatories.  Plaintiff was served by mail but did not oppose the
motions.  On May 28, 2024, the motions were granted, and Defendant
was ordered to give notice.  Defendant gave notice by email.
Plaintiff did not respond as
ordered.  (Mittskus Decl., ¶¶ 6-7.)  
On July 24, 2024, Defendant initially filed a
motion for terminating, issue, evidence, and/or monetary sanctions for violation
of this Court’s Order of May 28.  The hearing was set for August
20.  On the date of the hearing, moving party did not appear
(Plaintiff did), and the motion was placed off calendar.
On August 19, 2024, Defendant filed a new motion
for terminating, evidence, and/or monetary sanctions for violation of this
Court’s Order of May 28. That motion is set for hearing on September 16.
On August 21, 2024, Defendant filed this
motion.  In this motion, Defendant seeks
an order dismissing the case as a terminating sanction for violation of this
Court’s Order of May 28.  
No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order
compelling answers to interrogatories, “the court may make those orders that
are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction,
or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to, that sanction, the court
may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (c).)
“To the extent authorized by the chapter
governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of this title,
the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after
opportunity for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone
engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process: ... (d) The
court may impose a terminating sanction …."  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030.) “Misuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited to,
the following: ... (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method
of discovery. ... (g) Disobeying a court order to provide
discovery."  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an
escalating and “incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with
monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez
v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and
commensurate with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is
required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied
discovery.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
967, 992.) “If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is
warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally
harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.;
see also, e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly.
(Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative,
Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.)
“Although in extreme cases a court has the authority to order a terminating sanction
as a first measure, a terminating sanction should generally not be imposed
until the court has attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be
unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be
ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th at p.
604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful, preceded by
a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at
p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders that prejudice the
opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21 v. City of
Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los Defensores, Inc.
v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles v. Exxon Mobil
Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v. Hachman (2000)
77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to
obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is
not to punish. (Newland v. Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608,
613; Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery sanction should not create a “windfall” for
a party or place a party in a better position than it would have been if the
opposing party had simply complied with its obligations under the Court’s
orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2024),
¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
Discussion
As a threshold matter, the Court does not
understand why Defendant filed two motions seeking (in significant part)
overlapping relief on the same grounds. 
If this motion (filed August 21) is meant to supersede and replace the motion
filed on August 19, Defendant should have filed a notice withdrawing the motion
filed on August 19.  There is no reason
for the Court to allow a part to file two motions seeking the same relief on
the same basis.
Defendant filed this motion on August 21, 2024,
and served Plaintiff the same day by mail and by email.  The email
service is not proper, but the mail service is.
Beginning with the email service, under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1010.6, subdivision (c), a plaintiff representing
himself in pro per must consent to electronic service:
 “An
unrepresented party may consent to receive electronic service… Express consent
to electronic service may be given by either of the following:  (i)
Serving a notice on all parties and filing the notice with the court. (ii) Manifesting
affirmative consent through electronic means with the court or the court’s
electronic filing service provider, and concurrently providing the party’s
electronic address with that consent for the purpose of receiving electronic
service. The act of electronic filing shall not be construed as express
consent.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6,
subd. (c).)
Nothing has been filed with the Court to show
Plaintiff’s consent of electronic service in accordance with Code of Civil
Procedure section 1010.6, subdivision (c).
The mail service for this motion is a proper
method of service and was timely.  When a motion is served by
personal service, service must be effected 16 court days prior to the
hearing.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)  For mail service,
five additional calendar days are added.  (Ibid.)  That
means that for a motion set to be heard on September 18, the last day for
personal service was August 26, and the last day for mail service was five days
earlier, or August 21.   
Turning to the merits, Defendant argues that
Plaintiff violated the Court’s Order dated May 28, 2024.  In the May 28 Order, the Court ordered
Defendant to give notice to Plaintiff (who did not attend the hearing).  Defendant states that notice was given
(Mittskus Decl., ¶ 6) but does not attach a proof of service to the moving
papers.  Moreover, the proof of service
in the Court’s file (filed on May 28) indicates that Plaintiff was served
electronically which, for the reasons stated above, is not valid service under
these circumstances.
As there is no evidence that Plaintiff was given
proper notice of the Court’s order of May 28, the Court cannot impose sanctions
against Plaintiff for the failure to comply. 
The motion is denied.
The Court also notes that to obtain a terminating sanction, a party must present evidence of
repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process, as well as evidence that less severe sanctions have not (or likely will not) lead to
compliance with the discovery rules. 
Defendant has not, on this record at this time, made such a
showing.  There
has not been a showing of a history or pattern of willful abuse or repeated
violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by lesser sanctions. 
Moreover, a discovery sanction should not
create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it would
have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations under
the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  Here, at this
time, a terminating sanction would create such a windfall for Defendant.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion.
Moving Party is ordered to
give notice.
