And here is a summary of the judge's decision in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial, citing good cause for the continuance. The defendants were unable to complete the deposition of the plaintiff despite months of effort, and the plaintiff only proposed deposition dates in October 2024, approximately six weeks before trial. The judge has denied the defendants' request for monetary sanctions, but has reserved the issue for further consideration in a separate motion set for hearing on September 24. The trial has been continued for approximately 90 days, and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
