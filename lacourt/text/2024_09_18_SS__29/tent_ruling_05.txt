Background
On December 5, 2022, Elizabeth
Parrott (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against City of Los Angeles
(“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 10. On May 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”).  
 
On March 13, 2024, Defendant filed an
answer to the FAC.  Defendant also filed
a cross-complaint against Roes 1 through10.
 
On August 7, 2024, Defendant filed
the three motions that are before the Court and set for hearing on September
18: a motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to Form Interrogatories (Set One); a
motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to, Special Interrogatories (Set One);
and a motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to Request for Production (Set One).

 
Plaintiff filed a single opposition
on August 30. 
 
No reply has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On March 13, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with
discovery including Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request
for Production. (Bona Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff has not responded. (Id., ¶ 6.)
 
In Plaintiff’s single opposition to these three motions,
Plaintiff does not contest the service of the discovery or the failure to
respond.  Plaintiff’s counsel does,
however, state that Plaintiff has not cooperated in providing responses, and
counsel argues that no sanctions should be imposed on him or his office.
(Yeager Decl., ¶ 2.)
 
As to request for an order compelling
discovery responses, Defendant need not show anything more.  All three motions to compel are granted.
As to the requests for sanctions, the Court finds
that Plaintiff has unsuccessfully opposed the motions, that Plaintiff has not
acted with substantial justification, and that the imposition of sanctions against
Plaintiff would not be unjust.  No
sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff’s counsel.  
In light of the economies of scale
associated with preparing multiple discovery motions, and the reasonably
straightforward nature of these motions, the Court sets sanctions in the amount
of $250 per motion, based on one hour of attorney time, multiplied by a
reasonable rate of $250 per hour for work of this nature. (See Bona Decls., ¶ 7.)

The Court GRANTS the motions to compel Plaintiff to respond to
form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production.

The Court ORDERS Plaintiff is ordered to pay monetary

within 30 days of notice of this order.
