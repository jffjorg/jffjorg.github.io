And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, granting the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiff to respond to discovery requests. The plaintiff has failed to respond to the defendant's requests for discovery, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not acted with substantial justification and that the imposition of sanctions would not be unjust. The judge awards monetary sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $750 and sets sanctions in the amount of $250 per motion, based on one hour of attorney time. The judge orders the plaintiff to serve code-compliant, written, verified responses to the defendant's discovery requests within 21 days of notice of this order.
