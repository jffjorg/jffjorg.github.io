Significant Statements:
  - The Court does not understand why Defendant filed two motions seeking overlapping relief on the same grounds.
  - A terminating sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.
  - Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction.
  - A discovery sanction should not create a "windfall" for a party or place a party in a better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations under the Court's orders and the Civil Discovery Act.

And here is the summary in English text:

The judge issues a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to dismiss the case. The case arises from an automobile accident that occurred on April 25, 2018, involving the plaintiff, Brad Bello, and the defendant, Francisco Jose Maisch. The plaintiff filed a complaint on April 23, 2020, alleging one cause of action for motor vehicle negligence. The defendant filed an answer on November 19, 2021, and later filed motions to compel the plaintiff to respond to form interrogatories and special interrogatories. The plaintiff failed to respond to these motions, and the court granted the motions and ordered the defendant to give notice to the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not respond to the notice, and the defendant filed a motion for terminating sanctions, arguing that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's order warrants dismissal of the case.

The judge notes that the defendant filed two motions seeking overlapping relief on the same grounds, which is unnecessary and confusing. The judge also finds that the plaintiff was not properly served with the notice, as the email service was not valid under the circumstances. Therefore, the judge cannot impose sanctions against the plaintiff for failing to comply with the court's order.

The judge also notes that to obtain a terminating sanction, a party must present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process, as well as evidence that less severe sanctions have not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules. The defendant has not made such a showing, and therefore, the judge denies the motion.

The judge concludes that the motion is denied, and the defendant is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
