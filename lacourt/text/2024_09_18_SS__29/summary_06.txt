```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion by Staff Pro, Inc. to file a new cross-complaint against Goldenvoice LLC. The motion was denied because the court is unsure whether the proposed cross-complaint is compulsory or permissive. The court notes that if the cross-complaint is compulsory, Staff Pro has acted in good faith, but the court is also unsure whether the indemnity claims were in existence at the time Staff Pro filed its answer to Goldenvoice's cross-complaint. The court suggests that Staff Pro could have amended its existing cross-complaint to add causes of action against Goldenvoice instead of seeking leave to file a new cross-complaint. The denial of the motion is without prejudice to a future motion by Staff Pro to amend its existing cross-complaint.
