The court denies the remainder of the motion.

The judge finds that there are disputed issues of fact in relation to whether defendant was aware of the dog's aggressive tendencies and whether defendant took reasonable care to prevent the attack. The court also denies the motion for summary adjudication of the Second Cause of Action (for common law strict liability) and the Seventh Cause of Action (for battery) because there are disputed issues of fact.

The court notes that the parties have raised various disputes, including whether defendant was aware of the dog's aggressive tendencies, whether defendant took reasonable care to prevent the attack, and whether plaintiff was injured as a result of the attack. The court also notes that the parties have presented conflicting evidence, including testimony from defendant and a nonparty witness.
