And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's ex parte application to continue the trial date for six months or later. The defendant had filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, which was scheduled to be heard after trial, and argued that good cause existed for the continuance due to the court's congested calendar. The judge agreed, citing a California court case that states parties have a right to have their timely filed Motion for Summary Judgment heard before the start of trial. The judge will confer with the parties to select a new trial date, and the discovery cut-off will track the new trial date. The moving party is required to give notice.
