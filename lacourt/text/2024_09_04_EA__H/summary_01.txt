And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Shipflex Logistics LLC's application for default judgment against Pilot Inc. dba Pilot Automotive Inc. The application is denied without prejudice. The judge notes that the complaint fails to properly allege the theory of damages being sought by Shipflex, which is based on the defendant's failure to pay rent for a warehouse. The court has a duty to act as a "gatekeeper" to ensure that only appropriate claims are allowed. The judge requires Shipflex to amend its complaint and serve it on Pilot if it wishes to proceed with a claim for return of rental payments or other damages resulting from being vacated from the warehouse. The case will be heard on September 4, 2024.
