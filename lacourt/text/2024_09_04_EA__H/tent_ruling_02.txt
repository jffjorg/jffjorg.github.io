  [FN*]Â While  the fatal flaw with the instant application is that the complaint does not  properly allege the theory on which Plaintiff is entitled to relief, the Court  further observes that the rental payments Plaintiff seeks in connection with  the default judgment (i.e., the amounts reflected in Exhibit B) do not match  the rental payments referenced in Schedule 2.1 of the Agreement. To the extent  Plaintiff submits a renewed default judgment application, Plaintiff must explain the discrepancy. Plaintiff also must prove (through a  declaration or other competent evidence) that it in fact paid to Defendant the  rental payments it claims it is owed.
