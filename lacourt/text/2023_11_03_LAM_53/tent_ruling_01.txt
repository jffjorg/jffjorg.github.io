EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
The court grants defendant
Skydance Media, LLC’s request to strike the “Notice of Errata of Plaintiff’s
Separate Statement in Support of Plaintiff’s Second Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, from Defendant Skydance Media,
LLC,” filed by plaintiff Dan Sackheim on October 23, 2023, because it was not
filed and served 16 court days before the hearing as required by Code of Civil
Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).
The court overrules plaintiff
Dan Sackheim’s objection to defendant Skydance Media, LLC’s “sur-reply,”
because the court has construed that filing to be an evidentiary objection,
irrespective of its labeling as a sur-reply, since it requests that the court
strike the notice of errata and amended separate statement and does not include
further arguments in support of its opposition. 
The court grants defendant
Amazon Studios, Inc.’s request to strike the “Notice of Errata of Plaintiff’s
Separate Statement in Support of Plaintiff’s Second Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, from Defendant Amazon Studios,
LLC,” filed by plaintiff Dan Sackheim on October 23, 2023, because it was not
filed and served 16 court days before the hearing as required by Code of Civil
Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).
The court overrules plaintiff
Dan Sackheim’s objection to defendant Amazon Studios, Inc.’s “sur-reply”
because the court has construed that filing to be an evidentiary objection for
the same reasons as set forth above.  
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER
RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES FROM SKYDANCE MEDIA, LLC
Plaintiff Dan Sackheim (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1)
compelling defendant Skydance Media, LLC (“Skydance”) to serve further
responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, numbers 1-10, 13, 18, 19, 21,
22, 27-29, 31, and 33-42, and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and
against Skydance in the amount of $5,469.
            The court denies Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Skydance’s further responses to Special Interrogatories,
numbers 1-10 because, given the specially defined term “DESCRIBE IN DETAIL,”
those interrogatories contain subparts and are compound in violation of Code of
Civil Procedure section 2030.060, subdivision (f), and therefore Skydance’s
objections on the ground that they are compound are not without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(3).) 
            The court denies Plaintiff’s motion
to compel Skydance’s further responses to Special Interrogatories, numbers 13,
18, 27-29, 31, and 33-38 because the answers to those interrogatories are not
evasive or incomplete.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) 
            The court denies Plaintiff’s motion
to compel Skydance’s further response to Special Interrogatories, number 19
because Skydance’s objections to that interrogatory are not without merit since
the interrogatory calls for information that is protected by the work-product
protection.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.300, subd. (a)(3).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Skydance’s further
response to Special Interrogatories, numbers 21-22 and 39-42 because the
answers to those interrogatories are evasive and incomplete.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(a)(1).) 
In light of the mixed results of the court’s ruling, the court finds
that the circumstances presented would make the imposition of sanctions unjust
and therefore denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against
Skydance.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.300, subd. (d).) 
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER
RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES FROM AMAZON STUDIOS, INC.
Plaintiff moves the court for
an order (1) compelling defendant Amazon Studios, Inc. (“Amazon”) to provide
further responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, numbers 3.7, 15.1, 16.1,
16.9, and 16.10, and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against
Amazon in the amount of $5,469.
            The
court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Amazon’s further responses to Form
Interrogatories, numbers 3.7, 15.1, 16.1, and 16.9 because Amazon’s answers to
those interrogatories are evasive and incomplete.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(a)(1).)
            The
court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel Amazon’s further response to Form
Interrogatories, number 16.10 because Amazon’s answer to that interrogatory is
not evasive or incomplete.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) 
In light of the mixed results of the court’s ruling, the court finds
that the circumstances presented would make the imposition of sanctions unjust
and therefore denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Amazon.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(d).)
