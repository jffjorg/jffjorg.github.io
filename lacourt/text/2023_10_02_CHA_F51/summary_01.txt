## English-Text Summary

This tentative ruling addresses a motion filed by Defendant D L English Design to strike Plaintiff Stephanie Gissell Penaloza's request for punitive damages in her first amended complaint. 

The collision involved a parked USPS truck driven by Plaintiff and Defendant's van driven by Moses Garcia.  Plaintiff alleges Garcia fled the scene after the collision, causing her injuries.  

Defendant argues Plaintiff hasn't provided enough evidence to support punitive damages, claiming there's no proof of pre-incident malice or knowledge of Garcia's unfitness. Defendant also argues their actions, such as requesting a replacement license plate, don't constitute a cover-up.

However, the Judge finds Plaintiff's allegations sufficient to warrant punitive damages.  The Judge notes Plaintiff's claims of Defendant's knowledge of Garcia's unfitness, ratification of his conduct through cover-up efforts (including fleeing the scene and denying involvement), and personal culpability in causing harm.  

The motion to strike punitive damages is denied, and Defendant is ordered to file an answer to the complaint within 30 days.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages in the first amended complaint (FAC). The motion is denied. The court finds that Plaintiff's factual allegations are sufficient to support a prayer for punitive damages against Defendant for its employee's conduct. The court also finds that Plaintiff's allegations of malice and employer liability go beyond the scope of Defendant's replacement of the subject vehicle's license plate and include failure to report the incident to law enforcement, denial of involvement, and refusal to name the driver. The court denies the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages and orders Defendant to file and serve an answer to the FAC within 30 days of the hearing date.

Summary:
This is a summary of a tentative ruling by a Judge regarding a future Court Hearing for Case Number 23CHCV00923, scheduled for October 2, 2023, in the F51 Dept. of the Los Angeles Superior Court. The Judge has denied Defendant's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages in Plaintiff’s first amended complaint. Defendant, D L English Design, is required to file and serve an answer to Plaintiff’s FAC within 30 days of this hearing date.

The case involves an incident on 4/9/21 where Plaintiff, Stephanie Gissell Penaloza, was a passenger in a parked USPS truck that was struck by a 2018 Ford commercial-grade van owned by Defendant and driven by nonmoving Defendant Moses Garcia. Plaintiff alleges that she was injured and her vehicle collided with a third (non-party) vehicle. Defendant-driver fled the scene of the crash, and Defendant attempted to cover up the incident.

The Judge has determined that the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages is denied based on the facts alleged by Plaintiff, which demonstrate Defendants' conscious disregard for the safety of Plaintiff.
