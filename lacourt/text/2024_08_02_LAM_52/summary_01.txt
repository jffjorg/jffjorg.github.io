And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of respondents Farhad Eliasi and Elad Benisti to reconsider or correct the court's order awarding petitioner Eyal Raziel attorney fees and costs. The respondents have failed to show valid grounds for reconsideration, and their argument that the operating agreement of Extended Vision, LLC absolves them of liability for attorney fees or costs is based on a purely legal interpretation of the contract, which they could have made earlier in the proceedings. The judge has also denied the respondents' request to correct the court's order under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(d) because they have not shown any clerical mistake or void judgment or order. The judge has ordered petitioner Raziel to recover an additional $6,750 in attorney fees from respondents Eliasi and Benisti for opposing their motion.
