 Case Number:  23STCV14994    Hearing Date:   August 2, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Default
Judgment
Plaintiff Deborah Justice requests court judgment by default
against defendant Allyson Maren Carey. 
Plaintiff’s application meets all requirements for default judgment.  Plaintiff’s proposed judgment, however,
incorrectly states the judgment is “for defendant … Allyson Carey”
instead of “against defendant.” 
(JUD-100, § 5.)  The court will
modify the proposed judgment to state the judgment is against defendant Carey.
Plaintiff’s request for default
judgment is granted.  The court
will modify plaintiff’s proposed judgment and enter judgment.
