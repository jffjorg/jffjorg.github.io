The plaintiff has not had a full opportunity to be heard on the issue of whether the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFAA) applies to this case. The defendants have failed to submit supporting evidence and a memorandum of points and authorities in support of their petition. The court will therefore give the plaintiff an opportunity to respond to the defendants' contentions. The court will also exercise its discretion to require further briefing on this issue.
