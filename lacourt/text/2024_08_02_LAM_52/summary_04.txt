And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Randolf L. Turrow's demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiffs George Gamble and Nancy Gamble. The Defendant demurred to the Plaintiffs' first, second, third, fifth, and ninth causes of action. The Judge denied the Defendant's request for judicial notice of a prior declaration, finding that the exhibit is subject to judicial notice only for its existence and legal effects, not the truth of the matters asserted therein.

The Judge also found that the Plaintiffs' second amended complaint does not meet the standard for pleading fraud with particularity, specifically with regard to the first, second, and third causes of action. The Judge sustained the Defendant's demurrers to these causes of action with 15 days' leave to amend. The Judge overruled the Defendant's demurrers to the fifth and ninth causes of action.

The Judge's ruling does not address the merits of the Plaintiffs' claims, but rather focuses on the sufficiency of the complaint to withstand demurrer. The case will proceed to a future hearing on August 2, 2024, where the parties will have an opportunity to present their arguments and evidence.
