 Case Number:  21STCV31654    Hearing Date:   August 2, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff
Alexis Mitchell’s Motion to Quash Trial Subpoenas
Plaintiff
Alexis Mitchell moves to quash trial subpoenas served by defendant Quantum
Environmental Testing, Inc. (Quantum) to six deponents: (1) Grand Canyon
University, (2) Tecolote Research Inc., (3) FedEx Office Print & Ship
Center, (4) Patriot Environmental, (5) Fiasco Enterprises Inc., and (6) State
Compensation Insurance Fund.
Plaintiff
shows good cause to quash the subpoenas. 
Quantum did not properly serve plaintiff with notice to consumer or
notice to employee as required.  A party
who subpoenas a consumer’s personal records must serve a notice to the consumer
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1985.3. 
The notice may be served to the consumer’s attorney of record.  (Id., subd. (b)(1).)  The notice must be served at least 10 days before
the date specified for production.  (Id.,
subd. (b)(2).)  Equivalent requirements
apply when a party subpoenas an employee’s employment records.  (CCP § 1985.6.)   
For
each of the six subpoenas, Quantum served by mail a notice to consumer or
employee on Judicial Council Form SUBP-025. 
But Quantum served them to the wrong address.  On January 29, 2024, plaintiff’s counsel
served and filed a notice of change of address. 
(Khan Decl., Ex. A.)  It states
counsel’s address is 21213 Hawthorne Blvd., STE B #3300, Torrance, CA 90503.  (Ibid.)  Quantum served each notice to consumer or
employee to plaintiff’s counsel’s prior address: 800 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 200,
Los Angeles, CA 90017.  (Khan Decl., ¶¶
5, 8-10, Exs. D & F.)  Quantum therefore
did not comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections 1985.3 and 1985.6.  The court will quash the subpoenas.
Disposition
Plaintiff
Alexis Mitchell’s motion to quash trial subpoenas is granted.  The court hereby quashes defendant
Quantum Environmental Testing, Inc.’s trial subpoenas to (1) Grand Canyon
University, (2) Tecolote Research Inc., (3) FedEx Office Print & Ship
Center, (4) Patriot Environmental, (5) Fiasco Enterprises Inc., and (6) State
Compensation Insurance Fund.
