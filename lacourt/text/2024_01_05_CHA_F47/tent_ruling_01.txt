Case #21CHCV00099
 
MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Motion filed on 12/7/23.
 
MOVING ATTORNEY: Matthew Barzman
CLIENT: Defendant Shyla Walker
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order relieving Matthew
Barzman as counsel for Defendant Shyla Walker in this action.
 
RULING: The hearing on the motion will be
continued.  
 
On  12/7/23,
attorney Matthew Barzman of Sanders Roberts LP filed and served the instant
motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Shyla Walker in this
action.  The motion was originally
scheduled for hearing on 1/24/24 but was advanced by the Court to 1/5/24 on
12/11/23.  (See 12/11/23 Minute
Order).  
 
Attorney Barzman has made a sufficient showing that
withdrawing from representing Shyla Walker in this action is warranted.  However, a proposed Order Granting Attorney’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Council on Judicial Council – Civil Form MC-053 has
not been lodged with the court with the moving papers as required.  See CRC 3.1362(e).  More importantly, there is no evidence that
the client was provided notice that the hearing date was advanced from 1/24/24
to 1/5/24.
 
As such, the hearing will be continued.
