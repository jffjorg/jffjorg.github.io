The Judge's tentative ruling is that the hearing on the motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Shyla Walker will be continued. The motion was filed on December 7, 2023, and was originally scheduled for hearing on January 24, 2024, but was advanced to January 5, 2024, by the Court on December 11, 2023. The Judge finds that Attorney Matthew Barzman has made a sufficient showing to withdraw from representing Shyla Walker, but notes that a proposed Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Council has not been lodged with the Court as required. Additionally, there is no evidence that the client was provided notice of the hearing date change. As a result, the hearing will be continued.
