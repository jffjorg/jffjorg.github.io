The Court will note that there appears to be some confusion as to when
Plaintiff’s counsel obtained the police report. Plaintiff’s motion states that
her counsel received the police report on February 16, 2023 (Motion at p. 3),
while her counsel’s declaration states that the police report was received on
February 16, 2024 (Neubauer Decl., ¶ 8). Plaintiff’s reply does not address
this discrepancy.
