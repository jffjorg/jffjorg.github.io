And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add a prayer for punitive damages to her complaint, as well as a paragraph regarding the defendant's alleged driving under the influence of alcohol. The defendants argue that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate diligence in amending her complaint and that the proposed amendments are subject to demurrer and motion to strike. The judge finds that the defendants have not shown prejudice or inexcusable delay, and therefore grants the motion. The judge also notes that it is premature to argue the merits of the proposed amendments and that a demurrer is a more appropriate means of challenging the sufficiency of the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages.
