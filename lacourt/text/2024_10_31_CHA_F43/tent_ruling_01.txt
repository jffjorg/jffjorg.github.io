SUMMARY OF
ACTION
This Court
previously appointed Mark Adams of California Receivership Group (Receiver), as
Receiver for the Property located at 25046 Atwood Blvd., Santa Clarita, CA,
91321, (the Property) by order signed by this Court on July 23, 2021. The
Appointment Order found the Property was maintained in such a manner as to
constitute a public nuisance as defined under California Health and Safety Code
17920.3, the Santa Clarita Municipal Code (SCMC) and its adopted codes, and
that the violations were so extensive that the health and safety of the general
public was substantially endangered.
 
The Property
consisted of a single-family home of approximately 950 square feet on a lot of
approximately 7,683 square feet. At the time of appointment, the Property
suffered from numerous health and safety code violations. The Appointment Order
directed the Receiver to take full and complete control of the Property, to
prepare a plan to remedy the substandard conditions that necessitated the
appointment, and to rehabilitate the Property following the Court’s approval of
that plan.
 
On July 28,
2021, the Receiver conducted an initial inspection of the Property and began
formulating the remediation plan. The Receiver did things like cleaning fire
hazards out of the Property and soliciting estimates for the cost of
remediation work. The Receiver also listed the Property on the market to get an
accurate market value for the Property. The Court confirmed an as-is sale as
the best course of action, and the Property was sold on October 21, 2021, to
Diablo LLC and Gustavo Cardenas (First Buyer).
 
First Buyer did
not complete the necessary work on the Property by March 2023. The Receiver was
forced to step back in and take control of the Property. Around the same time,
the Receiver’s office was notified by First Buyer’s lender that it was
commencing a foreclosure on the property due to First Buyer’s failure to pay
their loan.
 
The Receiver
began remedial work on the Property in April 2023. By the Receiver’s Seventh
Report on November 12, 2023, all of the major remediation work was complete
other than a couple of things. The Receiver also stopped the foreclosure. By
December 2023, all of the work was completed and Receiver listed the Property
for sale for $699,999. After receiving four offers, the Receiver sold the
property for $680,000 to the New Buyer. First Buyer challenged the sale, but
the Court confirmed the sale of the Property on February 29, 2024.
 
Escrow closed
on May 15, 2024. The Receiver ensured New Buyer’s possession of the Property
caused no further issues. The Receiver is ready for discharge, so he filed this
motion to discharge the receivership on August 2, 2024. No opposition has been
filed.
 
ANALYSIS
The Final
Accounting and Motion for Discharge are the final actions in a receivership.
They are filed after the conditions and violations that required the
appointment are remedied, and the receivership actions are complete. (Health
and Safety Code § 17980.7(c)(9).) They provide a final and full accounting of
all the financial aspects of a receivership and give all impacted parties a
chance to review those amounts. They provide a full review of the receivership,
and the Discharge Order is the final judgment in the matter. The motion or
stipulation for discharge is served on all parties and any non-parties that
will be “affected by the order or stipulation . . .” (CRC Rule 3.1184(c)), and
it will bind all those with notice to its terms.
 
Once the work
of a receivership is finished, the Receiver is required to submit a motion or
stipulation for discharge, and a summary of all accounts, payments, and debts
of the receivership. (CRC Rule 3.1183, 3.1184; County of Sacramento v. Singh
(2021) 65 Cal.App.5th 858.) A receiver is an independent third party, a “hand”
or “agent” of the court that acts only upon the direction and authority of the
appointing court. (Takeba v. Superior Court (1919) 43 Cal.App. 469, 475.)
Thus, all actions undertaken are subject to final ratification by the Court,
and the discharge hearing is usually the appropriate venue for such final
ratification by the Court. (Hanno v. Superior Court (1939) 30 Cal.App.2d
639, 641.) The order discharging the receiver is necessary to fully complete
the receivership and end the court’s involvement. (Jun v. Myers (2001)
88 Cal.App.4th 117, 123-24.) The discharge does not happen automatically, and
must be requested. (Scoville v. De Bretteville (1942) 50 Cal.App.2d 622,
632.)
 
Here, the
Receiver has filed this motion for discharge as well as a summary of all
accounts, payments, and debts of the receivership. (See Adams Decl.) 
 
The accounting
can be, but is not required to be, supported by vouchers or invoices explaining
the costs of the receivership. (Hozz v. Varga (1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 539,
542.) Any unspent receivership funds are to be disbursed by order of the Court
upon application of “the owner, the mortgagee, or any lienor of record…”
(Health and Safety Code § 17980.7(c)(9).) Any objections must be brought at the
discharge hearing, otherwise they are waived. (Aviation Brake Systems, Ltd.
v. Voorhis (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 230, 232, 235.) When such an objection is
made, the burden is on the challenging party to present evidence to the Court
supporting the challenge. (Macmorris Sales Corp. v. Kozak (1967) 249
Cal.App.2d 998, 1003-04; see also People v. Riverside University (1973)
35 Cal.App.3d 572, 586.) The overseeing court assumes the receiver is honest
until evidence suggests otherwise, and unsubstantiated objections to a receiver’s
account do not provide a basis for refusing to approve an account. (County
of Sacramento, 65 Cal.App.5th 858.)
 
In this case, the
Receiver has attached his Final Report to his motion. The Final Report includes
backup invoices for the months of June and July 2024. The Final Report and its
attachments provide a summary of the receivership and the account. 
 
Objections to
the monthly accounting reports provided by the Receiver may be filed pursuant
to CRC Rule 3.1183(b), which requires that objections be made within 10 days of
notice of the report and accounting. In this case, none of the parties objected
to the monthly reports filed by the Receiver, though at one point First Buyer
filed untimely objections, which would have been procedurally improper. By not
objecting to the reports, this waives the parties’ right to object to the
monthly reports.
 
The discharge
order settling the account is the final judgment in a receivership proceeding,
and thus one of the few appealable orders. (Aviation Brake Systems, 133
Cal.App.3d at 233.) In the interests of finality, the discharge order is also
res judicata as to all actions of the receivership. (See Vitug v. Griffin
(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 488, 495; see also Aviation Brake Systems, 133
Cal.App.3d at 235.) The receiver and the court appointing the receiver are not
proper parties to any action after being discharged, because the official
duties have ended. (Vitug, 214 Cal.App.3d at 494.) 
 
As a part of
the motion or stipulation for discharge, the receiver is to submit a request
for exoneration of the surety. (CRC Rule 3.1184(a)(3).) An undertaking, or
bond, is often required by CCP § 567(b), with the beneficiary being the State
of California. At the discharge hearing, and in the discharge order, if there
are no more outstanding liabilities of the receivership, the surety is to be
exonerated as there are no longer any liabilities of the receivership for the
surety to ensure. In this case, a $100,000 bond with the State of California as
the listed beneficiary was purchased on July 27, 2021. Assuming all claims are
settled against the receivership property and the Receiver at discharge, then
the bond can be exonerated upon discharge.
 
Based on the
information presented by the Receiver in his motion and attachments, the Court
finds that the receivership can be discharged. The Court orders the
receivership discharged and the surety exonerated.
 
Additionally,
there is the matter of the receiver fees. In the receiver’s role as an agent of
the Court, the receiver is entitled to payment of his own fees and costs, and
the fees of all agents in his employ. (City of Chula Vista v. Gutierrez
(2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 681, 685.) The amount of that compensation is left up to
the appointing Court because the appointing court understood the need for the
appointment and is familiar with the day-to-day activities therein. (Venza
v. Venza (1951) 101 Cal.App.2d 678, 680-81.)
 
The amount of receivership
fees and costs outstanding in this case is $231,834.50, as well as $50,990.12
for the repayment of the construction loan taken out by Robert Rossil. (See
Memo. of Points and Authorities, pp. 5-6.)
 
In a situation
like this, where the receivership Property cannot cover the amounts owed,
§17980.7(c)(15) provides the back-up plan: “upon the request of a receiver, a
court may require the owner of the property to pay all unrecovered costs
associated with the receivership in addition to any other remedy authorized by
law.”
 
California
Health and Safety Code § 17980.7(f) defines the term “owner” as including “any
successor in interest who had actual or constructive knowledge of the notice,
order, or prosecution.” (Kaura v. Stabilis Fund II, LLC (2018) 24
Cal.App.5th 420, 432.)
 
Here, the
Receiver has requested that Diablo LLC, Robert Rossil (he signed the promissory
note for the Receiver construction loan and was a subsequent owner), and
Gustavo Cardenas be held jointly and severally liable for the unpaid receivership
fees and costs. The Receiver has also requested that Rossil be held
individually liable for the construction loan repayment. As the First Buyer,
Diablo LLC, Robert Rossil, and Gustavo Cardenas were obligated to remedy the
code violations and hazards on the Property. They failed to do so and almost
lost the Property to foreclosure, which obligated the Receiver to step in and
remedy the violations. As the owners of the Property, the Court can require
them to pay all of the uncovered costs associated with the receivership.
 
Accordingly,
Diablo LLC, Robert Rossil, and Gustavo Cardenas are ordered pay the outstanding
costs of the receivership in the amounts of $231,834.50 in unpaid fees, and
Rossil is ordered to pay $50,990.12 for the construction loan repayment.
 
CONCLUSION
The Receiver’s
motion for discharge, exoneration of the surety, and for an order directing
payment of fees and costs is granted. The receivership is ordered to be
concluded.
 
Diablo LLC,
Robert Rossil, and Gustavo Cardenas are ordered to pay receiver fees and costs
in the amounts of $231,834.50 in unpaid fees, and Rossil is ordered to pay
$50,990.12 for the construction loan repayment.
