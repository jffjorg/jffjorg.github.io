And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Maria G. Orozco, filed an action against the defendant, Northgate Gonzalez, LLC, for general negligence and premises liability. The defendant filed an answer and then a motion for summary judgment, which was set for hearing on October 31, 2024. The plaintiff filed an opposition, and the defendant filed a reply.

The Court finds that the defendant has carried its initial burden of showing that the green leafy material was not on the floor long enough for the defendant to have discovered it. However, the plaintiff has raised a triable issue of fact regarding the reasonable inspection and sweep of aisle 6, as well as whether the defendant's employee created the dangerous condition.

The Court denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment and orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling. The Court also orders the moving party to file proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
