And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has considered the motions and opposition papers in this case, which involves a premises liability dispute between Plaintiff Lisa Graham and Defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation. On August 22, 2024, Plaintiff signed a Release and Settlement Agreement, which requires her to negotiate the amount of a lien asserted by her former counsel on her recovery before receiving payment of the remaining settlement funds. The Judge finds that Plaintiff has not satisfied this requirement and therefore denies her motion to release settlement funds. The Judge also denies Defendant's request for sanctions.
