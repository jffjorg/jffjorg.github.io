[1]           Under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, the “prevailing
party” must serve and file a memorandum of costs within a specified time
period.  Upon filing the memorandum, the
opposing party may serve and file a motion to strike or to tax costs.  Here, Plaintiff combined the motion for
attorney’s fees and attached the memorandum of costs as a supporting
exhibit.  Defendants did not separately
file a motion to tax costs nor did they object to the Court considering both
the fees and costs together in one hearing.
