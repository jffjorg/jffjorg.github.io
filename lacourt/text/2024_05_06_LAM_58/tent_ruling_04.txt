            The parties have settled this Song-Beverly
matter and have agreed that Plaintiff Jorge Gonzalez Luna is the prevailing
party entitled to fees and costs under Civil Code section 1794, subdivision
(d).  
 
            Plaintiff moves for an order
awarding attorneys’ fees under the lodestar method in the amount of $24,204.50.  Plaintiff also requests $2,886.55 in costs.
The total requested is $27,091.05.  
 
            Plaintiff leased a new 2020 Ford Explorer
Sport from Bob Wondries Ford (dealership) with ninety (90) miles on the
odometer, for a total price of $59,579.85. After experiencing issues related to
brakes, electrical, transmission, front axle, and other nonconformities to
warranty, Plaintiff, through The Lemon Pros LLP, filed this action against the
dealership and Ford Motor Company (Defendants) alleging violations of the Song-Beverly
Act on April 19, 2023.  
            
            On May 16, 2023, before appearing in
this action, Ford offered to repurchase the vehicle pursuant to statutory
formula of Song Beverly. (Proudfoot Decl., ¶ 6; Ex. C.) Plaintiff assertedly ignored
this offer. Instead, on July 20, 2023, Plaintiff served a 998 offer for
$130,000 plus attorney’s fees. (Proudfoot Decl., ¶ 7.)
 
            On January 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a “Notice of Settlement.”  The settlement
was for $37,906.00 and attorney’s fees by this motion.
 
             
The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’ fees in part. 
 
Legal Standard
 
            A
prevailing buyer in a Song-Beverly action “shall be allowed by the court to
recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs
and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the Court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.”¿¿(Civ. Code,
§ 1794,¿subd. (d).) 
 
            The
prevailing party has the burden of showing that the requested attorney fees were
“reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in
amount.” (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California Inc.¿(2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817.) The party seeking attorney fees “ ‘is not
necessarily entitled to compensation for the value of attorney services
according to [his] own notion or to the full extent claimed by [him].’ ” (Levy
v. Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc.¿(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807, 816.)¿¿Therefore,
if the “time expended or the monetary charge being made for the time expended
are not reasonable under all the circumstances, then the court must take this
into account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.” (Nightingale v.
Hyundai Motor America¿(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.)¿¿ 
¿¿

            A court may “reduce a fee award
based on its reasonable determination that a routine, noncomplex case was
overstaffed to a degree that significant inefficiencies and inflated fees
resulted.”¿¿(Morris v. Hyundai Motor America¿(2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24,
39.)¿¿It is also appropriate to reduce an award based on inefficient or
duplicative efforts. (Id.¿at p. 38.) However, the analysis must be
“reasonably specific” and cannot rely on general notions of fairness. (Kerkeles¿v.
City of San Jose¿(2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 88,¿102.)¿¿Moreover, in conducting
the analysis, courts are not permitted to tie any reductions in the fee award
to some proportion of the buyer’s damages recovery. (Warren v. Kia Motors
America, Inc.¿(2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 39.)
 
Discussion

 
            Plaintiff seeks $24,204.50 in
attorneys’ fees.  The amount includes
anticipated fees of $5,473.50 for preparation, review, drafting the reply, and
attendance at the hearing for the fee motion itself. 
 
            Defendant contends that fees should
be limited based upon the earlier settlement offers.  As to the specific billing entries, they
argue that Plaintiff’s hourly rate and hours expended are excessive; there are
inappropriate billing entries such as for routine and administrative tasks;
anticipated entries should not be included; templates were used; and the
lodestar should be reduced by 33.5 hours. 
 
            A calculation of attorneys’ fees for
a Song-Beverly action¿begins with the “lodestar” approach, under which the
Court fixes the lodestar¿at¿“the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied
by the reasonable hourly rate.”¿ (Margolin v. Regional Planning Com.¿(1982)
134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004-1005.)¿ “California courts have consistently held that
a computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is
fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.”¿ (Ibid.)¿
“ ‘The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar
work.’ ”¿ (Id.¿at p. 1004.)¿ The lodestar figure may then be adjusted,
based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee
at the fair market value for the legal services¿provided.¿ (Serrano v.
Priest¿(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49;¿PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler¿(2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) 
 
            “[T]rial courts need not, and indeed
should not, become green-eyeshade accountants. The essential goal in shifting
fees (to either party) is to do rough justice, not to achieve auditing
perfection. So trial courts may take into account their overall sense of a
suit, and may use estimates in calculating and allocating an attorney's time.”
(Fox v. Vice (2011) 563 U.S. 826, 838.)
 
            Defendant first argues that the attorney’s fees sought are
unreasonable because Defendant complied with its obligation under Song-Beverly
by providing a repurchase offer. (Opposition, p. 4:13.) The argument is
unavailing.  Defendant does not provide
any comparison beteen a repurchase and the settlement amount. (Saeedian Reply Decl.,
¶ 5.) Further, Defendant did not make a section 998 offer to settle the case. (Id.)
Moreover, the January 19, 2024, appears to have been more favorable to
Plaintiff than the earlier offer from Defendant, on May 16, 2023. The May 2023
offer was based on a statutory formula, not a specific amount apart from the
attorney’s fees in the amount of $8,500, although it did offer to provide the numbers
if Plaintiff provided the contract and  payment
history. (Proudfoot Decl. ¶ 6; Ex. C.) The eventual $37,906.00 settlement is approximately
$10,500 higher than Mr. Luna’s total payments, indicating the settlement was better
for Plaintiff than Ford’s initial proposal. (Saeedian Reply Decl. ¶ 4.) 
 
            Thus, the Court declines Defendant’s
request to categorically reduce the fees based upon earlier settlement
offers.  (See Reck v. FCA US LLC (2021)
64 Cal.App.5th 682, 697 [trial court “may not categorically deny all fees from
the date of the offer when the plaintiff’s decision to press forward with
litigation has been vindicated by a more favorable judgment or award”].) 
 
Attorneys’ fees
 
Hourly Rate and Excessive Hours
 
            Defendants contend that the hourly
rates for attorneys’ fees are unreasonable.
 
            In assessing the reasonableness of
hourly billing rates,¿“the court may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity
with the legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and reputation of the
attorney requesting fees [citation], the difficulty or complexity of the
litigation to which that skill was applied [citations], and affidavits from
other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the community and rate
determinations in other cases.”¿¿(569 East County Boulevard LLC v.
Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc.¿(2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 437; see¿Mountjoy
v. Bank of America, N.A.¿(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 272 [“ ‘ “a reasonable
hourly rate is the product of a multiplicity of factors…[including] the level
of skill necessary, time limitations, the amount to be obtained in the
litigation, the attorney’s reputation, and the undesirability of the case” ’ ”].)¿
 
            The Court disagrees with Defendant’s
contention that the rates are unreasonable. 
Here, a review of both Saeedian Declarations in support of the motion
for attorney’s fees, the descriptions of each attorneys’ years of experience,
the accompanying exhibits, and the arguments and evidence brought forth by Plaintiff
leads to the conclusion that Plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees as requested are
reasonable: $695.00 per hour for Michael Saeedian, $525.00 per hour for
Christopher Urner, and $250.00 for the certified law clerk, Jorge L. Acosta.  The rates are supported by substantial
evidence under the present circumstances. 
(Saeedian Decl., ¶¶ 1-8, 10-12, 18-21.) 
Specifically, Saeedian states that the rates charged by his office are
reflected in the Laffey Matrix.  (Saeedian
Decl., ¶ 12.) 
 
            The
Court does not find the number of hours billed to be unreasonable.  
 
            Deduction
for administrative tasks.
 
            The Court has reviewed the itemized
entries and makes the following reductions because they are essentially
clerical, and should not be charged to a client or claimed under a fee-shifting
provision, because they are part of law firm overhead.  
 
                        The Court removed 31 clerical
and administrative entries. Examples of these entries are as follows:
 
o  
5/2/2023 JLA Receipt and review of POS of Summons for
FMC from Process Server. 0.2 $250 $50.00
o  
5/3/2023
JLA Receipt of Conformed POS of Summons for FMC and update file regarding same.
0.1 $250 $25.00
o  
5/3/2023
JLA Receipt and review of confirmation for assigning service of process to FMC.
0.1 $250 $25.00
o  
9/25/2023 JLA Review FMC's Document Production,
separate documents for attorney review, name and update case file. 2.2 $250 $550.00
o  
2/10/2023
JLA Request of lease documents and vehicle registration from Client. 0.1 $250 $25.00
 
            The total deduction for clerical
entries is $1794.50
 
            Thus, the Court grants Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees in a
reduced amount of $22,410.00 (24,204.50-1,794.50). 
 
            Anticipated
Billing
 
            While
Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot bill for time not actually incurred,
this argument is moot given that Plaintiff has filed the corresponding motion
for fees and the reply. 
 
 
Costs
 
            Plaintiff seeks a total of $2,886.55
in costs.[1]
 Defendants do not contest the
memorandum of costs.  The “ ‘failure to
file a motion to tax costs constitutes a waiver of the right to object.’ ”  (Douglas v. Willis (1994) 27
Cal.App.4th 287, 289.)  A “ ‘verified
memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of [the] propriety’ of the items
listed on it, and the burden is on the party challenging these costs to
demonstrate that they were not reasonable or necessary.”  (Adams v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199
Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486.)  Because
Defendants do not challenge the costs, the Court finds that Plaintiff has met his
burden and awards the full amount. 
 
 
Conclusion
 
            The motion for attorneys’ fees and
costs is granted in part.   In sum, the Court grants Plaintiff’s request
for attorneys’ fees in the total amount of $22,410.00.  Costs are awarded in the amount of $2,886.55.
 Defendant shall pay to Plaintiff’s
counsel the total of $25,296.55 on or before June 28, 2024.
