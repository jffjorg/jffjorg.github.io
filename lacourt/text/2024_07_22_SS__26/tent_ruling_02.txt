ANALYSIS:
 
On April 28, 2023, Plaintiff Aaron Sayles (“Plaintiff”)
filed this action against Defendants Westlake
Services, LLC (“Defendant Westlake”), Hudson Insurance Company (“Defendant
Hudson”), and Las Playas Auto Sales Inc. (“Defendant Las Playas”). Plaintiff
filed the first Motion to Compel Arbitration (“first Motion to Compel
Arbitration”) on July 18, 2023. Defendant Hudson was personally served with the
Summons and Complaint on July 12, 2023; Defendant Westlake was personally
served on August 3, 2023, but has not yet appeared. On October 5, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a notice of non-service with respect to Defendant Las Playas.
The Court denied Plaintiff’s first Motion to Compel Arbitration, brought with
respect to Defendant Las Playas and Westlake, on October 16, 2023. (Minute
Order, 10/16/23.) Plaintiff dismissed Defendant Las Playas on November 1, 2023,
then moved for an order allowing service on Defendant Las Playas via the
Secretary of State. The order was granted on April 2, 2024.  
 
Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion, again seeking to compel Defendants Westlake and Las Playas to submit to arbitration (“the Renewed Motion to Compel Arbitration”) on
May 17, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
When a party
seeks the same relief that was previously denied, it must bring a renewed
motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (b). (California
Correctional Peace Officers Ass’n v. Virga (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 30, 43,
fn. 11; see also Tate v. Wilburn (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 150, 156-157.)
When a motion has been denied in whole or in part, the moving party may apply
again for the same relief at a later time only upon “new or different facts,
circumstances or law.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (b); see Graham v.
Hansen (1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 965, 969-970.) 
 
Despite
being a renewed motion, Plaintiff has not filed a supporting declaration as
required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. The Court lacks the
jurisdiction to reconsider a prior ruling, on motion of a party, where the
motion does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section
1008. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (e); Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35
Cal.4th 1094, 1106.) The purpose of this jurisdictional bar is to protect the
Court from repetitive motions. (Ibid.) Also, the statute requires the
moving party “to show a satisfactory explanation for failing to provide the
evidence earlier, which can only be described as a strict requirement of
diligence” the purpose of which is to incentivize parties “to efficiently marshall
their evidence.” (Baldwin v. Home Sav. of America (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th
1192, 1199 [citing Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674,
689-690].) Therefore, the Court lacks the jurisdiction to reconsider its prior
ruling denying the first Motion to Compel Arbitration.
 
As the Court
noted in its ruling on the first Motion to Compel Arbitration, when a defendant
has been served but then fails to appear, Plaintiff is required to enter
their default. (Citing Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.110(g).) Accordingly, the
Court sets an order to show cause regarding Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default and default judgment. 
 
 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Aaron Sayles’ Renewed
Motion to Compel Arbitration is DENIED.
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE REGARDING REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT AND DEFAULT JUDGMENT
IS SET FOR SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AT 9:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET
COURTHOUSE.
