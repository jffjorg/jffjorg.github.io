Interinsurance Exchange v. Forero, et al.MOTION TO DEEM
REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED; 
REQUEST FOR
SANCTIONS
(CCP § 2033.280)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            
Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange
of the Automobile Club’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and
Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT DANIEL ANDRES FORERO IS ORDERED TO
PAY SANCTIONS OF $265.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS
ORDER.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On January 23, 2024, Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of
the Automobile Club (“Plaintiff”) served Requests for Admissions on Defendant
Daniel Andres Forero (“Defendant Forero”). (Motion,
Tapper Decl., Exh. A.) Despite a meet and confer effort, to date,
Defendant Forero has not served verified responses to the Requests for
Admission. (Id. at ¶3 and Exh. B.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to
Deem Requests for Admission Admitted (“the Motion”) on June 17, 2024. No
opposition has been filed to date. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Due to Defendant Forero’s failure to timely serve verified responses and
resultant waiver of objections, Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the
Requests for Admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
The Court is required to award sanctions under the moving
statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) While properly noticed, the
sanctions sought are excessive. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
granted against Defendant Forero in the amount of $265.00 based on one hour of
attorney time billed at $225.00 per hour, plus the $40.00 filing fee. (Motion,
Tapper Decl., ¶4.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club’s
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for Sanctions is
GRANTED. DEFENDANT DANIEL ANDRES FORERO IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $265.00
TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
