And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's renewed motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiff had previously filed a motion to compel arbitration, which was denied. The plaintiff has now filed a renewed motion, but has not filed a supporting declaration as required by the California Code of Civil Procedure. The judge lacks jurisdiction to reconsider its prior ruling and therefore denies the motion. The judge also sets an order to show cause regarding the plaintiff's request for entry of default and default judgment.
