The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Plaintiff) vs. Astra Holding Inc. and Solaris Trading Corporation (Defendants) regarding a motion to tax costs. The Plaintiff had filed an eminent domain proceeding, but later abandoned it. The Defendants are seeking to recover litigation expenses, including expert fees for Richard Levy and Darrin Arrasmith. The judge has ruled that the Defendants are entitled to Levy's expert fee of $7,411, as Levy provided services in connection with the litigation. However, the judge has denied the motion to tax Arrasmith's expert fee of $18,100, as Arrasmith's work was not performed in an expert capacity. The judge has ordered the Defendants to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service.
