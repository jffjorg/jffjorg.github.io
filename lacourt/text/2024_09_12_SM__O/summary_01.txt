And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Plaintiff, Walsh Enterprises III, L.P., has moved for summary judgment in a breach of contract case against the Defendants, Los Angeles SMSA Limited Partnership and Airtouch Cellular, Inc. The Plaintiff claims that the Defendants breached their contractual duty to maintain the premises in a reasonable condition and seeks damages of $62,900. However, the Court has denied the Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, finding that the Plaintiff has failed to meet its burden to show that there are no triable issues of material fact as to the amount of damages.

The Court has also found that the Defendant has raised triable issues of material fact as to the multiple elements of the claim, including whether the Plaintiff is responsible for maintaining the roof, who is responsible for the roof repair under the lease agreement, and whether the Plaintiff failed to mitigate its damages.

The Court has sustained the Defendant's objections to certain declarations and has overruled others. The Court has also granted the Plaintiff's request to deem the admissions admitted and has denied the Defendant's motion to strike certain portions of the Plaintiff's declaration.

The case will proceed to trial on October 7, 2024.
