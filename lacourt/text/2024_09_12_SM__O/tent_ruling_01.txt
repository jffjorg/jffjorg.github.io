RULING
             Plaintiff Walsh Enterprises
III, L.P. Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED. Plaintiff fails to meet their
burden to show there is no triable issue of material fact as the amount of
damages Plaintiff claims under its cause of action for breach of contract. 
 
            Plaintiff’s RJN (Court’s order deeming admissions
admitted) is GRANTED.
 
            Defendant’s objections to the declaration of “Plaintiff
Wash Enterprises III, L.P” (Ryan Morehead) nos. 10, 11, 12, and 13 are
SUSTAINED.  Objection nos. 7 and 8 are OVERRULED.
  
REASONING
            “[T]he
party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is
no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law.’ [Citation.]” (Behnke v. State Farm General Ins. Co.
(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1463; see also Nalwa v. Cedar Fair, L.P.
(2012) 55 Cal.4th 1148, 1153–1154.) “A plaintiff moving for summary judgment
establishes the absence of a defense to a cause of action by proving ‘each
element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on that cause of
action.’ [Citation.] The plaintiff need not, however, disprove any affirmative
defenses alleged by the defendant. [Citation.] Once the plaintiff's burden is
met, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant ‘to show that a triable issue
of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense
thereto.’ [Citation.] In meeting this burden, the defendant must present
‘specific facts showing’ the existence of the triable issue of material fact.”
(City of Monterey v. Carrnshimba (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1068,
1081.)  “The court's assessment of
whether the moving party has carried its burden—and therefore caused a
shift—occurs before the court's evaluation of the opposing party's papers.  Therefore, the burden on the motion does not
initially shift as a result of what is, or is not, contained in the opposing
papers.” (Mosley v. Pacific Specialty Insurance Company (2020) 49
Cal.App.5th 417, 434–435 [landlord’s failure to address issue of whether they
were aware of their tenant’s marijuana growing operation was not grounds to
grant summary judgment where moving party failed to satisfy its initial burden
as to the issue); Thatcher v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th
1081, 1086-1087 [court cannot grant summary judgment based merely on lack of
opposition; court must first determine if the moving party has satisfied its
burden].)   
 
            In addition, the evidence and affidavits of the moving
party are construed strictly, while those of the opponent are liberally read. (Government
Employees Ins. Co. v. Sup. Ct. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 95, 100. “All doubts
as to the propriety of granting the motion (whether there is any issue of
material fact [Code of Civil Procedure] § 437c) are to be resolved in favor of
the party opposing the motion (i.e., a denial of summary judgment).” (Hamburg
v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 497, 502.)
 
            “A plaintiff ...has met his or her burden of showing that
there is no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element
of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.
Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has met that burden, the burden shifts
to the defendant or cross-defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (p)(1).)   
A moving Plaintiff or Cross-Complainant does not bear
the burden of disproving a defendant’s affirmative defenses or cross-claims to
succeed on a motion for summary judgment. (See Oldcastle Precast, Inc. v.
Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. (2009) 170 Cal.App. 4th 554, 564 [“Plaintiffs
initial burden of proof in moving for summary judgment, however, did not
include disproving any affirmative defenses asserted by defendants”].)
 
I.      Plaintiff
fails to meet their burden to show there are no triable issues of fact as to
the breach of contract claim
 
            The essential elements of breach of contract are “(1) the
existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the
plaintiff." (D'Arrigo Bros. of California v. United Farmworkers of
America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 790, 800.)
 
            “No
damages can be recovered for a breach of contract which are not clearly
ascertainable in both their nature and origin.” (Copenbarger v. Morris
Cerullo World Evangelism, Inc. (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 1, 11, citing Civ.
Code § 3301.) “Damages which are remote, contingent, or merely possible cannot
serve as a legal basis for recovery.” (Westside Center Associates v. Safeway
Stores 23, Inc. (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 507, 531.) The plaintiff in a
breach of contract action has the burden of proving nonspeculative damages with
reasonable certainty. (See Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186, 169 Cal.Rptr.3d 475; Munoz v. MacMillan (2011)
195 Cal.App.4th 648, 662, 124 Cal.Rptr.3d 664.)
 
            Plaintiff Walsh Enterprises III, L.P. (“Plaintiff”)
argues Defendant breached their contractual duty to “maintain the Premises in a
reasonable condition throughout the term,” due to Defendants lack of roof
repair after notice of leak. (See SSUF, ¶¶ 3–7; Kalter Decl., ¶¶ 3, 4 Ex. 1
[RFAs No. 1–6 Deemed Admitted].  Plaintiff
 shows the existence of a contract between
the Plaintiff and Defendants Los Angeles SMSA Limited Partnership and Airtouch
Cellular, Inc (“Defendants”). (See SSUF, ¶ 2; Kalter Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. 2.)  Plaintiff submits evidence Defendants admit
they had notice of water damage to the roof, did not respond to Plaintiff’s
demands to repair the roof, and did not make any repairs to the roof. Plaintiff
submits evidence of “poor condition” with 13 leak locations “in close proximity
or directly under cell tower equipment” 
“due to waster standing on the roof due to the sagging g cause by the
cell tower equipment.”     
 (See SSUF, 7; Carman Decl., ¶¶ 3, 4.)
 
            Plaintiff provides two declarations to show proof of the
$62,900.00 damages request. (SSUF, ¶ 8; Carman Decl., ¶ 7; Morehead Decl., ¶¶
8–14.) The Damages allegedly comprise of $10,600.00 (coat and seal around the
cell tower equipment], $17,800.00 (roof estimate), $10,000.00 (drywall and
ceiling damage repair), $500.00 (multiple roof inspections), and $24,000.00
(loss of use damages due to Plaintiff not being able to use portions of the
subject property). (Ibid.)  
 
            Plaintiff submits an
estimate of the cost to repair the roof of $17,800.00 (Carman Decl., ¶¶ 1, 7.)  Plaintiff provides evidence of an invoice for
the partial repair cost of $10,600.00. (Morehead Decl., ¶ 9; Ex. C.) 
 
            In addition, Plaintiff claims and additional $10,000 was incurred
to “fix drywall, the ceiling, and painting.” (Morehead Decl., ¶ 11.) Plaintiff claims
damages of $24,000 for “loss of use” of portions of the property. (Id. ¶13)  Plaintiff does not provide any foundation or
competent evidence to support the claimed amount of damage for loss of use.
Additionally, Plaintiff claims, it incurred $500.00 “for costs of having
multiple roof inspections,” again without any foundation or competent evidence.
As the moving party, Plaintiff’s evidence is strictly construed, and even
though damages can be proven to a reasonable certainty and do not need to be
exact, they cannot be speculative or unsupported by admissible evidence.  Plaintiff did not provide any admissible
evidence for the claimed damages of $10,000.00, $500.00, and $24,000.00.  Thus, Plaintiff has not met its burden to
show there is no triable issues of material fact as the amount of Plaintiff’s
claim for damages of $62,900 of damages caused by Defendant’s breach of
contract claim. 
 
            Even if Plaintiffs were to meet their burden, Defendants
met their burden to show there are triable issues of material fact as to the multiple
elements of the claim.  Defendants show
there is a dispute as to Plaintiff’s claim of Defendants’ responsibility for
roof maintenance. (See Additional Disputed Facts (“ADF”) ¶ 1; Kalter Decl.,
¶ 4, Ex. 2 [Lease Agreement ¶ 5].) Defendants cite to the relevant
portion of the lease agreement which states:
 
Landlord warrants
and agrees that Landlord’s Property, and all improvements comply and during the
terms of this Lease shall continue to comply with all building, life/safety disability
and other laws, codes, and regulations of any governmental or
quasi-governmental authority. All such compliance shall be accomplished at
Landlord’s sole cost and expense.
 
            (Kalter
Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. 2 [Lease Agreement ¶ 5].)
 
Defendants argue and show that the
roof flashing and parapets were out of compliance with the California Building
Codes § 1503.3.1 and 1503.3.2 since both were cracked and weathered. (ADF, ¶ 4;
Bowles Decl., ¶¶ 7, 10–11, Ex. A–AG.) Defendants argue and show that the lease
requires the Plaintiff to maintain the roof in compliance with all applicable
codes, and thus there is a dispute of material fact as to the breach element of
the claim, or who is in fact responsible for the roof repair under the lease
agreement. 
 
Defendants further show there is a disputed
material fact as to whether Plaintiff’s failed to mitigate its damages. (SSUF,
¶ 7, 8.) Defendant shows that Plaintiff knew of the substantial damage to the
roof and water intrusions since at least 2022, and in the interim between 2022
and now Plaintiff has incurred substantial damage, as Plaintiff shows through
declaration. (Ibid.) Defendant’s show Plaintiff has not properly
mitigated their damages, and have not provided evidence to show actual repair
amounts to prove any mitigation. 
 
            Thus,
Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.
