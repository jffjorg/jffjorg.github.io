The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of American Capital Enterprises, Inc. v. Evocative, Inc. The Court has granted the motion to compel arbitration filed by Evocative, Inc. and has stayed the action pending resolution of arbitration.

The Court found that the 2018 Master Service Agreement contains a valid arbitration agreement and that Evocative, Inc. has met its burden to prove the existence of a valid arbitration agreement. The Court also found that the dispute is governed by the 2018 Master Service Agreement and that the 2022 Master Service Agreement and the 2022 Backup Agreement are incorporated into the 2018 Master Service Agreement.

The Court rejected the plaintiff's arguments that the arbitration agreement is inconspicuous, fraudulent, or that the motion was filed for delay. The Court also found that the plaintiff failed to provide any defenses to the compelling of arbitration.

The Court stayed the action pending resolution of arbitration, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.4. The Court ordered the parties to proceed with arbitration in accordance with the terms of the arbitration agreement.
