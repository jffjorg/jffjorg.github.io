And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants' motion to enforce a settlement agreement reached in 2020. The agreement was between Miawa Investment, Inc. and Maggie-Dawson, Inc. (plaintiffs) and Zhou Cai, Vista Selection, Inc., and Bingjie Zhao (defendants). The plaintiffs had argued that the settlement agreement was based on fraudulent misrepresentations or mutual mistake, but the Judge found that they failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. The Judge also ruled that the plaintiffs had waived their right to void the settlement agreement by agreeing to dismiss the defendants regardless of the outcome of the cross-complaint. As a result, the Judge granted the defendants' motion to enforce the settlement agreement.
