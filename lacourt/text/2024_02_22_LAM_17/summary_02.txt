Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the application to add Larry Nava, an individual, as a defendant. The plaintiff had previously filed a lawsuit against Larry's Custom Furniture and Upholstery and Larry Nava, but mistakenly forgot to include Larry Nava in the application. The judge found that the plaintiff would be substantially prejudiced if he was denied the ability to collect against both debtors based on an error in the application. The judge cited California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(a)(1), which allows the court to grant a party leave to amend any proceeding by adding any particulars necessary in furtherance of justice. The judge also cited the case of Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761, which held that the policy favoring leave to amend is so strong that it is an abuse of discretion to deny an amendment unless the adverse party can show meaningful prejudice.
