LARRY’S CUSTOM
  FURNITURE AND UPHOLSTERY, et al. 
 


 Case
  No.:  BC508895  
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: February 22, 2024



 
Plaintiff’s
motion for leave to amend to add Larry Nava, an individual, in the application
is GRANTED.
 
             On 5/14/2013, Plaintiff Edwin U. Perez
(Plaintiff) filed suit against Larry’s Custom Furniture and Upholstery and
Larry Nava (collectively, Defendants), alleging: (1) failure to pay wages; (2)
failure to provide meal and rest periods; (3) failure to pay overtime wages;
(4) failure to pay wages due upon termination; (5) failure to issue accurate
itemized wage statements; and (6) unlawful/unfair business practices. 
 
             On 12/3/2013, a default judgment of $23,186.78
was entered against Larry’s Custom Furniture and Upholstery, Inc., a California
Corporation and Larry Nava, an individual.
 
On November
13, 2023, Plaintiff filed an Application and Notice for Renewal of Judgment and
Notice for Renewal of Judgment.
 
Now,
Plaintiff moves the Court for leave to amend his Application and Notice for
Renewal of Judgment and Notice for Renewal of Judgment.
 
Discussion 
 
            On
November 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed an Application and Notice for Renewal of
Judgment and Notice for Renewal of Judgment, but mistakenly forgot to include
Larry Nava, an individual, in the application.
 
CCP section
473(a)(1) allows the Court to grant a party leave to amend any proceeding by
adding any particulars necessary in furtherance of justice. The policy favoring leave to amend is so strong that it is
an abuse of discretion to deny an amendment unless the adverse party can show
meaningful prejudice. (Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109
Cal.App.4th 739, 761.)
 
After
review, the Court finds good cause exists to grant Plaintiff leave to amend.
The 2013 default judgment was entered against both Larry’s
Custom Furniture and Upholstery, Inc. and Larry Nava, as an individual.
Accordingly, Plaintiff would be substantially prejudiced if he was denied the
ability to collect against both debtors based on an error in his Application
and Notice for Renewed Judgment.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend to add Larry Nava, an
individual, in the application is granted. 
 
It is so ordered.
