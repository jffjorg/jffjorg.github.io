LEGAL STANDARD
A.   
Depositions
C.C.P.
§ 2025.450(a) provides that “[i]f, after service of a deposition notice, a
party to the action… without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination…, the party giving the notice may
move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”  
C.C.P.
§ 2025.410(a) provides that “[a]ny party served with a deposition notice that
does not comply with [the notice requirements in C.C.P. §§2025.210 through
2025.290] waives any error or irregularity unless that party promptly serves a
written objection specifying that error or irregularity at least three
calendar days prior to the date for which the deposition is scheduled,
on the party seeking to take the deposition and any other attorney or party on
whom the deposition notice was served.” 
C.C.P.
§2025.450(b)(1) provides that “[t]he motion [to compel deposition] shall set
forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice.”
B.   
Sanctions 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court
to impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which
includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.010.)¿
If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿¿
“The
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct.” (CCP § 2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery process
includes: “(d) failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010(d).) Reasonable expenses under CCP section
2023.030(a) include the time spent in researching and preparing the motion, as
well as court time and travel time spent in connection with the motion. (Ghanooni
v. Super Shuttle (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) ¿If a CCP section
2025.450(a) motion is granted, the court “shall impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who
noticed the deposition and against the deponent … unless the court finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP §
2025.450(g)(1).)

DISCUSSION
A.   
Procedural Considerations
Meet
and Confer
Defendant’s
counsel attests to the following facts: On March 19, 2023, Defendant served by
e-mail a Notice of Deposition of Plaintiff Frida Lopez-Sanchez and Request for
Production of Documents for April 12, 2024, at 10:00 am, and a Notice of
Deposition of Plaintiff Isela Sanchez and Request for Production of Documents
for April 12, 2024, at 1:00 pm. (Michel Decl., ¶ 2; Exh. A.) 
On
April 10, 2024, Plaintiffs served an objection arguing that Defendant
unilaterally selected the April 12th date and that neither
Plaintiffs nor their counsel were available. (Decl. of David Derderian, ¶ 5;
Exh. 1.) On April 16, Plaintiffs’ counsel informed Defendant that deposition
availability would be provided by April 19, 2024. (Michel Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. E.)
On
May 6, 2024, not having received any additional communication, Defendant filed the
instant motion to compel.
On
June 24, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendant’s counsel with four dates
in August 2024, and stated they “will meet and confer further in good faith in
order to schedule a mutually agreeable date.” (Derderian Decl., ¶ 7.)
As
of July 8, 2024, there is no evidence that Plaintiffs’ depositions have
proceeded since the filing of the instant motion.
Based
on the foregoing, the Court finds that the meet and confer requirement is fulfilled.
B.   
Motion to Compel Deposition
Defendant
argues that it served a deposition request on Plaintiffs and that they are entitled
to Plaintiffs’ testimony because they are the buyers of the vehicle. (Mot. to
Compel, p. 1.) Defendant’s March 19, 2024 service of the Notice to Depose
Plaintiffs and request for production of documents set the depositions for
April 12, 2024. (Id.) However, Plaintiffs did not object to the notice
until April 10, 2024, only two days prior to the depositions. 
Defendant
also argues that Plaintiff misused discovery by failing to provide alternative
availability for the depositions for two months until the filing of this motion.
(Reply, p. 3.) After Plaintiffs’ April 10, 2024 objection, Plaintiffs promised
to offer dates as soon as April 19, 2024, yet did not until June 24, 2024. Plaintiffs
oppose this motion as moot and maintain they are willing to meet and confer in
good faith. (Derderian Decl., ¶ 6, 7l Ex. 2.) However, given that Plaintiff did
not follow up with additional availability until after the motion was filed, the
motion cannot be considered moot.
Therefore,
the Court finds it proper to GRANT Defendant’s motion to compel attendance at
the required depositions within 30 days of the date of this order.
A.   
Sanctions
Defendant
requests the court to impose a monetary sanction of $2,874.20 on Plaintiffs
and/or their counsel for Plaintiff’s alleged (1) failed meet and confer
attempts, (2) untimely objections by Plaintiffs, and (3) failure to provide
availability for the deposition. (Mot. to Compel, pp. 1-2.)
Defendant’s
Counsel, Andres F. Michel, a California-licensed attorney, and associate of Wilson
Turner Kosmo LLP, states that $840 were incurred in preparing this motion, based
on: (1) his hourly rate of $325.00 being applied to 2.4 hours to prepare this
motion; and (2) the $60.00 filing fee. (Michel Decl. ¶ 8.)  Attorney Michel
also estimates additional fees incurred of $975 for an estimated 3 hours spent
preparing the reply, preparing for oral argument and attending the hearing. (Id.) Attorney Michel argues that Plaintiff’s untimely objection cost
$1,059.20 based on (1) his hourly rate of $325.00 being applied 0.3 hours at $70.50, and (2) Court Reporter
fees of $988.70 (Id., Exh. F.)
Attorney
Michel’s declaration requests sanctions in the amount of $2,847.00 based on the
following calculations:

Plaintiffs
argue that Defendant failed “identify every person, party, and attorney against
whom the sanction is sought, or the specific type of sanctions sought.” Plaintiffs
argue that the accompanying declaration of Defendant’s counsel fails to set
forth any facts supporting the amount of any monetary sanctions sought.  The Court disagrees.  Defendant asks the Court to impose sanctions on
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s attorney of record, jointly and severally. As noted
above, Defendant sets forth a detailed itemization of the hours and amounts sought.  The Court finds that sanctions are warranted and
payable within 30 days of this order.
                    
IV.         
CONCLUSION
The motion by Defendant American
Honda Motor Co. Inc., for an order compelling the depositions of Plaintiffs is GRANTED.

Plaintiffs Frida Lopez-Sanchez and Isela
Sanchez are ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days of the date of this
order. 
Defendant’s request for sanctions is granted.  Sanctions of $2,874.20 must be paid within 30
days of this order.
Counsel for Defendant is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.
