And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Alan Richards' motion for attorney fees, which was filed against Defendant FrescoFICO, LLC. The Plaintiff is seeking $87,421.50 in attorney fees, which was incurred while pursuing causes of action under the Fair Employment and Housing Act. The Judge has determined that the Plaintiff is entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees, as he prevailed at trial.

To calculate the reasonable attorney fees, the Judge used the lodestar method, which involves calculating the number of hours reasonably expended by counsel multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's counsel had adequately justified a lodestar of $58,281, based on 154.9 hours of work by three attorneys.

The Plaintiff also sought a 50% enhancement to the lodestar, which the Judge denied. The Judge found that the case did not involve novel or difficult issues, and that the Plaintiff's counsel had competently represented the Plaintiff, but the case was not strongly contested. The Judge also noted that the Defendant was not represented by counsel beginning in May 2024, and that the Plaintiff's counsel had billed a total of 154.9 hours over 18 months, which is a relatively small amount of time.

The Judge granted the Plaintiff's motion for attorney fees in part, and ordered the Defendant to pay $58,281 in attorney fees to the Plaintiff.
