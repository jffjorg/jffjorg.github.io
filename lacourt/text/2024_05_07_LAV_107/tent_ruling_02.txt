COURT’S [TENTATIVE] RULING RE: 
 
Quash Service of Summons
 
 



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
 
I. BACKGROUND
On September 19,
2022, plaintiff Edwin Gonzalez (“Edwin”) tripped over a damaged sidewalk owned
by defendants City of Los Angeles and County of Los Angeles that was lifted up
by the roots of a tree on a property owned or managed by defendants Richard
Kaufman, Louise Kaufman, Richard I. Kaufman Revocable Trust, and Yale
Management Services, Inc. (Complaint pp. 4–6.) Edwin thereby sustained injuries
and his wife, plaintiff Silvia Gonzalez (“Silvia” and, together with Edwin,
“Plaintiffs”) suffered a loss of consortium. (Ibid.)
 
On April 3, 2023,
Plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit by filing a form complaint (the “Complaint”)
alleging causes of action for (1) general negligence, (2) premises liability,
and (3) loss of consortium. On January 12, 2024, Plaintiffs amended the Complaint
to add All in One Apartment Maintenance, Inc. (“Moving Party”) and RC
Landscaping, Inc. as defendants.
 
On April 9, 2024, Moving
Party filed a motion to quash service of summons (the “Motion”). On April 12,
Plaintiffs opposed the Motion, and on April 30, 2024, Moving Party replied to
Plaintiffs’ opposition.
 
II. LEGAL STANDARD
 
A motion to quash
service of summons may be brought on the grounds that the court lacks personal
jurisdiction over the defendant. (Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1).)
“[W]here a defendant properly moves
to quash service of summons the burden is on the
plaintiff to prove facts requisite to an effective service.” (Sheard v.
Superior Court (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 207, 211.)
 
A party may amend
its pleading once without leave of the court within a brief time after the
original pleading is filed. (Civ. Proc., § 427, subd. (a).) Thereafter,
however, amendment of any pleading requires leave of the court, including an
amendment that substitutes a defendant’s true name for a fictitiously named
“Doe” defendant. (Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1); see Barrows v.
American Motors Corp. (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 1, 6–7.)
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiffs did not
seek leave to amend the Complaint before filing an amendment to the Complaint
substituting Moving Party’s name for a fictitiously named “Doe” defendant. As
answers have already been filed in this case, Plaintiff may not amend the Complaint
without leave of this court under California Code of Civil Procedure section
427, subdivision (a). Although Plaintiffs state that “no additional procedure
seeking leave was required” because they state in the amendment that they “had
been ignorant of the true name of DOE 1 as of the date of the filing of the
Complaint on April 3, 2023,” Plaintiffs cite no legal authority for this point.
We are not required to consider arguments unsupported by legal authority, and
we decline to do so here. (Mansell v. Board of Education (1994) 30
Cal.App.4th 539, 545–46; In re S.C. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 396, 408 [“When
a point is asserted without argument and authority for the
proposition, it is deemed to be without foundation and requires no discussion
by the reviewing court,” internal quotation marks omitted.].) Because the
amendment to the Complaint was filed without leave of this court, it is not
effective to substitute Moving Party’s name for the fictitiously named “Doe”
defendant named in the Complaint. Moving Party has therefore not been added as
a party to this lawsuit, and this court lacks personal jurisdiction over Moving
Party.
 Accordingly, this
court GRANTS the Motion. Dated:             May
7, 2024                                                    ______­­­­­­­­­___________________________                                                                                                                  Hon.
