And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Edwin Gonzalez and Silvia Gonzalez against Richard Kaufman, et al. The court found that the plaintiff's amendment to the complaint, substituting the name of All in One Apartment Maintenance, Inc. for a fictitiously named "Doe" defendant, was made without leave of the court. The court held that the amendment was ineffective and that the defendant was not properly added as a party to the lawsuit. Therefore, the court granted the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and dismissed the defendant from the case.
