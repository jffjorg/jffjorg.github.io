And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, which seeks to prevent the defendants from conducting a foreclosure sale of the plaintiff's property. The court finds that the plaintiff is likely to suffer greater harm from the denial of the injunction than the defendants would from its grant. The court also finds that the plaintiff has a reasonable probability of succeeding on the merits of her claim, specifically in her claims for injunctive relief and accounting. The court grants the preliminary injunction, preventing the defendants from conducting a foreclosure sale of the property.
