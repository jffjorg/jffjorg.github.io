And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant's motions to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demand for identification and inspection of documents. The court finds that the defendant has met its burden of showing that the discovery requests were properly served and that no response was received by the plaintiff. The court grants the motions and awards sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $1,184.00. The court also orders the plaintiff to serve responses to the discovery requests without objection within 20 days of the hearing.
