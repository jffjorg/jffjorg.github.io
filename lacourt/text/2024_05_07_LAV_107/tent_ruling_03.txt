COURT’S [TENTATIVE] RULING RE: 
(1) Compel
  Responses to Form Interrogatories
(2) Compel
  Responses to Special Interrogatories
(3) Compel
  Responses to Demand for Identification
and Inspection
  of Documents
 
 



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
 
 
I. BACKGROUND
On November 22,
2023, plaintiff Elaine Strother (“Plaintiff”) initiated this lawsuit by filing
a complaint alleging a single cause of action for motor vehicle negligence
related to an incident with defendant Bryan Gusdorf (“Defendant”) that occurred
on January 3, 2022. (Complaint p. 4.)
 
On January 5,
2024, Defendant propounded discovery requests on Plaintiff. (Motion p. 1.)
 
On March 19, 2024,
Defendant filed three motions to compel: a motion to compel responses to form
interrogatories (“Motion #1”), a motion to compel responses to special
interrogatories (“Motion #2”), and a motion to compel responses to demand for
identification and inspection of documents (“Motion #3” and, together with
Motion #1 and Motion #2, the “Motions”).
 
On April 17, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration in response to each of the Motions. A
reply was due Tuesday, April 30, 2024 but none was filed. 
 
II. LEGAL STANDARD
 

Motions
     to Compel

 
“If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,…[t]he party
propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to
the interrogatories.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §¿2030.290.) And, “a party's
failure to object to interrogatories within 30 days, or such additional time as
extended by the court, constitutes a waiver of any right to object.” (Leach
v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Similarly, “[i]f a party
to whom¿a¿demand¿for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling¿is directed
fails to serve a timely response to it,… [t]he party to whom the¿demand¿for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling¿is directed waives any objection to
the demand [and]…[t]he party making the demand may move for an order compelling
response to the¿demand.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §¿2031.300.) In the absence of
any response to the discovery request, all that a motion to compel need show is
that a set of¿interrogatories¿was properly served on the opposing party, that
the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been
served. (See Leach v. Superior Court, supra at 905–06.)¿ 
 

Sanctions

 
Sanctions are mandatory against the party, the attorney, or
both whose failure to serve a timely response to the request necessitated the
motion to compel response to interrogatories or the motion to compel response
to a demand for inspection. (Cal. C. Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c);
see also Cal. Rules of Court R. 3.1348(a) (the court can award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party seeking to compel discovery even though
no opposition was filed, the opposition was withdrawn, or the requested
discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed). “As to
the amount of¿sanctions,¿Cal. C. Civ. Proc. §¿2023.030(a)¿authorizes the trial
court to impose an amount representing ‘the reasonable expenses, including
attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result’ of a party's misuse of the
discovery process.” (Parker v. Wolters Kluwer United States, Inc. (2007)
149 Cal.App.4th 285, 294.) “Imposition of monetary sanctions against a party's
attorney requires a finding that the attorney advised the party to engage in
the conduct resulting in sanctions, and the attorney bears the burden of
proving he or she did not so advise the client.” (Cornerstone Realty
Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771,
799.)
 
III. DISCUSSION
 

Motions to Compel

 
Defendant attaches to each of Motion #1,
Motion #2, and Motion #3 evidence that each such discovery request was properly
served on Plaintiff’s attorney by e-mail on January 5, 2024. (Motions Exh.
“A.”) Defendant also attaches to each of Motion #1, Motion #2, and Motion #3
evidence that no response of any kind to any of
the three discovery requests was received by that response due date or
thereafter. (Kothary Decls. ¶¿5.) Thus, Defendant has met its burden of showing
that Motion #1, Motion #2, and Motion #3 are necessary. 
 
Accordingly, Motion #1 is
GRANTED, Motion #2 is GRANTED, and Motion #3 is GRANTED.¿ 
 

Sanctions

 
Defendant requests
sanctions in the amount of $572.00 for each of the Motions, for a total of
$1,716.00. For each of the Motions, this is based on two hours of attorney time
spent preparing each of the Motions and two hours of attorney time on travel to
and attendance at the hearing on each of the Motions at a rate of $133.00 per
hour. Each of the Motions also seeks to recover the $40.00 court filing fee for
such Motion.
 
Because
this court grants Motion #1, Motion #2, and Motion #3, we find these Motions to
have been necessary. However, we note that the Motions
are now being heard together, so Defendant’s counsel needs to appear at only
one hearing. We therefore believe Defendant’s counsel should only be permitted
to bill two hours once for travel to and appearance at the hearing for all
three Motions. We find that two hours spent preparing each Motion and
Plaintiff’s counsel’s rate of $133.00 per hour are reasonable. We also find
that the $40.00 filing fee for each of the Motions is reasonable. Thus, we find
that a total of eight hours of attorney time at a rate of $133.00 per hour, or
$1,064.00, plus $40.00 per Motion, or $120.00, for a total of $1,184.00 is
reasonable.
 
Plaintiff’s counsel submits affidavits declaring that he has
“not received cooperation from [his] client in answering Defendant’s
discovery.” This adequately shows that Plaintiff’s counsel did not advise
Plaintiff to fail to respond to the discovery requests underlying the Motions.
Thus, sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff only. 
 
Accordingly, this court GRANTS sanctions against Plaintiff in
the reduced amount of $1,184.00. 
 
THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that: Plaintiff, ELAINE STROTHER
serve responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories (set one), Special
Interrogatories, and Demand for Identification and Inspection of Documents
within 20 days of this hearing without objection. 
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that: Plaintiff ELAINE STROTHER and shall
pay Defendant’s reasonable cost of bringing this motion in the amount of
$1,184.00.
