And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion filed by Defendants Savona Villas and REMCO to correct a clerical error in the October 26, 2023 minute order. The motion seeks to strike the language that extended pre-trial deadlines based on the new trial date. The Court grants the motion and strikes the language from the minute order. The Court finds that the language was a clerical error, as there was no written or oral motion by any party to reopen discovery and related deadlines. The Court orders the moving parties to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service with the Court within five days.
