And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has considered the motions, oppositions, and replies filed in this case and has ruled as follows. The case involves a collision between a vehicle driven by Defendant Patrick Harrington Thompson and an e-scooter ridden by Plaintiffs Alexandra Pepin and Ryan Christopher Noel. Defendant fled the scene without identifying himself, and Plaintiffs are seeking punitive damages. Defendant moves to strike the request for punitive damages, arguing that the complaint does not plead sufficient facts to support the claim. The judge agrees, finding that the complaint does not explain how Defendant's fleeing the scene increased Plaintiffs' damages. The judge grants Defendant's motion to strike the punitive damage claim with 30 days leave to amend the complaint.
