And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Jason Kolbe's motion to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Earnest Cooper. The motion was based on irreconcilable differences in the handling of the case, but the court notes that Babak Bobby Taghavi is still the attorney of record for the plaintiff, and Kolbe's name has only recently appeared in the case. The court previously denied Taghavi's motion to be relieved as counsel, and Kolbe is not listed as counsel of record. The judge orders Kolbe to give notice of the denial and encourages the parties to meet and confer to try to reach an agreement. If the parties do not submit to the tentative ruling, they will need to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
