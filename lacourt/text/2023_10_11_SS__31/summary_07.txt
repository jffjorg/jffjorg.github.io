And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is on a motion to set aside a default judgment against Jack Colocho. The case was filed by Plaintiff Brian Miller against defendants Blanca Schlup, et al., and a cross-complaint was filed by Schlup and Martha Bautista against Jack Colocho, Denise Colocho, and Catalina Colocho. Schlup and Bautista settled with Plaintiff, and now they are moving to set aside the default judgment against Jack Colocho due to mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect. The judge is denying the motion because it is untimely, filed 3 years after the entry of default and 11 months after being notified of the issue.
