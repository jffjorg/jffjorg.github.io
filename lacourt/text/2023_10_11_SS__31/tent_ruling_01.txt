  Case Number:  20STCV14625    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:  31 HEARING DATE: 10/11/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER: 20STCV14625 Nayeli Murillo v. Sandra Ryan, et al. PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR Nayeli Murillo, Age 10 RECOMMENDATION: DENY  TENTATIVE¿ ¿ The Court excuses the personal appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.¿  Claimant Nayeli Murillo (“Claimant”) agreed to settle her claims against Defendants for the total amount of $50,000. If the settlement is approved, $1,235.90 will be used for medical expenses, $12,500 for attorneys’ fees, and $2,668.47 will be used for costs. The net balance of $33,595.63 deposited into a blocked account.  The Court has reviewed the settlement and finds it fair and reasonable.¿The Court also finds the attorneys’ fees fair and reasonable, in that it amounts to 25% of Claimant’s settlement.¿¿¿¿  However, the petition is denied because the Court is unable to locate a copy of the retainer agreement. Claimant’s counsel’s declaration provides that Claimant’s representative signed a contingency retainer agreement. Because Petitioner is requesting attorney’s fees from the settlement, Item 13(a) of MC-350 requires Petitioner to attach a copy of any written attorney fee agreement as Attachment 17a.   Additionally, on MC-351, Item 2, Petitioner is to check all relationships or representative capacities that apply. Petitioner is also Claimant’s guardian ad litem. ¿ Petitioner must file a new petition curing all the above noted defects at her earliest convenience.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.
