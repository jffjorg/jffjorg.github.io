 Case Number:  20STCV46385    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  10/11/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  20STCV46385 TECHNOLOGY INSURANCE COMPANY, A CORPORATION vs ASHLEY SHANA WILLIAMS, ET AL. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  ASHLEY SHANA WILLIAMS RECOMMENDATION:  DENY for reasons stated below.  TENTATIVE  Plaintiff seeks reimbursement for the amount it paid for its insured’s damages in the principal amount of $110,215.33 in this subrogation claim. Plaintiff also seeks costs in the amount of $444.24 and prejudgment interest of $4,549.31. Plaintiff has properly dismissed all other parties in this action aside from Defendant Ashley Shana Williams (“Defendant”).    The request for default judgment submitted on October 4, 2023 is DENIED for the following reasons:    Plaintiff seeks damages in the principal sum of $110,215.33, in accordance with amount sought in Plaintiff’s operative Second Amended Complaint.   However, Plaintiff’s JUD-100 does not correlate with the amount sought in CIV-100. CIV-100 provides Plaintiff is seeking damages in the principal sum of $110,215.33, whereas JUD-100 requests damages in the principal sum of $109,315.33. Accordingly, there is a discrepancy in the total amount provided between CIV-100 and JUD-100.  Furthermore, Plaintiff provides the declaration of its custodian of records and subrogation examiner Cheryl England (“England”) in support thereof. England’s declaration refers to three exhibits, “A”, “B” and “C.” Documents were attached generally without any affixed labels or demarcations for the Court to determine which portions are meant to part of which exhibits. Furthermore, England’s declaration fails to authenticate the records.   No later than _________________, Plaintiff is to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects.¿ Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to ___________________.¿  Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.¿
