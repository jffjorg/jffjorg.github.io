And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Rosa Diaz. The Judge notes that the parties have been unable to schedule a deposition for over two years, despite numerous requests from the Defendants. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's counsel has been making efforts to schedule the deposition, but the defense counsel has not responded to the requests. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to give at least 10 days' notice of the deposition and allows the parties to conduct the deposition remotely if they agree. The Judge also declines to award sanctions, citing the lack of response from the defense counsel to the Plaintiff's counsel's recent deposition date requests.
