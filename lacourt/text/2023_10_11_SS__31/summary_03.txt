Significant Statements:

But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."
  - "Discovery sanctions are not to be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information."

And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion for terminating sanctions filed by the City of Los Angeles and Jilk Heavy Construction, Inc. against Plaintiff Shakela Murphy. The defendants are seeking to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint or, in the alternative, impose evidentiary sanctions against the plaintiff. The defendants argue that the plaintiff failed to comply with the court's order to provide further responses to discovery requests, while the plaintiff claims that the delay was due to a calendaring misunderstanding and that verified amended responses were served on September 26, 2023. The court finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated compliance with the court's order and denies the motion for terminating sanctions. The court also denies the request for monetary sanctions, as the parties failed to comply with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.040.
