 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Jonathan
  Neil & Associates, Inc.’s Motion to Deem Admissions Admitted and for Monetary
  Sanctions (Attorney Fees and Costs) Against Defendant Ara Tovmassian in the
  Amount of $850.00 [Res ID # 0191].



 
I. Background
On January 2, 2024, Plaintiff
purportedly served Requests for Admission (RFAs), Set One, on Defendant
Tovmassian. Responses to RFAs, Set One, were purportedly due on February 6,
2024, 35 days after purported service by mail on January 2, 2024.
Defendant Tovmassian
allegedly failed to serve responses to RFAs, Set One, by February 6, 2024.
On March 20, 2024,
based on Defendant Tovmassian’s alleged non-response to RFAs, Set One, Plaintiff
filed a motion to deem the truth of RFAs, Set One, admitted as against Defendant
Tovmassian. Plaintiff’s motion also requests monetary sanctions in the amount
of $850 against Defendant Tovmassian. Plaintiff served the motion on Defendant
Tovmassian by mail that same day.
Defendant Tovmassian
has failed to oppose Plaintiff’s motion despite service.
Plaintiff’s motion is
now before the Court.
 
II. Motion to Deem Truth of RFAs
Admitted and Request for Sanctions
A.
Motion to Deem Truth of RFAs Admitted: GRANTED.

1. Legal
Standard
The discovering party can make a
motion to deem as admitted any unanswered requests for admission or any
requests answered in a late or unverified response. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240, subd. (a) [RFA responses must
be signed by responding party under oath]; see Appleton v. Superior Court
(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 [unsworn response to RFAs is treated like no
response].) These requests are not automatically deemed admitted; the discovery
party must make the motion. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
To establish this ground, a movant
must show:
(1) Proper service (see Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.070);
(2) Expiration of the deadline for
the initial response 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties (see
Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subds. (a), (b)); and
(3) That (a) the responding party
served no response (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b)), (b) the
propounding party served a late response (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(b)); or (3) the responding party served an unsworn response (see Appleton
v. Superior Court, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at p. 636 [unsworn response
to RFAs is treated like no response]).
A court must deny a motion to
compel initial discovery where the discovery sought is outside the scope of
discovery. (See CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12,
19; see also Code. Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 [scope of discovery].)
2. Court’s
Determination
The Court finds in favor of
Plaintiff.
The moving papers’ points and
authorities contend that RFAs, Set One, was served on Defendant Tovmassian on
January 2, 2024. (Mot., pp. 3 [service], 5 [signature, not sworn].) However,
the points and authorities are unsworn and not entitled to evidentiary
credence. (In re Zeth S. (2003) 31 Cal.4th 396, 413 [“the unsworn
statements of counsel are not evidence”]; South Sutter, LLC v. LJ Sutter Partners,
L.P. (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 634, 668, fn. 14 [unsworn arguments of counsel
in a legal memorandum are not evidence].)
The original Natalia A. Minassian
counsel declaration filed on March 20, 2024 did not support service on January
2, 2024, as to RFAs, Set One. However, at the initial hearing on July 2, 2024,
the Court pointed out what appeared to 
be an inadvertent failure to include substance in that declaration. The
Court continued the hearing to July 9, 2024 to allow Plaintiff’s counsel to
address the error.
On July 3, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel filed a notice of errata and a revised Declaration of Natalia
Minassian. It included both averments by counsel as well as attaching the
Requests for Admission, along with the Proof of Service, showing service by
mail on the Defendant on January 2, 2024. For this reason, the Court finds that
service has been shown. Moreover, the evidence supports the fact that the discovery
was served on the date alleged in the motion, and thus the Court finds no
prejudice from the initial failure to attach the proof of service to the
motion.
Second, Defendant has failed to
oppose this motion, and did not appear at the initial hearing on July 2, 2024. The
evidence in the moving papers sets forth that the Defendant did not respond,
and this evidence is thus unrebutted.
Third, the court finds that the 17
RFAs are relevant to the facts involved in this case and are otherwise appropriate,
clear and unambiguous.
Given these findings, the Court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s motion.
B. Request for Sanctions: GRANTED.
1. Legal
Standard
The Court must award sanctions when
a party’s response is untimely, and the discovering party makes a motion to
deem the requests admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see Stover
v. Bruntz (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 19, 31-32; see e.g., Appleton v.
Superior Court, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at pp. 635-636 [sanctions are
mandatory].)
The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party
after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
2. Court’s
Determination
The motion to deem admitted has
been denied without prejudice, and Defendant has failed to respond or oppose
this motion in any way. The requested sanctions of $850 for legal fees of $790 at
an hourly rate of $395 and the $60 filing fee for the motion are eminently reasonable.
Accordingly, the Court grants sanctions in the amount of $850. 
III. Conclusion
Plaintiff Jonathan Neil & Associates, Inc.’s Motion to Deem Admissions
Admitted and for Monetary Sanctions (Attorney Fees and Costs) Against Defendant
Ara Tovmassian in the Amount of $850.00 [Res ID # 0191] is GRANTED. 
Sanctions in the amount of $850 are
ordered to be paid to Hatkoff & Minassian within 30 days of this Order.
Failure to do so could result in further sanctions as ordered by the Court.
