And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion for earnings withholding order against the nondebtor spouse, Silva Ohanian aka Silva Sevlian, is continued to allow the judgment creditor, Gregg Roberts, to file proof of service as to the nondebtor spouse. The judge notes that the judgment debtor, Shant Ohanian, has not appeared in the action and that the judgment creditor has collected nothing towards the satisfaction of the judgment. The judge also notes that there is no evidence that any exceptions apply which would make the earnings of the nondebtor spouse exempt from liability for the judgment entered against her spouse. However, proper service of the motion is in question, and the judge requires the judgment creditor to file proof of service as to the nondebtor spouse before the motion can proceed.
