And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to seal certain documents, except for redactions. The documents in question contain protected health information and confidential proprietary information related to the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff contends that the defendant's motion is a pretext to seal more than what is permitted and that only the plaintiff's protected information should be redacted. The court finds that the defendant's motion does not meet the legal standard for sealing, as the proposed sealing is not narrowly tailored and there are no less restrictive means to achieve the overriding interest. The court denies the motion to seal as to exhibits 4-5 and 24-25, which contain confidential clinical policies, as the defendant does not oppose the plaintiff's request to unseal these exhibits. The motion to seal is also denied as to exhibits 1-3, 7-18, and 21-22, provided that the plaintiff instructs the defendant as to the specific information within those exhibits that the plaintiff deems should be redacted.
