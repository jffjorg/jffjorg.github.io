Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between a Plaintiff and a Defendant over a mechanic's lien. The Plaintiff filed a complaint to enforce the lien, and the Defendant filed a motion to reduce or release the lien. The Judge has taken the motion off-calendar and ordered the parties to meet and confer to resolve the dispute. The parties are to meet in person or by video conference, and any agreement on the proper amount of the lien is to be reduced to a stipulation and order for the court's signature. The Judge notes that the primary obstacle to resolution is a lack of communication between the parties, and that the parties have already made significant progress in reducing the lien amount.
