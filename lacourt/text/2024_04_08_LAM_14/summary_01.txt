Defendant Kirk's counsel claimed that they have scheduling conflicts due to other trials in Nevada and Department 40. However, the court ruled that potential scheduling conflicts four months away are not sufficient grounds to continue the trial. The court also refused to consider a request to advance the trial date and noted that it will not entertain a request to advance the trial unless made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure ยง 36 or some other rule of priority. The court also stated that it will not consider medical issues as a ground for continuance unless a stipulation is reached between counsel. The case remains pending as to Defendant Kirk, with a jury trial currently set for September 3, 2024.
