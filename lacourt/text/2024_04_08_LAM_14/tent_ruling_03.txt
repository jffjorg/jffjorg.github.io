 Case Number:  BC720854    Hearing Date:   April 8, 2024    Dept:  14 June Again v BMWCase Background
 
Lemon law involving Plaintiffs’
2016 BMW 640i convertible.
 
On September 6, 2018, Plaintiffs
June Again, Inc. dba Looking Glass Films (“June Again”) and June Guterman
(“Guterman”) filed their Complaint for (1) Breach of Express Warranty and (2) Breach
of Implied Warranty against Defendants BMW of North America, LLC (“BMW”);
Beverly Hills BMW (“Dealer”); and DOES 1-50. 
 
On February 11, 2019, Plaintiffs
voluntarily dismissed Defendant Dealer, without prejudice. 
 
On February 7, 2020, this court
granted Defendant BMW’s motion to compel arbitration.[1]
 
On June 15, 2023, this court
granted the parties’ stipulation to return the case to active status.
 
Jury Trial is currently set for
April 22, 2024.
 
Instant Motions
 
            Plaintiffs
now move this court for an order continuing trial to September 16, 2024, with
all discovery deadlines to track the new date. 
 
Decision
 
The motion is GRANTED, in part.
Trial is continued to May 13, 2024, at 9:00 am. Final Status Conference is
continued to May 2, 2024, at 10:00 am. All counsel and any unrepresented
parties are to be present in person at the Final Status Conference. Discovery
deadlines will not track with the new date.
 
Discussion
 
California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1332(a) provides that trial dates are to be treated as
firm. However, Rule 3.1332(c) provides that, although continuances are
“disfavored,” requests should be considered on an individual basis. That
subsection also includes a non-exhaustive list of possible grounds for a
continuance.
 
            Plaintiffs
base their motion on the fact that Plaintiffs will be celebrating Passover on
April 22, 2024 (the current trial date). Passover runs from that date to April
30, 2024. This is good cause to continue the trial. It is not good cause to
continue the trial for five months. 
 
Counsel represent that they have
vacations in July and August. (Stipulation filed March 15, 2024). This leaves
May and June open. Despite the fact that this case may not be near the
five-year deadline for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure § 583.310, it
is nevertheless more than five actual years old. It should be ready, and it
needs to be tried or settled. This court has room on its calendar for May 13,
2024, when this case would be the oldest one set by far. Other trial conflicts
will not be a reason to continue this trial unless either trial counsel or this
court are actually engaged when the date arrives.
