The Court has granted the motion of Morgan & Morgan Los Angeles, LLP (the "Firm") to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff Crystal Luevano-Macias ("the Client"). The Firm seeks to withdraw as counsel due to a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, which precludes their ability to effectively represent the Client. The Court has determined that the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 have been met, including service of the motion papers on the Client at their last known address. The motion is granted, effective upon the filing of a proof of service showing service of the signed order upon the Client at their last known address.
