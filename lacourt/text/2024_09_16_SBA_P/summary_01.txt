**Case Summary:**

**Case Number:** 23TRCV02952
**Hearing Date:** September 16, 2024
**Department:** P Demurrer with Motion to Strike

**Ruling:**

* The court considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers.
* The defendants' demurrer is OVERRULED in part and SUSTAINED in part. It is overruled as to the third cause of action for tortious breach of implied warranty of habitability, eighth cause of action for retaliatory eviction, and ninth cause of action for IIED. It is sustained without leave to amend as to the fourth cause of action for violation of Civil Code section 1942.4, and sustained with leave to amend as to the sixth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.

**Background:**

* The plaintiff, Michelle Anaya, filed a complaint against defendants Verne Becker, South Bay Management Services, LLC, and Mary E. Colin on September 5, 2023.
* The plaintiff alleged that the defendants failed to maintain the property in a habitable and safe condition, and retaliated against her for reporting the issues.

**Demurrer:**

* The defendants demurred to the third, fourth, sixth, eighth, and ninth causes of action.
* The court found that the defendants' demurrer was unavailing as to the third cause of action for tortious breach of implied warranty of habitability, as the plaintiff alleged sufficient facts to find that the defendants owed a duty of ordinary care to the plaintiff.
* The court sustained the demurrer as to the fourth cause of action for violation of Civil Code section 1942.4, as the statute only applies to landlords, not property managers.
* The court overruled the demurrer as to the eighth cause of action for retaliatory eviction, as the plaintiff alleged sufficient facts to support a claim for retaliatory eviction.
* The court sustained the demurrer as to the sixth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation, as the plaintiff failed to allege reliance on the alleged misrepresentations.
* The court overruled the demurrer as to the ninth cause of action for IIED, as the plaintiff alleged sufficient facts to support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

**Motion to Strike:**

* The defendants moved to strike punitive damages, arguing that the plaintiff did not specify which defendant acted with malice, fraud, or oppression.
* The court disagreed and denied the motion to strike, as the plaintiff alleged sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages.

**Facts Alleged:**

* The plaintiff alleged that the defendants failed to maintain the property in a habitable and safe condition, and retaliated against her for reporting the issues.
* The plaintiff alleged that the defendants failed to repair the habitability defects, including electrical issues, and that the City red-tagged the property.
* The plaintiff alleged that she was forced to live in the property without electricity, and that the defendants knew of the issues but failed to address them.

**Legal Authority:**

* The court cited relevant California statutes and case law, including Civil Code section 1942.4, Civil Code section 1942.5, and Stoiber v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903.
