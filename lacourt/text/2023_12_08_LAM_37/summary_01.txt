And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration without prejudice. The defendant sought to compel arbitration based on an acknowledgment signed by the plaintiff on December 22, 2019, stating that he received a copy of the arbitration policy and agreed to its terms. However, the plaintiff disputes this, stating that he never saw the policy and did not agree to it.

The judge found that the defendant failed to show that a valid agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties. The acknowledgment signed by the plaintiff was included in a register entitled "Payroll Check Pick-Up Register," which was not a separate document from the payroll register that employees signed weekly. The judge found that a reasonable employee could believe that by signing the register, they were only acknowledging receipt of their paycheck, rather than agreeing to the arbitration policy.

The judge also found that the "SPECIAL NOTE" on the register was cut off, making it unclear to employees what they were signing. Without evidence that the arbitration acknowledgment was brought to the attention of employees, that copies of the agreement were provided to all employees, and that employees understood that their signature was an acknowledgment of having received a copy of the agreement and was not a requirement for receiving their paycheck, the defendant failed to show mutual assent.

As a result, the judge denied the motion to compel arbitration without prejudice, allowing the defendant to refile with additional evidence or to argue the issue further.
