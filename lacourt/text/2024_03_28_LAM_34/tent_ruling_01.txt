        As seen above, the Court has ruled upon all
of Defendants’ 202 objections.  Nonetheless,
the Court questions the necessity of these voluminous objections. For instance,
Defendants repeatedly objected to the statement of various declarants that “All
of the matters set forth herein are true and correct based upon my personal knowledge,
except those matters stated upon information and belief, and if called as a
witness, I could and would competently testify thereto.”  (See, e.g., Evidentiary Objections to
Declaration of Jennifer Bryant, Objection No.1.)  This objection is patently frivolous.  (See, e.g., Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 243,
254, fn. 3 [The “litigants file[d] blunderbuss objections to virtually every
item of evidence submitted. This is hardly good advocacy, and it unnecessarily
overburdens the trial court.”]) 
 
 
B.      Requests
for Judicial Notice
 
Defendants request for both the Hill MSJ and
the Smith MSJ that the Court take judicial notice of: (1) the FAC; and (2) the
Declaration of Ashley Roberts (and exhibits thereto) filed in this matter on June
27, 2022. 
 
The Court DENIES as superfluous judicial
notice of these items. Any party that wishes to draw the Court’s attention to
an item filed in this action may simply cite directly to the document by
execution and filing date. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(d).)
 
C.      Legal
Standard
 
“A party may
move for summary judgment in an action or proceeding if it is contended that
the action has no merit or that there is no defense to the action or
proceeding. The motion may be made at any time after 60 days have elapsed since
the general appearance in the action or proceeding of each party against whom
the motion is directed or at any earlier time after the general appearance that
the court, with or without notice and upon good cause shown, may direct.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (1)(a).)
 
“[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion
that there is no triable issue of fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law. That is because of the general principle that a party who seeks
a court’s action in his favor bears the burden of persuasion thereon. There is
a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would allow a
reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party
opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.” (Aguilar
v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850, citation omitted.) 
 
“[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of
production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable
issue of material fact; if he carries his burden of production, he causes a
shift, and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of
his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of
material fact.” (Aguilar, supra, at p. 850; Smith v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 1463, 1474, [applying the summary judgment standards in Aguilar
to motions for summary adjudication].) 
 
“On a summary judgment motion, the court must therefore consider what
inferences favoring the opposing party a factfinder could reasonably draw from
the evidence. While viewing the evidence in this manner, the court must bear in
mind that its primary function is to identify issues rather than to determine
issues. Only when the inferences are indisputable may the court decide the
issues as a matter of law. If the evidence is in conflict, the factual issues
must be resolved by trial.” (Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 832, 839, citation omitted.) 
 
“The trial court may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a fact
finder to determine whose version is more likely true. Nor may the trial court
grant summary judgment based on the court's evaluation of credibility.” (Binder,
supra, at p. 840, citations omitted; see also Weiss v. People ex rel.
Dep’t of Transp. (2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding motions for
summary judgment or summary adjudication may not weigh the evidence but must
instead view it in the light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all
reasonable inferences in favor of that party”].) 
 
“On a motion for summary adjudication, the trial court has no
discretion to exercise. If a triable issue of material fact exists as to the
challenged causes of action, the motion must be denied. If there is no triable
issue of fact, the motion must be granted.” (Fisherman's Wharf Bay Cruise
Corp. v. Super. Ct. (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 309, 320, citation omitted.) 
 
D.      Discussion
 
Defendant Hunter Hill moves for summary
judgment on the FAC, or in the alternative summary adjudication on the various
issues raised in the FAC. (Hill MSJ, p. 13:5–8.)
 
Defendant Hunter Hill argues: (1) that the
publicity and unjust enrichment claims are without merit; (2) that the
interference and related conspiracy and unfair competition claims are without
merit; and (3) that the negligence claims are without merit. (Hill MSJ, pp.
5:14, 6:21–22, 10:10.)
 
Defendants Tiffany Smith and Piper Rockelle,
Inc. move for summary judgment on the FAC, or in the alternative summary adjudication
on the various issues raised in the FAC. (Smith MSJ, p. 15:8–11.)
 
Defendants Tiffany Smith and Piper Rockelle,
Inc. echo the arguments made by Defendant Hunter Hill. (Smith MSJ, pp. 5:25,
7:13–14, 12:3.) They further argue that the bodily injury claims are without
merit. (Id. at p. 14:4.)
 
1.      The
Publicity and Unjust Enrichment Claims
 
Defendants claim that they had the consent of
Plaintiffs’ parents; Plaintiffs’ parents declare that they did not consent to
what occurred. 
 
Even considering just this one element of
these causes of action, it is clear that the publicity and unjust enrichment
claims involve triable issues of material fact. There also appear to be triable
issues of material fact as to the other elements of these causes of action.
 
Thus, although Defendants have met their
initial burden, Plaintiffs meet their subsequent burden. Summary adjudication is
inappropriate here. 
 
2.         
The Interference, Conspiracy, and Unfair Competition
Claims
 
Defendants claim that they did not engage in
various acts (e.g., flagging Plaintiffs’ content as inappropriate, utilizing
“bots”, conspiring to sabotage Plaintiffs’ respective YouTube channels, and
embedding Plaintiffs’ videos in pornography websites); Plaintiffs and their
parents declare that they did. 
 
Much of Plaintiffs’ evidence — including the
highly specific testimony of Angela Sharbino, the various screenshots of
YouTube channel analytics, and the testimony of Plaintiffs who heard Defendants
discuss how they affected other YouTubers’ accounts — makes clear that there
are multiple triable issues of material fact to resolve. 
 
As in section 1 above, although Defendants have
met their initial burden, Plaintiffs meet their subsequent burden. Summary
adjudication is inappropriate here. 
 
 
3.      The
Negligence Claims
 
Defendants claim that they did not have a
duty or special relationship regarding Plaintiffs; they also claim that they
did not expose Plaintiffs to lewd and lascivious conduct and materials, commit
perverse and prurient acts, or expose the children to controlled substances.
Plaintiffs, who are minors, declare that they were regularly in the sole care
of Defendants, who did all of these things. 
 
        The law is clear that adults
supervising minors owe a duty of care to those minors. (Margaret W. v.
Kelley R. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 141, 153, citing Romero v. Super. Ct. (2001)
89 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078 [“The court (in Romero) held that an adult who
invites a minor into her home assumes a special relationship with the minor in
light of the minor’s vulnerability.”].)
 
        Furthermore, Plaintiffs’
extensive declarations regarding sexual content, substance use, and other items
demonstrate that there are multiple triable issues of material fact at issue.
 
As in sections 1 and 2 above, although
Defendants have met their initial burden, meet their subsequent burden. Summary
adjudication is inappropriate here. 
 
4.      The
Bodily Injury Claims
 
Defendant Tiffany Smith claims that she did
not touch any of the Plaintiffs with intent to harm or offend and that she did
not act outrageously or intend to cause emotional distress. Plaintiffs testify
repeatedly to exactly the opposite. 
 
There are clearly multiple triable issues of
material fact at to the bodily injury claims. 
 
Once again, as in sections 1, 2 and 3 above, although
Defendants have met their initial burden, Plaintiffs meet their subsequent
burden. Summary judgment and adjudication are inappropriate here. 
 
E.      Conclusion
 
The Hill Motion for
Summary Judgment is DENIED. 
 
The Smith and Rockelle Piper, Inc. Motion for
Summary Judgment is DENIED. 
 
II.      
Motion for Leave to Amend FAC
 
A.      Evidentiary

Defendants filed evidentiary objections to
the Plaintiffs’ Declaration of Matthew Hoesly. The following are the Court’s
rulings on these objections.

B.      Request
for Judicial Notice
 
Defendants request that the Court take
judicial notice of prior orders issued in this matter.
 
The Court DENIES as superfluous judicial
notice of these items. Any party that wishes to draw the Court’s attention to
an item filed in this action may simply cite directly to the document by
execution and filing date. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(d).)
 
C.      Legal
Standard
 
“The court may, in furtherance of justice, and
on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or
proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a
mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may,
upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The court may
likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any
terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other
particulars; and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time
limited by this code.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).)
 
        “Any judge, at any time before or
after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such terms
as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any pleading or pretrial
conference order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 576.)
 
“A motion to amend a pleading before trial
must: (1) Include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which
must be serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or
amendments; (2) State what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to
be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the deleted
allegations are located; and (3) State what allegations are proposed to be
added to the previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line
number, the additional allegations are located.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1324(a).)
 
“A separate declaration must accompany the
motion and must specify: (1) The effect of the amendment; (2) Why the amendment
is necessary and proper; (3) When the facts giving rise to the amended
allegations were discovered; and (4) The reason why the request for amendment
was not made earlier.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b).)
 
“This discretion should be exercised liberally
in favor of amendments, for judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed
matters in the same lawsuit.” (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Super. Ct. (1989)
213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.) 
 
Leave to amend is thus liberally granted,
provided there is no statute of limitations concern. (Kolani v. Gluska (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 402, 411.) The Court
may deny the plaintiff’s leave to amend if there is prejudice to the opposing
party, such as delay in trial, loss of critical evidence, or added costs of
preparation. (Id.)
 
D.      Discussion
 
1.      California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324
 
Plaintiffs substantially complied with
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324.
 
First,
Plaintiffs’ Counsel submitted a copy of the proposed amended pleading. (Decl.
Hoesly, Exh. 1.)
 
Second, the
proposed amended pleading is red-lined version, which shows exactly where
additions and deletions would be made. (Decl. Hoesly, Exh. 1.)
 
        Finally,
Plaintiffs’ Counsel declares: (1) that the effect of the proposed pleading is
to add seven causes of action — all based on alleged violations of the Labor
Code — but no new factual allegations; (2) that the proposed amendments are
necessary and proper because these additional theories of liability are based
on the facts previously alleged in the Complaint and the FAC; (3) that that the
facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered during the course
of the Parties’ litigation; and (4) that the reason the request for the
proposed amendments was not made sooner was because of a pending investigation
by the Labor Commissioner’s Office that appears to have recently ended. (Decl.
Hoesly, Exh. 1, ¶¶ 3–5.)
 
2.      Prejudice
and Continuation of Trial
 
 
Trial is scheduled for May 20, 2024. 
 
At the hearing on this motion, Defendants
argued that they needed more time to take additional discovery if the Court
were to grant leave for Plaintiffs to file a SAC. Plaintiffs’ counsel stated
that he would prefer to continue the trial in order to be able to file an
amended complaint.
 
        Upon balancing the
relative risks, it would be appropriate here to grant leave to amend and
continue the trial.  Although the Court
is continuing the trial, there will be no further continuances allowed.
 
 
E.      Conclusion
 
The Motion for Leave to Amend the FAC is
GRANTED. Plaintiffs shall file their proposed second amended complaint within
five (5) days of the issuance of this Order. 
The trial is continued, with discovery deadlines moved to the new trial
date.  There shall be no further
continuances of the trial.
