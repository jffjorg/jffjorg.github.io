**Case Information**

* Case Number: 24STCV01638
* Hearing Date: March 28, 2024
* Department: 34
* Subject: Special Motion to Strike Complaint and Motion for Undertaking

**Parties**

* Moving Party: Defendant Faith Ballin
* Responding Party: Plaintiffs Melissa Bacelar, Wagmor Pets, and Wylder's Holistic Pet Center, Inc.

**Summary**

The Judge grants Defendant Faith Ballin's Anti-SLAPP Motion, dismissing her with prejudice from the Verified Complaint. The Judge also denies Plaintiffs' Request for Sanctions. The Motion for Undertaking is denied.

**Key Points**

* Defendant Ballin's Anti-SLAPP Motion is granted because she has shown that the alleged statements are protected by the right of free speech and contribute to public discussion of pet-related issues.
* Plaintiffs have not provided admissible evidence to support their claims, and the Court finds Defendant Ballin's testimony credible.
* The Motion for Undertaking is denied because there is no need for a bond, and Defendant Ballin may immediately move for costs and fees.

**Key Statutes and Regulations**

* California Code of Civil Procedure Section 425.16 (anti-SLAPP statute)
* California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1030 (undertaking requirement)
* California Civil Code Section 44 (definition of libel)
* California Civil Code Section 46 (definition of slander)

**Significant Statements**

* "A cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person's right of petition or free speech under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim." (Code Civ. Proc., ยง 425.16, subd. (b)(1))
* "The defendant's first-step burden is to identify the acts alleged in the complaint that it asserts are protected and what claims for relief are predicated on them. In turn, a court should examine whether those acts are protected and supply the basis for any claims." (Bonni v. St. Joseph Health Sys. (2021) 11 Cal.5th 995, 1010)
* "To determine whether a statement is actionable fact or nonactionable opinion, we apply a totality of the circumstances test pursuant to which we consider both the language of the statement itself and the context in which it is made." (Summit Bank v. Rogers (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 669, 696)
