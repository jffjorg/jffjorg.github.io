The Judge, Maurice A. Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The Plaintiff, Marcelo Rodriguez, filed a complaint against the Defendant, Arakelian Enterprises, Inc., on November 2, 2023, asserting 13 causes of action for FEHA and Labor Code violations. The Defendant moved to compel arbitration based on an Arbitration Agreement executed by the Plaintiff on June 26, 2023. The Agreement provides that it covers all grievances, claims, and disputes arising out of the Plaintiff's employment with the Defendant. The Judge found that the Defendant has met its burden to establish the existence of an agreement to arbitrate and that the Plaintiff has not opposed this motion to establish any defenses to enforcement. As a result, the Judge granted the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stayed the action.
