The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to vacate the entry of default. The defendants, Homa Badihian and Parviz Payghamy, failed to file a responsive pleading and as a result, the court entered default against them. However, the defendants then filed a motion to vacate the default. The plaintiff, Pasadena Lighting, Inc., did not oppose the motion, but instead filed a first amended complaint on September 12, 2023. Because the first amended complaint was filed, the entry of default is hereby vacated. Therefore, the motion to vacate the entry of default is moot and is placed off calendar.

## English-Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The court has decided to dismiss the defendants' motion to vacate the default judgment against them. 

Initially, the defendants failed to respond to the plaintiff's lawsuit, leading to default judgments being entered against them. Subsequently, the defendants filed a motion to vacate these defaults. However, before the court could rule on the motion, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint.

The court ruled that by filing the amended complaint, the previous default judgments became moot, effectively negating the need for the defendants' motion.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' motion to vacate the entry of default is moot. The plaintiff, Pasadena Lighting, Inc., filed a complaint against the defendants, Homa Badihian and Parviz Payghamy, on May 2, 2023, but they failed to file a responsive pleading. As a result, the court entered their defaults on July 28, 2023, and August 8, 2023. The defendants then filed a motion to vacate the entry of default, but the plaintiff has since filed a first amended complaint, which vacates the entry of default. Therefore, the motion is no longer necessary and is placed off calendar as moot.
