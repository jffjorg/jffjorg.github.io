And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to vacate the entry of default. The defendants, Homa Badihian and Parviz Payghamy, failed to file a responsive pleading and as a result, the court entered default against them. However, the defendants then filed a motion to vacate the default. The plaintiff, Pasadena Lighting, Inc., did not oppose the motion, but instead filed a first amended complaint on September 12, 2023. Because the first amended complaint was filed, the entry of default is hereby vacated. Therefore, the motion to vacate the entry of default is moot and is placed off calendar.
