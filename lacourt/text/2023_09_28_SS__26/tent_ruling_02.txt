ANALYSIS:
 
On January 14,
2021, Plaintiff City of Los Angeles, acting by and through the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for common counts
against Defendant 3132 East Pico LLC
aka LLC 3132 East Pico (“Defendant”). On May 5, 2021, Plaintiff filed a copy of the parties’
stipulated settlement agreement. 
 
On August 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion for Entry of Judgment Pursuant to Stipulated Settlement. To
date, no opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
The instant motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6, which states in relevant part:
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the
litigants themselves, not their attorneys. 
(Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current
statute provides that “parties” includes “an attorney who represents the party”
and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement
must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,
and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v.
Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) Plaintiff has demonstrated the settlement agreement complies with
the statutory requirements set forth above as it was signed by both parties and
Plaintiff’s attorneys. (Motion, Georgoulis Decl., Exh. A, p. 7.)
 
Furthermore, the request for
retention of jurisdiction must be made in writing, by the parties, before the
action is dismissed for the Court’s retention of jurisdiction to conform to the
statutory language. (Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 433 [“If,
after a suit has been dismissed, a party brings a section 664.6 motion for a
judgment on a settlement agreement but cannot present to the court a request
for retention of jurisdiction that meets all of these requirements, then
enforcement of the agreement must be left to a separate lawsuit.”].) The
parties’ request for retention of jurisdiction complies with these requirements
because it was made in writing to the Court before the action was dismissed.
(Motion, Georgoulis Decl., Exh. A, ¶8F.) 
 
The settlement provides that
Defendant would pay Plaintiff $8,742.80 in monthly payments starting on April
1, 2021. (Id. at Exh. A, ¶2.) The settlement agreement also provides
that upon Defendant’s default, Plaintiff may seek judgment in the settlement
amount, less any monies paid. (Id. at Exh. A, ¶4.) Payments of $2,757.30
were made towards the settlement, after which Defendant defaulted. (Id.
at ¶8 and Exh. 2.) Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff is entitled to entry of
judgment against Defendant in the amount of $5,985.50 principal ($8,742.80 -
$2,757.30) and 18 percent interest per annum starting on June 2, 2021. (Id.
at Exh. A, ¶4.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Motion of Plaintiff City of Los Angeles, acting by and
through the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, to Enforce Settlement
Agreement is GRANTED. JUDGMENT TO BE ENTERED IN PLAINTIFF’S FAVOR AND AGAINST
DEFENDANT 3132 EAST PICO LLC A.K.A. LLC 3132 EAST PICO IN THE AMOUNT OF $5,985.50 PRINCIPAL PLUS 18 PERCENT INTEREST PER
ANNUM STARTING ON JUNE 2, 2021.
