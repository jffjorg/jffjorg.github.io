Judicial NoticePursuant to Defendant-Intervenor’s request, the court takes judicial notice of TRUSTEE’S DEED UPON SALE, to 1317 S Hope 26 LLC, Recorded/Filed March 26, 2024, in Official Records, Recorder’s Office, Los Angeles, California, instrument number 20240191974. (Exh. 1.)II. Legal StandardIntervention may be mandatory or permissive. Code of Civil Procedure, section 387, subdivision (d)(1) provides that the court shall, upon timely application, permit a nonparty to intervene in the action or proceeding if “a provision of law confers an unconditional right to intervene,” or “[t]he person seeking intervention claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action and that person is so situated that the disposition of the action may impair or impede that person’s ability to protect that interest, unless that person’s interest is adequately represented by one or more of the existing parties.” Additionally, upon timely application, a court may “permit a nonparty to intervene in the action or proceeding if the person has an interest in the matter in litigation, or in the success of either of the parties, or an interest against both.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 387, subd. (d)(2).) To establish a direct and immediate interest in the litigation for purposes of permissive intervention, a non-party seeking intervention must show that he or she stands to gain or lose by direct operation of the judgment, even if no specific interest in the property or transaction at issue exists.¿ (Simpson Redwood Co. v. State of California¿(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1192, 1201.)¿ “Whether the intervener’s interest is sufficiently direct must be decided on the facts of each case¿. . . .¿And section 387 should be liberally construed in favor of intervention.”¿ (Id.¿at 1200.)¿ “In order that a party may be permitted to intervene it is not necessary that his interest in the action be such that he will inevitably be affected by the judgment.¿ It is enough that there be a substantial probability that his interests will also be so affected.¿ ‘The purposes of intervention are to protect the interests of those who may be affected by the judgment¿. . . .’”¿ (Timberidge¿Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Santa Rosa¿(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 873, 881-882 (citations and emphasis omitted).) III. AnalysisDefendant-Intervenor 1317 S Hope 26, LLC, moves for leave to intervene in this action. The dispute arises over the nonpayment for materials Plaintiff provided to Defendant FMB Development, LLC, for a project at 1317 S. Hope St, Los Angeles, CA 90015. (See Compl. ¶¶ 13-16, 32.) In Plaintiff’s Fifth Cause of Action for Foreclosure of Mechanic’s Lien, Plaintiff seeks to foreclose on a lien against Defendant 1317 Hope, LLC, who Plaintiff alleged was the owner of the property. (Id. ¶ 32.)Defendant-Intervenor asserts it is the current owner of the property at 1317 S Hope St, which it acquired by public auction on March 21, 2024. Defendant-Intervenor recorded a Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale on March 26, 2024. (RJN, Exh. 1.) As the current owner of the property, Defendant-Intervenor argues it has a direct interest in the subject of this action, “because a favorable verdict for foreclosure on Plaintiff’s claim will affect Defendant-Intervenor 1317 S Hope 26, LLC’s ownership interest in the Property.” (Mtn. 4: 25-26.) For the same reasons, Defendant-Intervenor suggests its interests will be impaired absent intervention. Finally, Defendant-Intervenor argues its interests are contrary to Plaintiff and the other Defendants, and thus, its interests are not adequately represented by existing parties.Here, Defendant-Intervenor, as owner of the property subject to the mechanic’s lien, has demonstrated an interest relating to the property that is the subject of the action. Defendant intervenor has also demonstrated and that it is so situated that the disposition of the action may impair or impede its ability to protect that interest, and that there are no other parties that will adequately protect that interest. Finally, Defendant-Intervenor’s motion is timely. A court will determine the timeliness of a motion to intervene based on the date when a nonparty “knew or should have known their interests in the litigation were not being adequately represented.” (Ziani Homeowners Assn. v. Brookfield Ziani LLC (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 274, 282.) Defendant-Intervenor recorded a Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale on March 26, 2024. (See RJN, Exh. 1.) Defendant-Intervenor moved for leave on May 31, 2024. There is no evidence the delay was unjustified or that it will prejudice any current party to the action.Accordingly, 1317 S. Hope 26, LLC’s Motion for Leave to Intervene is GRANTED.IT IS SO ORDERED.Dated:   July 11, 2024 ___________________________________ Randolph M.
