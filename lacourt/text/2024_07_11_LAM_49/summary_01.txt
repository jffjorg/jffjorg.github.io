Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for leave to intervene filed by 1317 S Hope 26, LLC, which is the current owner of the property at 1317 S Hope St. The motion was filed because White Cap, L.P. is seeking to foreclose on a mechanic's lien against the property, and 1317 S Hope 26, LLC wants to protect its interests as the current owner of the property. The judge found that 1317 S Hope 26, LLC has demonstrated an interest relating to the property that is the subject of the action, and that it is so situated that the disposition of the action may impair or impede its ability to protect that interest. The judge also found that there are no other parties that will adequately protect 1317 S Hope 26, LLC's interests. The judge ordered 1317 S Hope 26, LLC to file and serve a standalone copy of its Answer-In-Intervention within 10 days of the ruling and to give notice to all interested parties.
