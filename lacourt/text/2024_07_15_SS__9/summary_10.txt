This tentative ruling addresses a petition for a name change. The Judge requires the Petitioner to review the proposed decree to ensure the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the name is satisfactory, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not satisfactory, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a signed decree will be available seven days after the hearing date in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
