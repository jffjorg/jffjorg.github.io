And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the petition to change the name. The petitioner must review and ensure that the new name on the proposed decree is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility of the new name, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not accurate, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A signed copy of the decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
