And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling issued by a judge regarding a petition to change a name. The judge has determined that the petition will be granted, but with certain conditions. The petitioner must double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree and ensure that it is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the new name meets these requirements, the petitioner will not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the new name is not satisfactory, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
