Petitioner

No later than two weeks before the continued OSC and hearing, Petitioner must
file written proof that the outstanding bench warrant has been fully addressed
and resolved.  Failure to do so will result in the OSC and hearing on the

calendar upon filing of proof that all outstanding warrants have been
cleared.  The Court Clerk is to run a new
criminal history assessment prior to the continued OSC to verify that the warrant
has been cleared.
