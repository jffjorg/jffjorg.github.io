The Petitioner must clear their outstanding warrants and file written proof of such before the Court will rule on the petition. Additionally, the Petitioner must file proof of publication of the notice no later than one week before the continued hearing date. Failure to comply with these requirements will result in the petition being taken off calendar or denied and dismissed without prejudice.
