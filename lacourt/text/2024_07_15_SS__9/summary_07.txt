The Judge's tentative ruling is that the petition to change name is granted, subject to certain conditions. The Petitioner must review the proposed decree and ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility of the new name, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not correctly written and spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
