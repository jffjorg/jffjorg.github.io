And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the petition to change name, but with some conditions. The Petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the name meets these requirements, no further appearance is necessary. However, if the name is not legible or spelled correctly, the Petitioner must attend the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
