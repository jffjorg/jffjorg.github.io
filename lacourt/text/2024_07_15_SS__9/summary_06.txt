If the Petitioner is satisfied with the proposed decree, they do not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written or correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date. Additionally, the Judge notes that once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
