Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Petitioner, who has an active outstanding warrant. The Court's Clerk's Office has run a criminal history assessment through CLETS and NCIC, revealing the outstanding warrant. The judge orders Petitioner to clear the warrant and file evidence of its clearance before the Court will rule on the petition for a name change. The OSC and hearing on the petition are continued to September 9, 2024 at 9:30 am. The Court Clerk is to run a new criminal history assessment prior to the continued OSC to verify that the warrant has been cleared. Failure to clear the warrant will result in the OSC and hearing being taken off calendar without prejudice to be placed back on calendar upon filing of proof that all outstanding warrants have been cleared.
