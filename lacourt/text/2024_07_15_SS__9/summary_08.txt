The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 24STCP01498. The Petitioner has submitted a proposed decree changing their name, but the Judge has instructed them to double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility, they do not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
