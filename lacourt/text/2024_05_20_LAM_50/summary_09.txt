And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

"The Court notes that the plaintiff has filed a complaint in this matter, represented by attorney Arnoldo Casillas. Pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 14124.72, subdivision (d), the director's claim for reimbursement of benefits provided to the beneficiary shall be limited to the amount of the director's lien. If the action is brought by the beneficiary alone and incurs personal liability to pay attorney's fees and costs of litigation, the amount of the director's lien that is reimbursed shall be reduced by 25 percent, which represents the director's reasonable share of attorney's fees paid by the beneficiary. The Court will consider the ratio of the amount reimbursed to the director as satisfaction of the director's lien to the full amount of the settlement, judgment, or award prior to deducting reasonable attorney's fees and litigation expenses."
