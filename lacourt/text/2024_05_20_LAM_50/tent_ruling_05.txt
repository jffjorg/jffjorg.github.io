SUPERIOR
COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
FOR THE
COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES
 



 
NEYDI ABRAMS, et al.,
 
                        Plaintiffs,
 
            v.
 
AMERICAN
  HONDA MOTOR CO., INC.,
 
                        Defendants.
 


 


CASE NO. 23SCTV24826
 
ORDER
  STRIKING STATEMENT OF DISQUALIFICATION; VERIFIED ANSWER
 



 
            In
this case, Plaintiffs allege claims under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act against American Honda Motor Company, Inc. arising out of a pre-owned 2018
Honda Accord alleged to have defects and nonconformities including engine
defects, electrical defects, and sensing defects. On May 2, 2024[1],
the Court made a written disclosure and order (the “Disclosure”) advising:
 
Judge Beaudet hereby discloses … that
approximately 24 years ago, she and her husband purchased a pickup truck for
her husband's use that he recalled was either a Dodge or Chrysler pickup; Judge
Beaudet does not remember the maker of the pickup. The pickup developed electrical
problems. Judge Beaudet's husband took the pickup in to the dealer many times
for the same electrical problem. The pickup was tested with some device while
it was operating, and eventually, the manufacturer and the dealer agreed to take
the pickup back and refund the purchase price. No litigation was involved.
Judge Beaudet does not believe that her experience will cause her to be biased
for or against either party.
The disclosure was made out of
an abundance of caution because ethical considerations require the disclosure
of any information reasonably relevant to the question of disqualification,
even when no actual basis for disqualification exists. (California Code of
Judicial Ethics, Canon 3(E)(2)(a).)
            On
May 9, 2024, Defendant’s counsel
filed a declaration as a statement of disqualification
for cause, contending that the undersigned is prejudiced against Defendant or
its counsel and cannot have a fair and impartial hearing or trial based
exclusively on the Disclosure.
            As
such past life experiences are not, as a matter of law, legal grounds for
disqualification for cause, the pleading demonstrates on its face no legal
grounds for disqualification. It is stricken pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 170.4, subdivision (b). 
Mere Familiarity with the Type of Case or
Personal Involvement in a Similar Case 
Are Not Grounds for Disqualification for
Cause
“It shall not be grounds for
disqualification that the judge: (a) Is or is not a member of a racial, ethnic,
religious, sexual or similar group and the proceeding involves the rights of
such a group.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 170.2(a).)  The
Statement is based only on the Disclosure.
“[M]ere familiarity with the
defendant(s), or the type of charge, or kind of defense presented” is not
grounds for disqualification (Clemens v. U.S. Dist.
Court for Central Dist. of Cal. (9th Cir. 2005) 428 F.3d 1175, 1179 (quoting
Nichols v. Alley (10th Cir. 1995) 71 F.3d 347, 351).) That the
undersigned had a personal experience involving an electrical defect in an
automobile 24 years ago which is a similar defect alleged among others in this
case involving a different vehicle type and manufacturer is not disqualifying.
(See Mann v. Thalacker (8th Cir. 2001) 246 F.3d
1092, 1097 [“[W]e think it is not generally true that a judge who was a
victim of sexual abuse at some time in the remote past would therefore probably
be unable to give a fair trial to anyone accused of a sex crime.”]; cf. People v. Chatman (2006) 38 Cal.4th 344, 364 [“The
mere fact that Judge Ball’s daughter had been the victim of a knifepoint
robbery . . . many years before does not disqualify him [from a robbery trial].”].
As stated below, the undersigned is not prejudiced or biased against or in
favor of any party to this proceeding or their counsel. (Answer, ¶ 2.)
Opinions and Conclusions are Insufficient to
Disqualify a Judge
Code of
Civil Procedure section 170.3, subdivision (c)(1) requires the disqualification statement to
set forth “the facts constituting the grounds” for disqualification of the
judge. Mere conclusions of the pleader are insufficient. (In re Morelli (1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 819, 843 (overruled on other grounds); Urias v. Harris
Farms, Inc. (1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 415, 426.)
A party’s belief as to a judge’s bias and prejudice is irrelevant and not
controlling in a motion to disqualify for cause, as the test applied is an
objective one. (Leland Stanford
Junior University v. Superior Court
(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 403, 408;
United Farm Workers of America v. Superior Court
(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 97, 104;
(“the litigants’ necessarily partisan views [do] not provide the applicable
frame of reference.”) (Brackets in original.)) The facts and circumstances
prompting a challenge for cause must be evaluated in the context of the entire
proceeding and not based solely upon isolated conduct or remarks. (Flier v. Superior
Court (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 165, 171-172.) Thus, the opinions and
conclusions of Defendant’s counsel are insufficient to disqualify the
undersigned.
 The Statement is Insufficient for
Disqualification
Based
on an Appearance of Bias
Code
of Civil Procedure section 170.1, subdivision (a)(6)(A)(iii) provides that a judge shall be disqualified
if a person aware of the facts might reasonably entertain a doubt that the
judge would be able to be impartial. The California Supreme Court has cautioned
that this is a heavy burden and “must clearly be established by an objective
standard.” (Haworth
v. Superior Court (2010) 50 Cal.4th 372, 389 [quoting People v.
Chatman (2006) 38 Cal.4th 344, 363].) “[T]he appearance-of-partiality
‘standard must not be so broadly construed that it becomes, in effect,
presumptive, so that recusal is mandated upon the merest unsubstantiated
suggestion of personal bias or prejudice.’” (Haworth,
50 Cal.4th at 389 [quoting United States v. Holland (9th Cir. 2008)
519 F.3d 909, 913 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)].)   
To the extent Defendant
asserts that the undersigned is biased or prejudiced against Defendant,
Defendant has not alleged sufficient facts to clearly establish the appearance
of bias as Defendant only asserts counsel’s opinions and conclusions based on the
Disclosure. The undersigned is not prejudiced
or biased against or in favor of any party to this proceeding, has made all
rulings based upon the facts and arguments officially presented, has acted in
furtherance of her judicial duties, and has not prejudged any legal or factual
claims in this case. (Answer, ¶¶ 2-5.) Thus, absent any other facts suggesting prejudice or bias, the facts alleged
in the Disclosure do not disqualify the undersigned.
A Judge Has a Duty to Decide When Not
Disqualified
A judge has both an ethical and statutory duty to decide cases where,
as here, there are no legal grounds for disqualification. (Cal. Code Jud.
Ethics, canon 3B(1) [“A judge shall hear and decide all matters assigned to the
judge except those in which he or she is disqualified.”]; Code Civ. Proc., § 170; Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 10.608(1)(A).)  

CONCLUSION
Because the Statement, on its
face, discloses no legal grounds for disqualification for cause, it is ordered
stricken pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 170.4,
subdivision (b).
The parties are reminded that
the determination of the question of the disqualification is not an appealable
order and may be reviewed only by a writ of mandate from the Court of Appeal
sought within 10 days of notice to the parties of the decision. (Code Civ. Proc., §
170.3(d).) In the event that a timely writ is sought, and an
appellate court determines that an answer should have been timely filed, such
an answer is filed herewith. (See PBA, LLC v.
KPOD, Ltd. (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 965, 972; accord, Fine
v. Superior Court
(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 651, 658, n.3.)
 
            GOOD CAUSE APPEARING THEREFOR, it is
so ordered.
