Defendant (“Salomon”) discusses
the issue of informed consent in her Closing Trial Brief (Phase One), but
Romo acknowledges in her Reply thereto (pp. 6:17-7:1) that “[i]nformed consent

issue of informed consent was not identified as an issue for this Court to
determine in this bifurcated phase of the trial.
