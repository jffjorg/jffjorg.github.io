The Judge, Honorable Teresa A. Beaudet, issues a tentative ruling in Case No. 23STCV10405, in which Plaintiff FOUAD J. ABDULLA is suing Defendant GENERAL MOTORS, LLC. The Judge discloses that approximately 24 years ago, she and her husband purchased a pickup truck that developed electrical problems. The manufacturer and dealer agreed to take back the pickup and refund the purchase price. The Judge does not believe her experience will cause her to be biased for or against either party. However, if a party believes the Judge is biased, they have until May 31, 2024, to file and serve a verified statement of disqualification. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to give notice of this Disclosure to any new parties added to the case. The mediation/ADR status conference is continued to July 30, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 50, unless both parties waive the right to file the Statement.
