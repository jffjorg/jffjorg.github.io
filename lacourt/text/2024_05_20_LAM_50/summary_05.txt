Here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the motion to disqualify Judge Beaudet from hearing the case. The Defendant's counsel filed a statement of disqualification, alleging that Judge Beaudet's past experience with a faulty vehicle would bias her in the case. However, the court finds that the disclosure of Judge Beaudet's past experience does not constitute grounds for disqualification. The court also finds that the Defendant's counsel's arguments are insufficient to establish the appearance of bias. The court reminds the parties of their rights and obligations under the California Code of Civil Procedure and notes that the determination of the question of disqualification is not an appealable order.
