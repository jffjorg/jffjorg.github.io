Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ashley Strauss, et al. v. North Oak Real Estate Inv, Inc., et al. The case involves a dispute over alleged breaches of implied warranty of habitability, covenant of quiet enjoyment, and sexual battery, as well as claims of intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the third and fifth causes of action, which alleges sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, respectively. The judge has given the plaintiffs 20 days to amend their complaint to address the deficiencies noted in the demurrer.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the sixth cause of action, which alleges negligent infliction of emotional distress. The judge has also granted the motion to strike certain portions of the complaint, including allegations of punitive damages, and given the plaintiffs 20 days to amend their complaint to address the deficiencies noted in the motion to strike.

The judge has also noted that the plaintiffs' allegations of oppression, fraud, or malice are conclusory and insufficient to support their claims for punitive damages, and has granted the motion to strike these allegations.

The judge has ordered the defendant to give notice of this ruling.
