Plaintiffs filed additional declarations stating they were
not served with the arbitration award personally or by registered or certified
mail or as provided in the agreement. 
This argument fails for at least three reasons. First, as discussed
above, Plaintiffs’ opposition is untimely, which deprives this court of any
authority to vacate the arbitration award. (Murry v. Civil Service Employees
Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 796, 800; accord, Rivera, supra,
54 Cal.App.5th at p. 94.)  Second, Defendants
have demonstrated to the court’s satisfaction that the Arbirator’s Award was
electronically served on counsel in compliance with the agreed upon terms pursuant
to the JAMS rules.  Third, just as the
Court of Appeal found in Murry v. Civil Service Emp. Ins. Co. (1967) 254
Cal.App.2d 796, 799, even if there were “irregularity” in the service of he
award, it must be disregarded because “a defect in service of the award does
not come within the statutory grounds upon which the court in a confirmation
proceeding can and should vacate an this award in view of the complete absence
of any showing of any prejudice whatsoever to appellant by reason of this
irregularity.”  Here, even if the Arbitrator’s
Award arrived by the latest on November 21, 2023 (see 2/29/24, Shadrack Decl.,
Ex. 4.), Plaintiffs fail to show any prejudice whatsoever by reason of the “irregularity”
in receiving the Arbitrator’s Award.
