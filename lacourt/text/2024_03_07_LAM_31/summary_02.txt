```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to vacate an arbitration award. The plaintiffs argue that they were not served with the award personally or by registered/certified mail, but the judge rejects this argument for three reasons. Firstly, the opposition is late and therefore the court has no authority to vacate the award. Secondly, the award was electronically served on counsel in compliance with the agreed-upon terms. Thirdly, even if there was an irregularity in the service of the award, it would not be grounds for vacating the award because the plaintiffs have not shown any prejudice as a result. The judge concludes that the plaintiffs have failed to show any prejudice and therefore the arbitration award should stand.
