And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The motion to confirm the arbitration award is GRANTED. The Judge finds that the Defendants have satisfied the filing requirements for the petition, including serving the arbitration award and notice of hearing. The Judge also finds that the motion is timely and that the Plaintiffs' opposition is untimely and has no authority to consider it. The Judge concludes that the arbitration award is enforceable and therefore confirms the award. The Judge directs the Defendants to file a proposed judgment consistent with this decision within 10 days.
