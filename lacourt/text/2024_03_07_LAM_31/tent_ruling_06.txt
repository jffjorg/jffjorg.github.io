[1] healthPiper Defendants’ insistence
on the procedural defects of Plaintiff’s motions does not end here.  They next point out that Plaintiff improperly
combined two defendants (healthPiper LLC and healthPiper PC) regarding two sets
of discovery requests.  In other words,
Plaintiff should have filed four motions in all.  There is some merit to healthPiper Defendants
point.  healthPiper Defendants provided
different responses to some of the at-issue discovery.  In an apparent concession, Plaintiff has
withdrawn the motion as to SROG Nos. 34, and 45-48.  (See Reply, p. 4.)  However, as discussed herein, the same
objection does not hold as to RPD Nos. 15-19. 
The court will not require Plaintiff to file motions as to each
healthPiper Defendant, especially when Plaintiff has withdrawn the SROG Nos. 34
and 45-48.
