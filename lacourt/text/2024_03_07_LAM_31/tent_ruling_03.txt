JUDGMENT
CREDITOR’S MOTION FOR 
POST-JUDGMENT
ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS



 
MOVING
PARTY:               Plaintiff and
Judgment Creditor Fabiola Vera  
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Lucas Auto Center, Inc.
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On February
22, 2021, Plaintiff, Fabiola Vera, filed this action against Defendants Lucas
Auto Center Inc. (“Lucas Auto”), Hudson Insurance Company, and Does 1 through
75.  On April 5, 2021, Plaintiff filed
the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), alleging, in relevant part, violations of
the Consumer Legal Remedies Act and the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act.  
 
            On June 22,
2021, the clerk entered default against Lucas Auto.
 
            On October
13, 2021, after Plaintiff dismissed Hudson Insurance Company and Doe
Defendants, the court entered default judgment against Lucas Auto in the sum of
$30,805.32, consisting of $4,936.00 in damages, $16,918.36 as a Song-Beverly
penalty, $7,409.00 in attorneys’ fees, and $1,046.96 in costs.     
 
            On May 23,
2022, after several attempts, Plaintiff obtained a writ of execution.  On the same day, Lucas Auto filed a motion to
set aside the default and default judgment. 

 
On July 26, 2023, Lucas Auto filed
an ex parte application to advance the hearing date for its motion to set aside
the default and default judgment and to stay enforcement of the judgment.  Plaintiff opposed the application. The court granted
the application in part. The court did not advance the hearing date as
requested but issued a stay of Plaintiff’s writ of execution pending resolution
of Lucas Auto’s motion.
 
            On August
25, 2022, the court denied Lucas Auto’s motion to set aside the default and
default judgment.  Lucas Auto indicated
it would appeal the ruling.  Accordingly,
the court did not lift the stay on Plaintiff’s writ of execution.  The court set a status conference and set a
briefing schedule regarding its authority to stay the judgment while Lucas
Auto’s appeal was filed and pending.  Plaintiff’s
brief was due by September 12, 2022.  The
status conference was scheduled for September 22, 2022.
 
            On
September 12, 2022, Plaintiff filed her brief arguing why the court should not
stay enforcement of the judgment.
 
            On
September 20, 2022, Lucas Auto filed its Notice of Appeal.
 
            On
September 22, 2022, the court held the status conference.  The court informed counsel that once a bond is
posted the automatic stay will come into effect pursuant to CCP section 917.1.  
 
On November 1, 2022, Lucas Auto
posted the appeal bond which automatically stayed Plaintiff’s efforts to
enforce the judgment.[1]  
 
            On October
10, 2023, Plaintiff filed this Motion for Post-Judgment Attorneys’ Fees and
Costs which were incurred post-judgment. 
 
            Lucas Auto
filed an opposition.  Plaintiff replied.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Code of Civil Procedure (CCP)
section 685.040 states, in part, “The judgment creditor is entitled to the
reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment.” Attorney’s fees
incurred in enforcing a judgment are expressly excluded unless otherwise
provided by law.  (Id.) “[W]hen
a fee-shifting statute provides the substantive authority for an award of
attorney fees, any such fees incurred in enforcement of the judgment are within
the scope of section 685.040.” (Conservatorship of
McQueen (2014) 59 Cal.4th 602, 614.)
 
Costs authorized by Section 685.040
may be claimed by filing a memorandum of costs or via noticed motion before the
judgment is satisfied in full but not later than two years after the costs have
been incurred.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 685.070, subd. (b), 685.080, subd. (a).)
 Allowed costs include, but are not
limited to, those costs outlined in Section 685.070. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§¿685.080, subd. (a).)  The notice of motion must describe the costs
claimed, must state their amount, and must be supported by “an affidavit of a
person who has knowledge of the facts stating that to the person’s best
knowledge and belief the costs are correct, and reasonable and necessary, and
have not been satisfied.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.080, subd. (b).) 
The motion must be served personally or by mail.  (Ibid.)  The court must make an
order allowing or disallowing the costs to the extent justified under the
circumstances of that particular case. (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.080, subd. (c).) 
 
III.       DISCUSSION           
            
 “The judgment creditor is entitled to the
reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.040.)  “[W]hen a fee-shifting statute provides the
substantive authority for an award of attorney fees, any such fees incurred in
enforcement of the judgment are within the scope of section 685.040.” (Conservatorship
of McQueen, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 614.)
 
Here, Plaintiff was awarded a
default judgment against Lucas Auto. 
(Minute Order, 10/13/21.)  The
award included $7,904.00 in attorneys’ fees as authorized under the Consumer
Legal Remedies Act (Civ. Code § 1780, subd. (e)) and the Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d)). (Id.) Plaintiff now seeks to
recover a total sum of $13,000.26, consisting of $12,790.50 in attorney’s fees
and $209.76 in costs which were incurred in efforts to enforce her judgment
against Lucas Auto.  Specifically,
Plaintiff seeks to recover attorney fees for the following six categories: (1) obtaining
a writ of execution and opposing a stay of enforcement, including Lucas Auto’s
ex parte application to stay enforcement; (2) opposing Lucas Auto’s motion to
set aside the default and default judgment, (3) notifying the court of changes
to Plaintiff’s counsel’s contact information, (4) reviewing the case
reassignment to the Honorable Serena R. Murillo, (5) the fees incurred in
connection to this fees and costs motion and (6) appearing for the status
conference regarding Lucas Auto’s appeal. 
(See Reply, pp. 3-4.) 
 
The court’s order will track Plaintiff’s
categorical approach.  
 
Category 1:  The court finds this category involves activity
to enforce the judgment.  Category One is
recoverable. 
 
Category 2:   This
category presents somewhat of a riddle:  When
are defensive acts considered acts of enforcement?  Luckily, several courts have considered this
issue in the context of enforcing judgments. 

 
Lucas Auto relies primarily upon Conservatorship
of McQueen, supra, 59 Cal.4th 602. Conservatorship of McQueen
is distinguishable.  In Conservatorship
of McQueen, the California Supreme Court noted that “Section 685.040 … pertains
solely to the recovery of costs and fees incurred ‘enforcing a judgment.’… defending
a judgment on appeal is not an aspect of ‘enforcing’ it for purposes of Section
685.040.”  (Id. at p. 63.  
 
Here, the issue presented does not
involve the defense of an appeal.  The
rules on appeal are different, as discussed in Conservatorship of McQueen.
 
            Instead,
Plaintiff incurred fees to oppose Lucas Auto’s motion to set aside the default
and default judgment.  Plaintiff’s fees were
spent to enforce its judgment in the same way the judgment creditor’s fees in Globalist Internet Technologies, Inc. v. Reda (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1267 (Globalist), were spent
to enforce its judgment.  In Globalist,
the appellate court framed this issue and answered it as follows:  “In this case, we are asked to consider
whether attorney fees expended by a judgment creditor in successfully defending
itself in a separate action filed against it by the judgment debtor, which had
as its sole purpose the specific enforcement of an alleged agreement to settle
the judgment debt at a substantial reduction, are attorney fees expended by the
judgment creditor in enforcing the judgment. We conclude they are, and reverse
the trial court's postjudgment order taxing the judgment creditor's
postjudgment costs.” (Id. at pp. 1269–1270.) The Globalist Court stated:
 
As in Jaffe, Globalist's right to recover attorney fees
does not depend on the nature of the action or the forum in which the expenses
were incurred. The inquiry compelled by section 685.040 is whether the attorney
fees were incurred “in enforcing a judgment” containing an award of contract
attorney fees. They were. The sole purpose of the specific performance action
filed by Reda and IBI was to significantly decrease their unsatisfied judgment
debtor obligations in this action. By the time Reda v. Globalist, 06CC02588, was filed, Reda and IBI owed
Globalist over $444,600 (not including accrued interest) on this judgment.
Their action sought specific performance of an alleged settlement of the
judgment for $75,000 or about one-sixth of what was owed. Had Globalist not defended against the specific performance
action, it would have lost substantial rights under the judgment in this case.
Accordingly, the attorney fees it incurred in defense of the companion action
were incurred in enforcing the judgment.


(Globalist, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 1276.) 
 
            Similarly,
in Slates v. Gorabi (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215, the appellate
court noted that when considering whether the fees were spent to enforce the
action consideration should be given to the judgment debtor’s conduct.  “More
plausibly, the Legislature envisioned the propriety of an attorney fee award as
turning on the judgment debtor's postjudgment conduct, with the Legislature
intending that the judgment debtors possible liability for postjudgment fees
serve as encouragement for the debtors cooperation in satisfying the judgment.”  (Ibid.) 


            Here,
Lucas Auto sought to overturn the default and the default judgment.  As in Globalist, “had [Plaintiff] not defended against the specific performance action,
it would have lost substantial rights under the judgment in this case.” (Globalist, supra, 167
Cal.App.4th at p. 1276.) 
 
            The court awards fees incurred in
Category 2.  
 
Categories 3-6:  The court does not
award fees for these categories because the fees were not incurred in an effort
to enforce the judgment.  
 
The Fees 
 
As indicated above, Plaintiff is
entitled to some award of attorney fees. 
Lucas Auto concedes as much.  (See
Opp., p. 3.)  Further, Lucas Auto does not
challenge the reasonableness of the Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rates.  Rather, Defendant argues any such recovery
should be capped to $732 by obliquely referring to Plaintiff’s post-judgment itemized
billing sheet.  (See Opp., p. 3; Plaintiff’s
Compendium of Exhibits, Ex. 1.)  Lucas
Auto’s undeveloped challenge to the amount of attorney fees falls short.  “[I]t is the burden of the challenging party
to point to the specific items challenged [within the moving party’s verified
billing invoice], with a sufficient argument and citations to evidence.¿
General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do
not suffice.”¿ (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459,
488.)¿¿ 
 
In the absence of a challenge to
the hourly rates, and having found Plaintiff is entitled to recover attorney
fees as identified in Category 1 and 2, the court finds $9,074.50 is a
reasonable award of post-judgment attorney fees.  
 
            Costs
 
            Plaintiff
seeks $209.76 in costs.  Lucas Auto does
not challenge the requested costs. 
 
III.      CONCLUSION
 
            Based
on the foregoing, the motion for post-judgment attorney fees and costs is
GRANTED.  Plaintiff is awarded the total
sum of $9,283.76, consisting of $9,074.50 in attorney fees and $209.76 in
costs.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
