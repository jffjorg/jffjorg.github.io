MOTION
TO CONFIRM ARBITRATION AWARD



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendants
Front Porch Communities and Services, et al.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiffs
Patricia Hall Carlton and Richard Hall, Children and Successors in Interest of
Mildred Hall
 
 
I.          FACTUAL AND
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
            On June 4, 2021, Plaintiffs, Patricia Hall Carlton and
Richard Hall, Children and Successors in Interest of Mildred Hall, filed a
First Amended Complaint against Defendants,  Front Porch Communities and Services (“Front
Porch”), Randy Herzig, Nadine Roisman, Pamela Lowe, and Lisa Stephens LVN, arising
from the retaliatory eviction of Mildred Hall from Front Porch’s facilities.  
 
            On September
22, 2021, the court granted Front Porch’s and Randy Herzig’s petition to compel
arbitration.
 
            On October
27, 2021, the court granted Nadine Roisman’s and Pamela Lowe’s petition to
compel arbitration. 
 
The Honorable David A. Thompson (Ret.) was appointed as
Arbitrator.  Claimants repeatedly failed
to appear at conferences or comply with their discovery obligations.  On September 28, 2023, the Arbitrator issued a
Final Award in favor of Defendants.  The
Final Award determined the following: (1) all issues submitted to Arbitration
are hereby determined adversely to Claimants; (2) all such issues are thus
decided in favor of Respondents; (3) Claimants shall take nothing; and (4)
Claimants shall pay $1,170 in monetary sanctions to Respondents pursuant to
JAMS Rule 29.
 
On November 20, 2023, Defendants filed this motion for an
order confirming the arbitration award. 
 
The motion was heard on February 14, 2024.  The court issued a tentative order stating an
inclination to grant the motion pending the filing of proof of service of the
arbitration award by the Arbitrator.
 
On February 29, 2024, Defendants filed proof of service of
the arbitration award on Plaintiffs.  On
the same day, Plaintiffs filed additional declarations challenging proof of
service of the arbitration award. 
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Once
arbitration is concluded, “any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when
confirmed as a judgment of the superior court.”  (O’Hare v. Municipal
Resource Consultants (2003) 107¿Cal.App.4th 267, 278.)  Any of the
parties may file a petition with the court, which must then “confirm the award,
correct and confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,¿§§¿1285, 1286; EHM
Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of Hollywood,¿Inc. (2018) 21
Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.) “It is well settled that the scope of judicial
review of arbitration awards is extremely narrow.” (California Faculty Assn.
v. Superior Court¿(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.)  “Neither the trial
court, nor the appellate court, may ‘review the merits of the dispute, the
sufficiency of the evidence, or the arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct
or review an award because of an arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if
it appears on the award’s face.”  (EHM Productions, supra, at p.
1063-64.) 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
Defendants request a court order confirming the arbitration
award issued on September 28, 2023. 
 
An arbitrator’s award is enforceable only after being
confirmed by a court of law. (O’Hare, 107 Cal.App.4th at p. 278.) 
“An award that has not been confirmed or vacated has the same force and effect
as a contract in writing between the parties to the arbitration.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1287.6.)  Thus, the court must first evaluate and confirm
the initial arbitration award. 
 
A.   
Filing
Requirements (CCP § 1285.4)  
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4 states: “A petition
under this chapter shall: 
 

Set forth the substance of or
     have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner
     denies the existence of such an agreement. 


Set forth the names of the
     arbitrators. 


Set forth or have attached a
     copy of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if
     any. 

 
Here, Defendants submit the Final Award issued by Arbitrator,
The Honorable David A. Thompson (Ret.) on September 28, 2023.  (Schadrack
Decl., Ex. 1.)  Defendants also submit a copy of the arbitration agreement
executed by Mildred Hall.  (Schadrack
Decl., Ex. 2.)  Defendants have satisfied
the filing requirements.
  
B.    
Service of
the Arbitration Award & Timeliness of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288,
1288.4) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6 provides that: “The neutral
arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award on each party to
the arbitration personally or by registered or certified mail or as provided in
the agreement.”  (Emphasis added.)  In addition, a party may seek a
court judgment confirming an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition
no more than four years, but not less than 10 days, after the award is
served.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) 
 
Here, the court continued the hearing to allow Defendants to
file proof that the Arbitrator served a copy of the award on Plaintiffs.  Defendants
have submitted proof of service showing Plaintiffs were served with the arbitration
award on September 28, 2023 via the JAMS electronic filing system.  (2/29/24, Shadrack
Decl., Ex. 3.)  The proof of service
specifically includes Plaintiffs’ counsel (as confirmed by cross reference to
Exhibit 1 to Shadrack Decl.)  Defendants
filed this motion on November 20, 2023. 
The motion is timely.
 
C.    
Service of
the Petition, and Notice of Hearing (CCP § 1290.4)  
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4, the statute
governing proper service of this motion states, in pertinent part:  
 
“(a) A copy of the petition and a written notice of the time
and place of the hearing thereof and any other papers upon which the petition
is based shall be served in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement
for the service of such petition and notice. 
 
(b) If the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner
in which such service shall be made and the person upon whom service is to be
made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and has not previously been
served in accordance with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service within this State
shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in an
action. 
 
Here, Defendants served Plaintiffs with a copy of this
motion and notice of motion on December 22, 2023 by electronic service pursuant
to an agreement of the parties to accept service by e-mail or electronic
transmission.  Defendants demonstrate that the motion was properly
served.  However, given the deficiencies
noted with proof of service of the arbitration award by the arbitrator, the court
will continue the hearing for this motion. 
 
D.   
 Plaintiffs’
Opposition 
 
Although not
explicitly stated in their opposition, Plaintiffs seek an order vacating the
arbitration award.  They argue the motion
to confirm the arbitration award should be denied because: (1) they did not
have notice of the Arbitrator’s Award issued on September 28, 2023, and did not
have notice of the September 27, 2023 hearing with the arbitrator, and (2) this
case is statutorily exempt from arbitration. 

 
Plaintiffs’
opposition is untimely.  “The court’s
power to vacate an arbitration award is governed by sections 1286, 1286.2, and
1286.4.”  (Rivera v. Shivers
(2020) 54 Cal.App.5th 82, 94.)   In particular, Section 1286.4 requires that a
party seeking to vacate an arbitration award by petition or in a response
requesting such relief do so by duly filing or serving the petition or
response.  (Rivera, at p. 94
citing Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.4, subd. (a).)  “A response shall be served and filed within
10 days after service of the petition except that if the petition is served in
the manner provided in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of Section 1290.4, the
response shall be served and filed within 30 days after service of the
petition.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.6.)  Failure to file and serve a response to a
petition to confirm within 10 days of the petition deprives a trial court of
authority to consider the response.  (Rivera,
at p. 94.)
 
Here, Defendants
served and filed their motion to confirm the arbitration award on November 20,
2023.  Plaintiffs filed an opposition requesting
an order vacating the arbitration award. 
The opposition was filed on February 1, 2024—more than 30 days after
service of the motion.  Therefore, the
court has no authority to consider Plaintiffs’ request to vacate the
arbitration award.[1]
 
 IV.
      CONCLUSION
            
Based on the foregoing, the motion to confirm the
arbitration award is GRANTED.  
Defendants are directed to file a proposed judgment consistent with this
decision within 10 days.
 
Defendants to give notice.
