And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a future court hearing. The healthPiper Defendants have argued that the Plaintiff's motions contain procedural defects, including the improper combination of two defendants, healthPiper LLC and healthPiper PC, in two sets of discovery requests. While the Defendants have a point, the Plaintiff has withdrawn the motion as to certain discovery requests. The judge has decided not to require the Plaintiff to file separate motions for each healthPiper Defendant, especially since the Plaintiff has already withdrawn certain motions.
