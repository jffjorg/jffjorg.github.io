[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S
 MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES
 
I.       
BACKGROUND       
       The
complaint alleges that Plaintiffs bought a 2020 GMC Sierra made by Defendant
that developed defects in the electrical, transmission, and braking systems.
Defendant failed to repair or repurchase the vehicle. Plaintiffs allege
violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (the “Act”).
       On
February 28, 2024, Plaintiffs filed Notice of Settlement of Entire Case. Defendant
agreed to pay Plaintiffs restitution and civil penalties. Plaintiffs now
request statutory attorney’s fees of $56,262.50 and additional fees of $5,000 to
review Defendant’s opposition to Plaintiff’s fee motion and to appear at the
hearing (total of $61,262.50). 
 
II.     
ARGUMENTS
       Plaintiffs
argue that they are entitled to attorney’s fees under the Act because Defendant
unreasonably forced Plaintiff to file suit and litigate the case. 
       In
opposition, Defendant argues this case did not present any unique issues and
did not require special skill. This case is identical to the hundreds of
matters litigated against Defendant. Plaintiffs propound recycled discovery
requests, file virtually identical briefs and motions, create unnecessary
litigation, and otherwise wastes resources. The fee award should be reduced to
$15,805.21.  
       In
reply, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant’s contentions are based on an entirely
arbitrary assessment of the work expended by Plaintiff to litigate this case,
which arose as a result of Defendant’s unreasonable conduct. Other courts have
affirmed that Plaintiffs’ counsel’s fees are reasonable. 
 
III.   
LEGAL STANDARDS
       A
prevailing buyer in an action under the SBA “shall be allowed by the court” to
recover the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, “including attorney’s fees
based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably
incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of
such action.” (Civ.
Code, § 1794 subd.(d).) A prevailing buyer has the burden of showing that
the fees incurred were allowable, reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation, and were reasonable in amount. 
(Pulliam
v. HNL Automotive Inc. (2021) 60 Cal.App.5th 396, 405.) The
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work. (Id.)

       A reasonable fee can be measured by the
marketplace by analyzing the quality and necessity of services and then
comparing that cost with what other attorneys with similar experience and
ability charge for the same services. (Shaffer
v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 993, 1002.)
       In “lemon law” cases, the
court applies the lodestar method in calculating attorney’s fees, including the
use of fee multipliers where applicable. (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 785, 818.) The court determines a lodestar
figure “based on a careful compilation of the actual time spent and reasonable
hourly compensation for each attorney.” (Robertson at 819.) The lodestar may be
augmented or diminished “by taking various relevant factors into account
including (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved and the
skill displayed in presenting them; (2) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys; and (3) the contingent
nature of the  fee award, based on the uncertainty of prevailing on
the merits and of establishing eligibility for the award.” (Robertson at 819.) The multiplier is a risk
enhancement based on the probability of loss. (Robertson at 821.)  
       The prevailing party is entitled to
“’compensation for all the hours reasonably spent” in litigating
the action to a successful conclusion. (Ibid., italics in original.)
‘Reasonably spent’ means that time spent ‘in the form of inefficient or
duplicative efforts is not subject to compensation. (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 394.)
       The court may rely on his or her own
experience and is given broad discretion in calculating reasonable attorney’s
fees. (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132
["The experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of
professional services rendered in his court, and while his judgment is of
course subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court
is convinced that it is clearly wrong.”].)
IV.   
DISCUSSION
       Plaintiffs
seek reimbursement of fees incurred by partner, Nancy Zhang; an associate,
Allesandro Manno; and a paralegal, Robert Aguilar.  The Court has considered all of the relevant
factors including the nature of the case, which in the Court’s view, is a
relatively routine “lemon law” case that did not involve novel or difficult
questions of law or fact and resolved relatively quickly with little motion
practice. The Court also considers the outcome of the case, which resulted in
restitution and civil penalties without requirement of trial. 
       Plaintiff
contends that 153.6 billable hours were incurred. The Court has reviewed the
billing record and finds that a number of the itemized tasks are unreasonable,
inefficient, and at times duplicative among the attorneys and paralegal. Plaintiff’s
counsel is entitled to reasonable compensation; however, “‘padding” in the form
of inefficient or duplicative efforts is not subject to compensation." (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) 
       The
Court is permitted to make “across the board cuts and apply a negative
multiplier” where it determines that the case was not complex, as well as the
experience of counsel in this area. (Warren
v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 41 [permitting a
negative multiplier of 33% to the lodestar fee request of $351,055.26,
resulting in a fee award of $115,848.24].) 
       The Court
has discretion to apply a reduction in hours for duplicative and or excessive
billing. Proper factors to consider in applying a negative reduction are the
lack of complexity, that the matter did not go to trial, that name partners
were doing work that could have been done by lower-billing attorneys, and that
all the attorneys were doing work that could have been done by paralegals, thus
applying a 39% reduction in the lodestar. (Morris
v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 41.) These factors
are applicable here.
