And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $44,160.00. The ruling is based on the court's conclusion that the case was a relatively routine "lemon law" case that did not involve novel or difficult questions of law or fact and resolved relatively quickly with little motion practice. The court reduced the requested fees from $61,262.50 to $44,160.00 due to inefficient or duplicative efforts by plaintiff's counsel, as well as the lack of complexity in the case. The court applied a 39% reduction in the lodestar fee request, citing cases such as Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. and Morris v. Hyundai Motor America.
