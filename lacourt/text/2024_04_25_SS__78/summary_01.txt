Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has denied the motion to file a Cross-Complaint filed by Defendant James Shaw. The Court found that Shaw's delay in filing the Cross-Complaint was unacceptable and constituted bad faith. Shaw knew of the facts giving rise to his Cross-Complaint as early as 2021, but failed to file a Cross-Complaint despite the Court granting his first motion for leave to file a Cross-Complaint in 2022. The Court cannot find that Shaw acted in good faith in failing to file a timely Cross-Complaint.
