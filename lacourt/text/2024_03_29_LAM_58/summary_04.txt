English-text summary:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees and costs, but reduced the amount from the original request. The judge found that the plaintiff's attorneys' hourly rates were reasonable, but reduced the number of hours incurred for various tasks during the litigation. The judge also reduced the fees for tasks that were not reasonably necessary to the litigation, such as excessive travel time and "memo to file" tasks. The final amount of attorneys' fees awarded was $111,490.50, with costs of $7,277.71. The defendant, General Motors, is ordered to pay the plaintiff's counsel the sum of $118,768.21.
