And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to set aside a default judgment and a motion to substitute service. The judge notes that the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment was denied on January 11, 2024, and that the defendant's motion to set aside was filed late. The defendant claims that the delay was due to medical issues, but the judge finds this argument irrelevant. The judge also rules that the defendant's motion is procedurally defective because it does not attach the proposed answer or other pleading, despite the fact that the proposed answer is attached as an exhibit to the defendant's declaration. The judge cites California Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), which requires that an application for relief be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed.
