And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to enforce the settlement agreement between Plaintiff Sara Marie Alamo and Defendant Joe Miguel Alamo, Jr. The settlement agreement was signed by the parties and includes terms for quiet title, declaratory relief, and cancellation of instrument. The Defendant seeks to add a new term requiring the sale of the property by a certain date, but the Court finds that there is no ambiguity in the settlement agreement and therefore cannot add the new term. The Court also denies the request to appoint an elisor to execute the Full Reconveyance of the subject Deed of Trust, and instead orders the Defendant to reconvey the Deed of Trust once the Judgment is signed.
