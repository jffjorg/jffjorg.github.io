[1]           As early as January 11, 2024, when the
Court first denied Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment, the Court
noted that a motion to set aside had been reserved but no motion had yet been
filed. 


[2]           As preliminary matter, Plaintiff
argues that Defendant’s motion is procedurally defective because it fails
attach the proposed answer or other pleading with the Motion. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 473, subd. (b) [An application for relief “shall be accompanied by a copy of
the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed … otherwise the application
shall not be granted.”].) This argument fails because the proposed Answer is
attached as Exhibit B to the Chuwdry’s declaration.


[3]           Defendant further states that “Any
delay in filing this motion earlier than today was because in December and
January I was suffering from extreme back pain (requiring and ER visit) as well
a very serious case of the flu and was therefore unable to provide my counsel
all the information they needed to be able to finalize and file this motion.”
(Chuwdry Decl., ¶ 8.) Defendant’s vague declaration as to his medical condition
is irrelevant to disproving substitute service.
