And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion by the Defendants to continue the trial from March 15, 2024 to July 17, 2024. The Defendants argue that discovery motions are scheduled to be heard in January 2024 and that all discovery, including expert discovery, has been stalled. They also propose that after discovery is complete, they will be more prepared to participate in mediation.

The Plaintiffs oppose the motion, suggesting that if the parties agree on the scope and other conditions for the second IME, then the examination can occur on January 24, 2024, which would not necessitate a trial continuance.

The judge grants the motion, citing the need for a continuance due to the stalled discovery and the pending IME. The judge admonishes the parties that there will be no further continuances absent sufficient good cause and reminds them of the court's impacted motion calendar.
