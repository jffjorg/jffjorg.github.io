And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion to compel responses to discovery requests filed by Plaintiff Brayden Medina Molina against Defendant Target Corporation. The motion was filed due to Defendant's failure to timely respond to discovery requests, which waived all objections, including privilege and work product, unless Defendant served a response that is in substantial compliance or the failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The Court found that monetary sanctions are warranted due to the discovery abuse and granted sanctions in the amount of $2,461.65 total, which includes 1.5 hours of attorney time plus the filing fee for each motion. The Defendant and its counsel are ordered to pay the sanctions within 30 days, and Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court's order and file a proof of service of such.
