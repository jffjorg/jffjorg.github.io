And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the application of Poiema Enterprise, Inc. dba La Mexicana Meat Market to determine that the settlement between it and Plaintiff Ameila Aguilar was made in good faith. The Court finds that La Mexicana Meat Market has not presented sufficient admissible evidence to demonstrate the Tech-Bilt factors, including a rough approximation of Plaintiff's total recovery and the settling party's proportionate liability. The Court notes that La Mexicana Meat Market's failure to provide this evidence is a critical error that undermines its ability to demonstrate good faith settlement.
