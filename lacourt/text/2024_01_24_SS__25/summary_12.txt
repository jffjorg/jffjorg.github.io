English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The plaintiff had alleged that the defendant breached a rental car agreement and was therefore liable for damages to the vehicle. However, the judge found that the defendant had purchased an optional collision damage waiver, which covered damages to the vehicle, and therefore the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate a breach or damages.
