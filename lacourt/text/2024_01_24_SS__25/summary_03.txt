And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel responses to post-judgment requests and the motion for sanctions filed by Pinnacle Estate Properties (the judgment creditor). The motion was filed after the judgment debtor, Elizabeth Guemiksizian, failed to respond to the judgment creditor's request for production of documents.

The judge grants the motion to compel responses, ordering the judgment debtor to provide responses to the judgment creditor's post-judgment request for production. The judge also grants the motion for sanctions, ordering the judgment debtor to pay $850.00 to the judgment creditor's counsel for expenses incurred in seeking the court's order.

The judge finds that the judgment debtor has failed to provide any substantial justification for not complying with the court's orders, and therefore, the judgment creditor is entitled to sanctions. The judge notes that the judgment creditor's fees are reasonable under the circumstances and orders the judgment debtor to pay the amount of $850.00 within 30 days of service of the order.
