And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute between Plaintiff John Sloatman III and Defendant American Automobile Association, Inc. (AAA) over alleged violations of the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The Plaintiff alleges that AAA contacted him to collect an alleged debt and reported derogatory information on his credit report, despite him having canceled his insurance policy with AAA in writing. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff's complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, claiming that the action is time-barred and that AAA is not a debt collector. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a cause of action under California Civil Code, Section 1788.17, and as such, the Defendant's demurrer is overruled. The Defendant is ordered to file its answer within 20 days of the Court's ruling.
