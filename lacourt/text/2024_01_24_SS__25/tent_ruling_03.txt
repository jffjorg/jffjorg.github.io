BACKGROUND
 
On September 27, 2021, Arbitrators
Valerie Ho, Samuel D. Cadelinia, and Michael Simpson, through an Interboard
Arbitration Hearing, as required by the California Association of Realtors
(“CAR”), issued an arbitration award in favor of Pinnacle Estate Properties (“Judgment
Creditor” or “Creditor”), Craig Dubron (“Dubron”), Gary Keshishyan
(“Keshishyan”), and Rana Linka (“Linka”), (collectively “Petitioners”), and
against Respondents Century Realty & Loans, Inc. (“Century Realty”) and
Elizabeth Guemiksizian (“Judgment Debtor” or “Debtor”), (collectively
“Respondents”), for a total amount of $23,750.00. 
 
On September 19, 2022, Petitioners
filed a Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award against Respondents. 
 
On May 03, 2023, the Court granted
Petitioner’s petition to confirm the arbitration award. 
 
On May 04, 2023, the Court issued a
writ of execution against Debtor. 
 
On August 18, 2023, Debtor filed a
claim of exemption. The Court denied Debtor’s claim of exemption on August 28,
2023.
 
On November 13, 2023, Creditor
filed the instant Motion to Compel Judgment Debtor’s Responses to Judgment
Creditor’s Post Judgment Request for Production of Documents (Set One) and
Request for Monetary Sanctions. No opposition has been filed. 
 
On December 11, 2023, the Court on
its own motion continued the hearing on the instant motion to January 24, 2024.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard & Discussion
A. Interrogatories &
Requests for Production  
 
A judgment creditor may propound
written interrogatories to the judgment debtor in the manner provided by
Section 2030.010, et seq. (Code Civ. Proc., 708.020, subd. (a).)
Interrogatories pursuant to this section may be enforced, to the extent
practicable, in the same manner as interrogatories in a civil action. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 708.020, subd. (c).) Similarly, a judgment creditor may demand
that any judgment debtor produce and permit the party making the demand to
inspect and to copy documents in the possession, custody, or control of the
party upon whom the demand is made and, in the
manner
provided by Section 2031.010, et seq. (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.030, subd. (a).) Inspection demands
served pursuant to this section may be enforced in the same manner as demands
in a civil action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.030, subd. (c).)  
 
A party must respond to
interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260,
subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide
timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling responses
to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The party also
waives the right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or
work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) There is no
time limit for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories other than the
cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.020, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., 2030.290.) No meet and confer efforts are
required before filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)   
 
Failure to give notice of a motion is not only a violation
of the statutory requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones
v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) 
 
            Here, Creditor states that on
September 13, 2023, “Debtor was served [by Mail] with [Creditor]’s Request to
Produce Documents (Set 1) numbers 1-13.” (Alana Anaya Decl. ¶ 2; Exh. A.)
Responses needed to be submitted within 30 days after service was mailed to Debtor.
(Exh. A.) Creditor’s Counsel avers that no responses were received by October
19, 2023, when she had sent a “meet and confer letter” to the Debtor requesting
to resolve the dispute before court intervention was necessary. (Anaya Decl. ¶
3; Exh. B.) Debtor has since provided no verified responses to Creditor’s
request. (Id. ¶ 4.) Thus, because Debtor has not provided timely
responses to Creditor’s Request for Production, Creditor’s is entitled to
pursue the motion.
 
            B. Sanctions
            
            Code of Civil Procedure §
2031.300(c) provides in relevant part that the court shall impose monetary
sanctions against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully opposes a
motion to compel response to a demand unless it finds that they acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., CCP § 2031.300(c).) 
 
            Here, Creditor prays for sanctions against
Debtor totaling $850.00 based on the sum of $60.00 in court filing fees as well
as for two (2) hours of attorney’s fees at the rate of $395.00 an hour for 1.5
hours for work on drafting the motion and 0.5 hours for the appearance to argue
the motion. (Id. ¶¶ 5-7.) The Court finds these fees to be reasonable
under the circumstances, noting that Debtor has not provided any substantial
justification or other circumstances weighing against the issuance of
sanctions. Thus, the Court grants Creditor’s request for sanctions in the
amount of $850.00.
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Judgment Creditor Pinnacle Estate Properties’ Motion to Compel
Responses to Post-Judgment RPDs (Set 1) is GRANTED.
            
Judgment Creditor’s Motion for Sanctions is also GRANTED
in the amount of $850.00 against Judgment Debtor Elizabeth Guemiksizia. 
 
 JUDGMENT DEBTOR ELIZABETH
GUEMIKSIZIAN IS ORDERED TO PAY $850.00 TO JUDGMENT CREDITOR’S COUNSEL WITHIN
THIRTY (30) DAYS OF SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
