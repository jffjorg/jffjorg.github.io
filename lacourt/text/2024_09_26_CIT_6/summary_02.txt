Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The plaintiff, Jiajin Shi, is seeking a default judgment against the defendant, Huirong Dai, for a breach of contract. The court has reviewed the plaintiff's request and has identified several deficiencies in the submission. The court is denying the request for default judgment without prejudice, meaning the plaintiff has the opportunity to correct the deficiencies and re-submit the request. The deficiencies include:

* The plaintiff's declaration is dated before the operative First Amended Complaint was filed and before the default was entered.
* The plaintiff did not attach a copy of the subject contract to their declaration, even though it is mentioned and referenced therein.
* The plaintiff's declaration alone is not sufficient to prove damages, and proof is still required to support the damages requested.
* The plaintiff's memorandum of costs regarding a "Private Investigation Fee" for $499.00 is unclear and may not be a recoverable cost.

The court is requiring the plaintiff to correct these deficiencies and resubmit the default judgment package prior to the next hearing on September 26, 2024.
