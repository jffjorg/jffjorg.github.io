BACKGROUND           
            This
is an ADA/Unruh Civil Rights Act case. On May 22, 2023, plaintiff Orlando
Garcia (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Wayne Lee (Wayne),[1] Rayed Abdulnour (Rayed),
and Does 1 through 50, alleging one cause of action for violation of the Unruh
Civil Rights Act. Default was entered against Rayed on August 10, 2023. On May
2, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to strike Wayne’s answer. On May
28, 2024, default was entered against Wayne.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $14,958.58,
including $4,000.00 in damages, $9,120.00 in attorney fees, and $1,838.58 in
costs. The Court finds Plaintiff has submitted the appropriate documentation to
support the request for entry of default judgment, but the Court will reduce
the attorney fees request to $7,660.00 and the costs request to $1,740.67. As
noted in the Court’s prior ruling on Plaintiff’s request for entry of default
judgment, the Court will not include amounts billed for administrative work
such as filing documents and will not allow for more than 1 hour for
appearances at court conferences and OSC hearings. (Order re Tentative Ruling
(7/25/24).) The Court deducted entries for filing documents and for court
appearances accordingly. 
The
Court also notes that postage fees are not recoverable costs. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1033.5, subd. (b)(3).) The Court accordingly deducted entries for mailing and
postage. 
Accordingly,
the Court will GRANT Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment in the
amount of $4,000.00, plus $7,660.00 in attorney fees and $1,740.67 in costs,
for a total of $13,400.67. 
CONCLUSION           
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of
$13,400.67. The Court will modify and sign the proposed Judgment.
