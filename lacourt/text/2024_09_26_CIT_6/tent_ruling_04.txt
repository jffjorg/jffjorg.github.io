BACKGROUND 
This is a case involving abuse of a minor. On January
20, 2021, plaintiff D.C. (Claimant), a person with a disability, by and through
him [sic] guardian ad litem, Olivia C. (Petitioner), filed this action against
defendants West Covina Unified School district, Canyon View School, McKinley
Children’s Center, Inc. (McKinley), East San Gabriel Special Education Local
Planning Area, John Mann, Jeannie Ortiz, Jennifer Miller, Jorge Ramirez,
Yolanda Cork-Anthony, Diana Marie Casato and Does 1 through 50, alleging causes
of action for negligence, Ralph Act Violation, Bane Act Violation, Unruh Act
Violation. On February 3, 2021, the Court approved Petitioner’s application and
order for appointment as guardian ad litem for Claimant. 
On April 15, 2024, Claimant filed a notice of
settlement. On July 24, 2024, Olivia Chambers, i.e., Petitioner, filed a petition
for approval of compromise of claim or action or disposition of proceeds of
judgment for minor or person with disability on behalf of Claimant. On August
14, 2024, the Court granted the petition. 
On September 6, 2024, Petitioner filed an ex
parte application requesting the Court to sign a corrected order approving the
settlement. The Court continued the hearing to September 26, 2024, and directed
Petitioner to serve an amended petition and corrected order on September 9,
2024. On September 9, 2024, Petitioner filed a notice of ruling containing the
amended petition and corrected order. The petition is unopposed. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Court approval is required for all settlements of a
minor's claim or that of a person lacking the capacity to make decisions.
(Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372; see Pearson
v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1337.) "[T]he
protective role the court generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a
role to assure that whatever is done is in the minor's best interests . . . .
[I]ts primary concern is whether the compromise is sufficient to provide for
the minor's injuries, care and treatment." (Goldberg v. Superior Court
(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382.) The same protection applies for a disabled
person.
A petition for court approval of a compromise under
Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court
Rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. The petition must be verified by the petitioner
and contain a full disclosure of all information that has "any bearing
upon the reasonableness" of the compromise or the covenant. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.950.) The person compromising the claim on behalf of the person
who lacks capacity, and the represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise
of the claim unless the court for good cause dispenses with their personal
appearance. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952(a).) An order for deposit of funds
of a minor or person lacking decision-making capacity and a petition for the
withdrawal of such funds must comply with California Rules of Court Rules 7.953
and 7.954. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1384; see also Super. Ct. L.A. County,
Local Rules, rules 4.115-4.118.)
DISCUSSION
Form MC-350 (Rev. January 1, 2021)
The Amended Petition has been verified by Petitioner
and presented on a fully completed mandatory Judicial Council Form MC-350,
using the current January 1, 2021 revision. (Cal. Rule of Court Rule 7.950.) 
Settlement 
Claimant has agreed
to settle his claims with McKinley in exchange for $800,000.00, $375,520.24 of which will go to
Claimant. If approved, $320,000.00 will be paid in attorney’s fees, $64,479.76
will be paid for reimbursement of litigation costs advanced by Claimant’s
attorneys, and $40,000.00 will paid to Medi-Cal for medical expenses, leaving a
balance of $375,520.24 for Claimant. $43,000.00 of the proposed settlement will
be deposited into a special needs trust, while the remaining $332,520.24 will
be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity, subject to withdrawal only on
authorization of the Court. 
Court approval is required for
all settlements of a person with a disability. (Probate Code, §§ 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) The
Court has reviewed the proposed settlement and finds the Amended Petition
contains a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the
reasonableness of the settlement amount to Claimant and that the settlement
amount to Claimant is reasonable given Claimant's injuries and the medical
expenses incurred.
Notice
Probate Code Section 3611, subdivision (c), states: “Notice of the
time and place of the hearing and a copy of the petition shall be mailed to the
State Director of Health Care Services, the Director of State Hospitals, and
the Director of Developmental Services at the office of each director in Sacramento
at least 15 days before the hearing.” (Probate Code, § 3611, subd. (c).) The
Court notes that the proof of service attached to the September 9, 2024 notice
of ruling indicates it was served by mail, along with the amended petition and
corrected order, on the Direct of Developmental Services Legal Department,
California Department of Health Special Needs Unit, and Department of State.
The Court finds this sufficient.
Attorney's Fees 
The retained attorney's
information has been disclosed as required by Rule of Court 7.951. (Amended Petition,
¶ 17, subd. (b).) There is an agreement for services provided in connection
with the underlying claim. (Amended Petition, ¶ 17, subd. (a)(2).) Copies of
the agreements were submitted with the Petition as strictly required by Rule of
Court 7.951, subd. (6). (Amended Petition, Attach. 17a.) 
Petitioner’s counsel is seeking
to recover $320,000.00 in attorney's fees. (Amended Petition, ¶ 13, subd. (a),
Attach. 13a.) Counsel has provided a declaration addressing the reasonableness
of the fee request, as required by Rule of Court 7,995(c), accounting for the
factors specified in Rule of Court 7,955(b). CRC Rule 7.955(b) provides:
(b) Factors the court may
consider in determining a reasonable attorney's fee. In determining a
reasonable attorney's fee, the court may consider the following nonexclusive
factors:
(1) The fact that a minor or
person with a disability is involved and the circumstances of that minor or
person with a disability.
(2) The amount of the fee in
proportion to the value of the services performed.
(3) The novelty and difficulty of
the questions involved and the skill required to perform the legal services
properly.
(4) The amount involved and the
results obtained.
(5) The time limitations or
constraints imposed by the representative of the minor or person with a
disability or by the circumstances.
(6) The nature and length of the
professional relationship between the attorney and the representative of the
minor or person with a disability.
(7) The experience, reputation,
and ability of the attorney or attorneys performing the legal services.
(8) The time and labor required.
(9) The informed consent of the
representative of the minor or person with a disability to the fee.
(10) The relative sophistication
of the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a
disability.
(11) The likelihood, if apparent
to the representative of the minor or person with a disability when the
representation agreement was made, that the attorney's acceptance of the
particular employment would preclude other employment.
(12) Whether the fee is fixed,
hourly, or contingent.
(13) If the fee is contingent: 
(A) The risk of loss borne by the
attorney;
(B) The amount of costs advanced
by the attorney; and
(C) The delay in payment of fees
and reimbursement of costs paid by the attorney.
(14) Statutory requirements for
representation agreements applicable to particular cases or claims. 
(Cal. Rules of Court Rule 7.955(b).) The
Court addresses these factors below. 
Amount of Fee in Proportion to
Value of Services Performed 
Plaintiff's counsel contends that
an attorney fee of 40% of the sum recovered on behalf of the disabled claimant
is a reasonable fee in proportion to the services provided for more than three
years, and the result obtained, and reflects the market rate. (Ramey Decl., ¶¶ 9-15.) 
Novelty and Difficulty 
Petitioner’s counsel contends
that this area of law is both novel and difficult, and requires a different
level of skill and expertise. This case was even more complex because it deals
with a disabled and non-verbal client. Counsel states that the case required
extensive investigation, navigation of government claim filing requirements,
witness interviews, review of medical records, discovery, client meetings, and
communication, retention of three experts, in addition to court appearances and
drafting of documents. (Ramey Decl., ¶ 14.) 
Amount Involved and Results
Obtained 
Petitioner’s  counsel states that Defendant McKinley will
pay a total of $800,000.00. (Ramey Decl., ¶ 13.) 
Nature and Length of Professional
Relationship 
Plaintiff’s counsel has been
representing Plaintiff in this action since November of 2020. (Ramey Decl., ¶ 14,
subd. (6).) 
Experience, Reputation, and
Ability of Counsel 
Petitioner’s counsel states that she
has been practicing since 2000, and approximately 75% of her practice involves
representing minors in school bullying and abuse cases. Counsel has extensive
trial experience and is a frequent speaker and author on topics in this area of
the law. Counsel has also received numerous awards and recognitions. (Ramey
Decl.,  ¶ 14, subd. (7).) 
Time and Labor Required 
Petitioner’s counsel has been
working on this case for more than three years, and estimates having performed more
than 1000 hours of work on this case. (Ramey Decl., ¶ 14, subd. (8).) 
Acceptance of Case Precluding
Other Employment 
Petitioner’s counsel does not
address whether acceptance of this case precluded other employment. 
Contingent Fee 
Petitioner’s counsel states this
case was taken strictly on a contingency basis, and all costs and expenses, in
the total amount of $64,479.76 were borne by Petitioner’s counsel. (Ramey Decl.,
¶¶ 14, subds. (4), (13), (14).) 
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s
counsel has adequately demonstrated the reasonableness of the fee award in
light of the factors and circumstances in this case. 
Medical Bills 
Claimant has incurred $85,321.32
in medical expenses, but Medi-Cal has agreed to reduce its lien to $40,000.00.
(Amended Petition, ¶ 12, Attach. 12b(4)(c).) 
Costs 
Petitioner’s counsel seeks to
recover $6,675.50 in costs advanced by Ramey Law, PC and $57,804.26 in costs
advanced by Abir Cohen Treyzon Salo, LLP, for a total of $64,479.76 in costs. (Amended
Petition,  ¶ 13, subd. (b), Attach. 13b.) 
Amount to Be Paid to Claimant 
The net amount to be paid to claimant
D.C. is $375,520.24. (Amended Petition, ¶ 15.) 
Disposition of Balance of
Proceeds 
Petitioner requests that $43,000.00 of the net proceeds
be invested in a special needs trust (discussed more below), while the
remaining balance of $332,520.24
will be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity, subject to withdrawal
only on authorization of the Court. (Amended
Petition, ¶ 18, subds. (b)(3)-(b)(4), Attachs. 18b(3), 18b(4).)
Special Needs Trust
When approving the establishment or funding of a special needs
trust (SNT) from settlement proceeds, the Court must make the following
findings under Probate Code section 3604, subdivision (b), i.e., there are
factual allegations in the Amended Petition and its attachments supporting the
settlement that generally cover the requisite findings:
·        
The SNT beneficiary has a disability which substantially impairs
the individual’s ability to provide for his own care or custody and constitutes
a substantial handicap;
·        
The SNT beneficiary is likely to have special needs that will not
be met without the trust;
·        
The money to be paid to the trust does not exceed the amount that
appears reasonably necessary to meet the SNT beneficiary’s special needs.
The Court finds the proposed SNT meets the main requirements for
court created or funded trusts. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.903, subd. (c);
LASC, rule 4.116, subd. (b).) 
Trustee and Bond 
Normally, a bond must be required of a trustee unless the trustee
is a corporate fiduciary. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.903, subd. (c)(5);
Probate Code, § 2320.) The proposed trustee, Olivia Chambers, does not meet
that requirement. Thus, the Court will require a bond. 
Petitioner calculates a bond of $83,327.62. (Amended Petition,
Attach. 18b(4), p. 148 of pdf.) Petitioner’s corrected order rounds up to
$84,000.00, which the Court finds sufficient. (Proposed Order, Attach. 8(b)2),
Ex. 2, ¶ 7, p. 8 of pdf.) However, the Court notes that the corrected order
incorrectly indicates on paragraph 11 that a bond is not required. (Proposed
Order, ¶¶ 11.) The Court will modify this to require a bond in the amount of
$84,000.00. 
Prognosis 
Claimant has not recovered
completely from the effects of his injuries but has learned coping mechanisms.
(Amended Petition, ¶ 8.) 
Proposed Order MC-351 
Petitioner filed a Proposed Order
Form MC-351 for Claimant. 
Court Appearance 
California Rule of Court 7.952
requires attendance by the petitioner and claimant unless the court for good
cause dispenses with their personal appearance. The Court finds that the
appearance of the claimant is not required due to the nature of his disability.
However, the Court will require Petitioner’s appearance. 
Other Orders 
The Court will also require Petitioner to file a Notice of
Commencement of Proceedings for a Court Supervised Trust on LASC Form PRO 044
in the probate division of this Court within 60 days of this order. At the
hearing on the Amended Petition, the Court will also set a 14-month calendar
due date for the trustee’s first accounting to be filed in the probate case.
The Court will further set an OSC within approximately 60 days of this order to
ensure the funding of the settlement, submission of the bond, purchase of the
annuity, and the filing of LASC Form PRO 044 to open a trust supervision action
in probate. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds the settlement to
be fair and adequate. As the petition is procedurally in order, the Petition
for Approval of Compromise of Action for Person with a Disability is GRANTED. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Claimant D.C.’s amended petition for approval
of compromise of action for person with a disability. The Court will sign the
corrected order. For the sake of clarity, this order now supersedes the Court’s
prior order issued on August 14, 2024. 
The Court sets an OSC re proof of
funding of settlement, purchase of annuity, submission of bond, and filing of
LASC Form PRO 044 in the probate division of this Court for _____________,
2024, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 6 of this Court. 
The Court further sets a date of
_____________, 2025 for the trustee’s first accounting, to be filed in the
probate case. 
Petitioner is ordered to provide notice of the Court’s
ruling and file proof of service of same within five days of the Court’s order.
