The judge reduced the attorney fees request and costs request from the original amount of $14,958.58 because the court will not allow for more than 1 hour for appearances at court conferences and OSC hearings and will not include amounts billed for administrative work. The judge also deducted entries for filing documents, court appearances, and postage fees.
