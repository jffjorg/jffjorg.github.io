And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to determine the value of the subject property, but only in part. The court orders an appraisal of the property per Code of Civil Procedure section 874.316, subdivision (d), and will appoint a disinterested real estate appraiser licensed in the State of California. The court denies the motion without prejudice, meaning it can be re-filed, and sets a status conference to address the appointment of the appraiser. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
