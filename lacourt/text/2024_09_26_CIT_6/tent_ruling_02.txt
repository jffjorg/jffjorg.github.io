Jiajin Shi’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendant: Huirong Dai 
COURT RULING           
            Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice. Plaintiff should
correct the deficiencies discussed above and resubmit the default judgment
package prior to the OSC on September 26, 2024.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is a breach of contract case. On September 28, 2021, plaintiff Jiajin Shi
(Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Huirong Dai (Defendant) and
Does 1 through 50, alleging the sole cause of action for breach of contract. On
January 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint,
alleging the same cause of action for breach of contract against Defendant. 
            On
February 20, 2024, default was entered against Defendant.[1] On June 13, 2024, Plaintiff
dismissed the Doe Defendants. On July 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for
entry of default judgment.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendant in the total amount of $15,371,639.48,
including $15,370,324.43 in damages and $1,372.05 in costs. The Court finds three
defects with Plaintiff’s default judgment package. First, Plaintiff’s
declaration is dated July 14, 2022, which is prior to the operative First Amended
Complaint being filed and prior to the default being entered. Second, Plaintiff
did not attach a copy of the subject contract to his declaration, even though
it is mentioned and referenced therein as Exhibit A. (See Shi Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff’s
declaration alone is not sufficient to prove damages. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
585, subd. (b) [“the court shall hear the evidence offered by the plaintiff and
shall render judgment in the plaintiff’s favor for that relief, not exceeding
the amount stated in the complaint… as appears by the evidence to be just.”];
see also Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (8) [plaintiff must provide exhibits
as necessary].) While liability is admitted on default, proof is still required
to support the damages requested. (Carlsen v. Koivumaki (2014) 227
Cal.App.4th 879, 898.) It is also not enough that a copy of the contract is
attached to the First Amended Complaint since it is not authenticated. (Cf. Kim
v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 288
[declarations found to be “useless as evidence” where they were unintelligible
and lacked foundation].) 
Third, it is unclear exactly what
Plaintiff means in the memorandum of costs regarding “Private Investigation
Fee” for $499.00. (CIV-100, ¶ 7, subd. (d).) Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5 does not clearly provide that as a recoverable cost. In fact, it is
specifically not recoverable as a trial preparation cost. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5, subds. (b)(2), (b)(4).) If it was incurred to locate Defendant for
purposes of effecting service of process, that would be permissible. (Id.,
§ 1033.5, subd. (a)(4)(B).) The Court requests Plaintiff to provide further
details on this charge when reapplying for default judgment. 
CONCLUSION 
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice. Plaintiff should
correct the deficiencies discussed above and resubmit the default judgment
package prior to the OSC on September 26, 2024.
