And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to quash a subpoena issued to JPMorgan Chase by the defendants in a case brought by Allstate Insurance Company against Jaklin Benji and others. The defendants argue that the subpoena is overbroad, violates their privacy rights, and is unduly burdensome, but the court finds that the discovery sought is directly relevant to the issues in the case and is not overbroad. The court notes that the plaintiff has demonstrated a legitimate interest in discovering documents that are relevant to its claims and that the categories sought are not overly broad in light of the circumstances and allegations in the complaint. The court declines to award expenses to the parties and orders the third-party to turn over all documents consistent with the subpoena.
