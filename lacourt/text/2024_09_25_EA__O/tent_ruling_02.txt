[1] According to CACI No. 730, Vehicle
Code section 21055 applies when the officer fails to operate his vehicle “with
reasonable care, taking into account the emergency situation.” (CACI No. 730.)
The statute applies in situations wherein the driver of an authorized emergency
vehicle does not give the prescribed warnings by red light and
siren. (See e.g., Grant v. Petronella (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 281, 286; City
of Sacramento v. Superior Court (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 395; Peerless
Laundry Serv. v. City of Los Angeles (1952) 109 Cal.App.2d 703, 707; see
also Cruz v. Briseno (2000) 22 Cal.4th 568, 573 [“[T]here is a triable issue of fact regarding whether
Briseno activated his lights and siren and is thereby entitled to immunity
under section 17004.”].)

[3] With that, any
attempts at holding Montclair vicariously liable through Government Code
section 815.2(a) are moot as leave to amend is given for Plaintiffs to allege
facts as to Officer Mackey’s purported negligence.  
 


[4] Montclair also
(briefly) asserts that it is afforded liability under Government Code section
845.8 (Demurrer p. 1:17-19); the opposition does not address this statute. As relevant here, section 845.8 provides:
“Neither a public entity nor a public employee is liable for: [¶] ... [¶](b)
Any injury caused by: … [¶](3) A person resisting arrest.” As Montclair has not
provided a meaningful analysis on the statute, the statute will not be
discussed in this ruling. (See Cahill v. San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (2011)
194 Cal.App.4th 939, 956 [absence of a legal cogent or reasoned argument is
waived].)   
 


[5] As there are no facts as to
individual employees or officers of Pomona who were allegedly negligent,
Pomona’s liability turns on the entity’s negligence. With that, it is unclear
whether Government Code section 815.2(a) applies as to the city of Pomona.
The opposition does not address the lack of facts as to identifying a City of
Pomona employee/officer. 
 


[6] Though Pomona cites to the appellate case (14 Cal.App.5th
811). 


[7] This portion of the
opinion cites to Nguyen v. City of Westminster (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th
1161, 1167 which provides the following language: “In effect, plaintiffs argue defendant is not entitled to immunity
because Ingwerson failed to comply with the pursuit policy on this
occasion. The case law has rejected this argument. “The statute is clear:
if the agency adopts a pursuit policy which meets the statutory requirements,
then immunity results. The extent to which the policy was implemented in
general and was followed in the particular pursuit is irrelevant. ... We reject
as insubstantial appellants' argument that the immunity statute is ‘unlawful,
if not unconstitutional,’ unless given a saving construction that immunity in
each case depends on proof the pursuit policy was implemented in general and on
the particular occasion.” (Id. at p. 1168-69.)

4 citing McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457,
1491 [“A plaintiff may not avoid a demurrer by
pleading facts or positions in an amended complaint that contradict the facts
pleaded in the original complaint or by suppressing facts which prove the
pleaded facts false.”].)
