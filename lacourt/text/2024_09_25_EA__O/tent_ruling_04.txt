Code section 3852.
 
On June 4, 2024, Plaintiff Sentry Insurance Company filed
suit against SWP Express, LLC. 
 
On August 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. That
same day, Wei Lang was named as Doe 1. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff brings forth the motion pursuant to the Code of
Civil Procedure section 397(a) on the grounds that this is not the proper
court. More specifically, Plaintiff explains that at the time the complaint was
filed, Plaintiff presumed the accident happened in the city of La Verne, which
is in Los Angeles County. However, the traffic collision report indicated that
the accident happened in Chino, California, which is in San Bernardino County.
Moreover, Plaintiff later learned that the injured employee filed his own
lawsuit based upon the same accident in San Bernardino County.[2] 
 
Here, as the underlying accident happened in San Bernardino
County, venue is proper there. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is granted.
