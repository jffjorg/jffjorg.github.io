And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The motion was filed by Alex Alvarado and Patricia Alvarado, who are seeking to amend their complaint to include additional causes of action against the Ridgeview Saugus Homeowners Association, Michael Meadows, and Althea Meadows.

The judge finds that the proposed amendments are not new claims, but rather evidence of whether the defendants violated the governing documents. The judge also notes that the parties have already conducted discovery on the issues proposed to be added, and that there is no need for a trial continuance.

The judge orders the plaintiffs to file the First Amended Complaint separately, which is attached to the motion as Exhibit 1. The judge also notes that the new trial date should be scheduled to allow sufficient time for all defendants to challenge the new claims and conduct any additional discovery they deem necessary.
