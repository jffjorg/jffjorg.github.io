And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion filed by the defendant, William S. Hart Union High School District, seeking judgment on the pleadings in favor of the district on the plaintiff's entire First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, John Doe, alleges causes of action for negligent hiring, supervision and retention of unfit employee, breach of mandatory duty: failure to report suspected child abuse, negligent supervision of a minor, and negligent failure to warn, train or educate against the district.

The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred because recent amendments to CCP 340.1 and Government Code 905, through Assembly Bill 218 (AB 218), cannot constitutionally operate to revive already unenforceable claims that were subject to claims presentation requirements. However, the judge disagrees, finding that AB 218 does not violate the California Constitution.

The judge concludes that AB 218 removes the requirement of filing a government claim before initiating a court action against a public entity, such as the district, and that this does not create liability or a new claim. The judge also finds that the Legislature's revival of a previously time-barred claim or retroactive elimination of a condition precedent for seeking relief in court merely alleviates a barrier which it had created for the enforcement of liability, and that this does not constitute a gift of public money.
