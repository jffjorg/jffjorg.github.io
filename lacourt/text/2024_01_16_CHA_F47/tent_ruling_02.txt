SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises from allegations that Plaintiff John
Doe (Plaintiff) was sexually abused in the 1980s by his junior high school
teacher, Defendant Marguerite Lagnado (Lagnado), an employee of Defendant
William S. Hart Union High School District (the District) at the time.
 
On 5/4/22, Plaintiff filed this action against the
District, Lagnado and Doe Defendants. 
The operative First Amended Complaint contains causes of action for Negligent
Hiring, Supervision and Retention of Unfit Employee (3rd cause of
action), Breach of Mandatory Duty: Failure to Report Suspected Child Abuse (4th
cause of action), Negligent Supervision of a Minor (5th cause of
action), and Negligent Failure to Warn, Train or Educate (6th cause
of action) against the District.  Lagnado
is currently in default.  On 11/28/23,
the District filed and served the instant motion seeking an order granting
judgment on the pleadings in its favor on Plaintiff’s entire First Amended
Complaint.  Plaintiff has opposed the
motion and the District has filed a reply to the opposition.   
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) is
granted.  
 
The District argues that Plaintiff’s claims against it
are time-barred because recent amendments to CCP 340.1 and Government Code 905
through Assembly Bill 218 (AB 218) cannot constitutionally operate to revive
already unenforceable claims that were subject to claims presentation
requirements.  The District argues that
AB 218 violates Article XVI, Section 6 of the California Constitution, which
prohibits gifts of public funds for private purposes, through its provisions
stripping the District of statutory governmental immunity.  This Court disagrees.  
 
CCP 340.1 governs the period in which a plaintiff must
bring a tort claim based on childhood sexual abuse.  Quarry (2012) 53 C4th 945, 952.  Government Code 905(m) removes claims for
childhood sexual abuse/assault pursuant to CCP 340.1 from the government claim
presentation requirement.  AB 218 further
extended the statute of limitations to 22 years from the age of majority (40
years old) or five years from when the plaintiff discovered the injury or
should have.  CCP 340.1(a).  AB 218 also amended Government Code 905 by
retroactively expanding the exemption for CCP 340.1, including the exemption
from the claim requirement to all claims involving childhood sexual assault and
eliminating the language under Government Code 905 that previously limited this
exemption to prospective claims “arising out of conduct occurring on or after
January 1, 2009.” K.M. (2022) 84 CA5th 717, 736; Government Code
905(p).   
 
The main question to consider when determining whether an
appropriation of public money constitutes a prohibited gift is whether the
funds are to be used for a public or a private purpose; if the money is for a
public purpose, there is no gift even though private persons benefit from the
expenditure.  Los Angeles County v.
LaFuente (1942) 20 C2d 870, 876-877; County of Alameda v. Janssen
(1940) 16 C2d 276, 281; County of Alameda v. Carleson (1971) 5 C3d 730,
745-746; California House Finance Agency v. Elliott (1976) 17 C3d 575,
582-586; Jordan (2002) 100 CA4th 431, 441; Board of Supervisors v.
Dolan (1975) 45 CA3d 237, 243.  It
has further been held that “the determination of what constitutes a public
purpose is primarily a matter for the Legislature, and its discretion will not
be disturbed by the courts so long as that determination has a reasonable
basis.”  Carleson, supra at
746; See also Elliott, supra at 583.
 
The District has not established that AB 218’s revival of
a previously time-barred claim and retroactive elimination of the requirement
to file a government tort claim in childhood sexual abuse cases constitutes a
“gift” of public money for liability that otherwise does not exist.  Most of the cases relied on by the District
involve a specific appropriation of public funds for a specific person or
entity.  See Bourn (1982)
93 Cal 321, 326-328; Conlin (1893) 99 Cal 17, 21; Jordan, supra.  Here, there is no allocation of any
amount.  Further, Plaintiff’s recovery
depends on the existence of a cognizable claim and is, therefore, not a gift.
 
At the time Plaintiff was allegedly sexually abused,
liability against the District existed. 
The fact that Plaintiff did not submit a government claim within six
months after the last incident of abuse merely affected his remedy to seek
relief from the District for that existing liability.  AB 218 did not create new liability but
rather removed the requirement of filing a government claim before initiating a
court action against a public entity, such as the District.  The foregoing does not violate the gift
clause in the California Constitution nor does it create liability or a new
claim.  See Chapman (1894)
104 Cal. 690, 692-694, 696; See also Coats (2020) 46 CA5th 415, 424-428.
 
Coats involved revival of a cause of action barred
by a claim presentation requirement, not a statute of limitations wherein the
Court of Appeal found no reason the Legislature should be any less able to
revive claims in such context, as it expressly did in AB 218.  Coats, supra at 428; See
also Roman Catholic Bishop of Oakland (2005) 128 CA4th 1155, 1161; Liebig
(1989) 209  CA3d 828, 830; Deutsch
(2008) 164  CA4th 748, 760.  The Legislature’s revival of a time-barred
claim or retroactive elimination of a condition precedent for seeking relief in
court  merely alleviates a barrier which
it had created for the enforcement of liability.  Such action does not create an entitlement to
money that a party never had a legal right to obtain and is, therefore, not a
gift.  The cases relied on by the
District involve circumstances where the Legislative action at issue allocated
public money to parties where no liability previously existed.  See Bourne, supra at
326-328; Conlin, supra at 21; Powell (1903) 138 Cal 271,
271-272.  
 
As noted above, even if the amendments in AB 218
constitute the allocation of public money for a claim where no liability
previously existed, the Legislature may do so for a public purpose.  See Conlin, supra at 22;
Conlin (1896) 114 Cal 404, 410; Veterans’ Welfare Board (1922)
188 Cal 607, 610; Oakland (1924) 194 Cal 298, 302-303; LaFuente, supra
at 876-877.  It has been held that the
public policy behind AB 218 and its retroactive effect is manifest from the
text of the law and its legislative history. 
See Liebig, supra at 834; (RJN, Ex.1, pp.1-2; Ex.2,
p.5. p.8; Ex.6, pp.1-2; Ex.8, p.5, p.7).
