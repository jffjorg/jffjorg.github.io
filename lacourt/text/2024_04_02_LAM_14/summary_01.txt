And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial by six months, but only in part. The trial will be continued to April 15, 2024, with a final status conference set for April 2, 2024. The judge has denied the plaintiff's request to continue the trial and discovery deadlines, citing the lack of good cause for a continuance. The judge has noted that the case has been ongoing for over four years, and the plaintiff has had ample time to conduct discovery. The judge has also criticized the plaintiff's counsel for failing to seek discovery and for making false representations to the court. Despite this, the judge has granted a brief continuance due to the court's current trial schedule.
