 Case Number:  22STCV21977    Hearing Date:   April 2, 2024    Dept:  14 Corbin v. NormandieCase Background
 
Plaintiffs allege that their
landlords rented them an apartment that had a terrible mold problem. They allege
that before the issues were resolved, the landlords sold the property.
Plaintiffs allege that the new landlords did not completely fix the problem and
ultimately evicted them in retaliation for their complaints.

            On March 17,
2023, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) for (1) Tortious
Breach of the Implied Warranty of Habitability, (2) Breach of the Implied Warranty
of Habitability, (3) Nuisance (Negligent), (4) Nuisance (Intentional), (5)
Negligence, (6) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (“IIED”), (7) Breach
of Implied Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment, and (8) Premises Liability against
Defendants 720 Normandie LP, 720 Normandie Partnership, Inc. (collectively “Normandie”),
Prana Investments (“Prana”), Prana Holding Company, LLC, Vine Property
Services, Inc. (“Vine”), Citywide Property Management and Consulting Inc., erroneously
sued as “Kim & Casey Property Management” (“Citywide”), Statewide
Enterprises, Inc. (“Statewide”), Defendants Jamison Services, Inc. (“Jamison”),
709 S. Mariposa Ave., LLC (“Mariposa”), and DOES 4-50.
 
            On July 26,
2023, this court sustained the demurrer of Defendants Prana, Citywide, and
Statewide to the third and eighth causes of action, without leave to amend. On
the same date, this court sustained the demurrer of Defendants Normandie,
Jamison, and Vine to the third cause of action, without leave to amend.
 
            On August
1, 2023, Defendants Prana and Statewide filed their joint Answer.
 
            On August
7, 2023, Defendants Normandie and Jamison filed their joint Answer.
 
            On August
9, 2023, Defendant Vine filed its Answer.
 
            On August
11, 2023, Defendant Citywide filed its Answer.
 
Defendants Prana Holding Company,
LLC was served with the original complaint on October 14, 2022. Defendant Mariposa
was served with the original complaint on December 5, 2022. There is no proof
of service indicating that either defendant has been served with the FAC. Neither
has filed any sort of responsive pleading. 
 
On October 21, 2022, the personal
injury courts found that the case was erroneously filed in the personal injury
hub. The case was reassigned to Judge Stephanie Bowick, sitting in Department
19 of Stanley Mosk Courthouse. On November 8, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a
peremptory challenge and the case was reassigned to this department.
 
            Jury trial
is currently set for May 13, 2024.
 
Instant Motions
            
Plaintiffs
and Defendants now move this court for an order continuing trial by six months.
 
Decision
 
            The motions are GRANTED. Trial is continued to November
12, 2024, at 9:00 am. Final Status Conference is continued to October 30, 2024,
at 10:00 am. All counsel and any unrepresented parties are to be present in
person at the Final Status Conference. All discovery and other deadlines are to
track with the new date.
 
Discussion
 
California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1332(a) provides that trial dates are to be treated as
firm. However, Rule 3.1332(c) provides that, although continuances are “disfavored,”
requests should be considered on an individual basis. That subsection also
includes a non-exhaustive list of possible grounds for a continuance.
 
            The parties base their motion on the facts that Defendants
wish to file a motion for summary judgment and Plaintiffs fired their counsel
on February 1, 2024. The first is not good cause for a continuance. The second
is. 
 
            All parties have a statutory right to a hearing on a
timely filed motion for summary judgment. Cole v. Superior Court (2022)
87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88. However, that right comes with the obligation
to proceed with diligence and file the motion timely. The court is not obliged
to re-set trial because the parties were not ready to file for summary judgment
in time.
 
            However, the last-minute termination of counsel is good cause
for a continuance. Plaintiffs’ counsel were terminated by letter dated February
1, 2024. Plaintiffs have had two months to obtain new counsel and have not done
so. Nevertheless, it is possible that potential new counsel were discouraged by
the imminent trial date. And more importantly, no other party could address
themselves to Plaintiffs while their counsel of record awaited a hearing date
on their motion to be relieved. It is in everyone’s interest that Plaintiffs
have a little more time to obtain counsel.
 
Conclusion
 
            Because Plaintiff’s counsel were recently terminated and
time is necessary for the parties to adjust to that new reality, the motions are
GRANTED. Trial is continued to November 12, 2024, at 9:00 am. Final Status Conference
is continued to October 30, 2024, at 10:00 am. All counsel and any
unrepresented parties are to be present in person at the Final Status
Conference. All discovery and other deadlines are to track with the new date.
