And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Ruiz and Jacob Emrani. The Judge has denied both motions, citing the failure of Plaintiffs to make a reasonable attempt to meet and confer with Defense before filing the motions. The Judge has made it clear that email exchanges are not a substitute for live conversation and that Plaintiffs' demands for dates were not reasonable. The Judge has also stated that this is a matter that can be resolved with a phone call, not a motion. The case is set for a jury trial on June 3, 2024.
