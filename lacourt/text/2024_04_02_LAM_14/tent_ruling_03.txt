Plaintiffs allege that their
landlords rented them an apartment that had a terrible mold problem. They allege
that before the issues were resolved, the landlords sold the property.
Plaintiffs allege that the new landlords did not completely fix the problem and
ultimately evicted them in retaliation for their complaints.

            On March 17,
2023, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) for (1) Tortious
Breach of the Implied Warranty of Habitability, (2) Breach of the Implied Warranty
of Habitability, (3) Nuisance (Negligent), (4) Nuisance (Intentional), (5)
Negligence, (6) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (“IIED”), (7) Breach

Defendants 720 Normandie LP, 720 Normandie Partnership, Inc. (collectively “Normandie”),

sued as “Kim & Casey Property Management” (“Citywide”), Statewide
Enterprises, Inc. (“Statewide”), Defendants Jamison Services, Inc. (“Jamison”),
709 S. Mariposa Ave., LLC (“Mariposa”), and DOES 4-50.
 
            On July 26,
2023, this court sustained the demurrer of Defendants Prana, Citywide, and
Statewide to the third and eighth causes of action, without leave to amend. On
the same date, this court sustained the demurrer of Defendants Normandie,

Defendants Prana Holding Company,
LLC was served with the original complaint on October 14, 2022. Defendant Mariposa
was served with the original complaint on December 5, 2022. There is no proof
of service indicating that either defendant has been served with the FAC. Neither
has filed any sort of responsive pleading. 
 
On October 21, 2022, the personal
injury courts found that the case was erroneously filed in the personal injury
hub. The case was reassigned to Judge Stephanie Bowick, sitting in Department
19 of Stanley Mosk Courthouse. On November 8, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a
peremptory challenge and the case was reassigned to this department.
 
            Jury trial
is currently set for May 13, 2024.
 
Instant Motions
            
Attorney Mark L. Venardi (“Venardi”)
now seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiffs. 
 
Decision
 
            The motions
are GRANTED, effective upon the
filing of the proof of service of the signed orders upon the clients. 
 
Governing Rule
 
            California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 requires that counsel fill out forms MC-051, MC-052,
and MC-053. These forms serve two basic functions: (1) ensuring that notice is
given to the client and (2) providing the court with an adequate explanation of
why the matter is being handled via motion rather than mutual consent. See Code
of Civil Procedure § 284; California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362.
 
Discussion
 
            Counsel Vendardi
has completed the required forms. Those forms indicate that the client has been
served by mail at the most recent address counsel can find. 
 
            Counsel Venardi
indicates that he and his firm wish to withdraw because the clients have fired
them, but refuse to sign a substitution form.
 
            Counsel has
complied with the requirements of Rule 3.1362, and relief is appropriate under
the circumstances of this case. The motions are GRANTED, effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed
orders upon the clients.
