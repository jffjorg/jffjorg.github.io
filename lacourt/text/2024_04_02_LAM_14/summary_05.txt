Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Defendant Excell's motion to stay the case and compel arbitration. The Plaintiff, Alma Loaiza, had signed an agreement stating that any dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration, but the agreement does not comply with California law requiring specific language and formatting. The Judge finds that the agreement violates Code of Civil Procedure § 1295(a) and (b) and therefore cannot be enforced.
