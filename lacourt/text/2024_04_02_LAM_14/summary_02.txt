```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motions for continuance, pushing back the trial date to November 12, 2024, and the final status conference to October 30, 2024. The delay is due to the recent termination of the plaintiffs' counsel and the need for the parties to adjust to this new reality. The judge notes that California Rules of Court Rule 3.1332(c) provides that requests for continuances should be considered on an individual basis, and that the last-minute termination of counsel is good cause for a continuance. The judge also cites Cole v. Superior Court (2022) in support of the ruling, noting that parties have a statutory right to a hearing on a timely filed motion for summary judgment, but that this right comes with the obligation to proceed with diligence and file the motion timely.
