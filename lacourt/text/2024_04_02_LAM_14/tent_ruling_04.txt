 Case Number:  22STCV36251    Hearing Date:   April 2, 2024    Dept:  14 Ghermezian v. RuizCase Background
 
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants
hired them to do legal work on their behalf for which they have refused to pay.
 
            On October
25, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) for (1) Breach
of Contract, (2) Declaratory Relief, (3) Quantum Meruit, (4) Unjust Enrichment,
(5) Money Had and Received, (6) Conversion, and (7) Intentional Interference
with Contract against Defendants Dorlinda Ruiz (“Ruiz”), Law Offices of Jacob Emrani,
APC (“Emrani Firm”), and DOES 1-100.
 
            The first
three causes of action are asserted against Defendant Ruiz only. The seventh
cause of action is asserted against Defendant Emrani Firm only.
 
            On December
5, 2023, Defendants Ruiz and Emrani Firm filed their joint Answer.
 
            On January
26, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an “Amendment to Complaint” substituting Defendant
Karina Padua (“Padua”) in lieu of DOE 1.
 
            On February
13, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an “Amendment to Complaint” substituting Defendant Jacob
Emrani in lieu of DOE 2.
 
            On March 25,
2024, Plaintiffs filed an “Amendment to Complaint” substituting Defendant Jacob
Emrani, Esq. in lieu of DOE 3.
 
            No proof
of service has been filed indicating that individual Defendants Padua and Jacob
Emrani have been served.
 
            Jury trial
is currently set for June 3, 2024.
 
(1)       Deposition
of Ruiz
 
Plaintiffs now move this court for
an order compelling Defendant Dorlinda Ruiz to sit for deposition. Plaintiffs
also seek sanctions in the amount of $1,660.00.
 
Decision
 
The motion is DENIED.
 
Discussion
 
            As the
court said in its ruling on a previous discovery issue, this is a matter for a
phone call, not a motion. Plaintiffs noticed the deposition at issue here on
December 29, 2023. (Declaration of Raymond Ghermezian Exhibit A). On January 12,
2024, Defendant Ruiz served objections based on (1) the unilateral scheduling
of the deposition, (2) the setting of the deposition on a holiday, (3)
vagueness in the notice and an apparent conflict, (4) timeliness, (5)
attorney-client privilege, and (6) privacy. (Id. Exhibit B).
 
            On January
18, 2024, Plaintiffs emailed Defense counsel to demand available dates. (Id.
Exhibit C). Further email exchanges resulted merely in reiterated demands for
dates from Plaintiffs, accusations of bad faith from Defense, threats of
motions to compel, and sarcastic wishes of good luck. (Id. Exhibits C-E). 
 
            This court
has made clear that it does not consider email as an adequate substitute for
live conversation. Emails are useful to document, not replace, phone calls and
meetings. And no court could consider Plaintiffs brusque, single-sentence
demands for dates as a reasonable attempt to address the objections raised by Defense.
Therefore, Plaintiffs have failed to comply with Code of Civil Procedure
§ 2025.450(b)(2).
 
Conclusion
 
            Because Plaintiffs
failed to make a reasonable attempt to meet and confer with Defense, the motion
is DENIED.
 
(2)       Deposition
of Jacob Emrani
 
Plaintiffs now move this court for
an order compelling Defendant Jacob Emrani to sit for deposition. Plaintiffs
also seek sanctions in the amount of $2,860.00.
 
Decision
 
            The motion
is DENIED.
