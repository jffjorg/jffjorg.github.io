And here is the English-text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling addresses the procedural history of the case, directing Plaintiffs to its previous ruling on their motion for reconsideration. The Court notes that the opposition's response was unclear about the issue with the scope of the examination, as it was primarily focused on the raw data. The Court also references footnote 7 of its previous tentative ruling, which highlighted the unclear opposition. The Court's ruling is intended to clarify the scope of the examination and the requirements for an "independent medical evaluation".
