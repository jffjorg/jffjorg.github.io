And here is the English text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Hector Trigueros, brought a lawsuit against Ford Motor Company and Fritts Ford for various claims related to a 2019 Ford F-150 with a defective transmission. The defendants demurred to the 5th and 6th causes of action, alleging that they fail to state a cause of action and are barred by the economic loss rule. The court sustained the demurrer as to the 5th COA for Negligent Repair, finding that the plaintiff failed to plead the essential element of damages. The court also sustained the demurrer as to the 6th COA for Fraudulent Inducement - Concealment, finding that the plaintiff failed to plead specific allegations showing that the defendant had exclusive knowledge of the transmission defect and actively concealed it. The court granted leave to amend the pleading to address the demurrer.
