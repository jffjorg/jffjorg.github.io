On February 23, 2024, Defendants filed the instant demurrer.

 
On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed his opposition. 
 
On April 8, 2024, Defendants filed their reply.
 
Discussion
 
Defendants demur to the 5th COA for negligent
repair and 6th COA for Fraudulent Inducement - Concealment on the
grounds that both fail to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action
and are otherwise barred by the economic loss rule.
 
Fraud COA
 
“[T]he
elements of a cause of action for fraud based on concealment are: ‘“(1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.”’” (Jones v. ConocoPhillips
Co. (2011) 198 Cal. App. 4th 1187, 1198, quoting Kaldenbach v. Mutual of
Omaha Life Ins. Co. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 830, 850). 
 
As for
pleading the fourth element of inducement, “mere
conclusionary allegations that the omissions were intentional and for the
purpose of defrauding and deceiving plaintiffs and bringing about the purchase
... and that plaintiffs relied on the omissions in making such purchase are
insufficient [to show fraud by concealment].” (Linear Tech. Corp. v.
Applied Materials, Inc. (2007) 152 Cal. App. 4th 115, 132.) Additionally,
as for pleading fraud against a corporate defendant, “it was necessary for him to allege the name of the person who spoke,
his authority to speak, to whom he spoke, what he said or wrote, and when it
was said or written.” (Mason v. Drug, Inc. (1939) 31 Cal.App.3d 697,
703.) Thus, absent pleading facts to support the elements above without
specificity, will not be presumed. (Mason v. Drug Inc. (1939) 31
Cal.App.2d 697, 703; see also Tenet Healthsystem Desert, Inc. v. Blue Cross
of California (2016) 245 Cal. App. 4th 821, 838, quoting Lazar v.
Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638 [“[F]raud must be pled
specifically; general and conclusory allegations do not suffice. Thus, ‘the
policy of liberal construction of the pleadings ... will not ordinarily be
invoked to sustain a pleading defective in any material respect.’”].)
 
The 6th COA alleges, in pertinent part, that
Defendant “was well aware and knew that the transmission installed in the
Vehicle was defective but failed to disclose this fact to the Plaintiff at the
time of the sale and thereafter …[Defendant] acquired its knowledge of the
Transmission Defect prior to Plaintiff acquiring the Subject Vehicle, through
sources not available to consumers such as Plaintiff, including but not limited
to pre-production and postproduction testing data, early consumer complaints
about the transmission defect made directly to FMC and its network of dealers,
aggregate warranty data compiled from FMC's network of dealers, testing
conducted by FMC in response to these complaints, as well warranty repair and
part replacements data received by FMC from FMC's network of dealers, amongst
other sources of internal information. (Complaint p. 6.)
 
Here, the court requests that Plaintiff amend its pleading
to specifically provide, rather than incorporating by reference, what specific
allegations show Defendant had exclusive knowledge of the Transmission
Defect and what specific allegations show that Ford actively
concealed said Transmission Defect. (See e.g., Demurrer p. 14.) And upon
amendment, the amended complaint should only reference relevant defects.
For example, the vehicle purchased is a 2019 F-150; thus, it is unclear how
technical service bulletins ("TSBs") concerning a 2017 F-150 or even
TSBs referencing a Ford Raptor are relevant. (See Complaint ¶26.) Based
thereon, the court need not reach Defendant’s other arguments such as whether
the economic loss rule applies. 
 
Therefore, the demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend as
to the 6th COA. 
 
5th COA for Negligent Repair
 
To state a viable claim for negligent repair, a plaintiff
need allege that the repair facility (1) owed a duty to use ordinary care and
skill, (2) breached its duty, (3) caused damage to the plaintiff, and (4) that
this was causation of damages. (Lytle v. Ford Motor Co. (E.D.Cal. 2018)
2018 WL 4793800; citing Burgess v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1064,
1072; see also Def.’s Memo, p. 21, ln. 12-13, [duty, breach, causation, and
damages].)
 
Defendants demur, on one ground, that this COA fails because
to plead the essential element of damages (e.g., out-of-pocket expenses, or any
other monetary losses or property damage he may have sustained).
 
The opposition appears to concede the need for clarity in
the pleading as Plaintiff argues that the “Complaint does not affirmatively
disclose that the damages alleged are only economic losses such as prospective
economic advantage, and not other damages such as property damage (i.e., to the
car itself).” (Opp. p. 14:10-12.) 
 
Therefore, the court sustains the demurrer as to the 5th
COA. The court need not address Defendant’s other arguments such as whether the
economic loss rule applies. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer is sustained with leave
to amend.
