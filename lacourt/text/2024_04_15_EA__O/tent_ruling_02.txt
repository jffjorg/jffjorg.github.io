[1] By way of this
order, Plaintiff will again be a pro se litigant. It is well-established that a
pro per litigant is held to the same restrictive rules of procedure as an
attorney. (Grabowski v.
Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc., 64 Cal. App. 5th 67, 75 n.2, 278 Cal.
Rptr. 3d 553 (4th Dist. 2021).) Effectively,
pro se status does not excuse intentional noncompliance with
discovery rules and court orders. Failure to abide by the rules of
discovery in bad faith may warrant dismissal or terminating sanctions. A
party's failure to respond to discovery and to comply with a judge's orders
compelling discovery provides ample grounds for imposing a terminating
sanction. (Jerry’s Shell v. Equilon Enters., LLC (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th
1058; see also Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
967; see also Del Junco v. Hufnagel (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 789
[terminating sanctions warranted when it “became obvious” that party had no
intention of answering discovery, filing proper and timely papers, or complying
with judge's orders).].)
