And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiffs' motion to vacate and reconsider the court's orders granting defendants' motion for leave to conduct psychological evaluations of plaintiffs. The court found that the plaintiffs are attempting to reargue the merits of the motion, which should have been done in opposition to the motion to quash. The court's ruling is based on the fact that there are no new or different facts, circumstances, or law presented. The plaintiffs' motion is denied, and the court's previous orders remain in effect.
