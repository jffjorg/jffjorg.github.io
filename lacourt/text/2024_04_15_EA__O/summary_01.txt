And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Plaintiff's Counsel Andrew Twietmeyer's motion to be relieved as counsel. The court finds that despite assurances from Counsel Twietmeyer, Plaintiff has failed to provide promised discovery documents, including those produced after the January 2023 deposition. The court notes that Counsel Twietmeyer's failure to communicate with his client and obtain the necessary documents suggests that the Plaintiff is responsible for the delays. The court concludes that Counsel Twietmeyer's continued representation would not provide the necessary relief, and therefore grants the motion.
