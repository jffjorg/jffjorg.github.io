And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

By this order, the plaintiff will remain a pro se litigant, meaning they will continue to represent themselves in court without the assistance of an attorney. It is well-established that a pro se litigant is held to the same strict rules of procedure as an attorney. If a party fails to comply with discovery rules and court orders in bad faith, it may result in the imposition of terminating sanctions. The judge may dismiss the case or impose harsh penalties if a party fails to respond to discovery and comply with court orders.
