Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike certain allegations from the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant, Blue Cross of California dba Anthem Blue Cross, had demurred to the plaintiff's first three causes of action, alleging that the complaint was uncertain and failed to state a claim. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the complaint adequately apprises the defendant of the claims against it.

The defendant also moved to strike certain allegations regarding punitive damages, but the judge has denied this motion as well. The judge found that the allegations alleged sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages, including the defendant's alleged conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights.

The judge has also denied the defendant's motion to strike paragraph 24 of the complaint, which alleges that the defendant has a systemic problem of failing to recognize, properly investigate, and resolve member grievances. The judge found that these allegations are relevant to the plaintiff's claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

Overall, the judge has allowed the plaintiff's complaint to proceed, finding that it adequately states a claim and raises triable issues of fact.
