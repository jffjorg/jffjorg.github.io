MOVING PARTY:                 Court, on its own motion        
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Artem Gerashchenkov, as plaintiff in the unlawful detainer case

Order to Show Cause why the court should not (1)
reconsider and vacate (i) its September 29, 2023 order deeming the Unlawful
Detainer Action and Civil Action related, (ii) its September 29, 2023 order
reassigning the Unlawful Detainer Action to Department 53 at the Stanley Mosk
Courthouse, (iii) its September 29, 2023 order consolidating the Unlawful
Detainer Action and Civil Action for all purposes, and (iv) its March 5, 2024
order reclassifying the Unlawful Detainer Action as a civil unlimited case, and
(2) issue a new order (i) finding that the Unlawful Detainer Action and Civil
Action are not related, (ii) denying the request to consolidate the Unlawful
Detainer Action and Civil Action for all purposes, and (iii) leaving the
Unlawful Detainer Action as a limited unlawful detainer case
In Martin-Bragg v. Moore (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 367, 385, the
Court of Appeal stated:  “[T]he trial
court has the power to consolidate an unlawful detainer proceeding with a
simultaneously pending action in which title to the property is in issue.  That is because a successful claim of title
by the tenant would defeat the landlord’s right to possession.  [Citation.] When an unlawful detainer
proceeding and an unlimited action concerning title to the property are
simultaneously pending, the trial court in which the unlimited action is
pending may stay the unlawful detainer action until the issue of title is
resolved in the unlimited action, or it may consolidate the actions.  [Citation.]” 
Thus, the Court of Appeal concluded that “the trial court abused its
discretion in refusing [the unlawful detainer defendant’s] request to
consolidate the unlawful detainer and quiet title actions for trial and that [the
unlawful detainer defendant] was prejudiced by being forced to litigate the
complex issue of title to the property under the summary procedures that govern
actions for unlawful detainer.”  (Id.
at pp. 370-371.)     
Here, following the ruling in Martin-Bragg, the court, on
September 29, 2023, issued an order granting the ex parte application filed by
plaintiff Aysia A. Rowe (“Rowe”) and ordering that (1) this unlimited civil
action filed by Rowe (Case No. 23STCV14562) (the “Civil Action”) and the
limited civil action for unlawful detainer filed by defendant Artem
Gerashchenkov (“Gerashchenkov”) (Case No. 23IWUD01124) (the “Unlawful Detainer
Action”) are related cases, (2) the Unlawful Detainer Action shall be assigned
to Department 53, and (3) the Civil Action and the Unlawful Detainer Action are
consolidated for all purposes.  (Sep. 29,
2023 Minute Order, p. 1.)  On February 15,
2024, the court issued an order reclassifying the Unlawful Detainer Action
(which was filed as a limited jurisdiction civil case) as an unlimited civil
case.  (February 15, 2024 Minute Order,
p. 3; March 5, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1.) 
 
On May 9, 2024, based on the new facts and circumstances discussed
below, the court exercised its discretion to set for hearing on June 3, 2024, an
Order to Show Cause why the court should not (1) reconsider and vacate (i) its
September 29, 2023 order deeming the Unlawful Detainer Action and Civil Action
related, (ii) its September 29, 2023 order reassigning the Unlawful Detainer
Action to Department 53 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse, (iii) its September 29,
2023 order consolidating the Unlawful Detainer Action and Civil Action for all
purposes, and (iv) its March 5, 2024 order reclassifying the Unlawful Detainer
Action as a civil unlimited case, and (2) issue a new order  (i) finding that the Unlawful Detainer Action
and Civil Action cases are not related, (ii) denying the request to consolidate
the Unlawful Detainer Action and Civil Action for all purposes, and (iii)
leaving the Unlawful Detainer Action as a limited unlawful detainer case.  (May 9, 2024 Order, p. 3:16-25.)  
On June 3, 2024, the court issued an order noting that Gerashchenkov
did not serve Plaintiff with notice of the court’s May 9, 2024 order, and
therefore the court exercised its discretion to continue the hearing on the Order
to Show Cause to June 17, 2024.  The
court further ordered that any response to the Order to Show Cause shall be
filed no later than nine court days before the hearing.  (June 3, 2024 Order, p. 327-28.)  Gerashchenkov filed a notice of ruling with
the court on June 6, 2024, stating that notice of the court’s June 3, 2024
order was served on Plaintiff and defendants Newrez LLC d/b/a Shellpoint
Mortgage Servicing (on behalf of itself and erroneously sued as Shellpoint
Mortgage Servicing) on that date by electronic service.  (June 6, 2024 Notice of Ruling, pp. 2-6.)  Plaintiff did not file a response to the
court’s Order to Show Cause. 
The court finds that the Unlawful Detainer Action and Civil Action should
no longer be ordered related or consolidated based on following new facts and
circumstances.  
In the Unlawful Detainer Action, the plaintiff is Gerashchenkov and
the defendant is Rowe.  In the Civil
Action, at the time the court made its September 29, 2023 order deeming the two
cases related and consolidated, the operative First Amended Complaint, filed July
14, 2023, named Rowe as the plaintiff and the defendants as Gerashchenkov,
Selene Finance LP, RITHM Capital Corp., Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, Newrez
LLC, and U.S. Bank Trust National Association as Trustee for RCF 2 Acquisition
Trust c/o U.S. Bank Trust National Association. 
However, in the Civil Action, Rowe filed a Second Amended Complaint on March
6, 2024, which now only names Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing and NewRez LLC as
defendants, and no longer names Gerashchenkov as a
defendant.  Thus, the only party now
named in both cases is Rowe as the defendant in the Unlawful Detainer Action
and as the plaintiff in the Civil Action. 
Although Gerashchenkov is the plaintiff in the Unlawful Detainer Action,
he is no longer a defendant or party in the Civil Action.  
In addition, after Rowe filed her Second Amended Complaint in the
Civil Action, the two cases no longer involve common questions of law or fact
and are no longer based on the same or similar claims.  In the Civil Action, Rowe’s First Amended
Complaint included a first cause of action for quiet title which sought to
quiet title to the real property that is the subject of the Unlawful Detainer
Action in favor of Rowe.  (FAC ¶¶ 94-105;
Unlawful Detainer Compl., ¶ 1 [alleging entitlement to real property known as
2735 W. 94th Street, Inglewood, California].) 
Thus, if Rowe had succeeded on her claim of title in the Civil Action, that
would have defeated Gerashchenkov’s right to possession in the Unlawful
Detainer Action.  But, in the Second
Amended Complaint filed in the Civil Action, Rowe no longer alleges a cause of
action to quiet title and does not seek to quiet or adjudicate title to the
property.  Instead, in the Second Amended
Complaint, Rowe alleges that the wrongful conduct allegedly committed by Shellpoint
Mortgage Servicing and NewRez LLC caused her to lose that property and seeks to
recover only damages against those two defendants.  (SAC ¶¶ 4 [alleging that Rowe’s mother
purchased the real property located at 2735 W. 94th Street, Inglewood,
California], 56; SAC Prayer, ¶¶ 1-5.) 
Moreover, the Second Amended Complaint concedes that Rowe lost title to
the property.  (SAC ¶ 68 [alleging
that mismanagement of the property loan resulted in “loss of equity and loss of
the title of the Property in foreclosure”].)  

Thus, based on the new facts and circumstances presented by Rowe’s Second
Amended Complaint filed in the Civil Action, the court finds that the two cases
now (1) do not involve the same parties (other than Rowe being the defendant in
the Unlawful Detainer Action and the plaintiff in the Civil Action) and are not
based on the same or similar claims; (2) do not arise from the same or
substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the
determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact;
(3) do not involve claims against, title to, possession of, or damages to the
same property; and (4) are not likely for other reasons to require substantial
duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.300(a)(1)-(4).)
Based on the new facts and circumstances presented by Rowe’s Second
Amended Complaint filed in the Civil Action, the court also finds that the two
cases now do not involve any common questions of law or fact.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048.)  
The court therefore finds that (1) the Civil Action and Unlawful
Detainer Action are not related cases and should not be consolidated, and (2)
the Unlawful Detainer Action (i) should not remain in Department 53, and (ii)
should remain a limited civil case.  
Thus, the court grants its own motion for reconsideration and makes
the orders set forth below.  (Paul
Blanco’s Good Car Company Auto Group v. Superior Court of Alameda County (2020)
56 Cal.App.5th 86, 97 [“As a general rule, trial courts have inherent
jurisdiction to reconsider, vacate, or otherwise modify their interim
orders”].)
ORDER
            The court grants its own motion
for reconsideration. 
The court orders that the following orders are vacated: (1) the
court’s September 29, 2023 order (i) finding that this case filed by Aysia A.
Rowe (Case No. 23STCV14562) and the unlawful detainer case filed by Artem
Gerashchenkov (Case No. 23IWUD01124) are related cases, (ii) assigning the
unlawful detainer case filed by Artem Gerashchenkov (Case No. 23IWUD01124) to
Department 53 in the Stanley Mosk Courthouse, and (iii) consolidating this case
filed by Aysia A. Rowe (Case No. 23STCV14562) and the unlawful detainer case
filed by Artem Gerashchenkov (Case No. 23IWUD01124) for all purposes, and (2)
the court’s February 15, 2024 and March 5, 2024 orders reclassifying the
unlawful detainer case filed by Artem Gerashchenkov (Case No. 23IWUD01124) as a
civil unlimited case. 
The court issues a new order denying Aysia Rowe’s ex parte application
for complete consolidation of Case No. 23STCV14562 and Case No. 23IWUD01124
because the court finds that (1) this case filed by Aysia A. Rowe (Case No.
23STCV14562) and the unlawful detainer case filed by Artem Gerashchenkov (Case
No. 23IWUD01124) are not related cases, and (2) this case filed by Aysia A.
Rowe (Case No. 23STCV14562) and the unlawful detainer case filed by Artem
Gerashchenkov (Case No. 23IWUD01124) shall not be consolidated for all
purposes.
The court issues a new order leaving the unlawful detainer case filed
by Artem Gerashchenkov (Case No. 23IWUD01124) as a limited civil case. 
The court orders Case No. 23IWUD01124 to be transferred to Department
1 for reassignment to a courtroom handling limited civil unlawful detainer cases.

 
 
 
The court orders Artem
Gerashchenkov to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  June 17, 2024
