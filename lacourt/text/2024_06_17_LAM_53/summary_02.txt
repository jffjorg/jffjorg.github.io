And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to substitute Roy Hopkins as the defendant in place of Deborah Soileau, trustee of the Hopkins Soileau Family Trust dated July 28, 1999. The court finds that the plaintiff has not shown that Roy Hopkins is the successor in interest to Deborah Soileau within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 377.41. The court also denies the plaintiff's related request to amend the Complaint to name Roy Hopkins as a defendant in place of Deborah Soileau. Additionally, the court denies the plaintiff's requests to amend the Complaint to dismiss John Hopkins, Jr. as a defendant and to allege newly discovered facts. The court suggests that the plaintiff may be able to file a petition to appoint a trustee to fill the vacancy and thereafter request leave to amend the Complaint to name the current trustee as a defendant in the action.
