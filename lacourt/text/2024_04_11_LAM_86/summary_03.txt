And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a petition for a writ of mandate to challenge the City Council's approval of a project. The petitioner argues that the project's environmental impact has not been properly evaluated. The court is skeptical of the petitioner's evidence, including a model based on a survey across 167 square kilometers of annual grasslands. The court finds that the petitioner has not presented any evidence that special status bird species live at the Site. The court also notes that the petitioner's reliance on three cases is misplaced, as they do not involve baseline analysis. The court's tentative ruling is that the petitioner's evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the environmental impact of the project, and the project's approval by the City Council was proper.
