Date:               4/11/24
(1:30 PM)
Case:                           Kwon Whan Cook v. Yun
Ja Kim et al. (23STCV14729)
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
The Motion for Appointment of Receiver and Temporary
Restraining Order filed by Plaintiff Kwon Whan Cook, through Guardian ad Litem
Scott Cook, is DENIED. 
 
As a preliminary matter, based on the hearing date of April
11, 2024, the deadline to serve and file oppositions was March 26, 2024. (CCP §
1005(b).) Defendant Yun Ja Kim filed an opposition on March 29, 2024.
Defendants Family-in-Love, LLC and Hye Jung Kang filed an opposition on March
28, 2024. Despite the untimely oppositions, plaintiff was able to file a
substantive opposition. Accordingly, the Court exercises its discretion and
considers the oppositions. (Rule of Court 3.1300(d) [“No paper may be rejected
for filing on the ground that it was untimely submitted for filing. If the
court, in its discretion, refuses to consider a late filed paper, the minutes
or order must so indicate”].)   
 
Plaintiff’s requests for judicial notice are DENIED as “unnecessary
to the resolution” of the issues before the Court. (Martinez v. San Diego
County Credit Union (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 1048, 1075.)
 
All evidentiary objections are OVERRULED. 
 
Pursuant to CCP § 564(b)(1)
and (b)(9), plaintiff seeks the appointment of a receiver with respect to commercial
real properties located at 1308-1310 ½ S. Van Ness Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90019
(“Van Ness Property”) and 8432 & 8440 S. Broadway, Los Angeles, CA 90003
(“Broadway Property”), as well as a preliminary injunction in aid of such
receiver (though plaintiff erroneously entitles the instant motion as one
seeking a temporary restraining order). Plaintiff alleges that defendant Yun Ja
Kim took advantage of plaintiff’s lack of capacity to transfer the subject
properties out of his possession and into the possession of Kim and her children
or agents. The receiver would operate the properties and collect rents. 
 
Under CCP § 564(b),
a receiver may be appointed by the court in which an action is pending “on the
application of any party whose right to or interest in the property or fund, or
the proceeds of the property or fund, is probable, and where it is shown that
the property or fund is in danger of being lost, removed, or materially
injured.” (CCP § 564(b)(1).) A receiver may also be appointed “where necessary
to preserve the property or rights of any party.” (CCP § 564(b)(9).) 
 
A receiver should not be appointed unless absolutely
essential, because no other remedy will suffice. (City & County of San
Francisco v. Daley (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 734, 745.) This is so because the
appointment of a receiver is recognized as a drastic, time consuming, expensive,
and potentially unjust remedy to be used as a final resort. (See Weil &
Brown, Civ. Proc. Before Trial § 9:743 et seq.; see also Alhambra-Shumway
Mines v. Alhambra Gold Mine Corp. (1953) 116 Cal.App.2d 869, 873.) “The
appointment of a receiver is a drastic remedy and is one which should not be
invoked unless there is an actual or threatened cessation or diminution of the
business.” (In re Jamison Steel Corp. (1958) 158 Cal.App.2d 27, 35.) 
 
Plaintiff does not that dispute that lis pendens have been
recorded against the subject properties. (See, e.g., Motion at 19:15-19
[re: Van Ness Property]; Kang Decl. ¶ 17 & Ex. 102 [Broadway Property].) While
plaintiff contends that a lis pendens does not guarantee the properties will
not be conveyed, the Court finds that the lis pendens recorded against the
subject properties adequately protects plaintiff’s interest against future
conveyance of such properties. (Ryan v. Murphy (1919) 39 Cal.App. 640,
642.) “A lis pendens gives notice that the judgment will be binding on persons
later acquiring an interest in that property.” (Shoker v. Superior Court of
Alameda County (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 271, 275.)  Potential buyers of the properties are
notified that plaintiff has a claim against the properties and that they
purchase the properties at their own risk.  
 
With respect to rents from the properties, the appointment
of a receiver is not essential for the protection of any interest plaintiff may
have in such rents or to mitigate against dissipation of such assets.  For example, a preliminary injunction against
disbursement of proceeds from the properties may be an effective and less
stringent remedy than appointment of the receiver. It would be an abuse of
discretion for the Court to “appoint a receiver, when the purpose sought could
be accomplished, and the rights of the parties more adequately protected, by
the granting of an injunction upon the giving of an undertaking required by
statute.” (Dabney Oil Co. v. Providence Oil Co. of Arizona (1913) 22
Cal.App. 233, 239.) Further, insofar as plaintiff may not even be entitled to such
an injunction, plaintiff certainly would not be entitled to a receiver as
sought in the instant motion. (Ibid.) 
 
Plaintiff having failed to demonstrate that a receiver is
absolutely essential or that the properties are in danger of dissipation, the
motion is DENIED.
