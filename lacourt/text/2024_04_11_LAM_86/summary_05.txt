And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The Court has tentatively ruled in favor of Americredit Financial Services, granting their application for a writ of possession with respect to K.O. Towing and Recovery. The Court finds that Americredit has established a probably valid claim to possession of the 2020 Ford Super Duty F-25 vehicle. The vehicle was towed and stored by K.O. Towing without plaintiff's consent. Americredit offered to pay the maximum amount for storage in exchange for release of the vehicle, but K.O. Towing refused. The Court concludes that K.O. Towing waived its statutory lien and that Americredit has a probably valid claim for waiver of the lien. The Court also notes that the amount owed ($59,494.93) exceeds the market value of the vehicle ($33,334.00)."
