City Council (“City Council”) committee that hears and decides CEQA appeals.

City Council for ratification. (AR 78-79.)

          Otherwise, there may be good reason for this Court to
question the value of petitioner’s evidence. 
Dr. Smallwood contends the Site is used as a stopover during migration (AR 2783), but that does not necessarily
render the Site a habitat for the special status bird species. “Habitat” is
defined in Merriam-Webster Dictionary as “the place or environment where a
plant or animal naturally or normally lives and grows.” (Merriam-Webster
Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/habitat; see also
Leavitt v. County of Madera (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1502, 1514 [in
case involving statutory construction of CEQA provisions, “To determine the
usual and ordinary meaning of a word or phrase, a court may refer to the
definitions contained in a dictionary.”) Dr. Smallwood does not present any
evidence that any special status bird species lives at the Site. Further, in
finding that 17 vertebrate wildlife special-status species may visit the Site,
Dr. Smallwood applied a model based on a survey across 167 square kilometers of
annual grasslands of the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area. (AR 2781-82.) There
is no explanation why grasslands may be analogized to a parcel in an urbanized
area.
 


[5]           In Reply, petitioner cites three cases it claims “demonstrate that
courts rely on Section 15125 for evaluating the baseline environmental setting
for projects relying on CEQA exemptions.” (Reply at 5.)  However, in North Coast Rivers Alliance v.
Westlands Water Dist. (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 832, 872-74, the Court of
Appeal performed a baseline analysis to determine whether the “significant
effect on the environment” exception to an exemption applied. In County of
Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 952, the
baseline analysis pertained to whether the EIR adequately described the
baseline environment and historic operations. The court’s discussion of the
applicability of two categorical exemptions did not involve any baseline
analysis. (County of Amador, 76 Cal.App.4th at 966-69.) In Bottini¸v.
City of San Diego (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 281, the Court of Appeal explained
that a project that is categorically exempt does not undergo the CEQA review
process, where the agency “must evaluate the environmental impact of a project
against a measure commonly referred to as the baseline, i.e., the environment’s
state in the absence of the project.” (Bottini, 27 Cal.App.5th at
292-93.) Bottini does not even cite Guidelines § 15125.
