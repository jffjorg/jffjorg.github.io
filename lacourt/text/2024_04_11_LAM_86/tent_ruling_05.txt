Case:               Americredit Financial Services v. Damien R. Escalante et
al. (24STCV00979) 
  
RECOMMENDED RULING:
 
On March 5, 2024, the Court
tentatively denied petitioner’s application for writ of possession with respect
to defendant K.O. Towing and Recovery (“K.O. Towing”) because there was no
showing as to why K.O. Towing and Recovery would have possession of the
vehicle. The Court continued the matter to allow plaintiff Americredit
Financial Services to submit additional information. 
 
Plaintiff was ordered to file and
serve supplemental briefing on or before 3/8/24. According to a proof of
service, filed on 3/8/24, plaintiff served all defendants notice of the
continued hearing and a supplemental declaration of Eric Tran, Esq. on 3/7/24
by mail. However, the Tran declaration was filed on 3/28/24, twenty days past
the date ordered by the Court. Nevertheless, because the notice of continuance and
Tran declaration were timely served and no oppositions have been filed, the
Court rules on the merits of the application. 

 
With respect to K.O. Towing, the UNOPPOSED
Application for Writ of Possession by petitioner Americredit Financial Services
is GRANTED. 
 
The Court finds that plaintiff has established the probable
validity of its claim to possession of the property, namely, a 2020 Ford Super
Duty F-25 (VIN 1FT8W2BT4LEC64673). 
 
The Tran declaration demonstrates that plaintiff received a
Notice of Pending Lien Sale for Vehicle, which indicated that K.O. Towing
intended to sell the subject vehicle because its towing, storage or repair bill
had not been paid. (Tran Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. 1.) The Notice of Pending Lien
Sale indicated that plaintiff was the legal owner of the vehicle. (Tran Decl. ¶
3 & Ex. 1.) Based on conversations with representatives of K.O. Towing and
its agent, California Lien Sales, plaintiff represents that the lien sale has
not yet occurred and K.O. Towing remains in possession of the subject vehicle.
(Ttran Decl. ¶¶ 6-11.) Accordingly, it appears that the subject vehicle may be
located at 542 E. Walnut St., Fullerton, CA 92832, the address where K.O.
Towing conducts its business. (Tran Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. 1.) 
 
Further, on January 9, 2024, plaintiff sent K.O. Towing a letter
offering to pay the maximum amount for storage under Civil Code § 3068(c) in
exchange for release of the subject vehicle to plaintiff. (Tran Decl. ¶ 5 &
Ex. 2.) Plaintiff also asserted that it was not notified before K.O. Towing
began storing the vehicle. (Ibid.) This evidence establishes that K.O.
Towing came into possession of the vehicle and plaintiff probably did not give
consent to the vehicle being towed, stored, or repaired by K.O. Towing. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff shows a probably valid claim that any statutory lien would be limited
to the amounts stated in Civil Code § 3068(c)(1). 
 
K.O. Towing refused plaintiff’s offer to pay the maximum
amounts for release of the subject vehicle. (Tran Decl. ¶ 9.) Consequently,
K.O. Towing waived payment of the lien. (See Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp.
v. Rater (1963) 214 Cal.App.2d 493, 494-95 [defendant who made repairs to
vehicle waived statutory lien pursuant to Civil Code section 3068 when he
rejected plaintiff’s tender of the lien amount].) To the extent necessary for
issuance of a pre-judgment writ of possession, the Court also concludes that plaintiff
has shown a probably valid claim for waiver of the statutory lien.
 
No undertaking is required. The amount owed ($59,494.93)
exceeds the market value of the vehicle ($33,334.00). (CCP § 515.010; Williams
Decl. ¶ 9 & Ex. C.)  Plaintiff shall
submit a Proposed Order in accordance herewith on the appropriate Judicial
Council form.
