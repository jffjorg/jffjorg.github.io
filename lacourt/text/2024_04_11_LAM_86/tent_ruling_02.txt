          Petitioner Supporters Alliance
for Environmental Responsibility petitions for a writ of mandate directing
respondents City of Los Angeles and City Council of the City of Los Angeles to
vacate and set aside their approval of the 975-987 South Manhattan Place
Project until respondent complies with the California Environmental Quality Act
(“CEQA”).
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.          
Overview of the Project
and Setting
 
The
proposed Project entails the construction of a new seven-story, 95,206
square-foot, multi-family development with 120 residential units, 12 of which
are set aside for extremely low-income households. (AR 13, 33, 1192.) The
Project is located at 975-987 South Manhattan Place in the City’s Wilshire
Community Plan area and is split-zoned: the majority of the Project Site is
zoned “high medium” density residential and a smaller portion is zoned “general
commercial.” (AR 13, 33, 1536, 1691.) The Project is within “the City’s highly
urbanized and densely populated Koreatown neighborhood,” where it is surrounded
by multi-family residential
buildings
to the north and west, a large vacant lot to the east, and a commercial
building directly to the south. (AR 13, 1418, 1689, 1740-41.) According to the
City Planning Commission, the Project meets all “Transit Oriented Communities”
requirements and is consistent with the City’s goal of reducing traffic
congestion and improving air quality. (AR 66-73.)
 
The
Site lies on a “heavily impacted and previously developed urban infill site”
(AR 2603) that contains no natural land or features (AR 6742, 6752). The
northern portion of the Site was fully developed for over a hundred years
before the residential building previously located on the property was
demolished in 2018 and the southern portion was developed with a surface
parking lot. (AR 1811, 5844-49.) The entire Site now sits on a vacant dirt lot
that has been “heavily disturbed due to construction staging and parking, and
intense fuel modification practices, with mostly bare ground and the only
vegetation present being non-native annual plants and grasses.”
(AR
1142, 1149-54 [photographs], 1418-20, 1722-24.)
 
B.          
City Project Approval and
CEQA Infill Exemption Determination
 
On
November 3, 2021, real party in interest Korea Town, LP submitted an
Environmental Assessment Application for the Project to the City’s Department
of City Planning. (AR 6609-20.) In May 2022, the City produced a Categorical
Exemption (“CE”) report prepared by expert environmental consultant CAJA
Environmental Services (“CAJA”) (AR 1380), which determined the Project
qualifies for the Infill Exemption and that none of the regulatory exceptions
under Guidelines section 15300.2 apply (“2022 Report”). (AR 1378-1679.)[1]
Relevant to this lawsuit, which focuses on CEQA Guidelines section 15332(c),
the 2022 Report determined that the Site had “no value as habitat for
endangered, rare or threatened species.” (AR 1420.) Specifically, in making its
“no value as habitat” determination, the 2022 Report explained:
 
The
Project Site is completely surrounded by urban uses.
 
The
Project Site is a vacant lot.  There are
three (3) street/sidewalk trees on Manhattan. 
There are no protected trees or shrubs on the Site . . . .
 
.
. . .
 
No
federally protected wetlands (e.g., estuarine and marine deepwater, estuarine
and marine, freshwater pond, lake, riverine) occur on or in the immediate
vicinity of the Project Site.  The
nearest wetland is MacArthur Park, which classified as a Freshwater Pond and
located approximately 1.80 miles east of the Project Site.
 
No
riparian or other sensitive habitat areas are located on or adjacent to the
Project Site.  Due to the highly
urbanized nature of the Project Site and surrounding area, the lack of a major
water body, and the lack of trees, the Project Site is not a habitat for native
resident or migratory species or contain native nurseries.
 
There
are no City or County significant ecological areas on or around the Project
Site.  There are no California Natural
Community Conservations Plans (CNCCP) in the area. . . . There are no Habitat
Conservation Plans near the Site.
 
Thus,
there exists no value for the Project Site as habitat for endangered, rare, or
threatened species.  Further, the Project
Site is not located in an approved local, regional, or state habitat
conservation plan.
 
(AR
1419-20, footnotes omitted.)
 
SAFER submitted comments
ahead of the City’s May 25, 2022 hearing on the Project. None of SAFER’s
comments discussed habitat onsite or other significant biological issues.
Instead, SAFER’s comments addressed the Project’s purported impacts on indoor
air quality and noise. (AR 2571-79.) Following the May 25, 2022 hearing, on
July 8, 2022, the City’s Director of Planning (“Director”) issued a Letter of
Determination (“LOD”) approving the Project’s entitlements and determining
that, based on the whole of the administrative record, the Project qualifies
for the Infill Exemption and no exceptions apply. (AR 6.)
 
SAFER filed an appeal to
the City’s determination on July 21, 2022, which reiterated its earlier
comments about noise and indoor air quality. (AR 82-95.) SAFER’s July 21, 2022
“Justification/Reason for Appeal” again makes no reference to the Site’s alleged
habitat value. (AR 86.) 
 
On October 24, 2022, SAFER
submitted over 190 pages of material. (AR 2609-2802.) Included was a letter
from Dr. Shawn Smallwood, PhD (“Smallwood”) summarizing the results of a site
visit by Noriko Smallwood on July 24, 2022 (“Smallwood Letter”). (AR 2777-95.)
In this letter, Dr. Smallwood related that Ms. Smallwood allegedly detected 13
species of vertebrate wildlife at the Site, three of which qualified as special-status
bird species: Cooper’s hawk, western gull, and Allen’s hummingbird. (AR
2777-79.) Dr. Smallwood conjectured that the Site could support “17
special-status species of wildlife” and, on that basis, holds “considerable
habitat value to wildlife.” (AR 2782-83.) The Smallwood Letter asserted the
Site has habitat value due to its purported utility as “stopover and staging
opportunities” during migration. (AR 2783.)
 
In response to the Smallwood
Letter, the City’s expert CEQA consultant, CAJA, addressed the letter’s claims,
noting that Dr. Smallwood’s assertions were not supported “by any map showing the
specific location of the claimed sightings, and provide[d] no evidence for
habitat on the Site, instead just pointing out observations of birds in the
general vicinity of the Site.” (AR 2603-04.) CAJA then went on the confirm
there are “no wildlife corridors, riparian or wetland areas nearby the Project
Site” and that there is no evidence or information suggesting that the Site, “which
is a heavily impacted and previously developed urban infill site in the middle
of Koreatown, can validly be considered sensitive habitat. . . .” (AR 2603-04.)
 
The City Planning Commission
(“CPC”) received oral comments at its October 27, 2022 hearing for the Project
that reiterated the information found in both the Smallwood Letter and CAJA’s
response. (AR 2536-43.) Planning Department staff stated that it had reviewed
SAFER’s October 24, 2022 appeal letter and found it had failed to provide
substantial evidence in support of its claims and ignored the substantial
evidence supporting the Director’s Infill Exemption determination. (AR 2535.) 
 
On December 7, 2022, the
CPC, with support from the Planning Department’s Appeal Report (AR 96-104), denied
SAFER’s appeal and issued a Letter of Determination (“PC LOD”) approving the
Project. (AR 59-77.) The PC LOD determined the Project was exempt from CEQA and
that there was no substantial evidence, based on the whole administrative record,
demonstrating any exception to the Infill Exemption applied. (AR 59.)
 
On December 14, 2022,
SAFER appealed the CPC’s Infill Exemption determination. (AR 1004.) The City
and CAJA thereafter updated the 2022 Report to “adequately reflect current city
policies as well as address [SAFER’s] concerns,” addressing a variety of topics
including air quality, general plan consistency, and noise (“2023 Report”). (AR
1192, 1680-2313.) The City’s 2023 Report added further discussion of species
habitat (AR 1722-24), which was supported by a biological site survey and
assessment of the Project Site conducted by professional biological consultants,
South Environmental (“SE Report”). (AR 1141-61.) Using the City’s standard form
for evaluating a particular site, South Environmental assessed the Site for
presence of water resources, protected trees or shrubs, and any protected
animal species. (AR 1141-42, 1145.) The SE Report contained photographs and
information gathered during wildlife biologist AJ Samra’s visit to the Site on
February 21, 2023. (AR 1141-43, 1149-54.)
 
As with the City’s 2022
Report, both the 2023 Report and the SE Report contained findings that the Site
is disturbed land located in the middle of a dense and highly urbanized area
that contains no trees, water, or other natural features that would constitute
habitat, and is not within any identified ecologically sensitive areas. (AR
1141-43, 1419-20, 1722-24.) The SE Report noted that the Site was then being
used for “construction staging and parking” for a “construction company working
on a development across the street” and the Department of Fish and Wildlife
California Natural Diversity Database (“CNDDB”) did not identify any sensitive species
in the vicinity of the Site. (AR 1142.) As with the City’s 2022 Report, both
the 2023 Report and the SE Report concluded the Site has “no value as habitat
for endangered, rare, or threatened species.” (AR 1141-43, 1419-20, 1722-24.)
 
In its April 13, 2023
appeal report submitted to the Planning and Land Use Management (“PLUM”)
Committee,[2] City
staff concluded that the CPC did not err in finding that the Project fits the
Infill Exemption, as its analysis “relie[d] on various technical studies from
qualified experts” and SAFER’s appeal failed to offer substantial evidence demonstrating
any flaws in the City’s exemption determination. (AR 1192; see also AR
1722-24, 1142-43.) On April 18, 2023, after having heard SAFER’s final appeal
of the Project, the PLUM Committee considered the 2023 Report, the SE Report,
and written submissions from SAFER and voted unanimously to recommend that the
City Council deny the appeal and sustain CPC’s approval of the Project and
Infill Exemption. (AR 78-79, 1192-1377, 2375, 2555-56, 3857-4050.)
 
SAFER subsequently
submitted additional letters and comments, including additional comments from Dr.
Smallwood, asserting without evidentiary support, that the City “bulldozed” the
Site. (AR 4620-21, 4811-12 [Smallwood Response to SE Report] (“Response
Letter”).) Dr. Smallwood explained that, in the seven months between Ms.
Smallwood’s site inspection on July 24, 2022 and South Environmental’s site
inspection on February 21, 2023, the Site “had been committed to a construction
staging area” and was “highly disturbed.” (AR 4812.) Dr. Smallwood reiterated that
the Site constitutes habitat for the special status species based on Ms.
Smallwood’s previously reported observations and because the Site could
ostensibly be used as a “stopover” point for protected bird species. (AR
4817-18.) The Response Letter asserted the legal position that the “baseline”
condition of the Site under CEQA should have been “open space” as alleged in
the earlier Smallwood Letter, not the “dirt pad” pictured in the SE Report. (AR
4817.) 
 
The City Council denied
SAFER’s appeal and approved the Project on May 2, 2023. (AR 81.) On May 5,
2023, the City filed a Notice of Exemption for the Project with the Los Angeles
County Clerk, noting that the Project was exempt from CEQA under the Infill
Exemption. (AR 3-5.) 
 


II.      Procedural History
 
            On
June 6, 2023, petitioner filed a Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate. On
November 6, 2023, real party in interest Korea Town, LP filed an Answer.[3] On
November 7, 2023, respondents City of Los Angeles and City Council for the City
of Los Angeles filed an Answer. 
 
            On December 21, 2023, petitioner
filed an opening brief. On January 30, 2024, respondents and real party filed
an opposition. On February 29, 2024, petitioner filed a reply. The Court has
received an electronic copy of the administrative record and a hard copy of the
joint appendix. 
             
III.     Standard of Review
 
In an action challenging an agency’s decision under
CEQA, the trial court reviews the agency’s decision for a prejudicial abuse of
discretion. (Pub. Res. Code § 21168.5.) “Abuse of discretion is
established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if
the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.” (Ibid.)
 
“[S]ubstantial evidence includes fact, a reasonable
assumption predicated upon fact, or expert opinion supported by fact….
Substantial evidence is not argument, speculation, unsubstantiated opinion or
narrative, evidence that is clearly inaccurate or erroneous, or evidence of
social or economic impacts that do not contribute to, or are not caused by,
physical impacts on the environment.” (Pub. Res. Code § 21080(e).) Under the
substantial evidence test, the Court “review[s] the administrative record to see
if it contains evidence of ponderable legal significance that is reasonable in
nature, credible, and of solid value, to support the agency’s decision.” (Protect
Tustin Ranch v. City of Tustin (2021) 70 Cal.App.5th 951, 960.)  The Court does not weigh the evidence.  (Ibid.)
 
When an appellant challenges “’the sufficiency of
the evidence, all material evidence on the point must be set forth and not merely
[its] own evidence.” (Toigo v. Town of Ross (1998) 70 Cal.App.4th 309,
317, quoting Jordan v. City of Santa Barbara (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1245,
1255.) The petitioner “must lay out the evidence favorable to the other side
and show why it is lacking.” (Defend the Bay v. City of Irvine (2004)
119 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1266.) “Failure to do so is fatal. A reviewing court will
not independently review the record to make up for appellant's failure to carry
his burden.” (Ibid.) 
 


IV.     Analysis
 
A.          
Class 32 Exemption to CEQA
 
Respondents and real party contend that the Project
qualifies for a Class 32 exemption to CEQA, codified in Title 14, Section 15332
of the California Code of Regulations (hereinafter, “Guidelines”). CEQA
Guidelines § 15332 exempts “in-fill development” meeting the following
requirements: 
 
(a) The project is consistent with the applicable
general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as
with applicable zoning designation and regulations.
 
(b) The proposed development occurs within city
limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by
urban uses.
 
(c) The project site has no value, as habitat for
endangered, rare or threatened species.
 
(d) Approval of the project would not result in any
significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality.
 
(e) The site can be adequately served by all
required utilities and public services.
 
(Guidelines § 15332.)
 
Under CEQA, “[t]he lead agency has the burden to demonstrate
that a project falls within a categorical exemption and the agency’s
determination must be supported by substantial evidence.” (Citizens for
Environmental Responsibility v. State ex rel. 14th Dist. Ag. Assn. (2015)
242 Cal.App.4th 555, 568 [“CER”].) “‘[W]here the record contains
evidence bearing on the question whether the project qualifies for the
exemption … and the agency makes factual determinations as to whether the
project fits within an exemption category … [judicial review is] whether the
record contains substantial evidence to support the agency’s decision.”’ (Walters
v. City of Redondo Beach (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 809, 817.) The Court “do[es]
not weigh conflicting evidence, as that is the role of the public agency.” (Protect
Tustin Ranch, 70 Cal.App.5th at 960.)
            
“Since a determination that a project falls within
a categorical exemption excuses any further compliance with CEQA whatsoever, we
must construe the exemptions narrowly in order to afford the fullest possible
environmental protection.” (Save Our Carmel River v. Monterey Peninsula
Water Management Dist. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 677, 697.)
 
            The
essential issue here is whether subdivision (c) of CEQA Guidelines § 15332
applies, that is, whether the Site “has no value, as habitat for endangered,
rare or threatened species.” 
 
            Petitioner
focuses on a site visit conducted by Noriko Smallwood, a wildlife biologist, on
July 24, 2022. (AR 2777.) Having walked around the perimeter of the Site with
binoculars for 2.16 hours, Ms. Smallwood detected 13 species of vertebrate
wildlife, three of which were special-status bird species: Cooper’s hawk,
western gull, and Allen’s hummingbird. (AR 2777-80, 2782.) Dr. Shawn Smallwood
– researcher of animal density and distribution, habitat selection, and
conservation of rare and endangered species who has performed wildlife surveys
for 37 years (AR 2777) – applied a model to Ms. Smallwood’s results to estimate
that with repeated surveys, Ms. Smallwood would detect 73 species of vertebrate
wildlife at the Site, 17 of which would be special-status species. (AR 2781-82).
The model was based on a survey across 167 square kilometers of annual
grasslands of the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area, where Dr. Smallwood performed
721 hours of surveys at 46 stations from 2015 through 2019. (AR 2781.) Dr.
Smallwood further explained: 
 
Very few patches of open space remain within Los
Angeles. Each one that remains available to birds and bats is undoubtedly
sought for stopover and staging opportunities and for refugia and foraging to
fuel long-distance flights. A site such as that of the proposed project is
critically important for wildlife movement because it composes an increasingly
diminishing area of open space within a growing expanse of anthropogenic uses,
forcing more species of volant wildlife to use the site for stopover and staging
during migration, dispersal, and home range patrol [citations]. If it goes
forward, the project would cut wildlife off from stopover and staging
opportunities, forcing volant wildlife to travel even farther between remaining
stopover sites. As it is, the site is valuable to wildlife movement in the
region.
 
(AR 2783.) Based on the foregoing, Dr. Smallwood
concluded that “the site holds considerable habitat value to wildlife.” (AR
2783.)
 
            While
such evidence was before respondents, the Court finds there was, nonetheless,
substantial evidence to support the conclusion that the in-fill exemption to
the Project should apply.  In so finding,
this Court does not weigh the conflicting evidence when evaluating the decision
for substantial evidence.[4]
(Protect Tustin Ranch, 70 Cal.App.5th at 960.)  Respondents had before them the May 2022 report
by CAJA
Environmental Services, which stated: “No riparian or other sensitive habitat
areas are located on or adjacent to the Project Site. Due to the highly
urbanized nature of the Project Site and surrounding area, the lack of a major
water body, and the lack of trees, the Project Site is not a habitat for native
resident or migratory species or contain native nurseries.” (AR 1420, footnote
omitted.) CAJA also noted that there are no city or county designated
significant ecological areas nor any state conversation plans covering the Site
or anywhere nearby. (AR 1419-20.)  In making
its “no value as habitat” determination, the 2022 Report determined: (1) the
Site is entirely surrounded by urban uses; (2) the Site is a vacant dirt lot
containing no trees—including no protected trees or shrubs—and no natural
features typically associated with animal habitat; and (3) the Site contains no
ecologically sensitive areas, wetlands, or marine habitat on or near it. (AR
1419-20.)
 
            The May 2022 report would alone seem
to constitute substantial evidence supporting the finding of “no value as
habitat,” but there is more.  Respondents
also rely on results from a site visit by wildlife biologist AJ Samra on behalf
of South Environmental that took place on February 21, 2023. (AR 1141-43, 1149-54.) Consistent with the May 2022
report, South Environmental noted the following: (1) no protected trees or
shrubs occur on the Site; (2) the Site lacks water resources; (3) no native
plants were present at the Site; (4) the area around the Site is heavily
urbanized; and (5) there are no California Natural Diversity Database records
of sensitive and special status species within a 0.25-mile radius of the Site.
(AR 1142-43, 1145.) South Environmental also attached photographs consistent
with the observations noted in its report. (AR 1149-54.) Based on the
foregoing, South Environmental concluded that the Site “does not serve as
habitat for special-status plants or animals, and none have the potential to
occur.” (AR 1143.) 
 
            Further still, CAJA updated its 2022
Report in April 2023. (AR 1192, 1680-2313.) CAJA’s
updated findings remain consistent with both the May 2022 Report and the SE
Report. (AR 1722-24.) In particular, CAJA concluded: “Due to the highly urbanized
nature of the Project Site and surrounding area, the lack of a major water body,
and the lack of trees, the Project Site is not a habitat for native resident or
migratory species or contain native nurseries.” (AR 1723.) 
            The
foregoing substantial evidence of “no value, as habitat for endangered, rare,
or threatened species” should end the inquiry as to whether respondents committed
an abuse of discretion.  Nevertheless,
petitioner argues that the Site had been regraded and denuded of vegetation
prior to preparation of the SE Report and the April 2023 Report due to
construction staging. (Cf. AR 1338-39 [photographs attached to SE
Report]; cf. AR 5847-48 [pictures taken on or before July 1, 2019]; AR 4812 [photograph
from Google Earth Street View image of 975 Manhattan Place in July 2022]; AR
6742 [photograph of Site in presentation dated May 25, 2022].) Petitioner thus
contends that the SE Report and the April 2023 Report have no evidentiary value,
because the potential environmental impact of the Project needs to be compared
to the “baseline,” or when the environmental analysis is commenced, according
to petitioner. 
 
            This
argument is unhelpful to petitioner’s cause. 
To begin with, it is far from clear that petitioner’s “baseline”
requirement has any application here. 
The requirement for a baseline analysis arises from CEQA Guidelines § 15125(a),
but that section, by its explicit terms, applies only to the preparation of an Environmental
Impact Report. (See Guidelines § 15125(a) [“An EIR must include a
description of the physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of the
project. This environmental setting will normally constitute the baseline
physical conditions by which a lead agency determines whether an impact is
significant”].) While petitioner argues the “baseline” requirement also extends
to determinations of exemptions, the cases cited by petitioner do not
necessarily stand for that proposition.[5]
 
In any event, even if a baseline analysis were
required, thereby requiring the Project to be evaluated with respect to when
the environmental analysis commenced in May 2022 (see Guidelines § 15125(a)(1);
AR 6 [City determined that in-fill exemption applied in May 2022]), as
discussed above, the May 2022 report constitutes substantial evidence that the
in-fill exemption applies. As was found in May 2022, due to the urban nature of
the Site and the surrounding area, the lack of a body of water, lack of trees,
and lack of government-designated conversation efforts, there was substantial
evidence supporting the applicability of the in-fill exemption. While Petitioner argues that the May
2022 report does not constitute substantial evidence because there is no
evidence of any site visit, petitioner cites no authority indicating that a
site visit is necessary to constitute substantial evidence, and the Court does
not find that the lack of a site visit impacts its conclusion that the May 2022
report constitutes substantial evidence.
 
For
the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that substantial evidence supports
the City’s finding that the Project was exempt under the in-fill exemption.
 
B.          
Exceptions to Class 32 Exemption
 
“Once the agency establishes that the project is
exempt, the burden shifts to the party challenging the exemption to show that
the project is not exempt because it falls within one of the exceptions listed
in Guidelines section 15300.2.” (CER, 242 Cal.App.4th at 568.)
 
            Petitioner
argues that there is a reasonable possibility that the Project will have a
significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances. “A
categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a
reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the
environment due to unusual circumstances.” (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(c).)
 
The unusual circumstances exception may be
established in one of two ways. “A party invoking the exception may establish
an unusual circumstance without evidence of an environmental effect, by showing
that the project has some feature that distinguishes it from others in the
exempt class, such as its size or location. In such a case, to render the
exception applicable, the party need only show a reasonable possibility of a
significant effect due to that unusual circumstance. Alternatively…a party may
establish an unusual circumstance with evidence that the project will have a
significant environmental effect.” (Berkeley Hillside Preservation v. City
of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086, 1105.)
 
Petitioner has not shown that unusual circumstances
apply to the Project. “‘[T]he presence of comparable facilities in the
immediate area adequately supports [an] implied finding that there were no
“unusual circumstances” precluding a categorical exemption.’ [Citation.]” (Walters
v. City of Redondo Beach (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 809, 821, quoting Bloom v.
McGurk (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1316.) Here, the Project is typical of the
multi-family residential buildings surrounding the Site in Koreatown and is in
a “high medium” density residential zone. (AR
13, 1418, 1689, 1691, 1740-41.)  As for
the second test under Berkeley, the Court of Appeal in Walters
summarized its application as follows:
 
In the second alternative under Berkeley
Hillside, a challenger “may establish an unusual circumstance with evidence
that the project will have a significant environmental effect.” “When it
is shown ‘that a project otherwise covered by a categorical exemption will have
a significant environmental effect, it necessarily follows that the project
presents unusual circumstances.’” “But a challenger must establish more than
just a fair argument that the project will have a significant environmental
effect. A party challenging the exemption, must show that the project will
have a significant environmental impact.” “In other words, a showing by
substantial evidence that a project will have a significant effect on
the environment satisfies both prongs of the unusual circumstances exception
under the second method of establishing the exception.” 
 
(Walters, 1 Cal.App.5th 819-20, internal
citations omitted, emphasis in original.) Petitioner does not demonstrate the
inevitability of a significant environmental impact. Even if it is correct that
the Site would no longer be a “stopover” for certain special status bird
species (see AR 2783), there is no evidence that any special-status
species has ever lived at the Site or that the Project will otherwise have a
definitive significant environmental impact on a special status bird species or
any other endangered, rare, or threatened species.
 
            Petitioner
has not met its burden to demonstrate an exception to the in-fill exception. 
 
VI.     Conclusion
 
The
petition is DENIED. Pursuant to Local Rule 3.231(n), respondents shall
prepare, serve, and ultimately file a proposed judgment.
