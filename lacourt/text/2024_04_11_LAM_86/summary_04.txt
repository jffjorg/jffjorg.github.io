Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled that the motion for appointment of a receiver filed by Kwon Whan Cook, the plaintiff, is denied. The court found that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that a receiver is absolutely essential or that the properties are in danger of dissipation. The court also noted that the appointment of a receiver is a drastic remedy and should only be used as a last resort. The court found that the lis pendens recorded against the subject properties adequately protects the plaintiff's interest against future conveyance of the properties. The court also noted that a preliminary injunction against disbursement of proceeds from the properties may be an effective and less stringent remedy than the appointment of a receiver.
