BACKGROUND 
This
is a real property dispute. On November 9, 2022, plaintiffs Joy Yin and Ho
Seong Lee (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed this action against defendants
Nicholas Simmons (Nicholas), Cathy Simmons (Cathy), Prager Metis, CPAs (Prager),
Genitrix Georges (Georges) (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 to 10. On
February 2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the operative Third Amended Complaint (TAC),
alleging causes of action for injury to real property and breach of contract
against Nicholas and Cathy Simmons, and for intentional misrepresentation/fraud
and breach of contract against Georges/Prager Metis, and trespass against
Nicholas Simmons. 
On
March 6, 2024, Georges and Prager (Moving Parties) demurred to the Third Cause
of Action in the TAC and moved to strike portions of the TAC. On April 11,
2024, Plaintiffs opposed both motions. Moving Parties did not reply to the
oppositions. 
LEGAL
STANDARD – Demurrer 
A
demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other
pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or
content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., §
422.10; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of
the complaint; and for purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in
the complaint are assumed to be true. (Id.) 
A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian,
supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be
considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,
881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting
demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862, disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal
v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287 [error to consider
contents of release not part of court record].) 
A
demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete
or discloses some defense that would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc.
v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of
the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are
incorporated by reference into the complaint, or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s
Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as
surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”]) 
A demurrer
can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner
v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of
Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108
Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)   
DISCUSSION – Demurrer 
Meet and Confer           
Per Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a),
Moving Parties were required to meet and confer in person or by telephone
before bringing a demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The Court
finds Moving Parties’ meet-and-confer efforts sufficient. (Caranikas Decl., ¶¶ 2-6.) 
            Third Cause of Action
– Intentional Misrepresentation/Fraud 
            To state a cause of action for intentional
misrepresentation, the plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating: “(1) a misrepresentation,
(2) knowledge
of falsity, (3) intent to induce reliance, (4) actual and justifiable
reliance, and (5) resulting damage.
[Citation.]” (Aton Ctr., Inc. v. United Healthcare Ins. Co. (2023) 93
Cal.App.5th 1214, 1245.) “In California, fraud must be pled specifically;
general and conclusory allegations do not suffice. [Citations.] ‘Thus ‘ “the
policy of liberal construction of the pleadings ... will not ordinarily be
invoked to sustain a pleading defective in any material respect.’ ‘ [Citation.]
[¶] This particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts which show
how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.’
[Citation.] A plaintiff's burden in asserting a fraud claim against a corporate
employer is even greater. In such a case, the plaintiff must ‘allege the names
of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations, their
authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it
was said or written.’ [Citation.]” (Lazar v. Superior Ct.
(1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) 
            Moving Parties demur to the Third Cause of Action for
intentional misrepresentation/fraud on the grounds that the TAC fails to state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Moving Parties contend they
owed no duty to Plaintiffs since the leases at issue cannot bind them as
property manager by simply listing them that way. They argue that the first and
third lease contain no signatures by Moving Parties, nor is there evidence that
they were a party to those contracts. Moving Parties further contend the
allegations in the TAC are conclusory and do not show a fiduciary duty to
Plaintiffs. Moving parties also contend the TAC fails to allege sufficiently
specific facts showing that they knew the alleged representations at issue were
false. 
            In opposition, Plaintiffs contend they have sufficiently
pleaded fraud. Plaintiffs  contend Moving
Parties’ arguments regarding the lease, the email, and their interpretation are
mere advocacy and do not relate to the demurrer. Plaintiffs also contend fraud
exists whether there is constructive fraud or not. 
            The Court finds the TAC alleges sufficient facts to state
a cause of action for intentional misrepresentation/fraud. The TAC alleges that
Georges on behalf of Prager misrepresented that Moving Parties were licensed
real estate brokers and would acts as property managers. (TAC, ¶¶ 11, 43-45.) The
TAC alleges that Moving Parties knew they were not licensed real estate brokers
or property managers but nonetheless held themselves out as such to Plaintiffs
when the respective parties entered into the subject lease agreements. (TAC, ¶¶
11, 14, 15, 43, 47-48.) The TAC also alleges that Moving Parties misrepresented
to Plaintiffs they would have money set aside for any repairs, and that they would
repair any damage to the property. (TAC, ¶¶ 14-15, 43, 50.) The TAC
alleges that Moving Parties knew the representations were false when made and
made such misrepresentation to induce Plaintiffs to rent the property to the Nicholas
and Cathy Simmons. (TAC, ¶¶ 11, 12, 14, 15, 43, 46, 48.) The TAC alleges Plaintiffs
relied on the representations in agreeing to rent the property to Nicholas and
Cathy Simmons. (TAC, ¶¶ 11, 12, 43, 50.) The TAC alleges Plaintiffs suffered
damage when the property was damaged and Moving Parties failed to turn over any
money or make repairs to the property. (TAC, ¶¶ 17, 18, 27, 28, 43, 50.) 
While the Court agrees with Moving Parties that the
TAC does not allege sufficient facts to demonstrate the existence of a
fiduciary relationship between Plaintiffs and Moving Parties for purposes of a
constructive fraud claim, (see Civ. Code § 2079.24; Michel v. Moore &
Associates, Inc. (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 756, 762 [“A broker has a fiduciary
duty to its client. [Citations.]”]; Younan v. Equifax, Inc. (1980) 111
Cal.App.3d 498, 489 [a fiduciary relationship is a necessary element for a
constructive fraud claim]), the TAC nevertheless sufficiently alleges an
intentional misrepresentation. 
             Based on the foregoing, the Court OVERRULES the demurrer to
the Third Cause of Action. 
LEGAL STANDARD – Motion to Strike 
“Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading may
serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof, but this
time limitation shall not apply to motions specified in subdivision (e).”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(2).) “The court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any
pleading. (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed
in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the
court.” (Id., § 436.) 
DISCUSSION – Motion to Strike 
Meet and Confer 
Per Code of Civil Procedure section
435.5, subdivision (a), Moving Parties were required to meet and confer
telephonically or in person before bringing this motion to strike. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a).) The Court finds Moving Parties’ efforts to meet and
confer sufficient. (Caranikas Decl., ¶¶ 2-6.) 
Irrelevant Allegations 
(b) An immaterial allegation in a pleading is any of
the following: 
(1) An allegation that is not essential to the statement of a claim or defense. 
(2) An allegation that is neither
pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise sufficient
claim or defense. 
(3) A demand for judgment requesting relief not
supported by the allegations of the complaint or cross-complaint. 
(c) An “immaterial allegation” means “irrelevant
matter” as that term is used in Section 436. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 431.10.) 
            The
Court notes that Moving Parties seek to strike many, if not most, of the same
portions of the TAC that Nicholas and Cathy moved to strike in their recent
motion, which motion the Court granted. (Order Re: Tentative Ruling (4/17/24).)
Accordingly, the Court grants the motion to strike as to request nos. 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16. 
The Court finds that request no. 2 - paragraph
14, page 4, lines 26-27, request no. 3 - paragraph 14, page 5, lines 1-2 and request
no. 9 - paragraph 14, page 5, line 18 are relevant to Plaintiffs’ claims
against Moving Parties and not inflammatory. Accordingly, the Court DENIES the
motion to strike as to request nos. 2, 3 and 9. 
Punitive Damages 
A claim for punitive damages is subject
to a motion to strike when the allegations fail to rise to the level of malice,
oppression or fraud necessary under Civil Code section 3294. (Turman v.
Turning Point of Central California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 64.) 
In light of the Court OVERRULING the
demurrer to the Third Cause of Action for Intentional Misrepresentation/Fraud, the
Court finds Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support an award for
punitive damages. (See Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a); Benson v. Southern
California Auto Sales, Inc. (2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 1198, 1208-1209 [“If the
deception was intentional, punitive damages are available. [Citation.]”]) 
Therefore, the Court DENIES the motion to
strike request no. 1, the prayer for relief for punitive damages. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court OVERRULES
Defendants Genitrix Georges and Prager Metis CPAs’ demurrer to the Third Cause
of Action for Intentional Misrepresentation/Fraud. 
The Court GRANTS the motion
to strike as to request nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16. The
Court DENIES the motion to strike as to request nos. 1, 2, 3 and 9. 
Given the
number and nature of allegations stricken, the Court orders Plaintiffs to file
and serve a Fourth Amended Complaint within 10 days of the Court’s order, solely
removing all of the allegations stricken in this Motion to strike by Georges
and Prager, as well as all of the allegations stricken in Michael Simmons and
Cathy Simmons’ motion to strike as ordered on April 17, 2024. Plaintiffs shall
not add any other facts or causes of action and shall only remove the stricken
allegations as ordered by the Court. 
All
Defendants shall file and serve an answer to the Fourth Amended Complaint
within 20 days of service of the Fourth Amended Complaint. 
             Plaintiffs
are ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of
this order.
