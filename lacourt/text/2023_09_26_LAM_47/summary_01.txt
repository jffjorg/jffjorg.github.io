Judge Traber's tentative ruling in this case grants the Defendant's motion to stay the lawsuit filed by Andrea Campos against Lucky Taro, Inc. pending the resolution of a separate arbitration involving overlapping claims. 

While the Court acknowledged that Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.4 does not automatically apply in this situation, the Judge exercised her inherent authority to control the proceedings and determined that a stay is necessary to prevent conflicting rulings and conserve judicial resources. The arbitration involves claims under the FEHA and California Labor Code, which are also at issue in Campos’ PAGA lawsuit. 

The Court scheduled a status conference for March 20, 2023, to monitor the progress of the arbitration and determine further steps.

And here is a written summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Andrea Campos v. Lucky Taro, Inc. The case involves allegations of wage and hour violations, including failure to provide meal and rest breaks, accurate wage statements, and timely payment of wages. The Defendant, Lucky Taro, Inc., has moved to stay the case pending resolution of a separate arbitration. The Judge has granted the motion, finding that a stay is warranted under the Court's inherent authority to control its own proceedings.

The Judge has scheduled a Status Conference Re: Resolution of Arbitration for March 20, 2023, at 8:30 AM. The Court has also ordered the case stayed pending resolution of the arbitration of Plaintiff's claims under the Labor Code and the Fair Employment and Housing Act.

The Judge's ruling is based on the finding that the arbitrator will be compelled to resolve issues that overlap with issues raised in Plaintiff's PAGA claims, and allowing the PAGA case to proceed to trial would risk conflicting rulings in the two proceedings. The Judge has also cited the importance of conserving the time and effort of the parties, counsel, and the Court in deciding to grant the stay.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Defendant's motion to stay the action pending resolution of the arbitration of the Plaintiff's claims under the Labor Code and the Fair Employment and Housing Act. The Plaintiff had filed a complaint under the Private Attorneys General Act, alleging that the Defendant had systematically denied its employees their full wages, timely paid wages, overtime, meal and rest breaks, and accurate wage statements. The Defendant had moved to stay the action, arguing that the Court should exercise its inherent authority to stay the action pending resolution of the arbitration. The Court agreed, finding that staying the action would conserve the time and effort of the parties, counsel, and the Court, and would avoid the risk of duplicative proceedings resulting in conflicting rulings. The Court set a status conference for March 20, 2023, to review the resolution of the arbitration. The Plaintiff had argued that the arbitration would not affect the PAGA claims, but the Court found that the arbitrator's decision could impact the Plaintiff's standing to assert the PAGA claims. The Court's decision is based on its inherent authority to control its own proceedings and to promote judicial efficiency.
