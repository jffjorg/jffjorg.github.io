And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Plaintiff Luis Angel Espinoza to the answer filed by Defendants County of Los Angeles and Ray Andrew Gurango. The Judge has OVERRULED the demurrer in part (as to the first, second, and fourteenth affirmative defenses), SUSTAINED it with leave in part (as to the third through thirteenth and fifteenth through twenty-first affirmative defenses), and SUSTAINED it without leave in part (as to the twenty-second affirmative defense).

The Judge has ruled that the affirmative defenses of failure to state cause of action, statute of limitations, fault of others, contributory fault, and others raise new matter and are therefore sustained with leave. However, the affirmative defense of "no speculative or future loss recovery" is not properly an affirmative defense and is therefore overruled. The Judge has also ruled that the twenty-second affirmative defense, which reserves the right to assert additional defenses, is an improper attempt at requesting an amendment and is therefore sustained without leave.

The Judge has set a Case Management Conference for December 4, 2023, and has ordered that the parties file any amended pleadings by that date.
