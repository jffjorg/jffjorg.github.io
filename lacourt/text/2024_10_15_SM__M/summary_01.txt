As for the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Razavi, who is suing Nigro and others for negligence, gross negligence, and fraudulent transfer. The defendants have demurred to the complaint, arguing that the claims fail to state a cause of action. The judge has ruled that the demurrer is not sustained as to the negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED) claim, finding that the allegations state a theory of recovery for a distinct primary right.

The judge has also ruled that the demurrer is sustained as to the gross negligence claim, finding that a cause of action for gross negligence is not an independent cause of action in the present circumstances.

The judge has ruled that the demurrer is not sustained as to the fraudulent transfer claims, finding that the allegations establish actual fraud and satisfy the requirements of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA).

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to strike the claim for punitive damages, finding that the allegations state a claim for malice or fraud as defined by Civil Code section 3294.

Overall, the judge has allowed the case to proceed on some of the claims, but has dismissed others. The case will be heard on October 15, 2024.
