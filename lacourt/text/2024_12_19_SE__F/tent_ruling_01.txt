  Case Number:  23NWCV03289    Hearing Date:   December 19, 2024    Dept:  F Tonia Andrus Flores et al. v. Safeco Insurance, Case No.
23NWCV03289
 
A case management conference was set in this uninsured
motorist action on June 27, 2024.  Because counsel for Plaintiff failed to
appear, the Court scheduled an OSC re Dismissal for plaintiff’s failure to
appear on today’s date.  The Court has reviewed the declarations submitted
by counsel and does not dismiss the case.  Plaintiff does not address the
sole issue before the court – Plaintiff’s failure to appear at the June 27 case
management conference – however, it is clear to the court that Plaintiff continues
to prosecute the case.
