Case No. 24PSCV00906
ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S DEMURRER
Defendant
Guotao Huang’s Demurrer to First Amended Complaint is OVERRULED.

Background 
Plaintiff
Shuangshuang Li (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
In March 2022, Plaintiff posted
on Chinese social media that she was seeking a contractor to remodel her
Diamond Bar home (the “property”). Guotao Huang (“Huang”) responded to
Plaintiff’s post on behalf of Vanke Home Remodel, Inc. (“Vanke”) and met with
Plaintiff at Plaintiff’s home in April 2022. Huang and Vanke (together,
“Defendants”) agreed to do the requested work for $110,000.00. Plaintiff paid
$65,000.00 up front, with the remainder to be paid upon completion of the work.
The work performed was substandard. In May 2022, before the work was completed,
a city inspector discovered the project and informed Plaintiff that a permit
had not been obtained and was required. Plaintiff told Defendants to restore
the property and to apply for a permit. Huang told Plaintiff they would not
complete work and demanded full payment. In June 2022, Huang filed a mechanic’s
lien on the property. 
On
September 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (the “Operative
Complaint” or “FAC”), asserting a breach of contract cause of action against
Huang, Vanke, and Does 1-10. 
Pending
before the Court is Huang’s demurrer to the Operative Complaint.  
Legal
Standard 
A demurrer may be made on the grounds that the
pleading, inter alia, does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action and/or is uncertain. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e) and (f).) 
When considering
demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only
allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis
for the claim against him. (Semole v.
Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer does not, however,
admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the
pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded therein, or facts
impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which a court may take
judicial knowledge.” (S. Shore Land Co.
v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations omitted].) 
Discussion
Huang
demurs, per Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10, subdivisions (e) and (f), to the
Operative Complaint, on the basis that it fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute causes of action and is uncertain.
The
Court first addresses Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice. A court may take
judicial notice of, among other things, “official acts of the legislative,
executive, and judicial departments of a state and of facts and propositions
that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and
accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable
accuracy.” (People v. Terry, 38 Cal. App. 3d 432, 439, 113 Cal. Rptr.
233, 237 (Ct. App. 1974) [citing Evid. Code § 452].) With this standard in
mind, the Court grants Plaintiff’s request to take judicial notice of the mechanic’s
lien.
Turning
to the merits of the demurrer, Huang argues that the Operative Complaint violates
the sham pleading doctrine because Plaintiff deleted alter ego allegations and
the phrase “on behalf of Vanke” that was present in Paragraph 9 of her original
complaint. The Court disagrees. “Under the sham pleading doctrine, allegations in an
original pleading that rendered it vulnerable to demurrer or other attack
cannot simply be omitted without explanation.” (Hahn v, Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 751.) “The doctrine is not intended to prevent honest
complainants from correcting erroneous allegations or to prevent the correction
of ambiguous facts.” (Id.)
The Operative Complaint
now contains an allegation that “HUANG has recorded a Mechanic’s Lien against
Plaintiff’s home, in which he declared, under penalty of perjury, that in doing
the work on Plaintiff’s home, he was using ‘VANKE HOME REMODL’ as a dba.” (FAC,
¶ 6.) The Court believes the foregoing allegation constitutes the “explanation”
needed for purposes of withstanding demurrer.
The
demurrer is overruled.
