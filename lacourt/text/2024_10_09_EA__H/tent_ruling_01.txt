Case No. 23PSCV02121
 ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO
COMPEL
Defendant Denis Heriberto
Chavarria’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories is
GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to provide further, Code-compliant responses
within 20 calendar days from the date of the notice of ruling. Sanctions are
awarded in the reduced amount of $935.00 and are payable within 30 calendar
days from the date of the notice of ruling.

Background
Plaintiff Lucio Alvarez
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that he sustained injuries and damages in a March 2, 2023
motor vehicle accident.
On December 1, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against Denis Heriberto Chavarria
(“Chavarria”), One Stop Pool Pros #1, Inc. (erroneously sued as One Stop Pool
Pros, Inc.) (“One Stop”), and Does 1-50 for (1) motor vehicle negligence, (2)
general negligence, (3) negligent entrustment, (4) respondeat superior, and (5)
negligent hiring/representation.
Pending
before the Court is Chavarria’s motion to compel further responses to special
interrogatories. For the reasons stated herein, the motion is granted.
Legal Standard
“[T]he propounding party may
move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems
that . . . (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete[,] (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate[, and/or that] (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit
or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
The motion must include a meet and confer
declaration which “state[s] facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt
at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2030.300, subd. (b)(1).) “In lieu of a separate statement
required under the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving
party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request and each response in
dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(2).)
Notice of the motion must be
provided “within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing. .
.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c).) The responding party has the
burden of justifying the objections to the requests. (Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.)
“The court shall impose a
monetary sanction. . . against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)
Discussion
Chavarria
moves the court for an order compelling Plaintiff’s further, verified responses
to Chavarria’s Special Interrogatories, Set No. One (i.e., Nos. 34, 37, 38 and
47-49). Chavarria also seeks monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and his
counsel of record in the amount of $3,660.00.
Chavarria’s
counsel Rodrigo Bozoghlian (“Bozoghlian”) represents as follows:

On
May 3, 2024, Chavarria served the subject discovery. (Bozoghlian Decl., ¶ 3,
Exh. 1.) May 31, 2024, Plaintiff served his responses to the subject discovery.
(Id., ¶ 4, Exh. 2.) On June 2, 2024, Bozoghlian sent a meet and confer
letter to Plaintiff’s counsel, requesting further responses by June 13, 2024. (Id.,
¶ 5, Exh. 3.) On June 12, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel declined to provide further
responses. (Id., ¶ 6, Exh. 4.) Chavarria requested, and obtained, an
Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) date, which proceeded on July 29, 2024;
however, Plaintiff’s counsel left the IDC before the Court could reach the
issues raised herein. (Id., ¶¶ 7-9, Exhs. 5 and 6.) The Court advised
Chavarria to proceed with filing the instant motion. (Id., ¶ 9.)
The
interrogatories at issue are Nos. 34, 37, 38, and 47-49. These interrogatories
seek the following information:
No.
34 asks Plaintiff to identify each and every facility where Plaintiff sought
treatment in the ten years before the subject accident to the same body parts
Plaintiff claims he injured in the subject accident.
No.
37 asks Plaintiff to identify all facts for any and all motor vehicle accidents
he was involved in during the ten years preceding the subject accident. No. 38
asks Plaintiff to identify all documents relating to this/these accident(s).
No.
47 asks Plaintiff to identify by date each and every occasion where he has been
away from his residence on vacation since the subject accident. No. 48 asks
Plaintiff to identify every place he visited for each occasion set forth in No.
47. No. 49 asks Plaintiff to identify every person that accompanied him to
every place he visited identified in No. 48.
Plaintiff
interposed the same response to each of the aforesaid interrogatories, as
follows: “Objection: Vague, ambiguous, overbroad, invasion of privacy,
irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery [of]
admissible evidence.”
Plaintiff’s
opposition focuses on his privacy and overbreadth objections. The Court
determines that neither objection is well-taken.
No. 34
is limited temporally to ten years and by subject matter to the same body parts
Plaintiff claimed he injured in the subject accident. Further, while plaintiffs
are not obligated to sacrifice all privacy to seek redress for a specific
physical, mental, or emotional injury, they “may not withhold information which
relates to any physical or mental condition which they have put in issue by
bringing this lawsuit.” (Britt v.
Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 864.) A further response is warranted.
Nos. 37
and 38 are limited temporally to ten years, while Nos. 47-49 are limited
temporally to the time subsequent to the subject accident. “The party asserting a privacy right must
establish a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable
expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened intrusion
that is serious.” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531,
552.) “The party seeking information may raise in response whatever legitimate
and important countervailing interests disclosure serves, while the party
seeking protection may identify feasible alternatives that serve the same interests
or protective measures that would diminish the loss of privacy. A court must
then balance these competing considerations.” (Id.) The Court need not
move on to a balancing of interests because the threshold requirements are
simply absent here.
The
Court grants the motion in full. Plaintiff is ordered to provide further,
Code-compliant responses within 20 calendar days from the date of the notice of
ruling.
Turning
to Chavarria’s request for sanctions, Chavarria seeks monetary sanctions
against Plaintiff and his counsel of record in the amount of $3,660.00
[calculated as follows: 5 hours preparing motion, plus 3 hours reviewing
opposition and preparing reply, plus 1 hour preparing for and attending hearing
at $400.00/hour, plus $60.00 filing fee].
Utilizing
a Lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court
finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs
incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is
$935.00 (i.e., 2.5 hours attorney time at $350.00/hour, plus $60.00 filing
fee). Sanctions are payable within 20 days from the date of the notice of
ruling.
