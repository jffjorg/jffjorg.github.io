And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrers and motion to strike filed by the defendants in a case involving the death of a patient at Pomona Valley Vista Care Center. The Court overrules the demurrer filed by Gary G. Sandhu, M.D. to the second cause of action (negligence based on medical malpractice), but grants his motion to strike certain portions of the First Amended Complaint. The Court sustains the demurrer filed by MJB Partners, LLC dba Pomona Vista Care Center to the first cause of action (elder abuse and neglect) and fourth cause of action (wrongful death). The Court finds that the First Amended Complaint does not adequately plead a cause of action for elder abuse and neglect, and that the element of causation has not been pled in the wrongful death cause of action. The Court will hear from the plaintiffs' counsel as to whether leave to amend the First Amended Complaint is requested and will require an offer of proof as to which causes of action, if any, will be pursued.
