Wright, et al., Case No. 24PSCV01136 
ORDER
ON DEMURRERDefendants’ demurrer
is sustained, with 20 days’ leave to amend. The First Amended Complaint filed
October 1, 2024 is hereby stricken. 

Background 
Plaintiff
Gulf Harbour Investments Corporation (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:

On April 7, 2005, a grant deed was recorded wherein
Campbell Wright and Danielle Avila-Wright (the “Borrowers”) were granted an
interest in the real property located at 2370 North San Benito Court in
Claremont (“subject property”). On December 4, 2006, Borrowers executed and
delivered a note and deed of trust to Indymac Bank, F.S.B. (“Indymac”); the latter
document was recorded on December 12, 2006. Plaintiff thereafter purchased the
loan and all interest in both the note and deed of trust. Indymac, however,
failed to record an Assignment of Deed of Trust to Plaintiff.  
On April 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
complaint, asserting causes of action against the Borrowers, Indymac, and Does 1-50
for (1) equitable assignment of lien, and (2) declaratory relief. 
On August 14, 2024, Indymac’s default
was entered. 
Pending before the Court is the
Borrowers’ demurrer to the complaint.
Legal
Standard 
A demurrer
may be made on the grounds that the pleading, inter alia, does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action and/or is uncertain. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e) and (f).) 
When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. In
a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only
allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis
for the claim against him. (Semole v.
Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer does not, however,
admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the
pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded therein, or facts
impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which a court may take
judicial knowledge.” (S. Shore Land Co.
v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations omitted].)
Discussion
Borrowers
demur to the first and second causes of action in Plaintiff’s complaint on the
basis that they both fail to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of
action and are uncertain.
The
Court is in receipt of Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint filed October 1,
2024. Although the aforementioned complaint was not filed in compliance with
Code of Civil Procedure section 472, subdivision (a) (i.e., “[a] party may
amend its pleading once without leave of the court at any time before the
answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion
to strike is filed but before the demurrer or motion to strike is heard if the
amended pleading is filed and served no later than the date for filing an
opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike. A party may amend the pleading after the date for filing an
opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike, upon stipulation by the
parties. . .”), the Court construes the filing, coupled with Plaintiff’s
lack of opposition to the instant demurrer, as a concession by Plaintiff that
the instant demurrer is meritorious. 
Based on the
foregoing circumstances, the Court will order the First Amended Complaint filed
October 1, 2024 stricken and sustain the instant demurrer with 20 days’ leave
to amend.
