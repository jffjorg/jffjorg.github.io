And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the complaint is sustained, with 20 days' leave to amend. The first amended complaint filed on October 1, 2024, is hereby stricken. The court construes the filing of the first amended complaint as a concession by the plaintiff that the instant demurrer is meritorious. The demurrer is based on the grounds that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. The court will sustain the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend, allowing the plaintiff to re-file a revised complaint that addresses the defects.
