And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Qihui Yang's motion to set aside the default judgment entered against her on September 5, 2024. Yang had argued that the default was improper due to lack of personal jurisdiction, citing improper electronic service of the summons and complaint. However, the judge found that Yang's counsel, Peter Deng, had been authorized to accept service on her behalf and had signed and returned a notice of acceptance via email. The judge also noted that Yang's counsel, Heidi Cheng, had spoken with Deng by phone and followed up with an email to confirm his representation and acceptance of service. As a result, the judge concluded that the default was proper and denied Yang's motion to set it aside.
