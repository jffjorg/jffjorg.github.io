Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling from a judge regarding a case between Plaintiff Shuangshuang Li and Defendant Guotao Huang and Vanke Home Remodel, Inc. The case involves a dispute over a contractor agreement for the remodeling of a home in Diamond Bar, California. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant failed to complete the work according to the agreed-upon price of $110,000.00 and that the Defendant subsequently filed a mechanic's lien against the property. The Defendant has filed a demurrer to the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint, arguing that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. The judge has denied the demurrer, finding that the Plaintiff's allegations sufficiently state a cause of action and that the Defendant's arguments are without merit.
