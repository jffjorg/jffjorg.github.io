And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Defendant Denis Heriberto Chavarria's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories. Plaintiff Lucio Alvarez is ordered to provide further, Code-compliant responses within 20 calendar days from the date of the notice of ruling. Sanctions are awarded in the reduced amount of $935.00 and are payable within 30 calendar days from the date of the notice of ruling.

The court finds that Plaintiff's objections to Chavarria's special interrogatories are not well-taken. The court determines that the interrogatories are limited to a specific time period and are relevant to the claims made by Plaintiff. Plaintiff's privacy and overbreadth objections are also rejected.

Chavarria's request for sanctions is reduced to $935.00, which is the total and reasonable amount of attorney's fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion.
