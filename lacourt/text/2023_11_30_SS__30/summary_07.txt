  - "Liability does not extend to mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities."
  - "Severe emotional distress means . . . emotional distress of such substantial quantity or enduring quality that no reasonable man in a civilized society should be expected to endure it."

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the third cause of action for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress. The Judge has sustained the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend, meaning that the Plaintiff will have the opportunity to re-file the claims with additional information.

The Judge's ruling is based on the fact that the Plaintiff's complaint does not sufficiently plead the elements of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Specifically, the complaint does not allege any extreme or outrageous conduct by the Defendant, nor does it provide sufficient facts to show that the Plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress.

The Judge has also denied the motion to strike the allegations regarding punitive damages, as the demurrer to the third cause of action is sustained and the motion to strike is therefore moot.

The Judge's ruling is significant because it highlights the importance of pleading the elements of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, including extreme and outrageous conduct, and severe emotional distress. It also emphasizes the need for specificity in pleading punitive damages claims.
