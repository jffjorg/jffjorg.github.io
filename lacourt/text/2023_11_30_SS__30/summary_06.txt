This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a court hearing on November 30, 2023. The case is Joseph K. Cofey vs. Metropolitan Transit Authority, and the judge is considering motions filed by the defendant. The defendant seeks judgment on the pleadings, motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and to deem request for admissions admitted. The judge grants the defendant's motions, finding that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state a cause of action and fails to identify a statutory basis for liability. The judge also orders the plaintiff to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery requests served on the defendant. The judge denies the defendant's request for sanctions, but notes that the plaintiff should include a prayer for relief in any amended pleading.
