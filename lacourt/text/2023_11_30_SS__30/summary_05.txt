Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer is overruled in part and sustained with 20 days leave to amend in part. The demurrer is overruled as to the first and second causes of action for premises liability and negligence, but sustained with leave to amend as to the third cause of action for negligent hiring, supervision, and retention. The Court finds that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to plead general negligence and premises liability against the defendant, but the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for negligent hiring, supervision, and retention. The defendant's demurrer was based on the argument that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain, but the Court rejects these arguments and finds that the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action for negligence and premises liability.
