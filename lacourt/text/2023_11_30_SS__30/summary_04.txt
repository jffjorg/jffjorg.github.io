The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting plaintiff DANA GANT's motion for leave to file an amended complaint. The amended complaint seeks to substitute fictitious defendants, Steve Patterson and his company Patterson Builders, into the lawsuit. The plaintiff believes that discovery responses received from defendant JULIE FRANKEL, Successor Trustee of the Frankel Family Trust, indicate that Patterson Builders was comparatively negligent with respect to open trenches on the Subject Property, which the plaintiff fell into and was injured. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to file the proposed amended complaint within 10 days of the order and to give notice to the moving party. The judge has granted the motion due to the well-established liberality with which amendments are to be allowed.
