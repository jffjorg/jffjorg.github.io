  Case Number:  21STCV07504    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  30 CHRISTOPHER MICHAEL DOWDING vs HILARY SUSAN ROSE, et al.Motion to Compel ComplianceTentativeThe motion is DENIED along with the request for sanctions.  Defendant Quality Rentals to give notice.DiscussionOn June 16, 2023, Plaintiff served discovery Requests to Quality Rentals, Inc. including Requests for Production. (Zeesman Decl., 3; Exh. A.) On August 7, 2023, Defendant served the discovery responses. (Id., Exh. B) Plaintiff now requests that Defendant Quality Rentals, Inc. be ordered to produce the documents responsive to the Requests for Production, Set One, requests Nos. 1-4, 8, 12-16, 20, 22, and 33-42, as the documents have been identified and no privilege log has been indicated and production has not been made.Plaintiff’s motion actually seeks further responses. As such, the parties must participate in an informal discovery conference, and meet and confer, then Plaintiff may move to compel further. The motion at hand, to compel compliance with a statement of compliance under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.320(a) provides, “If a party filing a response” thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling “in accordance with that party’s statement of compliance,” then a motion to compel compliance under this section is proper. Here, the responses provided by Defendant do not state Defendant will comply. Rather, the responses are either objections, or state that Defendant does not have the requested documents. Therefore, there is no statement of compliance here, making section 2031.320 inapplicable in the facts at hand. The only required showing is that the responding party failed to comply as agreed. (Standon Co., Inc. v. Superior Court (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 898, 903.) There was no agreement here.
