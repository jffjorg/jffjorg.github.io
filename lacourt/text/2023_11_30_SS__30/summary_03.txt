And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Jose Delacruz, Jr., has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Lourdes Roldan vs. Manuel Gallardo, Jr., et al. The case involves a motion to compel the deposition of Lourdes Roldan, which was granted. The Judge ordered Lourdes Roldan to appear for deposition within 20 days and to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $965 to Defendant within 20 days.

The deposition was previously incomplete due to insufficient phone battery, and all counsel agreed to continue it. However, Lourdes Roldan failed to appear for the second session of deposition, resulting in Defendant incurring $965 in court reporting and interpreter costs.

The Judge also granted Defendant's request for sanctions, but reduced the amount due to the simplicity of the motion and the fact that it was not opposed. The Judge cited CCP section 2025.450(g) and noted that Defendant is entitled to a second session of Lourdes Roldan's deposition.

The Judge also referred to the case of City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504, which holds that sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.
