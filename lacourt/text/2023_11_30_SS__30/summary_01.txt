Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to compel compliance and the request for sanctions. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, Christopher Michael Dowding, against the defendant, Hilary Susan Rose, et al, seeking to compel the defendant to produce specific documents in response to discovery requests. The defendant, Quality Rentals, Inc, had previously served discovery responses, but the plaintiff argues that the responses do not comply with their obligations. The judge finds that the defendant did not provide a statement of compliance, as required by the Code of Civil Procedure, and therefore the motion to compel compliance is not applicable. Instead, the parties must participate in an informal discovery conference and meet and confer before the plaintiff may move to compel further compliance.
