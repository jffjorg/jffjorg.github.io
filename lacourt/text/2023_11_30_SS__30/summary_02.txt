And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint to add new causes of action against the defendants. The plaintiff seeks to add causes of action for negligence per se under Government Code 815.6 and Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 62.104, et seq. against the defendants City of LA/LADWP and Bruffy's Inc. dba Bruffy's Tow. The plaintiff argues that she has discovered new information during discovery that shows both defendants had an interest in the subject property and failed to carry out their duties, which resulted in the plaintiff's injuries. The judge finds that the defendants will not be prejudiced by the amendment and that the plaintiff has complied with the relevant rules and has provided sufficient explanation for the amendment. The motion is granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to file the proposed amended complaint within 10 days.
