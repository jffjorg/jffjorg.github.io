And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Wesley Su v. AvantGarde Senior Living dba AvantGarde Senior Living of Tarzana. The case involves a demurrer with a motion to strike to the complaint, and the Judge is ruling on the defendant's motion to strike certain portions of the complaint.

The Judge sustains the defendant's demurrer to the second cause of action for elder abuse, finding that the plaintiff's allegations do not provide a sufficient factual basis to support the claim. The Judge also grants the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's claims for punitive damages, attorney fees, and treble damages, as well as the plaintiff's references to the California Health and Human Services Agency.

The Judge finds that the plaintiff's allegations of reckless neglect or corporate authorization or ratification are insufficient to support an elder abuse cause of action. The Judge also finds that the defendant's Executive Director and Administrator knew of and implemented policies regarding potential risk for falls, but failed to take reasonable corrective action resulting in the plaintiff's injuries.

The Judge notes that the statute governing treble damages, Civil Code §3345, has a non-health care focus and is primarily directed at economic loss rather than physical harm, and therefore does not provide a basis for treble damages in this case.
