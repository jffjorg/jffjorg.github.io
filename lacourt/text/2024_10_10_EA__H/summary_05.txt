And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on United Financial Casualty Company's motion to intervene on behalf of DLJMK until November 5, 2024. The company must file a supplemental declaration by October 30, 2024, providing evidence that DLJMK is a defunct corporation that was terminated. The judge is requiring this evidence because the company has previously stated that DLJMK is a defunct corporation, but has not provided any supporting documentation. The judge is allowing the company to intervene in the case because it has an interest in the matter, as it is an insurer of DLJMK, and the court may permit a nonparty to intervene if it has an interest in the matter or in the success of one of the parties.
