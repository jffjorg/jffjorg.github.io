Background
Plaintiff
Min Wang (“Plaintiff”) alleges that he sustained injuries and damages in a May
2, 2022 motor vehicle accident.
On
April 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting a negligence cause of
action against Bin Liu, DLJMK, Inc. (“DLJMK”), Zhi Qin Cai Zhang, and Does 1-25.
On
June 27, 2024, Plaintiff filed three “Amendment[s] to Complaint,” wherein MJKC,
Inc., JKM Warriors, Inc. and Katerine Lineth Cai Lane were substituted in lieu
of Does 1-3, respectively.
Pending
before the Court is United Financial
Casualty Company’s motion to intervene.
Legal Standard
 
“A
nonparty shall petition the court for leave to intervene by noticed motion or
ex parte application. The petition shall include a copy of the proposed
complaint in intervention or answer in intervention and set forth the grounds
upon which intervention rests.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 387, subd. (c).)  
 
“The
court shall, upon timely application, permit a nonparty to intervene in the
action or proceeding if either of the following conditions is satisfied: 
(A)
A provision of law confers an unconditional right to intervene. 
(B)
The person seeking intervention claims an interest relating to the property or
transaction that is the subject of the action and that person is so situated
that the disposition of the action may impair or impede that person’s ability
to protect that interest, unless that person’s interest is adequately
represented by one or more of the existing parties.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 387, subd. (d)(1).) 
 
“The
court may, upon timely application, permit a nonparty to intervene in the
action or proceeding if the person has an interest in the matter in litigation,
or in the success of either of the parties, or an interest against both.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 387, subd. (d)(2).)
 
Discussion 
Proposed Intervenor United Financial Casualty
Company (“Proposed Intervenor”) moves for an order to intervene on behalf of
its insured, DLJMK, to file an Answer-In-Intervention and to stay discovery
requests against DLJMK. 
“Intervention may . . . be allowed in the insurance
context, where third party claimants are involved, when the insurer is allowed
to take over in litigation if its insured is not defending an action, to avoid
harm to the insurer.” (Royal Indemnity Co. v. United Enterprises, Inc.
(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 194, 206.)
The only manner in which an insurer may defend or exercise the powers of its
insured suspended corporation is by intervening in the action under Code of
Civil Procedure section 387 and asserting any defenses on behalf of its
insured.  (Kaufman & Broad Communities, Inc. v. Performance Plastering, Inc.
(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 212, 220.)
 
“An insurer’s right to intervene in an
action against the insured, for personal injury or property damage, arises as a
result of Insurance Code section 11580[FN1].” (Reliance
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 383, 386.)
Proposed Intervenor asserts that DKJMK is a “defunct
corporation that was terminated.” (Motion, 3:28; see also, 7:1 and 8:4-5.)
Proposed Intervenor, however, fails to provide the court with any evidence in
support of this statement; accordingly, the court will continue the hearing on
the motion, to November 5, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
Proposed Intervenor’s counsel is instructed to file
and serve a supplemental declaration in this regard by no later than October
30, 2024.
