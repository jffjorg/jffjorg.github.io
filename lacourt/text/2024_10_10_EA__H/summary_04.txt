The plaintiff is seeking to compel the defendant to produce a person most qualified and custodian of records for deposition and is also seeking sanctions against the defendant and its counsel in the amount of $2,509.00.

The judge's ruling is based on the lack of reasonable and good faith meet and confer efforts by the parties.
