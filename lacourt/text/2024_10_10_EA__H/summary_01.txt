And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

In this ruling, the judge grants Loyola's motion to quash service of summons. The judge concludes that Loyola is not a true "Doe" defendant because the plaintiff, De Valdivia, was aware of Loyola's identity and contact information prior to filing the complaint. The judge finds that De Valdivia's assertion that he was ignorant of Loyola's identity and facts giving rise to liability prior to filing the complaint is inconsistent with the evidence, including the animal control report that identified Loyola as the dog's owner and listed his contact information. The judge also finds that De Valdivia's failure to amend the complaint to name Loyola as a defendant before the statute of limitations ran is fatal to his claim.
