[1] No separate statement has been filed,
and the motion does not set forth the exact contents of the RFPs. (The motion
directs the court to the argument and evidence in the Separate Statement.
Motion p. 5:9-11.) Though there is a file entitled ‘separate statement’ in the
docket, the document is the motion. Notwithstanding, as Defendant appears to
have received a SS as it provides its ‘responses’ to the SS, the court will
reference the SS filed by Defendant. 
 


[2] As with before,
Defendant argues that the motion should be denied for untimeliness. However,
and as with before, the parties engaged in numerous meet and confer efforts and
extended the deadline to file a formal motion.
