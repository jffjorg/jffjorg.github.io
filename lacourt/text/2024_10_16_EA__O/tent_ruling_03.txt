 Case Number:  23PSCV00658    Hearing Date:   October 16, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling   Lauren A. Landau, Esq. &  Downtown La Law Group is GRANTED, effective  upon [see below]. The court also requests Plaintiff’s Counsel to briefly  address the 11/18/24 discovery motion.    Background   This is a  personal injury case. Plaintiff RICHARD CASTRO alleges the following  against Defendants CHRIST EXTENDED HAND (“Church”); TABAWA MINDFULNESS AND  DETACHMENT CENTER (“Center”); and SEVIN DOE: On March 14, 2021, Plaintiff was a  patron at a certain premises and was attacked by Sevin Doe, who is alleged to  be an employee of the corporate defendants.[1]    On March 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed suit for: 1.      Assault 2.      Battery 3.      Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED) 4.      Negligence and 5.      Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention    On August 31, 2023, Defendant Church filed its answer.   On September 31, 2023, the Center filed its answer. (The  Answer was filed ‘pro per.’)   On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed the Church from  the complaint without prejudice.   On February 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed a ‘Notice of Change of  Handling Attorney.’   On March 6, 2024, the Center filed a Substitution of  Attorney naming Counsel Schloss as counsel.   On August 14, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed the instant  motion.   On August 15, 2024, the Center filed a Motion for Order  Establishing Admissions and for Monetary Sanctions Against Richard Castro.   Discussion   Plaintiffs’ Counsel seeks to be relieved on the “grounds that there  has been an irredeemable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship that  stands in the way of effective representation.” Should there be any prejudice  by granting the motion, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. Moreover, the  case was relatively new such that there is no imminent trial date. As for the  11/18/24 discovery motion directed to Plaintiff, Plaintiff has ample time to  retain new counsel. Notwithstanding, the court request Plaintiff’s Counsel to  briefly address the motion as the motion states that discovery was propounded  on 5/3/24 with an extension granted to 7/15/24, but to date, no discovery responses  have been provided, though it was Counsel’s obligation to do so.    Conclusion   Based on the foregoing, the motion is granted effective upon  service of motion and the court’s order upon all Plaintiff, Defendants, and all  other parties who have appeared.
