10. Unfair Competition ( Bus.& Prof. Code §17200); and 11. Intentional
Infliction Emotional Distress.
 
On December
7, 2022, Defendant filed its answer.
 
On July 5,
2023, Plaintiff filed a MOTION FOR ORDER COMEPLLING ANSWERS AND FURTHER ANSWERS
TO INTERROGATORIES AND FOR SANCTIONS, which the court granted (but no sanctions
imposed).
 
On July 24,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. 
 
On August 20,
2024, Defendant filed its opposition.
 
On August 26,
2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.
 
On September
3, 2024, the court held its hearing on the discovery motion and allowed for
supplemental discovery. Per the minute order, “Plaintiff's Counsel is
permitted to file supplemental Briefing - opposition due on or before September
30, 2024. Defense Counsel is permitted to file supplemental Briefing - reply
due on or before October 8, 2024.” 
 
On October 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a ‘Supplemental Reply to
Defendant’s Opposition to Motion for Order Compelling Production of Documents.’

 
Plaintiff’s
Counsel is Leonard Lopez and Defense Counsel is Tony R. Skogen. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
Plaintiff
seeks an order compelling production of documents. 
 
The
propounding party may bring a motion to compel production of documents if it
believes the responses received are evasive or incomplete, the attempt to
produce writings pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or inadequate, the statement of compliance is incomplete, or if the
objections raised are meritless or too general. (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.300(a); 2031.310(a).) The motion must be accompanied by a good-faith meet and confer declaration, (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2016.040), and be accompanied by a separate statement. (Cal. R.
Ct., rule 3.1345.)[1] 
 
As an
additional requirement only as to requests for production, the motion must set
forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(b)(1).) “[T]hat burden is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.”
(TBG Ins. Services Corp. v. Superior Court, 96 Cal. App. 4th 443, 447
(2002).) This can be shown in a declaration. (Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co.
v. Sup. Ct. (1991) 233 Cal.3rd 1138, 1141.) The opposing party bears the
burden of justifying any objections. (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255; Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002) 95
Cal.App.4th 92, 97-98.)  
 
Unless
extended, the motion must be filed “within 45 days of the
service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on
or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party waives any right
to compel a further response to the interrogatories.” (Code Civ.
Proc. 2030.300(c).); see also Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410 (“the time within which to make a motion to compel . . .
is mandatory and jurisdictional.”).) Else, the propounding party waives any right to compel a
further response to the interrogatories. (Id.).[2]
 
Discussion
 
On September
3, 2024, the court heard oral argument on the matter. The court’s tentative was
to continue the hearing for supplemental briefing. Per the minute order, “Plaintiff's
Counsel is permitted to file supplemental Briefing - opposition due on or
before September 30, 2024. Defense Counsel is permitted to file supplemental
Briefing - reply due on or before October 8, 2024.” (9/3/24 minute order emphasis
added.) However, on October 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed her supplemental briefing contending
that it is Defendant who has otherwise failed to timely submit a supplemental
brief. (See Supp. Brief p. 1:23-24 [“Defendant failed to serve or file a
supplemental Opposition, even after requesting the time to do so.”].) 
 

Putting aside technicalities,
Plaintiff’s supplemental brief merely reiterates what was stated before. To the
extent Plaintiff argues that the employees don’t have a reasonable expectation
of privacy because the term “confidential” is omitted from the work policy,
there need not an explicit designation that something is confidential for it be
under the purview of constitutional right to privacy. To the extent that
Plaintiff continues to seek unredacted notes, Plaintiff has not stated how the
unredacted comments (made about
Plaintiff by other individuals that were interviewed) does not address the
alleged sexual exploitation of brain injured patients. In fact, it is not even
clear whether the truth of such allegations is relevant as there is no
allegation that Plaintiff was terminated for fabricating such incidents.
These post hoc reasons for her termination were her “bringing gummies to
work” and “traveling out of state with a patient.” (Complaint ¶152.) 
 
With that, the court adheres to its analysis presented in
the 9/3/24 ruling, which is found below.

 
Plaintiff
seeks an order compelling Defendant to produce responses to Plaintiff’s Request
for Production of Documents, Set One (RFPs Nos. 1, 3, and 4). Specifically,
Plaintiff wants the unredacted notes of the Corporate Compliance Notes. 
 
Defendant
largely objects to further production of the unredacted notes because they do
not “bear any relevance to the subject matter.” (Opp. p. 5:20-25.) 
 
As relevance
is at issue, the court turns to the complaint. The complaint alleges in
relevant part the following:
 
-       
A
colleague of Plaintiff (not Plaintiff herself) filed an original complaint on
January 24, 2022 (¶35) which alleged that an employee sexually exploited a
brain-injured patient (¶26.) 
-       
On
February 25, 2022, there was the first meeting (‘Header A’ on p. 6 of complaint)/an
investigation into the foregoing complaint. (¶26.)
-       
Plaintiff
was called as a corroborating witness in that investigation. (¶26.) 
-       
At
that “first meeting” or investigation (on 2/25/22), Plaintiff also reported
her own grievance on Defendant’s failure to act on the complaint.
Specifically, that Defendant knew of the allegations for three weeks but
took no action. (¶32.)
-       
At
that meeting, Plaintiff in addition to asserting her own grievance also reported
additional allegations of sexual harassment of patients and employees.
(¶44.) (For clarity, the complaint does not alleged that Plaintiff was sexually
harassed.) 
 
-       
On
February 28, 2022, there was a second meeting (Complaint p. 13). “The initial questions
followed-up on Plaintiff’s reporting and grievance from the first meeting.”
(¶83.) Then, the subject of the second meeting was “suddenly changed” and the
investigation “now targeted Plaintiff.” (¶88.) 
 
-       
On
March 1, 2022, there was a third meeting. (¶120.) At this meeting, Plaintiff was terminated for
not being a team player and “unsatisfactory performance.” (¶¶123-125.) 
 
-       
“Plaintiff
reported being told that a senior employee, Gretchen Bashaw, warned another
person to “steer clear” of Plaintiff because she was “going down” after her
participation in the investigation.” (¶142.) 
 
Effectively,
the crux of the allegations and basis of the action is that
Plaintiff was terminated for reporting the sexual harassment, assault, abuse,
and exploitation of patients by employees. And portions of the notes concerning
Plaintiff or concerning the interviews with Plaintiff have been produced
without redaction. (See e.g., Opp. p. 2:7-9 [“All notes from the interview
with Plaintiff were produced in an unredacted form as were all comments made
about Plaintiff by other individuals that were interviewed..”].) 
 
To the extent
that Plaintiff seeks the unredacted portions of all the notes, those
were not produced because they are irrelevant and implicate third party
privacy concerns of employees and patients. (Opp. p. 2.) The right to privacy is qualified, not absolute and in
each case, the court must carefully balance the
right of privacy against
the need for discovery. (See
e.g., Valley Bank of Nevada v. Superior Court (1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, 657;
Alch v. Superior Court (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1412, 1422; Life
Technologies Corp. v. Superior Court (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 640, 653.) The burden is on “the party asserting a privacy
interest to establish its extent and the seriousness of the prospective
invasion,” and then the court must “weigh the countervailing interests the
opposing party identifies.” [Williams v. Sup.Ct. (Marshalls
of CA, LLC), supra, 3 C5th
at 557, 220 CR3d at 493-494] Here, however, Plaintiff’s rebuttal is essentially limited to the one
sentence: “Each of
these topics is directly relevant to Plaintiff’s theory of the case, since she
seeks to establish the truth of the sexual exploitation of brain injured
patients….” (Reply p. 3:13-14.) That does not satisfy Plaintiff’s burden. 
 
Therefore,
the motion is DENIED.  
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, as Plaintiff has not discussed a balancing test and its relevant
considerations, the motion is denied.
