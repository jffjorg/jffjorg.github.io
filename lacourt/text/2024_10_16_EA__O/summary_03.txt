And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by Plaintiff's Counsel to be relieved from the attorney-client relationship due to an irredeemable breakdown in the relationship. The judge believes that granting the motion will not cause prejudice to the case, as it was relatively new and there is no imminent trial date. The judge also requests Plaintiff's Counsel to address the 11/18/24 discovery motion, as discovery was propounded on 5/3/24 but no responses have been provided. The motion is granted effective upon service of the motion and the court's order upon all parties.
