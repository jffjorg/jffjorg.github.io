SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Defendants Jonathan Berdeguer (Berdeguer)
and Jennie Buchelly’s (Buchelly) (collectively, Defendants) tenancy at premises
owned by Plaintiff Larry Tran (Plaintiff). 
On 8/24/22, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendants for breach of
contract and common counts.  
 
On 10/11/22, Buchelly was personally served with the
summons and complaint.  (See Proof
of Service filed 3/15/23).  On 10/21/22,
Plaintiff filed an application to serve Berdeguer by publication.  On 3/15/23, proof of service by publication
was filed.  On 4/10/23, default was
entered against Defendants.  On 4/13/23,
default judgment was entered against Defendants.  
On 6/28/23, Defendants were personally served with
Applications and Order for Appearance and Examination.  (See Applications filed 5/19/23 and
Proofs of Service filed 7/10/23).  
 
On 10/10/23, Defendants filed the instant motion seeking
an order setting aside the default entered on 4/10/23 and default judgment
entered in this case on 4/13/23.  On
11/21/23, Plaintiff filed an opposition. 
There is no proof of service attached to the opposition.  On 11/27/23, Defendants filed and served a
reply to the opposition noting that the opposition was filed and served 2 days
late and requesting that the Court strike/not consider same.    
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendants’ request that the Court strike the late
opposition is denied.  Defendants have
not shown that they were prejudiced by the late filing or service.  Nor have Defendants requested a continuance
of the hearing so that they have more time to respond to the opposition.  Without considering the opposition, the
Court’s ruling on the motion would be the same. 

 
The  Court notes
that the declarations filed in support of the motion are not executed in
compliance with CCP 2015.5.  
 
Buchelly requests relief from the default and default
judgment under CCP 473(b) claiming that the default and default judgment were entered
as a result of her mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect.  Buchelly admits to being personally served on
10/11/22.  (Buchelly Decl. ¶5).  Buchelly then claims that she became sick
with Covid at the end of October and/or early November 2022, she was sick for
nearly three months and she forgot about being served until receiving “a notice
of examination.”  (Buchelly Decl.
¶¶8-10).  Attached to Buchelly’s
declaration is a photo taken on 11/10/22 of a home Covid test.  There is no medical documentation to
establish that the results are actually Buchelly’s or when the test was taken.  Even if the Court accepts as true that
Buchelly tested positive for Covid on or around 11/10/22, she had approximately
a month to respond to the complaint before such time.  As such, it does not appear that the default
was entered as a result of her illness but rather her inexcusable neglect in
failing to timely respond to the complaint. 

 
Additionally, Buchelly admits that she remembered the
lawsuit when she “received a notice of examination” which was personally served
on her on 6/28/23.  (See Buchelly
Decl. ¶9; Proof of Service filed 7/10/23). 
Buchelly fails to explain why she waited approximately 3 ½ months after
“remembering” being served with the summons and complaint to file the instant
motion for relief from default and default judgment.  (See Buchelly Decl., generally).  An application for relief under CCP 473(b)
based on a party’s own fault must be made within a reasonable time with six
months being the outer most time limit.  Therefore,
even if the Court found that Buchelly’s failure to timely respond to the
complaint was excusable due to her claimed illness, she failed to act within a
reasonable time to have the default and default judgment set aside once she
learned of same.    
 
CCP 473(d) allows the Court to set aside any void
judgment or order.  The default and
default judgment entered against Berdeguer are void due to lack of personal
jurisdiction.  There is no  evidence in the court file that Berdeguer was
properly served with the summons and complaint. 
Although Plaintiff filed an Application for Publication, there is no
court order allowing for service by publication as required.  See CCP 415.50.  The fact that Berdeguer may have had actual
notice of the action is not a substitute for proper service of process and is
insufficient to confer jurisdiction.  American
Express Centurion Bank (2011) 199 CA4th 383, 392.  Therefore, the default and default judgment
based on such service of the summons and complaint on Berdeguer are void
entitling him to have them set aside.    
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied as to Defendant Jennie Buchelly and
granted as to Defendant Jonathan Berdeguer.
