And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to set aside the default and default judgment against defendant Jonathan Berdeguer, finding that the default and default judgment were void due to lack of personal jurisdiction. The judge denies the motion as to defendant Jennie Buchelly, finding that her failure to timely respond to the complaint was not excusable. The judge notes that Buchelly admitted to being personally served with the summons and complaint in October 2022, but failed to respond to the complaint in a timely manner, even after she "remembered" the lawsuit in June 2023. The judge also notes that Buchelly's declaration lacks medical documentation to establish the authenticity of a Covid test result and that she failed to explain why she waited over three months to file the motion to set aside the default and default judgment.
