MOTION TO
COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES
(Form
Interrogatories, Set 1)
 
Motion filed on 7/20/23.
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Steffanie Stelnick
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Southern California Property
Management Company, Inc.
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
compelling Defendant Southern California Property Management Company, Inc. (SCPMC) to serve further responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set 1, Nos. 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4,
15.1, 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.6 and 17.1 as to Requests for Admissions Nos. 4, 5
and 14-53.  Additionally, Plaintiff
Steffanie Stelnick requests an award of sanctions against SCPMC and its attorney
in the amount of $5,828.25.  

 
RULING: The motion is granted, in part, and moot
or denied, in part, as set forth below.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiffs Steffanie Stelnick,
Todd Stelnick, and Southern California Real Estate Management, Inc.’s
(collectively, Plaintiffs) claim that Defendants Ryan House and Tamar House
have breached a Settlement Agreement that ended a prior lawsuit.  Plaintiffs contend that the Houses have
repeatedly breached the Settlement Agreement by engaging in competing activity
in violation of a non-compete clauses in the Settlement Agreement.  Plaintiffs’ operative Second Amended
Complaint contains causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract and (2)
Trademark Infringement (15 U.S.C. 1114(1)) against the Houses and others.  
 
On 3/21/23, Plaintiff Steffanie Stelnick (Ms. Stelnick)
served Form Interrogatories, Set 1, and Requests for Admissions, Set 1, on
Defendant Southern California Property Management Company, Inc. (SCPMC).  (Berkowitz Decl., Ex.1, 2).  Pursuant to an extension of time to respond,
on 5/3/23, SCPMC served responses to the Form Interrogatories and Requests for
Admissions.  (Berkowitz Decl.,
Ex.3-4).  On 5/18/23, Plaintiffs’ counsel
emailed a meet and confer letter to defense counsel regarding what she believed
to be deficiencies in the responses. 
(Berkowitz Decl., Ex.5).  On
5/24/23, defense counsel responded by granting a 30-day extension to file
motions to compel further responses and requested further meet and confer.  (Berkowitz Decl., Ex.6).  Counsel for the parties were unable to
schedule a mutually agreeable time to meet and confer.  (Berkowitz Decl. ¶6).  Therefore, on 7/20/23, Ms. Stelnick filed and
served the instant motion seeking an order compelling SCPMC to serve further
responses to Form Interrogatories, Set 1, Nos. 12.1,
12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 15.1, 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.6 and 17.1 as to Requests for
Admissions Nos. 4, 5 and 14-53. 
Additionally, Ms. Stelnick requests an award of sanctions against SCPMC
and its attorney in the amount of $5,828.25. 
SCPMC has opposed the motion and requests sanctions in the amount of $16,946.00 against Ms. Stelnick and her counsel.  Ms. Stelnick has filed a reply to the
opposition.  
 
On 11/14/23, Defendants filed a request to strike the
reply because it was filed late.  On the
same day, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a response to the request.  Because the reply was filed in time for the
Court to review same before the original 11/17/23 hearing date and Defendants
were not prejudiced by the late filing, the reply was considered in ruling on
this motion.  See CRC 3.1300(d).
 
ANALYSIS
 
CCP 2030.300 provides, in relevant part: 
 
“(a) On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following
apply:
(1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.
(2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate.
(3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.
(b)(1) A
motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section
2016.040.”
 
Ms. Stelnick contends that SCPMC’s responses to the
subject Form Interrogatories contain frivolous and meritless objections and
SCPMC failed to completely respond to Form Interrogatories 15.1 and 17.1. 
 
The opposition to the motion contends that except for the
issue of sanctions, the instant motion is moot because SCPMC served
supplemental responses on 10/30/23 consistent with this Court’s 8/14/23 ruling
on the motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set 1, as
against Ryan House.  (See Liu
Decl. ¶19, Ex.N).  SCPMC further contends
that Ms. Stelnick’s counsel failed to adequately respond to meet and confer
efforts to resolve the issues presented by this motion before SCPMC served its
supplemental responses on 10/30/23 and filed the opposition on 11/3/23.  (Liu Decl. ¶¶9-20, Ex.G-N).  The opposition also contends that Ms.
Stelnick and/or her counsel acted improperly by scheduling the hearings on the
instant motion and multiple other discovery motions on different days requiring
multiple appearances.  (See
Opposition, p.2:10-13; Liu Decl. ¶5).
 
The reply argues that the motion is not moot as certain
of the supplemental responses of SCPMC  (as
to Form Interrogatories 12.2, 12.3 and 12.4) are still deficient and the issue
of sanctions remains.  The reply also
notes that the second supplemental responses of Mr. House (which the opposition
claims were served in September 2023, but Ms. Stelnick’s counsel claims were
not received until the end of October 2023) did not resolve the issues in SCPMC’s
responses as they are two different defendants. 

 
Based on the opposition, including the supplemental
responses served on 10/30/23, the Court’s 8/14/23 ruling and the reply, it
appears that the motion is moot as to Form
Interrogatories 12.1, 15.1, 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.6 and 17.1 as to Requests for
Admissions Nos. 4, 5 and 14-53.  (See
Liu Decl., Ex.N; Reply, p.4:1-16).  To
the extent Ms. Stelnick may still contend the motion is not moot as to Form
Interrogatories 16.1,
16.2, 16.3 and 16.6 (the
motion as to Ryan House as to these interrogatories was denied), the request to
compel further responses to those interrogatories is denied for the same
reasons set forth in the Court’s 8/14/23 ruling as to Ryan House.   
 
SCPMC’s supplemental
responses to Form Interrogatories 12.2, 12.3 and 12.4 are still
deficient as they include objections which the Court noted in its ruling on Ms.
Stelnick’s motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set 1,
as to Ryan House were without merit.  (See
8/14/23 Minute Order, p.3).
 
As noted in the Court’s 11/16/23 ruling, it is the
Court’s reservation system which prohibits the scheduling of all of the motions
to compel on the same date.  As such, it
is not the fault of Plaintiffs’ counsel that the motions were originally
scheduled on separate dates.  As set
forth in the 8/16/23 Minute Order, the remaining discovery motions will now all
be heard on 12/4/23.  (See
11/16/23 Minute Order).    
 
The Court finds that imposing sanctions on either party
or their counsel under the circumstances would be unjust.  CCP 2030.300(d).  As noted above, the motion lacks merit as to
Form Interrogatories 16.1, 16.2, 16.3 and 16.6. 
SCPMG is not entitled to sanctions as it failed to serve further
responses until after the motion was filed and as noted above, certain of those
further responses are still deficient. 
The Court further notes that SCPMG’s request for $16,946.00 in sanctions
is confusing and excessive.  The motion
indicates that the amount includes the sanctions requested in the motion heard
on 11/16/23 and then indicates that if sanctions are awarded to Tamar House on
that motion, such amount can be deducted from the request on this motion.  (See Opposition, p.3, fn.1; Liu Decl.
¶21).  It is SCPMG’s responsibility to
clearly set forth the amount of sanctions sought in relation to each motion and
not require the Court to parse out which fees relate to which motion.  Additionally, as noted in the Court’s 8/16/23
ruling, SCPMG’s counsel is attempting to recover for his time  reviewing past discovery requests, responses,
and Court orders as well as researching and analyzing substantive and
procedural legal issues relating to the discovery requests which he is  required to do to meet both his and his
client’s discovery obligations.  (See
Liu Decl. ¶23; 11/16/23 Minute Order). 
If the Court found that SCPMG was entitled to recover sanctions (which
it did not), it would only be able to recover fees and costs related to the
motion, not fees incurred in properly responding to the discovery.   
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the Court’s 8/14/23 ruling, the supplemental
responses served on 10/30/23 and the reply (which only addresses deficiencies
in the supplemental responses as to Form Interrogatories 12.2, 12.3, 12.4), it
appears that the motion is moot as to Form Interrogatories  12.1, 15.1, 16.1, 16.2, 16.2, 16.6 and 17.1
as to Requests for Admissions Nos. 4, 5 and 14-53.  (See Liu Decl., Ex.N; Reply, p.4:1-16).  
 
To the extent Ms. Stelnick contends the motion is not
moot as to Form Interrogatories 16.1, 16.2, 16.3 and 16.6, the request to
compel further responses to those interrogatories is denied for the same
reasons set forth in the Court’s 8/14/23 ruling as to Ryan House.
 
The motion is granted as to Form Interrogatories 12.2,
12.3 and 12.4 as the supplemental responses served on 10/30/23 include improper
objections.  Further responses are due
within 30 days.  
 
Both parties’ requests for sanctions are denied.

on Defendant Tamar House (Ms. House). 
(Berkowitz Decl., Ex.1).  Pursuant

ANALYSIS
 
CCP 2033.220 provides: 
 
“(a) Each answer in a response to
requests for admission shall be as complete and straightforward as the
information reasonably available to the responding party permits.
(b) Each answer shall:
(1) Admit so much of the matter
involved in the request as is true, either as expressed in the request itself
or as reasonably and clearly qualified by the responding party.
(2) Deny so much of the matter
involved in the request as is untrue.
(3) Specify so much of the matter
involved in the request as to the truth of which the responding party
lacks sufficient information or knowledge.
(c) If a
responding party gives lack of information or knowledge as a reason for a
failure to admit all or part of a request for admission, that party shall state
in the answer that a reasonable inquiry concerning the matter in the particular
request has been made, and that the information known or readily obtainable is
insufficient to enable that party to admit the matter.”
 
CCP 2033.290, in relevant part: 
 
“(a) On receipt of a response to
requests for admissions, the party requesting admissions may move for an order
compelling a further response if that party deems that either or both of the
following apply:
(1) An answer to a particular
request is evasive or incomplete.
(2) An objection to a particular
request is without merit or too general.
(b)(1) A
motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section
2016.040.”
 
Ms. Stelnick contends that Ms. House’s responses to
Requests for Admissions 4, 5 and 8 are incomplete and include frivolous and
meritless objections.  
 
In opposition to the motion, Ms. House contends that Ms.
Stelnick’s counsel failed to adequately respond to meet and confer efforts to
resolve the issues presented by this motion before and after Ms. House served
her supplemental responses to the subject Requests for Admissions on
11/8/23.    (Liu Decl. ¶¶8-11, Ex.E-H).  The opposition also contends that Ms. Stelnick
and/or her counsel acted improperly by scheduling the hearings on the instant
motion and multiple other discovery motions on different days requiring
multiple appearances.  (See
Opposition, p.2:10-13; Liu Decl. ¶¶5, 19). 
As noted in the Court’s 11/16/23 ruling on another discovery motion, it
is the Court’s reservation system which prohibits the scheduling of all of the
motions to compel on the same date.  The
issue is now moot as the Court has consolidated the hearings on the remaining
discovery motions.    
 
 
The reply argues that the motion is not moot as Ms.
House’s supplemental responses to Requests for Admissions 4 and 5 still include
improper and unmeritorious objections and the supplemental response to Request
for Admission 8 is implausible.  
 
Request for Admission 4 asks Ms. House to “[a]dmit that
the AGREEMENT included certain ‘non-compete’ clauses prohibiting the HOUSES
from certain residential real-estate-related activity for two years in
specified geographic areas.”  Ms. House initially objected to the request “on the
grounds that it is vague and ambiguous.” 
In her supplemental response, Ms. House states:
 
“Responding Party objects to this
request on the ground that it is vague and ambiguous, particularly as to the
undefined phrases: ‘certain ‘non-compete’ clauses,’ ‘certain residential real-estate-related
activity,’ and ‘specified geographic areas.’ Responding Party admits the
AGREEMENT provides in relevant part: ‘Plaintiffs agree not to compete with
Defendants in the business of residential property management for two (2) years
in the Santa Clarita Valley, the San Fernando Valley, the Antelope Valley, Agua
Dolce, and Acton. Commercial property management and residential and commercial
leasing are specifically excluded from this agreement not to compete with
Defendants.’
 
To the extent required, Responding
Party denies the remainder of the request.”
 
The Court finds that Ms. House’s
initial response to Request for Admission 4 to be deficient as it fails to
provide any explanation as to how or why the request is vague and/or
ambiguous.  When the basis for these
objections is explained in the supplemental response, the Court finds them to
be valid.  Additionally, the Court finds
the substantive response included in the supplemental response to this request
to be sufficient.  
 
Request 5 asks Ms. House to “[a]dmit that the AGREEMENT
included a liquidated damages provision whereby the HOUSES would become liable
for $54,000 for each breach by the HOUSES of the non-compete clauses.”  Ms. House initially objected to the request
“on the grounds that it is vague and ambiguous.”  In her supplemental response, Ms. House
states:
 
“Responding Party objects to this
request on the ground that it is vague and ambiguous, particularly as to the
undefined phrases: ‘become liable,’ ‘each breach,’ and ‘non-compete clauses.’
Responding Party admits the AGREEMENT provides in relevant part: ‘In the event
Plaintiffs breach their obligation of non-competing, Plaintiffs agree to pay to
Defendants, as liquidated damages, the sum of $54,000 for each breach. The
Parties acknowledge that this provision for liquidated damages does not
constitute a penalty or forfeiture within the meaning of Civil Code §§3275 or
3369 or any other provision of California law. The Parties further acknowledge
that the payment of damages pursuant to this provision does not abrogate or
affect in any way the terms of this Agreement.’ 
 
To the extent required, Responding
Party denies the remainder of this request.”    
 
As with Request 4, the Court finds that Ms. House’s
initial response to Request for Admission 5 to be deficient as it fails to
provide any explanation as to how or why the request is vague and/or
ambiguous.  When the basis for these
objections is explained in the supplemental response, the Court finds them to be
valid.  Additionally, the Court finds the
substantive response included in the supplemental response to this request to
be sufficient.  
 
Request 8 asks Ms. House to “[a]dmit that, in or about
March 2021, Defendant TEAM HOUSE REAL ESTATE, INC. sent out a paid ‘promoted’
Tweet or similar social-media message stating in part, ‘We also help with
rentals so please let us know how we can help with your real estate needs!’  Ms. House initially responded to this request
by stating that she was “[u]nable to admit or deny.”  Ms. House’s supplemental response to Request
for Admission 8 states: 
 
“Responding Party lacks sufficient
information or knowledge to admit or deny this Request. A reasonable inquiry
regarding the matter in this Request has been made, and the information known
or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable Responding Party to admit the
matter.”
 
Ms. House’s initial response was deficient in that it did
not comply with CCP 2033.220(c).  The
supplemental response now complies with the statutory requirements.  Ms. Stelnick provides no authority which
would allow the Court to order Ms. House to further respond because her claim
of lack of information “is simply implausible here.”  (See Reply, p.4:17-22).  If Ms. Stelnick ultimately proves the truth
of the matter, she has remedies available if the Court determines that the  admission was of substantial importance, Ms.
House had no reasonable ground to believe that she would prevail on the matter
and there was no other good reason for Ms. House’s failure to admit.  See CCP 2033.420.
 
With regard to sanctions, Ms. House did not serve
supplemental responses until after the motion was filed forcing Ms. Stelnick to
incur fees and costs related to filing the motion.  On the other hand, Ms. Stelnick’s argument
that the supplemental responses are still inadequate is without merit.  As such, the Court finds that imposing
sanctions on either party or their counsel under the circumstances would be
unjust.  CCP 2033.290(d).  Even if the Court found that either party was
entitled to recover sanctions, the Court finds that the amounts requested by
both Ms. Stelnick ($5,828.25) and Ms. House ($6,387.50) to be excessive.    
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied. 
Both parties’ requests for sanctions is denied.

Request 8 asks Mr. House to “[a]dmit that, in or about
March 2021, Defendant TEAM HOUSE REAL ESTATE, INC. sent out a paid ‘promoted’
Tweet or similar social-media message stating in part, ‘We also help with
rentals so please let us know how we can help with your real estate needs!’  Mr. House initially responded to this request
by stating that she was “[u]nable to admit or deny.”  Mr. House’s supplemental response to Request
for Admission 8 states: 
 
“Responding Party lacks sufficient
information or knowledge to admit or deny this Request. A reasonable inquiry
regarding the matter in this Request has been made, and the information known
or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable Responding Party to admit the
matter.”
 
Mr. House’s initial response was deficient in that it did
not comply with CCP 2033.220(c).  The
supplemental response now complies with the statutory requirements.  Ms. Stelnick provides no authority which
would allow the Court to order Mr. House to further respond because her claim
of lack of information “is simply implausible here.”  (See Reply, p.4:17-22).  If Ms. Stelnick ultimately proves the truth
of the matter, she has remedies available if the Court determines that the  admission was of substantial importance, Mr.
House had no reasonable ground to believe that he would prevail on the matter
and there was no other good reason for Mr. House’s failure to admit.  See CCP 2033.420.
 
With regard to sanctions, Mr. House did not serve
supplemental responses until after the motion was filed forcing Ms. Stelnick to
incur fees and costs related to filing the motion.  On the other hand, Ms. Stelnick’s argument
that the supplemental responses are still inadequate is without merit.  As such, the Court finds that imposing
sanctions on either party or their counsel under the circumstances would be
unjust.  CCP 2033.290(d).  Even if the Court found that either party was
entitled to recover sanctions, the Court finds that the amounts requested by
both Ms. Stelnick ($5,828.25) and Mr. House ($10,100.00) to be excessive.    
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied. 
Both parties’ requests for sanctions is denied.

SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiffs Steffanie Stelnick,
Todd Stelnick, and Southern California Real Estate Management, Inc.’s
(collectively, Plaintiffs) claim that Defendants Ryan House and Tamar House
have breached a Settlement Agreement that ended a prior lawsuit.  Plaintiffs contend that the Houses have
repeatedly breached the Settlement Agreement by engaging in competing activity
in violation of a non-compete clauses in the Settlement Agreement.  Plaintiffs’ operative Second Amended
Complaint contains causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract and (2)
Trademark Infringement (15 U.S.C. 1114(1)) against the Houses and others.  
 
On 3/21/23, Plaintiff Steffanie Stelnick (Ms. Stelnick)
served Requests for Admissions, Set 1, 
on Defendant Southern California Property Management Company, Inc.
(SCPMC).  (Berkowitz Decl., Ex.1).  Pursuant to an extension of time to respond,
on 5/3/23, SCPMC served responses to the Requests for Admissions.  (Berkowitz Decl., Ex.2).  On 5/18/23, Plaintiffs’ counsel emailed a
meet and confer letter to defense counsel regarding what she believed to be
deficiencies in the responses. 
(Berkowitz Decl., Ex.3).  On
5/24/23, defense counsel responded by granting a 30-day extension to file
motions to compel further responses and requested further meet and confer.  (Berkowitz Decl., Ex.4).  Counsel for the parties were unable to
schedule a mutually agreeable time to meet and confer.  (Berkowitz Decl. ¶6).  Therefore, on 7/20/23, Ms. Stelnick filed and
served the instant motion seeking an order compelling SCPMC to serve further
responses to Requests for Admissions, Set 1, Nos. 4, 5 and 8.  Additionally, Ms. Stelnick requests an award
of sanctions against SCPMC and its attorney in the amount of $5,828.25.  
 
SCPMC has opposed the motion and requests sanctions in
the amount of $6,387.50 against Ms. Stelnick and her counsel.  Ms. Stelnick has filed a reply to the
opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
CCP 2033.220 provides: 
 
“(a) Each answer in a response to
requests for admission shall be as complete and straightforward as the
information reasonably available to the responding party permits.
(b) Each answer shall:
(1) Admit so much of the matter
involved in the request as is true, either as expressed in the request itself
or as reasonably and clearly qualified by the responding party.
(2) Deny so much of the matter
involved in the request as is untrue.
(3) Specify so much of the matter
involved in the request as to the truth of which the responding party
lacks sufficient information or knowledge.
(c) If a
responding party gives lack of information or knowledge as a reason for a
failure to admit all or part of a request for admission, that party shall state
in the answer that a reasonable inquiry concerning the matter in the particular
request has been made, and that the information known or readily obtainable is
insufficient to enable that party to admit the matter.”
 
CCP 2033.290, in relevant part: 
 
“(a) On receipt of a response to
requests for admissions, the party requesting admissions may move for an order
compelling a further response if that party deems that either or both of the
following apply:
(1) An answer to a particular
request is evasive or incomplete.
(2) An objection to a particular
request is without merit or too general.
(b)(1) A
motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section
2016.040.”
 
Ms. Stelnick contends that SCPMC’s responses to Requests
for Admissions 4, 5 and 8 are incomplete and include frivolous and meritless
objections.  
 
In opposition to the motion, SCPMC contends that Ms.
Stelnick’s counsel failed to adequately respond to meet and confer efforts to
resolve the issues presented by this motion before and after SCPMC served its supplemental
responses to the subject Requests for Admissions on 11/8/23.    (Liu
Decl. ¶¶8-11, Ex.E-H).  The opposition
also contends that Ms. Stelnick and/or her counsel acted improperly by
scheduling the hearings on the instant motion and multiple other discovery
motions on different days requiring multiple appearances.  (See Opposition, p.2:10-13; Liu Decl.
¶¶5, 19).  As noted in the Court’s
11/16/23 ruling on another discovery motion, it is the Court’s reservation
system which prohibits the scheduling of all of the motions to compel on the
same date.  The issue is now moot as the
Court has consolidated the hearings on the remaining discovery motions.    
 
 
The reply argues that the motion is not moot as SCPMC’s supplemental
responses to Requests for Admissions 4 and 5 still include improper and
unmeritorious objections and the supplemental response to Request for Admission
8 is implausible.  
 
Request for Admission 4 asks SCPMC to “[a]dmit that the
AGREEMENT included certain ‘non-compete’ clauses prohibiting the HOUSES from
certain residential real-estate-related activity for two years in specified
geographic areas.”  SCPMC initially objected to the request “on the grounds
that it is vague and ambiguous.”  In its supplemental
response, SCPMC states:
 
“Responding Party objects to this
request on the ground that it is vague and ambiguous, particularly as to the
undefined phrases: ‘certain ‘non-compete’ clauses,’ ‘certain residential real-estate-related
activity,’ and ‘specified geographic areas.’ Responding Party admits the
AGREEMENT provides in relevant part: ‘Plaintiffs agree not to compete with
Defendants in the business of residential property management for two (2) years
in the Santa Clarita Valley, the San Fernando Valley, the Antelope Valley, Agua
Dolce, and Acton. Commercial property management and residential and commercial
leasing are specifically excluded from this agreement not to compete with
Defendants.’
 
To the extent required, Responding
Party denies the remainder of the request.”
 
The Court finds that SCPMC’s initial
response to Request for Admission 4 to be deficient as it fails to provide any
explanation as to how or why the request is vague and/or ambiguous.  When the basis for these objections is
explained in the supplemental response, the Court finds them to be valid.  Additionally, the Court finds the substantive
response included in the supplemental response to this request to be
sufficient.  
 
Request 5 asks SCPMC to “[a]dmit that the AGREEMENT
included a liquidated damages provision whereby the HOUSES would become liable
for $54,000 for each breach by the HOUSES of the non-compete clauses.”  SCPMC initially objected to the request “on
the grounds that it is vague and ambiguous.” 
In its supplemental response, SCPMC states:
 
“Responding Party objects to this
request on the ground that it is vague and ambiguous, particularly as to the
undefined phrases: ‘become liable,’ ‘each breach,’ and ‘non-compete clauses.’
Responding Party admits the AGREEMENT provides in relevant part: ‘In the event
Plaintiffs breach their obligation of non-competing, Plaintiffs agree to pay to
Defendants, as liquidated damages, the sum of $54,000 for each breach. The
Parties acknowledge that this provision for liquidated damages does not
constitute a penalty or forfeiture within the meaning of Civil Code §§3275 or
3369 or any other provision of California law. The Parties further acknowledge
that the payment of damages pursuant to this provision does not abrogate or
affect in any way the terms of this Agreement.’ 
 
To the extent required, Responding
Party denies the remainder of this request.”    
 
As with Request 4, the Court finds that SCPMC’s initial
response to Request for Admission 5 to be deficient as it fails to provide any
explanation as to how or why the request is vague and/or ambiguous.  When the basis for these objections is
explained in the supplemental response, the Court finds them to be valid.  Additionally, the Court finds the substantive
response included in the supplemental response to this request to be
sufficient.  
 
Request 8 asks SCPMC to “[a]dmit that, in or about March
2021, Defendant TEAM HOUSE REAL ESTATE, INC. sent out a paid ‘promoted’ Tweet
or similar social-media message stating in part, ‘We also help with rentals so
please let us know how we can help with your real estate needs!’”  SCPMC initially responded to this request by
stating that it was “[u]nable to admit or deny.”  SCPMC’s supplemental response to Request for
Admission 8 states: 
 
“Responding Party lacks sufficient
information or knowledge to admit or deny this Request. A reasonable inquiry
regarding the matter in this Request has been made, and the information known
or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable Responding Party to admit the
matter.”
 
SCPMC’s initial response was deficient in that it did not
comply with CCP 2033.220(c).  The
supplemental response now complies with the statutory requirements.  Ms. Stelnick provides no authority which
would allow the Court to order SCPMC to further respond because its claim of
lack of information “is simply implausible here.”  (See Reply, p.4:17-22).  If Ms. Stelnick ultimately proves the truth
of the matter, she has remedies available if the Court determines that the  admission was of substantial importance, SCPMC
had no reasonable ground to believe that it would prevail on the matter and
there was no other good reason for SCPMC’s failure to admit.  See CCP 2033.420.
 
With regard to sanctions, SCPMC did not serve
supplemental responses until after the motion was filed forcing Ms. Stelnick to
incur fees and costs related to filing the motion.  On the other hand, Ms. Stelnick’s argument
that the supplemental responses are still inadequate is without merit.  As such, the Court finds that imposing

entitled to recover sanctions, the Court finds that the amounts requested by
both Ms. Stelnick ($5,828.25) and SCPMC ($6,387.50) to be excessive.

ANALYSIS
 
CCP 2031.210(a) provides: 
 
“(a) The party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling has been directed
shall respond separately to each item or category of item by any of the
following:
(1) A statement that the party will
comply with the particular demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling by the date set for the inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling pursuant to paragraph
(2) of subdivision (c) of Section 2031.030 and any related activities.
(2) A representation that the party
lacks the ability to comply with the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling of a particular item or
category of item.
(3) An objection to the particular
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling.”
 
CCP 2031.220 provides: 
 
“A statement that the party to
whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling has
been directed will comply with the particular demand shall state that the
production, inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, and
related activity demanded, will be
allowed either in whole or in part, and that all documents or things in the
demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party
and to which no objection is being made will be included in the production.”
 
CCP 2031.230 provides: 
 
“A representation of inability to
comply with the particular demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm that a diligent
search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that
demand. This statement shall also specify whether the inability to comply is
because the particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed,
has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the
possession, custody, or control of the responding party. The statement shall
set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization known or
believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that item or
category of item.”
 
CCP 2031.240 provides: 
 
“(a) If only part of an item or
category of item in a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
objectionable, the response shall contain a statement of compliance, or a
representation of inability to comply with respect to the remainder of that
item or category.
(b) If the responding party objects
to the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of an item or
category of item, the response shall do both of the following:
(1) Identify with particularity any
document, tangible thing, land, or electronically stored information falling
within any category of item in the demand to which an objection is being made.
(2) Set forth clearly the extent
of, and the specific ground for, the objection. If an objection is based on a
claim of privilege, the particular privilege invoked shall be stated. If an
objection is based on a claim that the information sought is protected work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010), that claim shall be expressly asserted.
(c)(1) If
an objection is based on a claim of privilege or a claim that the information
sought is protected work product, the response shall provide sufficient factual
information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including,
if necessary, a privilege log.
(2) It is
the intent of the Legislature to codify the concept of a privilege log as that
term is used in California case law. Nothing in this subdivision shall be
construed to constitute a substantive change in case law.”
 
CCP 2031.310 provides, in part: 
 
“(a) On receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding
party deems that any of the following apply:
(1) A statement of compliance with
the demand is incomplete.
(2) A representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
(3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.
(b) A motion under subdivision (a)
shall comply with each of the
following:
(1) The motion shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
demand.
(2) The motion shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.
(3) In lieu
of a separate statement required under the California Rules of Court, the court
may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request
and each response in dispute.”
 
The Court notes that Ms. Stelnick did not obtain Court
permission before filing the motion to allow her to submit a “concise outline”
rather than a separate statement in support of the motion.  See CCP 2031.310(b)(3).  The Court will allow the concise outline in
lieu of a separate statement in this circumstance.  However, in the future, the parties must
obtain prior court approval before submitting a concise outline instead of a
separate statement in support of a motion to compel further responses.   
 
Ms. Stelnick takes issue with Mr. House’s responses to
Requests 1, 6, 9, 12-38 and 40-68 because Mr. House
has stated that he will “produce, non-privileged documents in his possession,
custody, and control” leaving Ms. Stelnick to guess whether any documents are
being withheld on the basis of privilege. 
(Issue 1)  
 
Mr. House’s argument with regard to Issue 1 is confusing
at best.  The opposition seems to argue
that Mr. House has not specifically objected to each of the subject requests
based on privilege or indicated that documents are being withheld on the basis
of any privilege.  (See
Opposition, p.6:26-p.7:3).  However, the
opposition also argues that the objection is sufficient to satisfy the
requirements of CCP 2031.240(c)(1) which would seem to indicate that Mr. House
is specifically objecting to each of the subject requests on the basis of
privilege.  The general privilege
objection in Mr. House’s responses to the document requests states:
 
“Responding Party objects to these
requests to the extent they seek information that is protected from disclosure
by the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work
product doctrine, or any other applicable privileged or protected information.
To the extent that the requests may be construed as seeking such privileged or
protected information, Responding Party hereby claims such privilege and
invokes such privilege. The fact that Responding Party does not specifically
object to an individual request on the ground that it seeks such privileged or
protected information is not a waiver of the protection afforded by the
attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine, or any other applicable
privilege or protection.”    
 
The language in the foregoing general objection does not
satisfy the requirements of CCP 2031.240. 
The general objection fails to identify the particular privilege invoked
as to each of the subject requests.  CCP
2031.240(b)(2).  Rather, it leaves Ms.
Stelnick and the Court to guess whether any documents are being withheld based
on the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work product doctrine, or any
other unidentified applicable privilege. 
Additionally, contrary to the assertion in the opposition, the general privilege
objection does not provide sufficient factual information for Ms. Stelnick to
evaluate the merits of any privilege claim. 
(See Opposition, p.6:9-p.7:3); CCP 2031.240(c)(1). 
 
Ms. Stelnick has shown the requisite good cause
justifying the discovery is entitled to further responses to Requests 1, 6, 9,
12-38 and 40-68.  CCP 2031.310(a)(1),
(3), (b)(1).  If no documents are being
withheld on the basis of privilege, further responses eliminating the portion
of the responses indicating that “non-privileged documents” are being produced
is warranted.  If documents are being
withheld on the basis of privilege, further responses stating the particular
privilege(s) invoked along with sufficient factual information for the other
parties to evaluate the merits of the claim, including a privilege log, if
necessary, are required.  CCP
2031.240(b)(2), (c)(1). 
 
Ms. Stelnick also takes issue with the documents produced
in response to Requests 57-68.  (Issue
2).  Ms. Stelnick believes that Mr. House
has not produced all of the responsive documents he has with regard to these
requests.  Ms. Stelnick has not made the
proper motion nor cited the proper authority with regard to this issue.  Ms. Stelnick should have made a motion to
compel compliance under CCP 2031.320. 
Even if Ms. Stelnick had made the proper motion and/or cited the correct
statute for such relief, it could not be granted by the Court based on Ms.
Stelnick’s speculation that Mr. House has additional responsive documents.  The Court notes that Ms. Stelnick offers no
evidence (i.e., declaration, copies of the documents) to support her claim in
the reply that she has discovered additional responsive documents on her own.  (See Reply, p.3:11-16).  Rather, she merely claims that such documents
are included in her pending Application for Writ of Attachment without
specifying the documents or to which specific request they are responsive.  Nor has Ms. Stelnick definitively shown that
Mr. House has possession, custody and control of documents she purportedly
discovered on her own.     
 
The Court finds that it would be unjust to impose
sanctions on either party since neither was entirely successful on the
motion.  CCP 2031.310(h).  Therefore, both parties’ requests for
sanctions are denied.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted, in part, and denied, in part.  
 
Mr. House is ordered to provide further responses to
Requests 1, 6, 9, 12-38 and 40-68 within 30 days.   
 
The request to compel Mr. House to produce additional
documents in response to Requests 57-68 is denied.  
 
Both parties’ requests for sanctions are denied.

category of item in a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
objectionable, the response shall contain a statement of compliance, or a
representation of inability to comply with respect to the remainder of that
item or category.
(b) If the responding party objects
to the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of an item or
category of item, the response shall do both of the following:
(1) Identify with particularity any
document, tangible thing, land, or electronically stored information falling
within any category of item in the demand to which an objection is being made.
(2) Set forth clearly the extent
of, and the specific ground for, the objection. If an objection is based on a
claim of privilege, the particular privilege invoked shall be stated. If an
objection is based on a claim that the information sought is protected work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010), that claim shall be expressly asserted.
(c)(1) If
an objection is based on a claim of privilege or a claim that the information
sought is protected work product, the response shall provide sufficient factual
information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including,
if necessary, a privilege log.
(2) It is
the intent of the Legislature to codify the concept of a privilege log as that
term is used in California case law. Nothing in this subdivision shall be
construed to constitute a substantive change in case law.”
 
CCP 2031.310 provides, in part: 
 
“(a) On receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding
party deems that any of the following apply:
(1) A statement of compliance with
the demand is incomplete.
(2) A representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
(3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.
(b) A motion under subdivision (a)
shall comply with each of the
following:
(1) The motion shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
demand.
(2) The motion shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.
(3) In lieu
of a separate statement required under the California Rules of Court, the court
may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request
and each response in dispute.”
 
The Court notes that Ms. Stelnick did not obtain Court
permission before filing the motion to allow her to submit a “concise outline”
rather than a separate statement in support of the motion.  See CCP 2031.310(b)(3).  The Court will allow the concise outline in
lieu of a separate statement in this circumstance.  However, in the future, the parties must
obtain prior court approval before submitting a concise outline instead of a
separate statement in support of a motion to compel further responses.   
 
Ms. Stelnick takes issue with Ms. House’s responses to
Requests 1, 6, 9, 12-38 and 40-68 because Ms. House
has stated that she will “produce, non-privileged documents in her possession,
custody, and control” leaving Ms. Stelnick to guess whether any documents are
being withheld on the basis of privilege. 
(Issue 1)  
 
Ms. House’s argument with regard to Issue 1 is confusing
at best.  The opposition seems to argue
that Ms. House has not specifically objected to each of the subject requests
based on privilege or indicated that documents are being withheld on the basis
of any privilege.  (See
Opposition, p.6:24-28).  However, the
opposition also argues that the objection is sufficient to satisfy the
requirements of CCP 2031.240(c)(1) which would seem to indicate that Ms. House
is specifically objecting to each of the subject requests on the basis of
privilege.  The general privilege
objection in Ms. House’s responses to the document requests states:
 
“Responding Party objects to these
requests to the extent they seek information that is protected from disclosure
by the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work
product doctrine, or any other applicable privileged or protected information.
To the extent that the requests may be construed as seeking such privileged or
protected information, Responding Party hereby claims such privilege and
invokes such privilege. The fact that Responding Party does not specifically
object to an individual request on the ground that it seeks such privileged or
protected information is not a waiver of the protection afforded by the
attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine, or any other applicable
privilege or protection.”    
 
The language in the foregoing general objection does not
satisfy the requirements of CCP 2031.240. 
The general objection fails to identify the particular privilege invoked
as to each of the subject requests.  CCP
2031.240(b)(2).  Rather, it leaves Ms.
Stelnick and the Court to guess whether any documents are being withheld based
on the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work product doctrine, or any
other unidentified applicable privilege. 
Additionally, contrary to the assertion in the opposition, the general privilege
objection does not provide sufficient factual information for Ms. Stelnick to
evaluate the merits of any privilege claim. 
(See Opposition, p.6:9-p.7:3); CCP 2031.240(c)(1). 
 
Ms. Stelnick has shown the
requisite good cause justifying the discovery is entitled to further responses
to Requests 1,
6, 9, 12-38 and 40-68.  CCP 2031.310(a)(1), (3), (b)(1).  If no documents are being withheld on the
basis of privilege, further responses eliminating the portion of the responses
indicating that “non-privileged documents” are being produced is warranted.  If documents are being withheld on the basis
of privilege, further responses stating the particular privilege(s) invoked
along with sufficient factual information for the other parties to evaluate the
merits of the claim, including a privilege log, if necessary, are required.  CCP 2031.240(b)(2), (c)(1). 
 
Ms. Stelnick also takes issue with the documents produced
in response to Requests 57-68.  (Issue
2).  Ms. Stelnick believes that Ms. House
has not produced all of the responsive documents she has with regard to these
requests.  Ms. Stelnick has not made the
proper motion nor cited the proper authority with regard to this issue.  Ms. Stelnick should have made a motion to
compel compliance under CCP 2031.320. 
Even if Ms. Stelnick had made the proper motion and/or cited the correct
statute for such relief, it could not be granted by the Court based on Ms.
Stelnick’s speculation that Ms. House has additional responsive documents.  The Court notes that Ms. Stelnick offers no
evidence (i.e., declaration, copies of the documents) to support her claim in
the reply that she has discovered additional responsive documents on her own.  (See Reply, p.3:11-16).  Rather, she merely claims that such documents
are included in her pending Application for Writ of Attachment without
specifying the documents or to which specific request they are responsive.  Nor has Ms. Stelnick definitively shown that
Ms. House has possession, custody and control of documents she purportedly
discovered on her own.     
 
The Court finds that it would be unjust to impose
sanctions on either party since neither was entirely successful on the
motion.  CCP 2031.310(h).  Therefore, both parties’ requests for
sanctions are denied.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted, in part, and denied, in part.  
 
Ms. House is ordered to provide further responses to
Requests 1, 6, 9, 12-38 and 40-68 within 30 days.   
 
The request to compel Ms. House to produce additional
documents in response to Requests 57-68 is denied.  
 
Both parties’ requests for sanctions are denied.

MOTION TO
COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES
(Requests for Production,
Set 1)
 
Motion filed on 7/20/23.
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Steffanie Stelnick
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Southern California Property
Management Company, Inc.
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order compelling
Defendant Southern California Property Management
Company, Inc. to serve further responses to Requests for Production,
Set 1.  Additionally,
Plaintiff Steffanie Stelnick requests an award of sanctions against Defendant Southern California Property Management Company, Inc. and
its attorney in the amount of $5,828.25. 

 
RULING: The motion is granted, in part, and
denied, in part.  Both parties’ requests
for sanctions are denied.    
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiffs Steffanie Stelnick,
Todd Stelnick, and Southern California Real Estate Management, Inc.’s
(collectively, Plaintiffs) claim that Defendants Ryan House and Tamar House
have breached a Settlement Agreement that ended a prior lawsuit.  Plaintiffs contend that the Houses have
repeatedly breached the Settlement Agreement by engaging in competing activity
in violation of a non-compete clauses in the Settlement Agreement.  Plaintiffs’ operative Second Amended
Complaint contains causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract and (2)
Trademark Infringement (15 U.S.C. 1114(1)) against the Houses and others.  
 
On 3/21/23, Plaintiff Steffanie Stelnick (Ms. Stelnick)
served Requests for Production, Set 1, 
on Defendant Southern California Property Management Company, Inc.  (SCPMC). 
(Berkowitz Decl., Ex.1).  Pursuant
to an extension of time to respond, on 5/3/23, SCPMC served responses to the Requests
for Production and produced documents. 
(Berkowitz Decl., Ex.2, 3).  On
5/18/23, Plaintiffs’ counsel emailed a meet and confer letter to defense
counsel regarding what she believed to be deficiencies in the responses.  (Berkowitz Decl., Ex.4).  On 5/24/23, defense counsel responded by
granting a 30-day extension to file motions to compel further responses and
requested further meet and confer. 
(Berkowitz Decl., Ex.5).  Counsel
for the parties were unable to schedule a mutually agreeable time to meet and
confer.  (Berkowitz Decl. ¶6).  Therefore, on 7/20/23, Ms. Stelnick filed and
served the instant motion seeking an order compelling SCPMC to serve further
responses to Requests for Production, Set 1. 
Additionally, Ms. Stelnick requests an award of sanctions against SCPMC
and its attorney in the amount of $5,828.25. 

 
SCPMC has opposed the motion and requests sanctions in
the amount of $3,250.00 against Ms. Stelnick and her counsel.  Ms. Stelnick has filed a reply to the
opposition.  
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
CCP 2031.210(a) provides: 
 
“(a) The party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling has been directed
shall respond separately to each item or category of item by any of the
following:
(1) A statement that the party will
comply with the particular demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling by the date set for the inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling pursuant to paragraph
(2) of subdivision (c) of Section 2031.030 and any related activities.
(2) A representation that the party
lacks the ability to comply with the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling of a particular item or
category of item.
(3) An objection to the particular
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling.”
 
CCP 2031.220 provides: 
 
“A statement that the party to
whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling has
been directed will comply with the particular demand shall state that the
production, inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, and
related activity demanded, will be
allowed either in whole or in part, and that all documents or things in the
demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party
and to which no objection is being made will be included in the production.”
 
CCP 2031.230 provides: 
 
“A representation of inability to
comply with the particular demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm that a diligent
search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that
demand. This statement shall also specify whether the inability to comply is
because the particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed,
has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the
possession, custody, or control of the responding party. The statement shall
set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization known or
believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that item or
category of item.”
 
CCP 2031.240 provides: 
 
“(a) If only part of an item or
category of item in a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
objectionable, the response shall contain a statement of compliance, or a
representation of inability to comply with respect to the remainder of that
item or category.
(b) If the responding party objects
to the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of an item or
category of item, the response shall do both of the following:
(1) Identify with particularity any
document, tangible thing, land, or electronically stored information falling
within any category of item in the demand to which an objection is being made.
(2) Set forth clearly the extent
of, and the specific ground for, the objection. If an objection is based on a
claim of privilege, the particular privilege invoked shall be stated. If an
objection is based on a claim that the information sought is protected work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010), that claim shall be expressly asserted.
(c)(1) If
an objection is based on a claim of privilege or a claim that the information
sought is protected work product, the response shall provide sufficient factual
information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including,
if necessary, a privilege log.
(2) It is
the intent of the Legislature to codify the concept of a privilege log as that
term is used in California case law. Nothing in this subdivision shall be
construed to constitute a substantive change in case law.”
 
CCP 2031.310 provides, in part: 
 
“(a) On receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding
party deems that any of the following apply:
(1) A statement of compliance with
the demand is incomplete.
(2) A representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
(3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.
(b) A motion under subdivision (a)
shall comply with each of the
following:
(1) The motion shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
demand.
(2) The motion shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.
(3) In lieu
of a separate statement required under the California Rules of Court, the court
may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request
and each response in dispute.”
 
The Court notes that Ms. Stelnick did not obtain Court
permission before filing the motion to allow her to submit a “concise outline”
rather than a separate statement in support of the motion.  See CCP 2031.310(b)(3).  The Court will allow the concise outline in
lieu of a separate statement in this circumstance.  However, in the future, the parties must
obtain prior court approval before submitting a concise outline instead of a
separate statement in support of a motion to compel further responses.   
 
Ms. Stelnick takes issue with SCPMC’s responses to
Requests 1, 6, 9, 12-38 and 40-68 because SCPMC has
stated that it will “produce, non-privileged documents in her possession,
custody, and control” leaving Ms. Stelnick to guess whether any documents are

objection is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of CCP 2031.240(c)(1) which
would seem to indicate that Ms. House is specifically objecting to each of the

The general privilege objection in SCPMC’s responses to the document
requests states:
 
“Responding Party objects to these

product doctrine, or any other applicable privileged or protected information.
To the extent that the requests may be construed as seeking such privileged or

The language in the foregoing general objection does not

as to each of the subject requests.  CCP
2031.240(b)(2).  Rather, it leaves Ms.

(See Opposition, p.6:9-p.7:3); CCP 2031.240(c)(1). 
 
Ms. Stelnick has shown the
requisite good cause justifying the discovery and is entitled to further
responses to Requests 1, 6, 9, 12-38 and 40-68. 
CCP 2031.310(a)(1),
(3), (b)(1).  If no documents are
being withheld on the basis of privilege, further responses eliminating the
portion of the responses indicating that “non-privileged documents” are being
produced is warranted.  If documents are
being withheld on the basis of privilege, further responses stating the
particular privilege(s) invoked along with sufficient factual information for
the other parties to evaluate the merits of the claim, including a privilege
log, if necessary, are required.  CCP
2031.240(b)(2), (c)(1). 
 
Ms. Stelnick also takes issue with the documents produced
in response to Requests 57-68.  (Issue
2).  Ms. Stelnick believes that SCPMC has

sanctions are denied.  
 
CONCLUSION

SCPMC is ordered to provide further responses to Requests
1, 6, 9, 12-38 and 40-68 within 30 days.
