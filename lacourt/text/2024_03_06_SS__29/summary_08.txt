And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for a deemed-admitted order without prejudice. The defendant had served the plaintiff with requests for admission on November 17, 2023, but the plaintiff did not respond. The defendant then filed a motion to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission. However, the judge found that the motion was not properly served on the plaintiff, who is representing herself, and therefore denied the motion without prejudice. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's failure to respond to the requests for admission waived all objections and mandated the imposition of a monetary sanction.
