 Case Number:  23STCV29440    Hearing Date:   March 6, 2024    Dept:  29 Demurrer filed by Defendant Los Angeles Unified School
District. 
 
Tentative
 
The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend.
 
Background
Plaintiff Penny Lavitt alleges that she was
seriously injured on June 9, 2023, when a student at Mt. Washington Elementary
School “ran full speed off the yard and collided with her.”  (Complaint, ¶ 8.)  Plaintiffs Penny Lavitt and Martin Lavitt
(“Plaintiffs”) filed their complaint on November 30, 2023, against Los Angeles
Unified School District (“LAUSD”) and Does 1 through 25 asserting causes of
action for negligence, failure to perform mandatory duty, and loss of
consortium.
On February 2, 2024, LAUSD filed this
demurrer. 
Plaintiffs have not filed any opposition to
the demurrer.  On February 20, 2024,
however, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint (the “FAC”).  In the FAC, Plaintiffs assert statutory causes
of action under the Government Code for dangerous condition and failure to supervise,
as well as a common law cause of action for loss of consortium.  It appears that Plaintiffs did not serve the
FAC until February 26.
LAUSD filed a reply in support of the
demurrer on February 28, 2024.
Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration on
March 4, 2024.  The Court would normally
disregard such an authorized sur-reply, but the Court will consider (subject to
any response of LAUSD) the factual representations of counsel that Plaintiff
did not serve LAUSD with the FAC on February 20; that this was “due to a
miscommunication in our office””; and that the FAC was not served until February
26.  (Bostwick Decl., ¶¶ 7, 10.)
Legal
Standard
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not
fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party's pleading
(complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10; see Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the
function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and
for purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are
assumed to be true. (Id.)  
A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116
Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be
considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,
881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting
demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co.
(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal
v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider
contents of release not part of court record].)  
A demurrer can be utilized where the
“face of the complaint” itself is incomplete or discloses some defense that
would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001)
94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of the complaint” includes
material contained in attached exhibits that are incorporated by reference into
the complaint; or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v.
Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and
accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the
pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”]).  
A demurrer can only be sustained when
it disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev.
Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) 
"Before filing a demurrer
pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person
or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41(a).)
“A party
may amend its pleading once without leave of the court at any time before the answer,
demurrer, or motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike
is filed but before the demurrer or motion to strike is heard if the amended
pleading is filed and served no later than the date for filing an opposition to
the demurrer or motion to strike. A party may amend the pleading after the date
for filing an opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike, upon stipulation
by the parties. The time for responding to an amended pleading shall be
computed from the date of service of the amended pleading.” (Code of Civ. Proc.,
§ 472, subd. (a).)
Meet and
Confer
LAUSD
satisfied the statutory meet and confer requirement.  (Noeil Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
Discussion
Plaintiffs filed the FAC timely on February
20, but they did not serve LAUSD until February 26, after their opposition was
due.  A party has a right to amend its
pleading once without leave to amend if it files and serves by the time an
opposition to a demurrer is due. Plaintiff was untimely with serving Defendant,
and did not obtain either leave from the Court or a stipulation from LAUSD. 
As such, the FAC was not timely filed, and the
Court will evaluate Defendant’s demurrer to the Complaint.
LAUSD contends
that Plaintiff has failed to plead facts demonstrating that they presented a
claim to LAUDS in accordance with the Claims Act. (Motion, 4:7-9.) LAUSD argues
it is a “local public entity,” under Government Code section 900.4, and as
such, a claim is barred until a written claim has been presented to the public
entity and have been acted upon or rejected by that entity in accordance with
Government Code section 945.4. 
The Court finds
that Plaintiff has not pled sufficient facts in their complaint to show it
filed an administrative claim against LAUSD. 
Therefore, LAUSD’s
demurrer is SUSTAINED.
The Court grants
Plaintiffs leave to amend within 21 days.
Conclusion
The Court SUSTAINS
the demurrer with leave to amend. 
The Court GRANTS
Plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint within 21 days of notice.
Moving Party is
to give notice.
