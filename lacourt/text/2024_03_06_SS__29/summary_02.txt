And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions against the defendants. The judge finds that the defendants' failure to provide responses to discovery requests is substantial discovery abuse, but that the plaintiff has not made a showing of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process or a history of abuse that would warrant a terminating sanction. The judge has granted the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $510, based on 1.5 hours of attorney work and a reasonable billing rate of $300 per hour. The judge's decision is without prejudice to the plaintiff seeking other sanctions or seeking a terminating sanction at a later stage of the proceedings.
