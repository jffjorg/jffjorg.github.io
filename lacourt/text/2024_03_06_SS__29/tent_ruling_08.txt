 Case Number:  22STCV32003    Hearing Date:   March 6, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion for a Deemed-Admitted Order 
 
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On September 30, 2022, Plaintiff Emily Givhan (“Plaintiff”) filed
her complaint against Food 4 Less of California Inc., dba Food 4 Less, Katrina
Hernandez, and Does 1 through 100 for Negligence and Premises Liability for
injuries Plaintiff alleged sustained on October 6, 2021.  
On October 19, 2022, Defendant Alpha Beta Company dba Food 4 Less
(erroneously sued as Food 4 Less of California Inc., dba Food 4 Less)
(“Defendant”) filed its answer.  
On June 16, 2023, the Court granted the motion of Plaintiff’s
attorney of record to be relieved as counsel.
On November 17, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with Requests for
Admission (Set One.) (Breitburg Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. A.)  Plaintiff was served by mail, with a courtesy
copy by email.  (Id, Exh. A.)
 Plaintiff did not respond to the requests for admission.  (Id.,
¶ 3.)
On January 29, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for an order
deeming admitted the truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admission (Set
No. One).  Defendant also seeks sanctions.  Plaintiff was served with the motion by email
only.
No opposition has been
filed.
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
that the truth of the matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a motion, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the matters contained in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil
Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d),
defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond
to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Defendant served Plaintiff on November 17, 2023, with Requests for
Admission (Set One.) (Breitburg Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. A.)  Plaintiff did not respond.  (Id.,
¶ 3.)
Defendant filed this motion and served Plaintiff, who is
representing herself in pro per, by email only.  Although email
service may be mandatory for represented parties, litigants who are in pro per
are not subject to mandatory email service, and Defendant has presented no
evidence that Plaintiff has consented to email service.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (c)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.251(c)(3)(B).)
Accordingly, the motion was not properly served and is denied
without prejudice.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion without
prejudice.
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
