Background
On
November 25, 2020, Rosa Erika De Leon Fuentes (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
relating to an incident on December 24, 2018, involving Defendants Carmen Maria
Godinez, Carmen Denim Inc. (collectively “Defendants”), and Does 1 through 100,
alleging five causes of action for (1) Assault, (2) Battery, (3) Intentional
infliction of Emotional Distress, (4) Negligence, and (5) Negligent Hiring,
Supervision and Retention.
 
On February 9,
2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for terminating sanctions, and monetary
sanctions. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
When a party “fails to obey
an order compelling further response to interrogatories, the court may make
those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 ….  In lieu of, or in addition to, that sanction,
the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 ….”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (e).)
When a party “fails to obey an
order compelling further response [to a request for production], the court may
make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction,
an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 ….  In lieu of, or in addition to, that sanction,
the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 ….”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (e).)
In Chapter 7, section 2023.030 provides: “To the extent authorized
by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision
of this title, the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or
attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose the following sanctions
against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process:
... (d) The court may impose a terminating sanction …."  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) “Misuses of the discovery process include, but are not
limited to, the following: ... (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery. ... (g) Disobeying a court order to provide
discovery."  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
A
“terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary
discovery sanction is never justified.” 
(Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.) 
Discussion
On January
5, 2024, the Court ordered Defendants to provide code compliant, verified,
written responses and documents to Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories and Request for Production.  (Hakim Decl., ¶ 2.)  
 
Plaintiff
moves for terminating sanctions against Defendants for failing to provide
responses to discovery requests as well as failing to comply with this Court’s
order to do so.  
Defendants’ failure in providing further
discovery responses is substantial discovery abuse.  Serious sanctions are warranted for this
conduct.  
For terminating sanctions, however, a party
must present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process,
as well as evidence that less severe sanctions have
not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules.  Plaintiff has not, on this record at this
time, made such a showing.  There has not been a showing of a history or pattern of
willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by
lesser sanctions.
Moreover, a discovery sanction should not
create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it
would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations
under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  Here, at this
time, a terminating sanction would create such a windfall for Plaintiff.
The request for a terminating sanction is
denied.
Plaintiff does not seek issue or evidence
sanctions.
Plaintiff does seek additional monetary
sanctions.  That request is granted in
part.  The Court sets sanctions in the
amount of $510, based on 1.5 hours of attorney work, multiplied by a reasonable
billing rate of $300 per hour for work of this nature, plus the filing fee. (Copeland
Decl., ¶ 2.), 
The
denial of the request for a terminating sanction is without prejudice to Plaintiff
seeking other sanctions or seeking a terminating sanction at a later stage of
the proceedings, based on a further showing of misuse of the discovery process.
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion for terminating sanctions is DENIED. 
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is
GRANTED in part
The Court ORDERS Defendants Carmen Maria
Godinez and Carmen Denim Inc., jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions
under the Civil Discovery Act to Plaintiff in the amount of $510 within 30 days
of notice.
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
