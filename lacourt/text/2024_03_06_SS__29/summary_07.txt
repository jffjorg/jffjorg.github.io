And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court will hear from counsel regarding any remaining disputes following the Informal Discovery Conference (IDC). The case involves a motor vehicle accident on January 16, 2021, near the intersection of South Western Avenue and West 89th Street in Los Angeles. The plaintiffs, Uriel Calzada Martinez and Aracely De Los Santos, filed a complaint on June 21, 2022, against the defendant, Jerome Winfield, and Does 1 through 50. The defendant failed to provide timely responses to the discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories (Set One), Requests for Production (Set One), and Requests for Admission (Set One).

The court notes that the defendant provided untimely responses that included both objections and substantive responses, but did not verify its responses. The plaintiff attempted to meet and confer with the defendant to obtain verifications and substantive responses, but the defendant did not provide the verifications and suggested an exchange in which it would provide verifications if the plaintiff agreed to waive its objections.

The court will consider the motions to compel further responses and will impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. The court will also consider any other relevant facts and laws, including California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300, 2030.310, and 2033.290.
