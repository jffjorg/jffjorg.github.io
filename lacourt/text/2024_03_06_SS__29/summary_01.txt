And here is the summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to bifurcate filed by the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The motion seeks to separate the trial into two parts: liability and damages, with the liability phase being tried first. The court has denied the motion without prejudice, meaning that the defendant can refile it at a later time. The court has also ruled that the trial judge should make the discretionary determination on whether to bifurcate the trial, rather than the judge hearing the motion. The court has ordered that the bifurcation briefing be included in the trial binders along with any motions in limine filed in the case.
