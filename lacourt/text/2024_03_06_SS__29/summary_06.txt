And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories without prejudice. The defendant, Princella Lewis, failed to respond to the discovery requests served on October 17, 2023. The plaintiff, Nazlie Mojiri, filed the motion on February 8, 2024, after the defendant did not respond to the discovery requests. The judge ruled that the motion was not properly served as the plaintiff did not present evidence that the defendant consented to email service, which is mandatory for represented parties. The judge ordered the moving party to give notice and denied the motion without prejudice.
