And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses Plaintiff Ava Welsing-Kitcher's motion to withdraw from arbitration in the case against Karplus Warehouse, Inc. and The Western Surety Company. The Plaintiff had filed the operative First Amended Complaint on July 31, 2023, and the Court ordered the matter to arbitration on January 4, 2024, after the parties stipulated to arbitration. However, the Plaintiff filed a motion to withdraw from arbitration on April 30, 2024, citing the Defendants' failure to pay the requisite fees. The Defendants filed a notice of non-opposition to the motion. The Court finds that the Defendants are in default of arbitration for failing to timely pay the fees, and therefore grants the Plaintiff's motion to withdraw from arbitration.
