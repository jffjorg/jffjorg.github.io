And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding two motions: one to compel further responses to the plaintiff's special interrogatories and another to compel further responses to the plaintiff's request for production of documents. The defendant, FCA US LLC, initially served objections to the plaintiff's special interrogatories 45-48 and later served supplemental responses. The defendant also served supplemental responses to the plaintiff's request for production of documents, requests 45 & 46. As a result, the plaintiff's motions are moot. The judge does not award sanctions, finding that both sides acted with substantial justification.
