  Case No.:  23STCV12304
  Hearing Date:  May 31, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to withdraw from
  arbitration 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 31, 2023, Plaintiff Ava
Welsing-Kitcher filed this action against Defendants Karplus Warehouse, Inc.
and The Western Surety Company, asserting claims arising from Plaintiff’s
purchase of a Hyundai vehicle. Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended
Complaint on July 31, 2023. 
            On January 4, 2024, the Court
ordered the matter to arbitration pursuant to the parties’ stipulation. 
            On April 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to withdraw from arbitration and reinstate the matter in
court. Defendants filed a notice of non-opposition on May 17, 2024.    
LEGAL STANDARD
“In an employment or consumer arbitration
that requires . . . the drafting party to pay certain fees and costs before the
arbitration can proceed, if the fees or costs to initiate an arbitration
proceeding are not paid within 30 days after the due date, the drafting party
is in material breach of the arbitration agreement, is in default of the
arbitration, and waives its right to compel arbitration under Section 1281.2.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.97(a)(1).) “If the drafting party materially breaches
the arbitration agreement and is in default under subdivision (a), the employee
or consumer may . . . [w]ithdraw the claim from arbitration and proceed in a
court of appropriate jurisdiction.” (Id., § 1281.97(b).)  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff made an arbitration demand
with AAA on February 6, 2024. (Barry Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. 5.) AAA sent an initial fee
request on February 23, 2024, with payment “due upon receipt.” (Id., Ex.
6.) Payment was due on March 25, 2024 based on the thirty-day grace period
provided by Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.97. (Ibid.) AAA sent a
reminder on March 11, 2024 that Defendants had not remitted the fee,
reiterating that the grace period would end on March 25, 2024. (Id., Ex.
7.) On April 3, 2024, AAA sent notice that payment still had not been received
and that it was closing the file. (Id., Ex. 8.)  
            Defendants do not dispute these
facts and have indicated their non-opposition to the motion. The undisputed
facts show that Defendants are in default of arbitration for failing to timely
pay the requisite fees. Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to withdraw the matter
from arbitration. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to withdraw from
arbitration is GRANTED.
