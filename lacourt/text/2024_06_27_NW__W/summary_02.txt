And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel deposition testimony from Rosario Soriano in part. The plaintiff had requested the contact information for responsible persons at Sunshine's Place II, but defendant instructed Ms. Soriano not to answer. The court finds that the request for contact information is proper and overrules the objections. The judge also agrees that some of the questions asked by the plaintiff at Ms. Soriano's deposition were improper, calling for legal conclusions or expert opinions. However, the court finds that Ms. Soriano is competent to testify to certain issues related to the safety of residents and the applicable laws and regulations for RCFEs. The plaintiff's request for sanctions against defendant and its counsel is denied, as the court finds that defendant acted with substantial justification in opposing the motion.
