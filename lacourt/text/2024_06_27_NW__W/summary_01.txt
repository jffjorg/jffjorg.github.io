Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the first amended complaint and the motion to strike the demand for a jury trial. The demurrer was filed by the defendants, Surge Private Equity LLC, Thomas Beauchamp, Lewis Sharp, and Surge Global Bakeries Partners LP.

The court has ruled that the demurrer to the fraudulent concealment cause of action is overruled, finding that the complaint is sufficient to state a claim. The court has also ruled that the demurrer to the breach of contract cause of action is sustained with leave to amend, finding that the complaint is unclear as to how the defendants breached the contract.

The court has denied the motion to strike the demand for a jury trial, finding that the agreements attached to the complaint are unenforceable as they are predispute waivers of the right to a jury trial.

The court has also ruled that the statute of limitations argument is without merit, finding that the claims relate back to the original complaint.

Overall, the court has ruled in favor of the plaintiff, finding that the complaint is sufficient to state claims for fraudulent concealment and breach of contract, and that the defendants' demurrer and motion to strike are without merit.
