BACKGROUND
 
On May 31, 2022, Plaintiff Albert Boyajian filed a
complaint against Defendants Surge Global Bakeries Holdings LLC, Surge Global
Bakeries Partners LP, Surge Global Bakeries Partners GP, LLC, Surge Private
Equity LLC, Surge Private Equity, McLarty Capital Partners SBIC II, LP, The
Firmament Group, Thomas Beauchamp, Lewis Sharp, Lauren Steel, Parris Boyd,
Tobias Keller, Andy Burchfield, and Ashur Aghasi for (1) Limited Partner
Derivative Suit; (2) Limited Partner Derivative Suit; (3) Fraudulent
Concealment; (4) Breach of Contract; and (5) Breach of Contract. Plaintiff
filed a first amended complaint on April 10, 2024, adding a new plaintiff,
Global Chips, Inc.. 
 
This action involves shareholder derivative and direct
claims by Plaintiff. Plaintiff alleges he sold his profitable bakery for an
equity position in a parent entity, a place on the board of directors of his
former bakery (now a wholly-owned subsidiary), and a Consulting Agreement. However,
Plaintiff alleges he did not know, when he sold his company, that the purchase
was merely the first step of a lender’s scheme to exploit the company for the
lender’s benefit, entirely contrary to the best interests of the equity holders.
Plaintiff contends after the purchase, the company unwarrantedly acquired an
additional two companies and took on additional dramatic debt, during periods
of mismanagement by inept managers and the lender who controlled the board.
Moreover, since the takeover, Plaintiff alleges the lender has not given
plaintiff any information on the companies; and has not called a meeting of the
board. 
 
[TENTATIVE]
RULING:
 
Defendants
Surge Private Equity LLC, Thomas Beauchamp, Lewis Sharp, Surge Global Bakeries
Partners LP Demurrer to the FAC is OVRERULED, in part; SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO
AMEND, in part. Defendants’ Motion to Strike is DENIED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendants
Surge Private Equity LLC, Thomas Beauchamp, Lewis Sharp, Surge Global Bakeries
Partners LP (“Surge Defendants”) demur to the first amended complaint.
Defendants also move to strike Plaintiff’s demand for a jury trial. 
 
Specificity

 
Surge
Defendants argue the allegations of the FAC lack specificity for any fraud or
breach of fiduciary claims by Plaintiff. 
 
The
elements of fraud are: “(a) misrepresentation (false representation,
concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c)
intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e)
resulting damage.” (Charnay v. Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.)
In California, fraud, including negligent misrepresentation, must be pled with
specificity. (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167,
184.) “The particularity demands that a plaintiff plead facts which show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.” (Cansino
v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.)  
 
Surge
Defendants argue the complaint alleges that all Defendants collectively did
something or lumps together the Surge Defendants into a general category with
multiple other Defendants. As such, there is not a specific allegation that
Surge Defendants committed any element of the cause of action for fraud or
breach of fiduciary duty. As a result, the complaint fails to allege who
misrepresented what, when, and why with the requisite intent to deceive and
reasonable reliance.
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues the FAC does provide the required specificity. Plaintiff
contends the paragraphs in the fraud cause of action identify the ultimate
statements that were fraudulent, including statements made in identified
written documents, why Surge Defendants had a duty to provide additional
information, what information the Surge Defendants did not disclose that had to
be disclosed, that Surge Defendants knew they were making false statements,
that Surge Defendants intended to defraud Plaintiffs, that Plaintiffs justifiably
relied on Surge Defendants, and that Plaintiffs suffered damages. (See FAC ¶¶
74-84.) 
 
First,
the court notes there is no specificity requirement for breach of fiduciary
duty. Second, the court finds the fraudulent concealment cause of action
sufficient for the purposes of a demurrer. A demurrer tests the pleading alone,
and not the evidence or facts alleged.  (E-Fab,
Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.)
As such, the court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or
implied factual allegations. (Id.) The fraudulent concealment claim is
against Surge Equity, Sharp and Beauchamp (“Defendants”) (Surge LP is not
listed in the third cause of action). The FAC alleges all three Defendants
induced Plaintiffs to sell Global Bakeries’ assets to Surge Equity. The FAC
further alleges Defendants concealed from Plaintiff that they intended to load
Surge Bakeries with debt upon the purchase of Global Bakeries, Defendants
intended to borrow more money from The Firmament Group than the business could
support, Global Bakeries was part of a fraudulent scheme formulated between
Surge Equity Defendants (Surge Bakeries, Surge LP, Surge GP, Surge Equity,
Thomas Beauchamp, Lewis Sharp) and Firmament Group, and so on. This is
sufficient to show at least by whom and to whom the fraudulent conduct was
directed.  When dealing with fraudulent
concealment, a plaintiff may not necessarily be able to allege the specific
time, place and specific content of what was concealed. (See Alfaro v.
Community Housing Improvement System & Planning Assn., Inc. (2009) 171
Cal.App.4th 1356, 1384.) 
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer is OVERRULED on these grounds. 
 
Statute
of Limitations
 
Surge
Defendants next demur to first three causes of action brought by the new
plaintiff (Global Chips, Inc.) on statute of limitations grounds.  The new plaintiff was added on April 10,
2024.  Defendant argue that this
complaint was filed more than four years after plaintiff discovered the breach
and more than three years after plaintiff discovered the alleged fraud,
creating a bar to the new plaintiff proceeding with these claims.  Defendant argues that the “relation back”
doctrine does not save the claims, but as a new plaintiff, Global Chips, Inc.,
cannot take advantage of that doctrine. 
 
The
court disagrees with plaintiff’s invocation of the relation back doctrine.  While it will allow the same plaintiff to
bring in new claims that are based on the same injury and same general set of
facts, (even in the statute has run), “[a]n amendment adding a new plaintiff
will not relate back to a prior complaint if the new plaintiff is “enforc[ing]
an independent right” that imposes a  ‘”wholly
distinct and different legal obligation against the defendant”’ (Bartalo v.
Superior Court (1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 526, 533, 124 Cal.Rptr. 370, italics
omitted (Bartalo); Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th
235, 243, 46 Cal.Rptr.3d 66, 138 P.3d 214 (Branick)).”  (Engel v. Pech (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th
1227, 1231.)  The Engel court
explained when relation back is allowed and when it is properly denied in some
detail, reproduced here: 
 
[W]hen it
comes to adding a new plaintiff, courts have refined the general rule: A new
plaintiff's claims relate back to claims asserted in a previously and timely
filed complaint if the new plaintiff is seeking to enforce the same right as a
previously named plaintiff (because, in that case, the amendment relies on the
same general set of facts, involves the same injury, and refers to the same
instrumentality of the defendant's conduct). (Klopstock v. Superior Court
(1941) 17 Cal.2d 13, 16-21, 108 P.2d 906 (Klopstock) [amendment to a derivative
action in a corporation's name that substitutes a new plaintiff relates back
because the relief “sought on behalf of the corporation [entails] ... exactly
the same liability” as previously alleged]; Pasadena Hospital Assn., Ltd. v.
Superior Court (1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1031, 1034-1037, 251 Cal.Rptr. 686
(Pasadena Hospital) [amendment adding the prior plaintiff's professional
corporation as a new plaintiff to a defamation lawsuit against a defendant who
defamed the plaintiff relates back because “the resulting harms to [the
plaintiff] and [his professional] corporation”—because damage was to their
reputation, which was inseparable between the two—“do not appear to be
distinct”]; Bank of America v. Superior Court (1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 555,
556-557, 110 Cal.Rptr. 709 [amendment correcting an error in one word of the
new plaintiff's three-word corporate name in a check forgery claim relates back
because the claim is the same and because the check with the plaintiff's correct
name was attached to the original complaint].) This is why amendments that do
no more than swap in a new plaintiff for an existing cause of action—when the
new plaintiff is the real party in interest and the original plaintiff was
not—typically relate back. (Cox v. San Joaquin Light & Power Corp. (1917)
33 Cal.App. 522, 523-524, 166 P. 578 [amendment swapping in decedent's personal
representative as plaintiff instead of decedent's heir relates back];
California Gasoline Retailers v. Regal Petroleum Corp. (1958) 50 Cal.2d 844,
850-851, 330 P.2d 778 [amendment swapping in individual as plaintiff instead of
business association relates back]; California Air Resources Bd. v. Hart (1993)
21 Cal.App.4th 289, 301, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 153 (Hart) [amendment swapping in State
of California as plaintiff instead of state agency relates back]; Cloud v.
Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 1000, 1005, 79 Cal.Rptr.2d
544 [amendment swapping in bankruptcy trustee as plaintiff relates back]; see
generally Garrison v. Board of Directors (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1670, 1678, 43
Cal.Rptr.2d 214 [amended complaint “ ‘by the right party’ ” relates back when
it “ ‘restates the identical cause of action’ ”].)
 
Conversely,
a new plaintiff's claims do not relate back if the new plaintiff is seeking to
“enforce a[ ] right” “independent” of the right asserted by the previously
named plaintiff(s). (Bartalo, supra, 51 Cal.App.3d at p. 533, 124 Cal.Rptr.
370, italics omitted; Quiroz v. Seventh Ave. Center (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th
1256, 1264, 1278, 45 Cal.Rptr.3d 222 (Quiroz).) This occurs when (1) the new
plaintiff's claims rest on a “wholly different legal liability or obligation”
(that is, a “distinct” “cause of action”) “from that originally [alleged]”
(Klopstock, supra, 17 Cal.2d at p. 20, 108 P.2d 906 [claim does not relate back
“where the effect of such amendment is to state ‘another and distinct cause of
action’ ”]; Branick, supra, 39 Cal.4th at pp. 243-244, 46 Cal.Rptr.3d 66, 138
P.3d 214; Pasadena Hospital, supra, 204 Cal.App.3d at p. 1035, 251 Cal.Rptr.
686); (2) the new plaintiff's claims entail a distinct injury (Quiroz, at p.
1279, 45 Cal.Rptr.3d 222); or (3) the new plaintiff's claims “ ‘impose greater
liability upon the defendant’ ” than the original plaintiff's claims (Quiroz,
at p. 1278, 45 Cal.Rptr.3d 222; Bartalo, at p. 533, 124 Cal.Rptr. 370; Estrada
v. Royalty Carpet Mills, Inc. (2022) 76 Cal.App.5th 685, 715, 292 Cal.Rptr.3d
1, review granted June 22, 2022, S274340). (See Quiroz, at pp. 1278-1279, 45
Cal.Rptr.3d 222 [amendment adding spouse as a plaintiff in her capacity as
representative for the decedent in a survivor action does not relate back to
prior complaint naming spouse as a wrongful death plaintiff because the two
claims involve “different injur[ies]”]; Dominguez v. City of Alhambra (1981)
118 Cal.App.3d 237, 243, 173 Cal.Rptr. 345 [same]; Bartalo, at p. 533, 124
Cal.Rptr. 370 [amendment adding injured person's spouse as a plaintiff to
assert a loss of consortium claim does not relate back to complaint alleging
personal injury to person because the two claims involve distinct injuries];
Shelton v. Superior Court (1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 66, 74, 128 Cal.Rptr. 454
[same].)
 
At bottom,
this refined, plaintiff-focused test is aimed at assessing whether adding the
new plaintiff merely corrects a “ ‘misnomer in the description of the
[plaintiff]’ ” or instead “interject[s] a new party into the litigation for the
first time under the guise of a misnomer.” (Hart, supra, 21 Cal.App.4th at pp.
300-301, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 153; Stephens v. Berry (1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 474, 478,
57 Cal.Rptr. 505.) This distinction seeks to harmonize competing policies. On
the one hand, public policy favors liberal amendment of pleadings in order to
effectuate the resolution of lawsuits on their merits if the party being sued
has timely notice of its potential liability. (Branick, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p.
243, 46 Cal.Rptr.3d 66, 138 P.3d 214; Pointe San Diego Residential Community,
L.P. v. Procopio, Cory, Hargreaves & Savitch, LLP (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th
265, 277, 125 Cal.Rptr.3d 540 (Pointe San Diego) [noting “ ‘strong policy in
this state that cases should be decided on their merits’ ”]; Pointe San Diego,
at p. 277, 125 Cal.Rptr.3d 540 [“ ‘The policy behind statutes of limitations
... to put defendants on notice of the need to defend against a claim ... is
satisfied when recovery under an amended complaint is sought on the same basic
set of facts as the original pleading’ ”].) On the other hand, public policy
favors finality and repose once a limitations period for a particular potential
liability has passed. (Bartalo, supra, 51 Cal.App.3d at p. 534, 124 Cal.Rptr.
370 [“Once the statute of limitation has passed as to other possible
plaintiffs, a defendant is entitled to dismiss them from his considerations”].)
 
(Engel, 95
Cal.App.5th at 1238-39.)                                                
 
                                                                                                          
Ultimately,
the court finds this case controlled by Klopstock, supra, which allowed a
different plaintiff to be substituted in to proceed in a derivate suit on
behalf of a corporation against the defendants.   Plaintiff Boyajian initiated this action,
seeking to bring those derivative claims. When this court concluded that he was
not properly situated to bring a shareholder action, the amended complaint was
filed to name the actual shareholder, Global Chips, Inc.  As the court explained I Engel on
similar facts: “Since the corporation is the ultimate beneficiary of such a
derivative suit, it is clear that the particular stockholder who brings the
suit is merely a nominal party plaintiff. (Citation omitted.)   The defendants have been fully apprised
since the filing of the original complaint of the facts which are relied upon
to state a right to relief against them in behalf of the corporation. Under the
facts of this case, therefore, we hold that the amendment complained of did not
constitute the statement of a wholly different cause of action which would
prevent amendment of the complaint, but, on the contrary, was well within the
liberal discretion which is granted to the courts by Code of Civil Procedure,
section 473.”  (Klopstock v. Superior
Court, supra  at p. 21.)   
 
Because
the claims relate back, defendant’s statute of limitations’ argument must
fail.  
Moreover,
as alleged, it is not clear from the complaint that Plaintiffs discovered any
breach or had had any suspicions of fraudulent conduct in 2018 or 2019. Paragraph
31 describes the closing process in 2018 and how after Mr. Boyajian discovered
Defendants’ loan to finance the acquisition required interest to be taken out
of the profit of the company, the parties agreed to Mr. Boyajian acting under a
Consultation Agreement. Paragraph 36 describes the first potential purchase of
a company in February 2019 and that Mr. Boyajian abstained from the vote and
never saw the associated loan documents. 
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer is OVERRULED on these grounds. 
 
Breach
of Contract
 
Surge
Defendants demur to the breach of contract claim on the grounds none of them
are a buyer under the agreement and neither Plaintiff is the seller under the
agreement. 
 
The
fourth cause of action for breach of contract – Asset Purchase Agreement is
against Surge Bakeries (Surge Global Bakeries Holdings LLC) and Surge LP. The
fifth cause of action for breach of contract – Consultant Agreement is against
Surge Bakeries. 
 
Since
the fifth cause of action is not against any of the moving defendants, the
court will only address the fourth cause of action. Although not a buyer, Surge
LP is a party to the contract as the Parent company. From the allegations, it
is unclear how Surge LP breached the APA. 
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer to the fourth cause of action is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. 
 
Uncertainty
 
The
court notes Surge Defendants make reference to the complaint being uncertain
yet make no argument in the points and authorities. Regardless, demurrers for
uncertainty are disfavored and should only be sustained where the complaint is
so uncertain that the demurring defendant cannot reasonably respond thereto
(see, e.g., Khoury v. Maly's of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612,
616.)
 
Motion
to Strike 
 
Surge
Defendants moves to strike Plaintiffs’ demand for a jury trial on the grounds the
FAC attaches agreements by which Plaintiffs waived their right to jury. (FAC,
Exhs. A p. 42; B p. 77; C p. 127.) 
 
In
opposition, Plaintiffs argue Surge Defendants do not authenticate any
agreements referred to in their motion, fail to identify the language in the
agreements that allegedly waives Plaintiffs’ right to a jury trial, and two
agreements cited include predispute waivers that are unenforceable under Code
of Civil Procedure section 631.
 
First,
as to authentication, the court agrees Plaintiff made judicial admissions by
attaching the exhibits to their complaint. Next, the court finds that although
Exhibit B and C do provide that the parties to the agreement waive their right
to a jury trial, a predispute waiver of a jury trial is not authorized by Code
of Civil Procedure section 631. (See Grafton Partners v. Superior Court (2005)
36 Cal.4th 944, 967.) 
 
Exhibit
A only has a heading and therefore, is too vague to determine whether it is a
predispute waiver. However, Exhibit B provides: “CONSULTANT AND COMPANY
EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT EITHER MAY HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL CONCERNING ANY CIVIL
ACTION THAT MAY ARISE FROM THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES
HERETO.” Moreover, Exhibit C provides: “The parties to this Agreement each
hereby agrees and consents that any such claim, demand, action, or cause of
action shall be decided by court trial without a jury and that the parties to
this Agreement may file an original counterpart of a copy of this Agreement
with any court as written evidence of the consent of the parties hereto to the
waiver of their right to trial by jury.” Each waiver is a waiver in advance of
litigation and therefore is unenforceable. 
 
Accordingly,
the motion to strike is DENIED.
