Ted Rosenblatt and PFG Entertainment.
TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
1.      Petition
to Confirm Arbitration Award is GRANTED.
STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
Plaintiff Sittler Law Group (“Plaintiff”) brings this
action against Defendants Ted Rosenblatt, Marisa Rosenblatt, and PFG
Entertainment (collectively, “Defendants”) and Does 1 through 10 arising out of
a failure to pay legal fees incurred through legal representation. 
 
On September 07, 2021, Plaintiff filed the operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants for the following causes of
action: 
 
(1) Breach of Contract; 
(2) Quantum Meruit; and 
(3) Open Book Account. 
 
On August 19, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Compel
Arbitration which the court GRANTED.
 
On May 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Petition to
Confirm Arbitration Award.
 
On May 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed Notice of Hearing on
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award.
 
On July 12, 2024, each Defendant filed substitution of
attorney.[1]
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made
may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.¿ The petition
shall name as respondent all parties to the arbitration and may name as
respondents any other persons bound by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ.
Proc., (CCP) § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly
served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered
in this state or another state, unless in accordance with this chapter it
corrects the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses
the proceeding.” (CCP § 1286.)¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Filing Requirements of a Petition to Confirm
Arbitration Award (CCP § 1285.4)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 1285.4 states: “A petition under this chapter shall:¿¿ 
 
a.       
Set forth the
substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the
petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement.¿¿ 
 
c.       
Set forth the names of
the arbitrators.¿¿ 
 
c.       
Set forth or have
attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if
any.”¿¿ 
¿¿ 
(CCP § 1285.4 (emphasis added).)¿¿ 
 
Here, Plaintiff complied with CCP § 1285.4 First, Plaintiff
set forth the arbitration clause in the Petition and also attached a copy of
the arbitration agreement. (Petition, Exhibit 4-C.) Second, Plaintiff
identified Hon. Gerald Rosenberg, Ret. as the arbitrator. (Petition, ¶6.)
Third, Plaintiff attached a copy of the Arbitration Award. (Petition, Exhibit
8-C.) 
 
Accordingly, the filing requirements are met.
 
Service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing (CCP §
1290.4)¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4 states in pertinent
part:¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
(a) A copy
of the petition and a written notice of the time and place of the hearing
thereof and any other papers upon which the petition is based shall be served
in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the service of such
petition and notice.¿¿ 
¿¿ 
(b) If the
arbitration agreement does not provide the manner in which such service shall
be made and the person upon whom service is to be made has not previously
appeared in the proceeding and has not previously been served in accordance
with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service within this State shall be made in the
manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.¿¿ 
¿¿ 
(CCP § 1290.4.)¿¿ 
 
Here, Plaintiff complied with CCP §
1290.4. Plaintiff served a copy of the Petition and Notice of Hearing via
e-mail to counsel. (Proof of Service filed with Notice of Hearing and
Petition.) While the Arbitration Agreement does not provide for the method of
service, the court is inclined to accept e-mail service as sufficient. Notably,
the arbitration administrator served the Final Arbitration Award via e-mail,
U.S. Mail, and certified mail. (See Final Arbitration Award Proof of Service,
Petition, Exhibit 8-C.) This indicates to the court that the parties agreed to
accept service of documents via e-mail. Additionally, counsel previously served
other documents via e-mail. (See, e.g., Defendants’ proof of service filed
September 24, 2021, with Objection to Plaintiff’s Evidence Filed with Reply In
Support of Motion to Compel Arbitration.[2])
 
Accordingly, the service requirement of the Petition and
Notice of Hearing is met.
 
Service of the Arbitration Award (CCP § 1283.6)¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1283.6 provides that: “The neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration
personally or by registered or certified mail or as provided in the
agreement.”¿This requirement may be satisfied by service by the arbitrator or
upon proper service of the Award with the Petition. (See Murry v. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d
796, 799-800.)¿¿ 
 
Here, the Arbitrator complied with CCP § 1283.6. As noted
above, the arbitration administrator
served the Final Arbitration Award via e-mail, U.S. Mail, and certified mail.
(See Final Arbitration Award Proof of Service, Petition, Exhibit 8-C.) 
 
Accordingly, the service requirement of the Arbitration
Award is met.
 
Timing of Service of Petition (CCP §§ 1288, 1288.4)¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
A party may seek a court judgment
confirming an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition no more than
four years, but not less than 10 days, after the award is served. (CCP §§ 1288, 1288.4.)¿¿
 
Here, Plaintiff’s Petition is timely. The Final Award was
issued on April 29, 2024. (Petition, Exhibit 8-C.) Plaintiff filed this
Petition on May 22, 2024 which is more than 10 days after service of the Final
Award and well within four years of its issuance.
 
Accordingly, the timing of service is met.
 
Merits of the
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
The court must confirm the award as made, unless it
corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses the proceeding.¿ (CCP § 1286; Valsan Partners Limited Partnership v.
Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.)¿¿ 
 
Here, Plaintiff has demonstrated that on April 29, 2024, the
arbitrator issued an Arbitration Award in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendants Ted Rosenblatt and PFG Entertainment for $136,339.08. (Petition,
Exhibit 8-C.) Plaintiff presented no evidence that this Award applies to
Defendant Marisa Rosenblatt and the Petition is for Defendants Ted Rosenblatt
and PFG Entertainment only.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Petition
to Confirm Arbitration Award is GRANTED.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
