The court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Betty Wyman's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Plaintiffs Raymond Saviss and Helen Saviss, as well as Co-defendant Manuela S. Chamchoum and Co-defendant City of Los Angeles. The motion is granted, and Defendant Wyman is allowed to file her cross-complaint forthwith. The court found that Defendant Wyman did not act in bad faith in bringing her compulsory cross-claims against the plaintiffs, and that granting leave to file the cross-complaint serves the interest of justice by avoiding "a multiplicity of actions."
