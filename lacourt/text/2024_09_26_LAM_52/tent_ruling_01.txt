  Case Number:  22STCV10204    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendant Betty Wyman’s Motion
for Leave to File Cross-Complaint
Defendant
Betty Wyman moves for leave to file a cross-complaint against plaintiffs
Raymond Saviss and Helen Saviss, co-defendant Manuela S. Chamchoum,
co-defendant City of Los Angeles, and against all persons unknown, claiming any
right in the subject property adverse to Wyman’s title.
Denying
leave to file a compulsory cross-complaint against the plaintiffs requires “bad
faith of the moving party.”  (Silver Organizations Ltd. v. Frank
(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 94, 99; accord CCP § 426.50.)  A
cross-complaint that does not bring compulsory cross-claims against the
plaintiffs “may be filed at any time
before the court has set a date for trial.” 
(CCP § 428.50(b).)  Courts may
grant leave to file an untimely cross-complaint “in the interest of justice at
any time during the course of the action.” 
(Id., subd. (c).)  
For her compulsory
cross-claims against plaintiffs, Wyman adequately shows she did not act in bad
faith.  For her permissive cross-claims
against other parties, granting Wyman leave to file the proposed
cross-complaint serves the interest of justice by avoiding “a multiplicity of
actions.”  (Heshejin v. Rostami (2020)
54 Cal.App.5th 984, 993.)   
Disposition
Defendant
Betty Wyman’s motion for leave to file a cross-complaint is granted.  Defendant shall file her cross-complaint (attached
as exhibit 3 to the declaration of Scott R. Laes) forthwith.
