 Case Number:  23STCV24572    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2024    Dept:  52 Jonathan G. Gabriel, Esq.’s
Motions to Be Relieved as Counsel for Defendants 
Attorney Jonathan G.
Gabriel, Esq. of Gabriel Law Group, PC moves to be relieved as counsel for
defendants Craze, LLC and Scott Rosenbluth. 
Gabriel shows valid grounds to be relieved as counsel.  At the prior hearing on these motions, the
court noted sections 5, 6, 7, and 8 on each proposed order was blank.  Defendants’ counsel submitted new proposed
orders.  Counsel completed sections 7 and
8, but sections 5 and 6 are blank again. 
The court will complete sections 5 and 6 and sign the proposed
orders.  
Defendants’ counsel’s
motion to be relieved as counsel for defendants Craze, LLC and Scott Rosenbluth
are granted.  The court will
complete and sign the proposed orders on Judicial Council form MC-053.  The
orders will be effective upon filing proof of service of the signed order on each
defendant.
