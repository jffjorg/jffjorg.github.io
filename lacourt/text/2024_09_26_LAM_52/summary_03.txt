And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reached a tentative decision regarding the motion by defendant's counsel, Jonathan G. Gabriel, Esq., to be relieved as counsel for the defendants Craze, LLC and Scott Rosenbluth. The court finds that Gabriel has valid grounds to be relieved as counsel. At the prior hearing, the court noted that sections 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the proposed orders were blank, but new proposed orders were submitted with sections 7 and 8 completed. However, sections 5 and 6 remained blank. The court will complete those sections and sign the proposed orders. As a result, the defendants' counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel is granted. The court will complete and sign the proposed orders on Judicial Council form MC-053, which will become effective upon filing proof of service of the signed order on each defendant.
