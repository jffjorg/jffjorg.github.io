And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to quash or modify the defendant's deposition subpoenas for business records. The plaintiff, Jane M.R. Doe, alleges that the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), violated her privacy rights by seeking access to her medical records. The plaintiff argues that the subpoenas are overly broad and seek discovery concerning her sexual conduct with individuals other than the alleged perpetrator, which is not allowed under Code of Civil Procedure section 2017.220.

The court disagrees with the plaintiff's argument, finding that the subpoenas seek medical records, not evidence about her sexual conduct. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not established a legitimate privacy interest in the records sought by LAUSD.

However, the court does acknowledge that the subpoenas are overly broad and seek access to a large number of medical records. To address this concern, the court will permit LAUSD to discover records about the plaintiff's mental health and physical injuries, but only from a limited period of time (January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2009, and January 1, 2022, to the present). The court will also require the plaintiff to specifically identify any physical injuries she attributes to the alleged sexual assault, and LAUSD will only be allowed to discover records related to those injuries.

Overall, the court's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion in part, but limits the discovery to records that are relevant to the plaintiff's mental health and physical injuries.
