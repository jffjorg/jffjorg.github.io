And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants Defendant/Cross-Complainant Universal Studios, LLC's motion to compel Plaintiff Lakhbir Kaur Dhatt's further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, in part. The court orders Plaintiff to provide further responses to SROGs, Set One, Nos. 22-26, with modifications to Request No. 22.

The court finds that Plaintiff's responses to Requests Nos. 22-26 are incomplete and inadequate. The court grants the motion as to compelling a further response to SROG, Set One, No. 22, with modifications to limit the timeframe and scope of the request. The court also grants the motion as to compelling further responses to SROGs, Set One, Nos. 23-25, and SROG, Set One, No. 26.

The court finds that Plaintiff's objections to the requests are without merit. The court notes that Plaintiff has previously provided information about her medical providers and injuries sustained on May 19, 2019, and that she must provide further information to support her claims. The court also finds that Plaintiff's responses are vague and inadequate, and that she must provide clearer information about the causal link between the alleged malfunction and her mental injuries.

The court orders Plaintiff to provide further responses to SROGs, Set One, Nos. 22-26, within 20 calendar days of this ruling.
