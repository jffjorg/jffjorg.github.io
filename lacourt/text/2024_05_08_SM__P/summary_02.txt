Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Singletary v. City of LA and County of Santa Barbara. The petitioner, Singletary, alleges that he was shot in the face with a rubber bullet by law enforcement officers during a protest in Santa Monica on May 31, 2020. Singletary failed to present a claim against the respondents within the six-month period provided by Gov. Code section 911.2.

Singletary filed a claim for damages with the federal court on July 7, 2020, against Santa Monica, and a complaint for damages and a jury demand in the United States District Court on March 10, 2022. He later filed late claim applications with the respondents on June 7 and 9, 2023, which were denied on June 15 and 24, 2023, respectively. Singletary then filed a petition for relief from the requirements of Government Code section 945.4 with the federal court on August 21, 2023.

The court finds that the statute of limitations was not tolled due to delayed discovery, and that Singletary's failure to present a claim was not excusable. The court further finds that the petitioner's cause of action accrued on May 31, 2020, and that the petitioner's late claim applications were filed more than one year after the accrual of the cause of action. As such, the court denies the petition for relief from the requirements of Government Code section 945.4.
