Singletary v. City
of LA and County of Santa Barbara., Case No. 24SMCP00120
Hearing date May
8, 2024
Petitioner’s
Petition for Relief from Claim Presentation Requirements of Government Code
Section 945.4
 
Petitioner
Singletary alleges he was shot in the face with a rubber bullet by law
enforcement officers employed by new respondents, City of Los Angeles (“LA”)
and County of Santa Barbara (“SB”) (collectively “new respondents”) during a
protest in Santa Monica on May 31, 2020. Petitioner failed to present a claim
against new respondents within the six-month period provided by Gov. Code
section 911.2 due to alleged inability to identify those law enforcement
officers as being from a department other than the City of Santa Monica. 
 
Petitioner timely filed
a claim for damages with the federal court on July 7, 2020, against Santa
Monica and filed a complaint for damages and a jury demand in the United States
District Court on March 10, 2022. 
 
On January 23,
2023 petitioner learned from Santa Monica that the officers responsible for firing
the rubber bullets were from LA and SB, after SM officials reviewed
petitioner’s cell phone footage. Petitioner subsequently filed his late claim
application with new respondents on June 9, 2023, and, after new respondents
denied the applications, filed this petition for relief from late claim. 
 
Date of Accrual
“The California
rule on delayed discovery of a cause of action is the statute of limitation
begins to run ‘when the plaintiff has reason to suspect an injury and some
wrongful cause . . . .’ ‘A plaintiff need not be aware of the specific “facts” necessary
to establish the claim; that is a process contemplated by pretrial discovery. .
. . So long as a suspicion exists, it is clear that the plaintiff must go find
the facts; she cannot wait for the facts to find her.’” MGA Entertainment,
Inc. v. Mattel,
Inc. (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 554, 561.
 
Petitioner argues
that though he was injured May 31, 2020, the statute of limitations is governed
by the delayed discovery rule. Petitioner states on January 23, 2023, he
learned from Santa Monica Police Department (“SMPD”) that the officers who
fired the rubber bullets were from new respondents’ municipalities. According
to SMPD, new respondents were present at the request of SMPD, which sought aid
from neighboring law enforcement agencies per a mutual aid agreement.
Petitioner alleges SMPD claimed new respondents were not part of SMPD’s Area A
mutual aid agreement. Id. Petitioner claims SMPD identified new
respondents by examining third-party cellphone video footage previously in
petitioner’s possession. Petitioner asserts SMPD’s technology technician manipulated
the video footage and was able to identify badges belonging to members of
respondents’ law enforcement agencies. 
 
Respondent SB
argues the claim accrued on May 31, 2020, the date of injury, more than a year
before petitioner filed his application for late claim on June 9, 2023. SB
argues petitioner was aware of his injuries on May 31, 2020 and was in
possession of video footage showing two distinct law enforcement uniforms
present that day. SB argues petitioner had notice because on May 4, 2021, the
Office of Independent Review Report (“OIR Report”) stated County officers were
present.
 
Respondent LA likewise argues
delayed discovery does not apply. Per Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery (2005)
35 Cal.4th 797, 812; Norgart v. Upjohn Co. (1991) 21 Cal.4th 383, 399, “ignorance
of the identity of the defendant does not delay accrual of a cause of action.” LA
argues delayed discovery only applies when plaintiff establishes he could not
have discovered the wrongdoing that caused the injury until a date after the
general suspicion of wrongdoing, which is not the case here.
 
Petitioner argues
he was only on inquiry notice on January 23, 2023, after he was informed by SM
via the related federal case that the video depicted new respondents’ officers.
Petitioner argues an expert was needed to review the footage to reveal new
respondents were present, the OIR Report did not mention the incident in which petitioner
was injured, so did not provide notice of new respondents’ presence, and
specialized knowledge is required to distinguish agencies in the video
depicting the incident.  
 
The cause of
action accrued on May 31, 2020, the date of injury. The delayed discovery rule pertains
to delayed discovery of wrongdoing, not delayed discovery of defendants. Petitioner
was in possession of the video from the outset. He failed to do his own
discovery. The court accepts as true that he only had actual knowledge of the
presence of LA/SB officers after being so informed in 2023, but this does not meet
the criteria for delayed discovery. Petitioner could have discovered the
presence of the other agencies through his own diligent discovery and review of
his video footage or otherwise, but he failed to do so. Had he been diligent,
he should have discovered the identities of all involved law enforcement
agencies in time to file timely claims. 
 
Lateness of Claim
and/or Excusable Neglect
 
Under Gov. Code section 946.6,
a court shall relieve the petitioner from Gov. Code section 945.4 (necessity
of written claim acted upon by board or deemed to have been rejected) if the
court finds (1) the application under Gov. Code section 911.4 was
made within a reasonable time not to exceed one year after accrual of the cause
of action; (2) the application was denied or deemed denied; and (3) the failure
to present the claim was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect.
 
Filing a late-claim
application within one year after the accrual of a cause of action is a
jurisdictional prerequisite to a claim-relief petition.
Santee v. Santa Clara County Office of Education 220
Cal.App.3d at p. 713, 269 Cal.Rptr. 605. When the underlying application to
file a late claim is filed more than one year after the accrual of the cause of
action, the court is without jurisdiction to grant
relief under Gov. Code section 946.6. Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. County
of Santa Clara (1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 480, 488, 231 Cal.Rptr. 702. 
 
Petitioner argues his
claim did not accrue until January 23, 2023 – three and a half years after the
incident – when SMPD informed him of the presence of LA/SB officers. Petitioner
filed applications with LA on June 7, 2023 and new SB on June 9, 2023 (denied
June 15, 2023 and June 24, 2023, respectively). Id. ¶¶ 11-14. Thus,
petitioner argues the petition was timely filed on August 21, 2023, with the
federal district court which subsequently transferred the case to this court on
November 2, 2023. Id. ¶15.  
 
SB argues the
application for leave to present a late claim was not timely filed and
petitioner did not use due diligence to investigate, despite being in
possession of the OIR Report, the knowledge of the mutual aid agreement and the
cellphone video footage. County asserts petitioner’s failure to review the
video or retain necessary assistance in doing so is not excusable. 
SB argues “the six-month statute of limitations is
inviolate [and] ... cannot be extended by provisions outside the Tort Claims
Act.” Martell v. Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 978, 982. 
 
In addressing petitioner’s argument that by filing the
petition in August of 2023 with the federal court, the petition was timely, LA
asserts 946.6 expressly vests California superior courts, not federal courts,
with the sole jurisdiction over petitions for relief from the requirements of
section 945.4. Petitioner argues under equitable tolling, he had until March
15, 2024, to file the petition because California Superior Courts apply
equitable tolling over state court causes of action when a federal claim is
pursued in good faith. 
 
The Court need not
resolve the issues of equitable tolling or electronic filing apply because
petitioner’s cause of action accrued May 31, 2020. As such, petitioner’s June
2023 applications to LA and SB were made over three years since the incident,
leaving this Court without jurisdiction to grant relief under Gov. Code,
section 946.6. DENIED.
