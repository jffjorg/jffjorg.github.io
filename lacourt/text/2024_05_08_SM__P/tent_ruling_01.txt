Ruling
West
Idaho LLC v. Catherine Zhang, Case No. 21SMUD00229
Hearing
date May 8, 2024
Defendant
Counsel Finkel’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel
Alan Finkel, counsel for defendant
Zhang, seeks to withdraw, citing a breach of the attorney-client retainer
agreement. MC-052 Declaration of Finkel. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion
should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does
not disrupt the orderly process of justice. See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.
 
Counsel seeks withdrawal due to
Zhang’s breach of her retainer agreement with Finkel’s law firm. Finkel Decl.,
para. 1. Zhang failed to make payments for legal services rendered, despite all
parties knowing and agreeing counsel’s firm would not be representing Zhang on
a pro bono basis. Id. 
 
Counsel states at the last
status conference on February 9, 2024, all counsel represented to the Court
that the July 22, 2024 trial date should be vacated to permit Zhang to conduct
a wrongful termination arbitration with her former employer. Finkel Decl.,
para. 1. Despite this understanding, cross-defendant West Idaho LLC erroneously
stated in their March 28, 2024 Motion for Summary Judgment that trial was set
for July 22, 2024, not recognizing the Court vacated the July 22, 2024 trial
date. Finkel Decl., para. 2. Finkel subsequently requested cross-defendant West
Idaho take the Motion for Summary Judgment off, but cross-defendant has refused
to do so. Id.
 
Counsel Finkel filed the
mandatory forms and served defendant Zhang and all parties. No proposed order has
yet been submitted (MC-053). As no opposition was filed by Zhang, the motion is
granted, subject to Finkel proving the court with a proposed order.
