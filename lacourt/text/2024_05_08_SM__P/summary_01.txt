The tentative ruling is regarding a motion by Counsel Finkel to withdraw as counsel for Defendant Catherine Zhang due to a breach of the attorney-client retainer agreement. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, provided there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. Counsel Finkel's law firm did not provide pro bono services, and Defendant Zhang failed to make payments for legal services. Despite this, Counsel Finkel seeks to withdraw as counsel due to the breach of the retainer agreement. The court grants the motion, subject to Counsel Finkel providing a proposed order.
