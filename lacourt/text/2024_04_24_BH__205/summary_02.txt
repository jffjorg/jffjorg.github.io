Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiffs' request for a default judgment against the defendant, Ross Reghabi. The plaintiffs, Siamak Michael Rahimi and Rahimi & Co., sought a default judgment against the defendant for $1,939,820.07, which includes $645,606.69 in general damages and $1,293,213.38 in punitive damages. However, the judge finds that the plaintiffs failed to comply with the requirements for a default judgment, including serving a statement of damages and completing item 2 of the CIV 100 form. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs' request for punitive damages is invalid because the complaint did not specify an amount. As a result, the judge denies the plaintiffs' request for a default judgment and sets the matter for further hearing.
