The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiff's complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, specifically libel, slander, and defamation. The Judge grants the Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which means the complaint is dismissed. The Judge also denies the Plaintiff's request to amend the complaint without leave to amend. The Judge orders the Defendant to give notice of the ruling. The parties are required to submit their intentions regarding the tentative ruling by email to the court by the specified deadline.
