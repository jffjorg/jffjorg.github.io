```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Labor Commissioner has filed applications to set aside judgments in three related cases. The applications are denied due to the lack of supporting evidence and authorities presented in the moving papers. The Court previously denied a motion to remove encumbrances, and the Labor Commissioner is seeking to set aside the judgments, claiming the judgments were entered erroneously due to settlement agreements. The Court finds that the applications lack sufficient evidence and authorities to support the relief sought. The ruling is without prejudice to the Labor Commissioner's right to file properly noticed motions with scheduled hearing dates and including all relevant evidence and authorities in support of the relief sought.
