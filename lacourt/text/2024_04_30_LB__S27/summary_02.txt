And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Labor Commissioner filed a petition to have the Clerk enter judgment in three related cases. Respondent Baljeet Bansal filed a motion to remove encumbrances, which was denied by the court. The Labor Commissioner then filed applications to set aside the judgments, which were also denied. The court's ruling is based on the lack of authority and evidence presented in the moving papers. The applications were denied, and the court ordered the Labor Commissioner to give notice. The parties are ordered to submit on the tentative ruling by emailing the court, or they will be expected to appear remotely at the hearing.
