 Case Number:  23LBCV00974    Hearing Date:   April 30, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.    
Background
Facts
Plaintiffs, Jesus and Diana Renteria filed this action against
Defendants, Pinner Construction Co., Inc.., et al. on 6/06/23.  Plaintiffs’ operative complaint is their
First Amended Complaint, which they filed before any pleading challenge was
heard, on 6/09/23.  The FAC includes
causes of action for general negligence, premises liability, and loss of
consortium.  The FAC alleges the
defendants, and each of them, provided negligent drawings, plans,
specifications, safety instructions, and designs for Plaintiff to use in
constructing a building.  As a result,
the building Plaintiff was working on collapsed, causing him to sustain grave
injuries.  His wife sues for loss of
consortium.  
 
2.    
Motion
to Compel
Plaintiffs propounded RPDs, FROGs,
and SROGs on Defendant, Kern Steel Fabrication, Inc. on 8/04/23.  Defendant obtained extensions of time to
respond, and ultimately served unverified responses to SROGs and RPDs on 12/11/23.  Defendant had not, as of the filing of the
moving papers, served responses to FROGs.
 
Plaintiffs seek an order compelling
Defendant to serve responses to FROGs, without objections, and to serve
verifications to the RPDs and SROGs.  Defendant,
in opposition to the motion, indicates it provided responses to FROGs with the
opposition and will provide verifications prior to the due date for the
reply.  Plaintiffs, in reply, indicate
they have still not received verifications. 
To the extent the request for verifications is not rendered moot prior
to the hearing, the motion is granted. 
CCP §§2030.290(a), (b), 2031.300(a), (b).  Defendant must serve verifications within ten
days.
 
Plaintiffs also seek an order
compelling Defendant to produce documents responsive to RPDs 10 and 15.  Defendant, in its unverified response to
these RPDs, indicated it would produce all responsive documents.  Plaintiffs contend it failed, however, to do
so.  Defendant, in opposition, contends
it provided all responsive documents, but Plaintiffs, in reply, contend
Defendant did not do so.  To the extent
the documents have not been provided, the motion to compel is also
granted.  CCP §2031.320(a).  Defendant must produce responsive documents
within ten days.
 
Plaintiffs seek imposition of
monetary sanctions.  They seek sanctions
in the amount of $1061.65 against Defendant and its attorney of record to
compensate for attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in making this motion.  The request is both reasonable and fully
supported, and is granted in full.  CCP
§§2030.290(c), 2031.300(c), 2031.320(b). 

 
Plaintiffs also seek imposition of
a $1000 penalty against Defense Counsel per CCP §2023.050(a), which provides:
Notwithstanding any other law, and
in addition to any other sanctions imposed pursuant to this chapter, a court
shall impose a one-thousand-dollar ($1,000) sanction, payable to the requesting
party, upon a party, person, or attorney if, upon reviewing a request for a
sanction made pursuant to Section 2023.040, the court finds any of the
following: 
(1) The party, person, or attorney
did not respond in good faith to a request for the production of documents made
pursuant to Section 2020.010, 2020.410, 2020.510, or 2025.210, or to an
inspection demand made pursuant to Section 2031.010. 
(2) The party, person, or attorney
produced requested documents within seven days before the court was scheduled
to hear a motion to compel production of the records pursuant to Section
2025.450, 2025.480, or 2031.320 that is filed by the requesting party as a
result of the other party's, person's, or attorney's failure to respond in good
faith. 
(3) The party, person, or attorney
failed to confer in person, by telephone, letter, or other means of
communication in writing, as defined in Section 250 of the Evidence Code, with
the party or attorney requesting the documents in a reasonable and good faith
attempt to resolve informally any dispute concerning the request.
 
Plaintiff contends Defense Counsel
is subject to this sanction because verifications were promised but not
provided, and also because responsive documents were promised but not
provided.  Defendant, in opposition to
the motion, contends additional sanctions should not be awarded because there
were no false or misleading statements made. 
The standard above, however, is simply that the party failed to act in
good faith to provide responses to an inspection demand.  Plaintiffs made the required showing in the
moving papers, and Defendant did not meaningfully respond to the showing in
opposition, instead basically conceding the failure to timely respond and
failing to provide any justification for the failure.  The request for this sanction is therefore
also granted.  
 
Defendant and its attorney of
record, jointly and severally, must pay sanctions to Plaintiffs, by and through
their attorney of record, in the total amount of $1061.65, within twenty
days.  Defense Counsel must pay an
additional sanction of $1000 to Plaintiffs, by and through their attorney of
record, also within twenty days.  
 
3.     Motion
for Leave to Amend
Plaintiffs reserved a hearing on a motion for leave to amend for
4/30/24.  It appears the motion is moot,
as Plaintiffs filed their operative Third Amended Complaint, pursuant to
stipulation and order, on 4/04/24.  The
Court therefore takes the hearing on the motion for leave to amend off
calendar.   
 
4.     OSC
and CMC
The parties are reminded that there
is an OSC re: proof of service on calendar concurrently with the hearing on the
above motions.  The Court asks Counsel to
make arrangements to appear remotely at the OSC and hearing on the motions.
