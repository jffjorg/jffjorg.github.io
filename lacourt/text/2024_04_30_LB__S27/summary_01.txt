And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Labor Commissioner commenced three actions by filing petitions to have the Clerk enter judgment. The petitions were filed on behalf of Sarbjeet Singh, the real party in interest. The petitions sought to have judgment entered against the respondents, including Baljeet Bansal, Balwinder Kaur, and SG Nanda Agency, Inc.

The Court denied Respondent Bansal's motion to remove encumbrances, finding that there was no authority presented in support of the relief sought, and that Bansal had not given notice of the motion to the labor commissioner. The Court also denied the applications to set aside the judgments, finding that there was no evidence presented to support the relief sought, and that the applications were entirely devoid of evidence concerning the terms of the settlements and payments. The Court ordered the labor commissioner to give notice, and scheduled a hearing for April 30, 2024.
