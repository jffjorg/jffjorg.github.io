And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case filed by Carlos Freddis Peraza against Total Terminals International, LLC. The case involves an automobile accident that occurred on the defendant's property, resulting in injuries and damages to the plaintiff. The plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses to RFAs (Requests for Admission) from the defendant, but the defendant objected on various grounds. The court denied the plaintiff's motion because it failed to meet and confer with the defendant before filing the motion, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.290(b)(1). The court noted that the defendant did not seek imposition of sanctions with the opposition papers, and therefore no sanctions are imposed. The parties are required to notify the court of their intent to submit on the tentative ruling, and if no appearances are made at the hearing, the motion may be placed off calendar.
