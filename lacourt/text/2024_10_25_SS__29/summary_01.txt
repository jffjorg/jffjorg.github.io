And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the defendant's motion for a deemed-admitted order, which sought to deem the plaintiff's responses to the defendant's requests for admission as admitted. The judge finds that the plaintiff served a response that is in substantial compliance with the relevant code section, and therefore the motion is denied. The judge grants the defendant's request for sanctions, imposing a sanction of $600 on the plaintiff and her counsel for failing to serve a timely response to the requests for admission. The judge orders the plaintiff and her counsel to pay the sanction within 30 days of notice.
