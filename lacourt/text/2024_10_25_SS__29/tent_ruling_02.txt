Authority
21STCV36936
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On October 6, 2021, Denise Chow (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
(“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 10, asserting causes of action for motor
vehicle negligence and general negligence arising out of an alleged accident
occurring on April 19, 2021. 
 
Defendant filed its answer on April 28, 2023.
 
On September 30, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to
compel the deposition of Plaintiff. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action … to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection
and copying.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280,
subd. (a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
Section
2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  
Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).)  
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses
of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
Discussion
Defendant
seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to appear for deposition.
 
On June
28, 2024, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for July 24, 2024. (Preciado
Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. 1.) The deposition was cancelled.  (Id., ¶ 3.)  
 
On
September 6, 2024, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for September 23,
2024. (Id., ¶ 4 & Exh. 2.) Before the scheduled deposition, Defense
counsel reached out to Plaintiff’s counsel to confirm that Plaintiff would
attend; Plaintiff’s counsel stated he would provide Plaintiff’s availability by
the end of day but failed to do so. (Id., ¶ 5.) 
 
Plaintiff
did not appear for deposition on September 23. (Id., ¶ 6 & Exh. 4.)
Defendant
has the right under the Civil Discovery Act to take the deposition of Plaintiff.  But to obtain a court order compelling
Plaintiff to appear, Defendant must satisfy all of the procedural requirements
set forth in the applicable statutes. 
That includes the requirement that the moving party submit, with the
motion, either a meet and confer declaration or a declaration showing that the
moving party “has
contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(b).)  
No such
declaration has been submitted here.  The
declaration of Defendant’s counsel does not show that there was an effort to
meet and confer after the nonappearance or even an inquiry to Plaintiff’s
counsel about the nonappearance.
 
Accordingly,
the motion to compel is denied without prejudice.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff Denise Chow’s
deposition.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
