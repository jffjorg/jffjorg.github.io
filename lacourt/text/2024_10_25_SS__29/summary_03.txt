Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion of Cross-Defendants Metro Investments Group, Inc. and Apex Development, Inc. to set aside the defaults entered against them on the cross-complaint. The court finds that the defaults are void because the plaintiff did not serve a statement of damages on the defendants before the defaults were entered, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11. The court grants leave to Apex Development, Inc. to file a proposed answer within seven days of the hearing date and sets aside the defaults entered on June 18, 2024, as against both defendants.
