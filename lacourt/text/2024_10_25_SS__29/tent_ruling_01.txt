  Case Number:  21STCV23166    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2024    Dept:  29 Herrera v. Scott
21STCV23166
Defendant’s Motion for Order Deeming Plaintiff to Have Admitted the Truth of
the Matters Specified in Defendant’s Request for Admissions (Set One).
Tentative
The motion is denied.
The request for sanctions is granted in part.
Background
On June 22, 2021, Eva Hererra (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Kathy Scott (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 10 for general
negligence arising out of an alleged dog attack incident on June 24, 2019.
 
On July 7, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.
 
On September 16, 2024, Defendant filed
this motion for a deemed-admitted order. 
Plaintiff filed an opposition on October 11.
 
 Legal Standard
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
“[P]roviding untimely responses does not divest the trial court of
its authority [to hear a motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.)  “The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348(a).)  
Discussion
On July 20, 2024, Defendant served
Plaintiff with Requests for Admission (Set One). (Morand Decl., ¶ 2.) Plaintiff
served responses, without objections, on October 11, 2024. (See Exhibit to
Opposition.)
 
Plaintiff has
served, before the hearing, a response that is in substantial compliance with
Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220. 
Accordingly, the motion for a deemed-admitted order is denied.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c);
see also, e.g., St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762,
778-780.)
The chapter in the Civil Discovery
Act governing requests for admission provides for a “mandatory” imposition of
sanctions “on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely
response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [for a
deemed-admitted order].”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
The Court finds that the failure of
Plaintiff and her attorney of record necessitated this motion.  Accordingly, the request for sanctions is
granted in part.  The Court sets
sanctions in the amount of $600, calculated based on two hours of attorney time
multiplied by a reasonable billing rate of $300 per hour for work of this
nature.  (See Morand Decl., ¶ 7.)
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES Defendant’s Motion
for a Deemed-Admitted Order. 
 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s request
for sanctions.
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Eva
Hererra and her counsel of record, Timothy L. O’Reily, jointly and severally, to
pay sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of $810 to Defendant Kathy
Scott (through counsel) within 30 days of notice. 
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
