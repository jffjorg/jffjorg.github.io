Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff, Denise Chow, without prejudice. The defendant had noticed the plaintiff's deposition twice, but the plaintiff did not appear for the scheduled depositions. The defendant did not submit the required declarations showing that they contacted the plaintiff to inquire about the nonappearance or attempted to meet and confer after the nonappearance. The judge noted that the defendant has the right to take the deposition of the plaintiff under the California Code of Civil Procedure, but must satisfy all procedural requirements, including submitting the required declarations.
