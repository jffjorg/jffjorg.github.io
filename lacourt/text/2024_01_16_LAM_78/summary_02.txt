And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Novel et al. v. Bank of America et al., case number 23STCV04089. The case involves a demurrer filed by Defendant Bank of America to Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint, as well as a motion to strike requests for attorney's fees and punitive damages.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer as to the second cause of action for negligence, finding that the negligence claim is barred by the economic loss rule. The Judge has overruled the demurrer as to the remaining causes of action, including breach of written contract, conversion, and receipt of stolen property.

The Judge has denied the motion to strike the request for attorney's fees, finding that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to support a claim for attorney's fees. However, the Judge has granted the motion to strike the request for punitive damages, finding that the complaint does not contain sufficient allegations to support a claim for punitive damages against Defendant Bank of America as a corporate entity.

The Judge has also scheduled a hearing for January 16, 2024, at which time the parties will discuss the issue of leave to amend the complaint, as well as the status of the Third Amended Complaint received on December 26, 2023.
