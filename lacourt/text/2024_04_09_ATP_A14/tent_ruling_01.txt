Maria Pelayo (“Plaintiff”) is the motion of Decedent Jonathan Alfaro
(“Decedent”). Plaintiff alleges that on February 18, 2022, in the parking lot
at Pete Knight High School and Knight Academy Junior Prep High School (the
“Parking Lot”) which is within the supervision, control, and guidance of
Defendant Antelope Valley Union High School District (“AVUHSD”), Defendant
Rachel Cruz (“Rachel”)[1]
and several students were lined up to “burn rubber” (i.e., engaging in sharp
turns and driving recklessly around the lot at high speeds) when Decedent was
thrown from the back of a truck driven by Rachel, sustaining blunt trauma to
his head, feet, and legs, and, ultimately, leading to his death. Plaintiff
presents that there were no security officers or school administrators present
during the incident.

Legal Standard
 
Standard for Compelling
Further Responses to Requests for Production (“RFPs”) – “Unless otherwise limited
by order of the court in accordance with this title, any party may obtain
discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject
matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion
made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”
(Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.) For discovery purposes, information
is regarded as relevant “if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating
the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement thereof.” (City of
Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 272,
288.)      
      
A motion to compel further responses
to a demand for inspection or production of documents (“RFP”) may be brought
based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or
incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly
generalized objections.  (Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§ 2031.310(a).)      
     
Notice of the motion must be given
within 45 days of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response,
or on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.310(c).)     
      
A motion to compel further production
must set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery
sought by the inspection demand. (See Cal. Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310(b)(1).) In Digital Music News LLC v Superior Court (2014)
226 Cal.App.4th 216 at 224, the Court defined “good cause” as a showing that
there is “a disputed fact that is of consequence in the action and
the discovery sought will tend in reason to prove or disprove that fact or lead
to other evidence that will tend to prove or disprove the
fact.”       
      
If the moving party has shown good
cause for the requests for production, the burden is on the objecting party to
justify the objections. (Kirkland v. Sup. Ct (2002) 95 Cal.
App.4th 92, 98.)      
      
“The court shall limit the scope of
discovery if it determines that the burden, expense, or intrusiveness of that
discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood that the information sought will
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §
2017.020(a).) Generally, objections on the ground of burden require the
objecting party to produce evidence of (a) the propounding party’s subjective
intent to create burden, or (b) the amount of time and effort it would take to
actually respond. (See West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v.
Superior Court In and For Los Angeles County (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407,
417.) However, where discovery is obviously overbroad on its face, no such
evidence is necessary. (See Obregon v. Superior Court (1998)
67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.)       
      
Trial courts are vested with “wide
discretion” to allow or prohibit discovery. (Williams v. Superior Court (2017)
3 Cal.5th 531, 540.)

Discussion
 
Application – Requests
for Production (“RFPs”) No. 1, 3, 15, 22, and 32 concern a police report. 
 
AVUHSD presents the following
arguments:
 
(1)   A three-page police report is not the
complete report;
(2)   The police report alone is not the entirety
of the documents pertaining the underlying incident which gives rise to Rachel’s
Cross-Complaint;
(3)  
Rachel
has complete control over these documents;
(4)  
Rachel
has not followed the statutory response format under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.230; and
(5)  
Ali v. Apple, Inc., No. 19CV356117, (Cal.Super.
Oct. 14, 2021) 2021 WL 11561428, at *3 (“Ali”) citing A. Farber &
Ptnrs., Inc. v. Garber (C.D. Cal. 2006) 234 F.R.D. 186, 189 states: “
‘There is authority for the proposition that if documents requested from a
party are maintained by a third party not a party to the lawsuit, the
responding party has an obligation to obtain those documents if there is a
contractual relationship between the responding party and the third party.’ ”
 
Rachel’s responses to these arguments are: (1) she has produced whatever
document are in her possession as to the police report; (2) she cannot demand
such documents from the authorities absent a subpoena, which moving party has
admittedly done; (3) she cannot produce documents that she has never had or has
not been able to obtain from her former criminal counsel; (4) the information
sought is vague; (5) her responses are in good faith; and (5) as to some
responses, the responses indicate that she has no such documents. 
 
As to the Ali argument, used also in arguments as to RFP Nos.
34-35, this Court is not bound by the decisions of another trial court. A.
Farber & Ptnrs., Inc. v. Garber (C.D. Cal. 2006) 234 F.R.D. 186
concerns supplemental production under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
not Cal. Code Civ. Proc. Thus, this argument is inapposite. 
 
The Court
directs the parties to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.210-2031.250 for formatting
of responses to inspection demands. 
 
Response to RFP No. 1:
“After a diligent search and reasonable inquiry, we have no documents that be
responsive to this request; cross defendant does not believe any such documents
ever existed, other than the police report; A copy of that document was
previously produced; We have already produced whatever documents are in my
possession with respect to the Juvenile Court matter; Neither I nor my attorney
have been able to reach my former criminal counsel, Jesse Duran, who I may have
additional documents[.]”
 
(Response to Separate Statement
at RFP No. 1; Motion, Exh. D at RFP No. 1.) 
 
While this response states that a
diligent search and reasonable inquiry has ben conducted and no documents are
responsive, the response also states that (1) a police report exists and was
produced, and (2) Rachel’s former criminal counsel may have additional
documents. 
 
“A representation of inability to
comply with the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling
shall affirm that a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in
an effort to comply with that demand. This statement shall also specify whether
the inability to comply is because the particular item or category has never
existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never
been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding
party. The statement shall set forth the name and address of any natural person
or organization known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or
control of that item or category of item.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.230.) 
 
Rachel’s response to RFP No. 1 is
not compliant with Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.230. 
 
Response to RFP No. 3:
“After a diligent search we are not aware that any such documents ever existed,
other than the police report, which was previously produced.”
 
As with the Response to RFP No.
1, this response indicates that (1) no documents existed, but (2) a police
report exists which answers the response. However, the police report is not
included as Rachel states that she has already produced it. While the Court
understands that production may have occurred previously, the current reference
to previously produced documents is not an adequate response. It does not
comply with Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.210-2031.250 nor does it comply with Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.280 which states that “[a]ny documents or category of
documents produced in response to a demand...shall be identified with the
specific request number to which the documents respond.” 
 
(Response to Separate Statement
at RFP No. 3; Motion, Exh. D at RFP No. 3.) 
 
Response to RFP No. 15:
“After a diligent search, we have not attempted to obtain any of the requested
documents other than what has been voluntarily provided to us by cross
complainant’s counsel.”
 
(Response to Separate Statement
at RFP No. 15; Motion, Exh. D at RFP No. 15.) 
 
On its face, the response to RFP
No. 15 does not comply with Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.210-2031.250. 
 
Response
to RFP No. 22: “Other than the Police Report, which has already been
produced. After a diligent search we are not aware that any other such
documents ever existed; We have no documents responsive to this request.”
 
(Response to Separate Statement
at RFP No. 22; Motion, Exh. D at RFP No. 22.) 
 
For the same reasons as the
analysis for the response to RFP No. 3, this response is not code compliant.
 
Response to RFP No. 32:
“After a diligent search we are not aware that any such documents ever existed;
We have no documents responsive to this request other than the police report,
which has been produced[.]”
 
(Response to Separate Statement
at RFP No. 32; Motion, Exh. D at RFP No. 32.) 
 
For the same reasons as the
analysis for the response to RFP No. 3, this response is not code compliant.
 
RFPs No. 24, 25, 26, and 31
concern responses in which this lawsuit is represented as “brought on behalf of
Plaintiff.”  
 
RFPs No. 24 through 26 are
relatively similar. They request “All DOCUMENTS which IDENTIFY any claims, complaints
or actions by PLAINTIFF or anyone acting on behalf of PLAINTIFF or DECEDENT”
against Rachel, Richard, and Edelia. (See Response to Separate Statement at RFP
Nos. 24-26; Motion, Exh. D at RFP Nos. 24-26.)
 
RFP No. 31 requests “[p]roduce
each DOCUMENT[] tangible thing and/or other property which are identified or
referenced in the response to Special Interrogatory Number 20, served
concurrently with this Request.” (See Response to Separate Statement at RFP No.
31; Motion, Exh. D at RFP Nos. 20 and 31.)
 
As to RFPs Nos. 24-26, Rachel has
provided: “Objection, ambiguous; While reserving that objection, we have no
documents other than this lawsuit which was ‘brought on behalf of Plaintiff.’ ”
(See Response to Separate Statement at RFP Nos. 24-26; Motion, Exh. D at RFP
Nos. 24-26.) Rachel’s ambiguous objections are meritless. These responses are
not compliant with Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.210-2031.250 nor does it comply
with Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.280 which states that “[a]ny documents or
category of documents produced in response to a demand...shall be identified
with the specific request number to which the documents respond.”
 
As to RFP No. 31, Special
Interrogatory No. 20 has not been disclosed to the Court. The Court notes that
it does not know the context of RFP No. 31; however, the response provided [“After
a diligent search we are not aware that any such documents; We have no
documents responsive to this
request other than this lawsuit.”] is not code compliant as (1) the statement
regarding the documents is incomplete, and (2) the response does not follow the
statutory requirements of Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.210-2031.250, 2031.280. 
 
RFPs 33 and 34 likewise request
production of items that were used to answer special interrogatories. (See Response
to Separate Statement at RFP No. 33 and Motion, Exh. D at RFP No. 33 [“Produce
each DOCUMENT. tangible thing and/or other property which are
identified or referenced in the
response to Special Interrogatory Number 23, served concurrently with this
Request.”]; Response to Separate Statement at RFP No. 34 and Motion, Exh. D at
RFP No. 34 [“Produce each DOCUMENT. tangible thing and/or other property which
are identified or referenced in the response to Special Interrogatory Number
24, served concurrently with this Request.”].) 
 
Rachel’s response to RFP No. 33
reads: “We have produced Rachel’s letter to Jonathan’s mother. Other than that
document, we have performed a diligent search and cannot find any other
documents which would be responsive to this request.” (See Response to Separate
Statement at RFP No. 33 and Motion, Exh. D at RFP No. 33.) This response is not
compliant with Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.210-2031.250 nor does it comply
with Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.280 which states that “[a]ny documents or
category of documents produced in response to a demand...shall be identified
with the specific request number to which the documents respond.”
 
Rachel’s response to RFP No. 34
reads: “After a diligent search , neither I nor my civil counsel have any
documents that would be responsive to this request; My criminal counsel, Jesse
Duran might have documents but has not responded to my attorney’s emails or
telephone calls[.]” (See Response to Separate Statement at RFP No. 34 and
Motion, Exh. D at RFP No. 34.) This response is not code compliant under Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.230.
 
RFP No. 35 reads: “Produce each
written statement provided by CROSS-DEFENDANT RACHEL CRUZ to any PERSON
regarding the SUBJECT INCIDENT.” (See Response to Separate Statement at RFP No.
35 and Motion, Exh. D at RFP No. 35.)
 
Rachel’s response reads: “After a
diligent search , neither I nor my civil counsel have any documents that would
be responsive to this request; My criminal counsel, Jesse Duran might have
documents but has not responded to my attorney’s emails or telephone calls[.]”
(See ibid.)
 
For the same reasons as RFP No.
34, this response is not code compliant. 
 
RFP No. 36 reads: “Produce all
reports made by any person or entity concerning the SUBJECT INCIDENT.” (See
Response to Separate Statement at RFP No. 36 and Motion, Exh. D at RFP No. 36.)
 
Rachel’s
response reads: “Objection, this request is vague, ambiguous and overly broad
and seeks information which is irrelevant to the issues presented and is not
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. It also seeks
information which may be subject to the attorney-client and work product
privileges. While reserving those objections, we have no other documents that
would be responsive to this request.” (Ibid.)
 
The objections
regarding vague, ambiguous, and overly broad are without merit. To the extent
Rachel’s objections are based on privilege, privilege responses “shall provide
sufficient factual information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that
claim, including, if necessary, a privilege log” and Rachel’s responses do not
do so. (See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(b)(c)(1).) Rachel’s statement that
“we have no other documents that would be responsive to this request” does not
adhere to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.230. 
 
Accordingly,
the Motion to Compel Further is GRANTED. Rachel is to Provide code-compliant
responses within 30 days of this Court’s Order.
 
-----
 
Sanctions
 
While the moving papers do not
specifically request sanctions, Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(h) requires
sanctions as follows:
 
Except as provided
in subdivision (j), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.
 
As presented in the Response to
Separate Statement, Rachel believes that her responses are appropriate and in
good faith and indicates that Rachel does not have certain documents. However,
they are not code-compliant. No justification has been presented for why the
responses were not presented in the appropriate format. 
 
Accordingly, the Court imposes a
sanction of $500.00 on Rachel and her counsel of record, David Arthur Belofsky,
jointly and severally.  
 
-----
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant/Cross-Defendant
Antelope Valley Union High School’s Motion to Compel Further Responses and
Produce Documents without Objections is GRANTED.
 
The Court imposes a sanction of $500.00
on Cross-Defendant/Cross-Complainant Rachel Lauren Cruz and her counsel of
record, David Arthur Belofsky, jointly and severally.  
 
Cross-Defendants/Cross-Complainants Rachel Lauren Cruz
is ordered to provide code-compliant responses within 30 days of this Court
Order.
