Significant Statements:
  - "A superior court must evaluate two interrelated factors when ruling on a request for a preliminary injunction: (1) the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial and (2) the interim harm that the plaintiff would be likely to sustain if the injunction were denied as compared to the harm the defendant would be likely to suffer if the preliminary injunction were issued."
  - "Procedural unconscionability focuses on the elements of oppression and surprise."
  - "Substantive unconscionability focuses on the actual terms of the agreement and evaluates whether they create overly harsh or one-sided results."
```

Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the defendants from proceeding with the foreclosure sale of the real property at issue. The court finds that the loan agreement and deed of trust are unconscionable and that the plaintiff has a likelihood of prevailing on the merits. The court also finds that the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm if the foreclosure occurs, as the loss of his house would be a greater harm to him than the defendants' delayed recovery of money. The court will hear further argument from the parties at the hearing on the amount required for the bond.
