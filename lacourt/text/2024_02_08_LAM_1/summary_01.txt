And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's renewed motion to transfer the case to another department and request for immediate stay of proceedings. The judge noted that the plaintiff's previous motion to transfer was denied on September 21, 2023, and that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any factual or legal basis for the transfer. The judge also stated that a motion to transfer is not a valid substitute for the proper procedural mechanisms to request disqualification of a judicial officer and seek review of any denial thereof.
