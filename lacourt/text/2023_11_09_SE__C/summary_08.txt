And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the cross-complaint and the demurrer to the complaint. With regard to the cross-complaint, the judge overrules the demurrer and orders the cross-complainant to file and serve an answer within 20 days. With regard to the complaint, the judge sustains the demurrer with 15 days leave to amend. The judge also finds that the motion to strike is rendered moot. The case concerns a premises liability action filed by the plaintiffs, Arturo and Clarissa Beltran, against the defendants, DOWNEY'S BILLIARD, LLC and HAYK GEVORKYAN. The plaintiffs allege that they were injured as a result of a violent incident that occurred at a nightclub owned by the defendants. The defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that all six claims are barred by the statute of limitations. The judge finds that the plaintiffs failed to serve the defendant DIVERSIFIED PROTECTIVE SERVICES within three years of the filing of the complaint and that the claims are therefore barred by the statute of limitations.
