Defendant COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES’S motion to dismiss the
entire action is DENIED. The motion to dismiss the first and fourth
causes of action is GRANTED. 
 
Moving Party to give Notice. 

 
“The court may dismiss the complaint as to [a] defendant
when…after a demurrer to the complaint is sustained with leave to amend, the
plaintiff fails to amend it within the time allowed by the court and either
party moves for dismissal.” (CCP §581(f)(2).) CCP §581(m) further provides that
“[t]he provisions of this section shall not be deemed to be an exclusive
enumeration of the court’s power to dismiss an action or dismiss a complaint as
to a defendant.” The trial court also has authority to dismiss a complaint
based on its inherent power to control the litigation. (See CCP §583.150.) Two
factors are evaluated in exercising this discretionary power: “(1) the
plaintiff has failed to prosecute diligently; or (2) the complaint has been
shown to be ‘fictitious or sham’ such that [the] plaintiff has no valid cause
of action.” (Pearlson v. Does 1 to 646 (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 1005,
1010.) 
 
On February 23, 2023, this Court sustained Defendant COUNTY
OF LOS ANGELES’S (“County”) demurrer to the first and fourth causes of action
in Plaintiff’s Complaint with 30 days leave to amend.  Plaintiff failed to file a First Amended
Complaint within the time allowed.  Rather,
Plaintiff submitted a proposed First Amended Complaint in conjunction with the
Opposition to the instant Motion on October 26, 2023, more than seven months
after it was due.  
 
Plaintiff attributes the delay to moving office space and
staff being out of the office for an extended period of time. (Moossai Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.) However, these assertions
are undermined by Defendant’s contention that Plaintiff was notified several
times that the FAC was overdue.  The
instant motion was filed on June 20, 2023. 
At two case management conferences (held on July 17, 2023 and September
22, 2023) Defense counsel reminded the clerk that counsel had not received the
FAC. (Gupta Decl., ¶¶
2-3.)  Under these circumstances, the
court exercises its discretion to dismiss the first and fourth causes of action
as to the County.    
 
The County’s Motion to Dismiss the entire action against
it is DENIED. The County’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint only attacked the
first and fourth causes of action, and this Court’s February 23, 2023 Order only
addressed the first and fourth causes of action. The second and third causes of
action remain viable against the County. 
 
Accordingly, the Motion to Dismiss the first and fourth
causes of action with prejudice against the County is GRANTED. (Cano v.
Glover (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 326, 329-330.)  Plaintiff did not amend these causes of
action within the time allowed by this Court after the Demurrer to the
Complaint was sustained with 30 days leave to amend.
