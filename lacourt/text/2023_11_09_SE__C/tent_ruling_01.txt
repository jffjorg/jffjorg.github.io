I.       
Defendant
ANA GAMA’s unopposed Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Initial Responses to Request
for Production of Documents (set two) is GRANTED. 
 
   
II.       
Defendant
ANA GAMA’s unopposed Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Initial Responses to Supplemental Interrogatories (set two)
is GRANTED. 
 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
No
Opposition(s) filed as of November 6, 2023. 
 
If a party
to whom interrogatories and document demands are directed fails to respond at
all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers
thereto. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) All that needs to be shown is that the
discovery was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond
has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. The moving party
is not required to show a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the
matter informally before filing this motion. A motion to compel initial
discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely
filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate statement. (See Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The failure to timely respond also waives all
objections. 
 
Here,
Defendant has shown that Request for Production of Documents (set two) and
Supplemental Interrogatory (set two) were properly served onto Plaintiff on February
28, 2023. The deadlines to respond have expired, and no responses of any kind
have been provided.  These Motions were
filed June 26, 2023— about three months after service of the discovery. As of November
6, 2023, no substantive Oppositions have been filed to the subject Motions. 
 
Therefore,
the Motions to Compel are GRANTED,
and Plaintiff EDWIN FIGUEROA is ORDERED
to provide verified responses and documents, without objection by no later
than 15 days from date of the Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may
be extended by stipulation of the parties. If any objections are asserted, it
will be tantamount to no response at all and will be deemed a violation of this
Court’s order. 
 
Sanctions
may be awarded against a party who fails to oppose a motion to compel. (C.R.C
3.1348(a).). Plaintiff failed to submit any Oppositions to the instant Motions.
As such, there is nothing to show that he acted with substantial justification
and the Court knows of no other circumstances which would make the imposition
of sanctions unjust.  
 
Reasonable
Sanctions are awarded as follows: Plaintiff EDWIN FIGUEROA is ORDERED to pay Moving
Party and their counsel of record reasonable sanctions in the total amount of $1,099.00.
($475/hr. x 2 hrs.) ($149 costs) no later than 30 days from the Court’s
issuance of this Order. This date may be extended per agreement of the
parties.
