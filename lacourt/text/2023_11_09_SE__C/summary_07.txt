And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the unopposed Demurrer to the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Marcel Padilla against Defendant Estrella Flores, D.D.S. The Demurrer argues that the Complaint is barred by the statute of limitations, as it was filed more than one year after the discovery of the injury. The Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Flores negligently broke his tooth while extracting it, but the Complaint was filed on January 23, 2023, when it should have been filed by January 27, 2022. The Court has sustained the Demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the Plaintiff's Complaint is invalid and the case will likely be dismissed.
