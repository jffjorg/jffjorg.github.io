And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling on the motion to dismiss the entire action against the County of Los Angeles. The motion to dismiss the first and fourth causes of action is granted, as the plaintiff failed to amend their complaint within the time allowed after the demurrer was sustained. However, the motion to dismiss the entire action is denied, as the County's demurrer only attacked the first and fourth causes of action, and the second and third causes of action remain viable against the County. The court exercises its discretion to dismiss the first and fourth causes of action, citing the plaintiff's failure to prosecute diligently and the complaint's lack of validity.
