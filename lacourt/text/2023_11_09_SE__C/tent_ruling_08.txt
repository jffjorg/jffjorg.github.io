Prevailing Party to give notice.
 
This action for premises liability was filed by Plaintiffs
ARTURO BELTRAN and CLARISSA BELTRAN (“Plaintiffs”) on May 25, 2018. Plaintiffs
allege that “[o]n or about May 28, 2016 at around 12:00 AM, Plaintiff ARTURO
BELTRAN, along with his daughter CLARISSA BELTRAN were paying patrons at the
SUBJECT PREMISES at Club DB Lounge which was owned, operated, managed and or
controlled by Defendant DOWNEY’S BILLIARD, LLC… and/or HAYK GEVORKYAN. The
SUBJECT PREMISES is marketed as ‘LA’s and OC’s hottest 21 + Nightclub for 5
years running.” (Complaint ¶12.) “Not too long after being inside the SUBJECT
PREMISES, and as Plaintiff ARTURO BELTRAN, knelt down to fix his leg-fast brace,
he was viciously kicked in the head and savagely beaten without any warning or provocation
by ‘security personnel’ or DOE BOUNCERS acting within the course and scope of
their employment…. Plaintiff was dragged about 50 feet to the exit.” (Complaint
¶15.) “Plaintiff CLARISSA BELTRAN sustained significant emotional injuries
after witnessing her father being attacked by DOE BOUNCERS.” (Complaint ¶17.) 
 
Plaintiffs’ Complaint asserts the following causes of
action: 
 
(1) General
Negligence; 
(2) Premises
Liability; 
(3) Assault/Battery;

(4) Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress; 
(5) Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress; 
(6) Negligent
Hiring, Training, Supervision, and Retention of Employees 
 
On March 10, 2023, Defendants/Cross-Complainants DOWNEY’S
BILLIARD LLC and HAYK GEVORKYAN (“Defendants” or “Cross-Complainants”) filed a
Cross-Complaint for Indemnity against Cross-Defendant DIVERSIFIED PROTECTIVE
SERVICES (“Cross-Defendant”). Cross-Complainants allege Cross-Complainants and
Cross-Defendant entered into a written contract whereby Cross-Defendant agreed
to furnish security guards for Cross-Complainants’ business and hold
Cross-Complainants harmless from any liability resulting from the acts or
omissions of its security guards. Cross-Complainants allege that
Cross-Defendant agreed to indemnify and hold Cross-Complainants harmless from
any liability Cross-Complainants might sustain as a consequence of the acts or
omissions of Cross-Defendant’s security guards. (XC ¶ 5.) 
 
Cross-Defendant DIVERSIFIED PROTECTIVE SERVICES’ Demurrer
to the Cross-Complaint 
 
Cross-Defendant PROTECTIVE SERVICES Demurs to the entire
Cross-Complaint on the basis that the entire Cross-Complaint is barred by the
statute of limitations. 
 
On May 9, 2023, Cross-Complainants filed a limited
Opposition arguing that this Court lacks jurisdiction to issue a ruling on the
merits because Cross-Defendants’ Demurrer is untimely for failure to comply
with CCP §1010.6 “by short serving and short filing the Demurrer by one day.
Cross-Defendants should have been served on Defendants by email on April 23,
2023.” (Opp. 2:5-7.) 
 
No substantive Opposition or Reply have been filed as of
November 6, 2023. 
 
The Subject Demurrer was filed on April 25, 2023. This
matter was originally scheduled for hearing on May 17, 2023 at the Spring
Street Courthouse. However, this action was reassigned to the Norwalk
Courthouse on May 16, 2023, and all pending motions and hearings were ordered
to be reset. This Demurrer was reset for hearing November 9, 2023. Thus, the
Demurrer was timely filed and served prior to October 18, 2023 (16 court days
prior to the new hearing date). (CCP §1005(b).) The Court will issue a ruling
on the merits. 
 
The Cross-Complainant asserts one sole cause of action for
Indemnity based on the breach of a written agreement. The statute of
limitations for breach of a written contract is four years. (CCP §337(a).) Indemnity
claims accrue when the indemnitee sustains an actual loss through payment of a
covered cost, not when the underlying accident occurred. (See, e.g., Adler
v. Sawyer (1919) 40 Cal.App.778, 782.) “The indemnity action, unlike the
plaintiff’s claim, does not accrue for statute of limitations purposes when the
original accident occurs, but instead accrues at the time the tort defendant
pays a judgment or settlement as to which he is entitled to indemnity.” (Valley
Crest Landscape Development, Inc. v. Mission Pools of Escondido, Inc.
(2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 468, 481.) 
 
“The defense of statute of limitations may be asserted by
general demurrer if the complaint shows on its face that the statute bars the
action.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Services (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 1316.)  
 
The face of the Cross-Complaint does not establish that
Cross-Complainant’s claim for indemnity is necessarily barred by any
statute of limitations. A determination of such would require factual
determinations inappropriately decided at the demurrer stage. At this point in
the litigation, no judgment has issued entitling Defendant(s) to
indemnification. 
 
The Demurrer is OVERRULED. 
 
Defendant DIVERSIFIED PROTECTIVE SERVICES’ Demurrer to
Plaintiffs’ Complaint
 
This action was filed on May 25, 2018. On July 27, 2022,
Plaintiffs filed a Doe Amendment naming Defendant DIVERSIFIED PROTECTIVE
SERVICES (“Defendant” or “DPS”) as a defendant to this action, which is over
six years after the date of the alleged incident. 
 
Defendant demurs to the entire Complaint, arguing that all
six claims are barred by the statute of limitations, arguing specifically that
the Cross-Complaint is untimely under CCP §483.210 due to Plaintiffs’ failure
to serve DPS within three years of the filing of the Complaint. 
 
In Opposition, Plaintiffs contend that their claims are
timely filed and not barred by the statute of limitations. 
 
As alleged, DPS was substituted as a Doe defendant more than
three years after the filing of the Complaint. 
 
CCP §583.210 states that “[t]he summons and complaint shall
be served upon a defendant within three years after the action is commenced
against the defendant.” (Id.). 
 
Since Plaintiffs
clearly failed to serve DPS within three years of filing this action on May 25,
2018 and because Plaintiffs do not allege the existence of some valid exception
to the mandatory provisions of CCP §583.210(a), this Court finds that Plaintiffs
have failed to allege a valid cause of action against DPS. 
 
Given Plaintiff’s
arguments in Opposition, the Demurrer is SUSTAINED with 15 days leave to amend.

 
The Motion to Strike
is rendered MOOT.
