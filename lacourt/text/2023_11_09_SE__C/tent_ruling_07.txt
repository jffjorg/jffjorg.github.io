Defendant ESTRELLA FLORES, D.D.S.’s unopposed Demurrer to
Plaintiff’s Complaint is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
 
Moving Party to give notice.
 
No Opposition filed as of November 6, 2023. 
 
Defendant ESRELLA FLORES, D.D.S. generally demurs to the
only cause of action in the Complaint. 
 
On January 23, 2023, Plaintiff Marcel Padilla (“Plaintiff”)
filed this Complaint for Dental Malpractice against Defendants ESTRELLA FLORES,
D.D.S, and DOWNEY SMILE CENTER. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Flores, while
working at Downey Smile, negligently broke his tooth while extracting it. 
 
Defendant Flores argues that Plaintiff’s claim is barred by
the statute of limitations because the Complaint was filed more than one year
after the discovery o the injury. “In an action for injury or death against a
health care provider based upon such person’s alleged professional negligence,
the time for the commencement of action shall be three years after the date of
injury or one year after the plaintiff discovers, or through the use of
reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury, whichever occurs
first. (CCP §340.5.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff alleges that he “Sent a notice of his
intention to commence action based upon Defendants[‘] negligence” on January
27, 2021. Thus, it is evident from the face of the Complaint that Plaintiff
discovered his injury by January 27, 2021 and had until January 27, 2022 to
file his Complaint. 
 
Plaintiff untimely filed his Complaint on January 23, 2023.
Therefore, Plaintiff’s Complaint is barred by the statute of limitations. 


The unopposed Demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
