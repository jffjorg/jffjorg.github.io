And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Ford Motor Company to the first amended complaint filed by Maria Ramirez. The plaintiff is seeking relief under the Song-Beverly Act and negligent repair for defects and nonconformities in a 2020 Ford Explorer that she purchased from a dealership. The judge has sustained Ford's demurrer to the first cause of action, which alleges breach of express warranty, finding that the Song-Beverly Act does not apply to used vehicles sold with a balance remaining on the manufacturer's express warranty. The judge has also sustained Ford's demurrer to the second cause of action, which alleges negligent repair, finding that the economic loss rule bars the plaintiff's recovery. The judge has granted the plaintiff 15 days leave to amend both causes of action.
