And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling discusses the requirements for presenting a claim to the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Board of Supervisors, as outlined in Sections 945.4 and 910 of the California Government Code. The judge notes that Guirguis, the claimant, has not followed the proper procedures for presenting a claim, and therefore, the board's rejection of the claim is valid. The judge also cites the relevant sections of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which require claimants to present a written claim to the public entity and specify the amount claimed, if it is less than $10,000. The judge's tentative ruling suggests that the lawsuit filed by Guirguis may be dismissed due to the failure to follow these procedures.
