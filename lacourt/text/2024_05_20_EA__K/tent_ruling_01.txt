be Relieved as Counsel is CONTINUED to  June 13, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. [see below].
Background   
Case
No. 22PSCV01040
Plaintiff Moore Sweeping (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
Plaintiff and Defendant Guy F. Atkinson
Construction, LLC (“Atkinson”) entered into a contract dated July 19, 2019
(“Contract”), whereby Plaintiff was to perform street sweeping services for
Atkinson on State Route 60 pavement rehabilitation project in Los Angeles
County (the “Project”). The Contract was subject to the Federal Disadvantaged
Business Enterprise (“DBE”) program requirements and the State of California
Department of Transportation’s (“CalTrans”) Disadvantaged Business Enterprise
Policy. 
 
Plaintiff began work on the Project on
December 29, 2019. At the outset, Atkinson did not request more than one DBE
street sweeper for the Project. Plaintiff then became aware that Atkinson was
using another company, Century Sweeping, Inc. (“Century”), for street sweeping
on the Project in violation of the Contract terms. Plaintiff also became aware
that Atkinson had engaged in two separate DBE violations: the illegal
replacement of a DBE subcontractor and prompt payment violations. CalTrans
investigated Atkinson’s alleged violations and, in or about April 2020, found
that Atkinson had indeed committed same. Atkinson terminated the Contract
without notice and without a justifiable reason immediately following the
investigation, on the basis that Plaintiff had not obtained the required
special shift letter from Atkinson’s union, the International Union of
Operating Engineers, Local 12 (“Union”), to begin work at the time it was
instructed to by Atkinson. 
 
Plaintiff was the only subcontractor out of
several that had this special shift letter requirement. Atkinson and Union were
complicit in preventing this letter from being obtained by Plaintiff. At the
time of termination of the Contract, there remained outstanding to Plaintiff
$759,739.23 left on the Contract price. Plaintiff filed a complaint with
CalTrans regarding Atkinson’s termination of the Contract and filed a Stop
Notice, but CalTrans found that Atkinson had good cause to replace Plaintiff.
On October 21, 2022 (i.e., while the action was pending in the
United States District Court, Central District, Case No.
2:22-cv-07496-JFW-AGR), Atkinson filed its “Answer and Counterclaims.”
On April 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a “Amended Verified
Complaint,” asserting causes of action against Atkinson, Union, Joseph Pacheco
(“Pacheco”) and Does 1-10 for:
1.                 
Breach of Contract
2.                 
Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
3.                 
Unfair Business Practices (Bus. & Prof. Code §
17204)
4.                 
Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations
5.                 
Intentional Misrepresentation
6.                 
Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic
Advantage
On April 25, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed Union and Pacheco,
without prejudice.
On November 16, 2023, the court related Case
Nos. 22PSCV01040 and 23PSCV00962; Case No. 22PSCV01040 was designated as the
lead case.
The Final Status
Conference is set for September 24, 2024. Trial is set for October 8, 2024.
Case No. 23PSCV00962
Plaintiff Moore Sweeping (“Plaintiff”)
alleges as follows:
In July 2019, Plaintiff was hired as a subcontractor
by Atkinson to perform street sweeping services for Atkinson on the Project. Pursuant
to its subcontract with Atkinson, Plaintiff was required to hire only Union
employees to work on the Project and to enter into a contract with the Union to
procure the employees needed to perform Plaintiff’s contracted-for work on the
Project. Plaintiff and the Union then entered into a Short-Form Collective
Bargaining Agreement (“CBA”) which was subject to the terms of a Master Labor
Agreement (“MLA”) incorporated therein. 
 
In October 2019, Plaintiff contacted the
Union to procure operators to perform work on the Project and was put in
contact with business representative Pacheco. Pacheco made discriminatory
requests of Plaintiff, asking for documents that were not required for
Plaintiff to perform its work on the Project which delayed Plaintiff’s start
time on the Project. Pacheco required only Plaintiff to obtain a bona fide
special shift letter, intimidated one of Plaintiff’s employees into filing a
baseless grievance, failed to follow grievance resolution procedures and
stopped Plaintiff’s work on the Project. Perry Hawkins (“Hawkins”) was the
district representative and/or treasurer for the Union and Pacheco’s superior
and assisted Pacheco’s violations. Carl Mendenhall (“Mendenhall”) was the treasurer
for the Union and assisted Pacheco’s violations. 
On November 16, 2023, the court related Case
Nos. 22PSCV01040 and 23PSCV00962; Case No. 22PSCV01040 was designated as the
lead case.
On December 21,
2023, Plaintiff filed its Second Amended Verified Complaint (“SAC”), asserting
causes of action against Union, Pacheco, Hawkins, Mendenhall (collectively,
“Defendants”) and Does 1-10 for:
1.                 
Breach of Contract 
2.                 
Unfair Business Practices (Bus. & Prof. C. §17200,
Et Seq.)
3.                 
Fraud/Intentional Misrepresentation
4.                 
Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations
5.                 
Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic
Advantage
6.                 
Conspiracy to Commit Fraud
On April 2, 2024, an
“Order on Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Adjudication” was entered.
The Final Status
Conference is set for September 24, 2024. Trial is set for October 8, 2024.
