Background   
Plaintiff Jose Martin Reyes dba JMR Pool Pro (“Plaintiff”)
alleges as follows:
On January 15, 202, Plaintiff and Barry Anthony Braun dba Trueblue Pool Care (“Braun”) entered into an
agreement wherein Plaintiff agreed to purchase 20 pool service accounts from
Braun for $22,608.00 (“Agreement”). Braun also executed a Non-Competition
Agreement (“Non-Compete Agreement”) wherein he agreed not to compete with
Plaintiff for 5 years from the date of the Agreement. After the agreements were
executed, Braun proposed providing administrative services to manage
Plaintiff’s newly acquired and future pool service accounts. Plaintiff and
Braun entered into an oral agreement, wherein Braun would handle administrative
tasks in exchange for a 15% monthly service fee from the total amount collected
(“Administrative Agreement”). Braun asked Plaintiff to have each of Plaintiff’s
clients endorse a TrueBlue Pool Care Traditional Service Agreement (“Service
Agreement”) under the pretense that they would be used to streamline the
collection of client information to establish profiles and schedule service
appointments. Plaintiff’s business greatly expanded and Plaintiff provided the
Service Agreement to each new client.
The relationship
between Plaintiff and Braun subsequently soured and Plaintiff informed Braun of
his intent to terminate their business relationship; in response, Braun claimed
ownership of all of the pool service accounts Plaintiff had acquired during their
association, minus the original 20 accounts Plaintiff had purchased. Braun
demanded that Plaintiff buy these accounts from him.
On November 12,
2022, Plaintiff contacted Braun’s office to request that Braun inform
Plaintiff’s pool service accounts that Plaintiff would be taking time off
during Thanksgiving week but that he would provide extra treatment to their
pools and spas the week beforehand to maintain the correct levels until his
return. Braun purposely failed to communicate this information and instead sent
correspondence to each of Plaintiff’s clients, unbeknownst to Plaintiff,
advising them that Plaintiff had taken the week off without notice, did not
maintain the required qualifications to perform swimming pool maintenance in
Los Angeles County and that Plaintiff was resigning as their pool servicer.
Braun’s false communications resulted in some of Plaintiff’s clients switching
to Braun for their pool service needs.
On October 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”), asserting causes of action against Braun and Does 1-50 for:
1.                 
Breach of Contract
2.                 
Breach of Oral Contract
3.                 
Breach of Implied Contract
4.                 
Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing
5.

Libel 
On May 1, 2024, the court sustained Braun’s demurrer to the
fifth-ninth causes of action; Plaintiff did not request leave to amend.
On May 13, 2024, Braun filed a cross-complaint, asserting
causes of action against Plaintiff and Roes 1-25 for:
1.                 
Breach of Oral Contract
2.                 
Intentional Interference with Economic Relations
3.                 
Negligent Interference with Prospective Economic
Relations
4.                 
Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations
A Case Management Conference is set for July 31, 2024.
1.         Motion to
Deem Requests for Admission Admitted
Legal Standard
A response to
requests for admission is due 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.250, subd.
(a).) “If a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a 
timely response,
. . .[t]he requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any 
documents and the
truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. . .” (Code 
Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (b).) “The court shall make this order, unless it finds that
the party
to whom the
requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the

motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with 
Section 2033.220.
. .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction . . . on the party or attorney, or
both,
whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the court for an order that the genuineness of any documents and
the truth of any matters specified in Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set
One (“subject discovery”) propounded to Braun be deemed admitted pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure § 2033.280. Plaintiff also seeks sanctions against Braun
and/or his attorneys of record, jointly and severally, in the amount of
$1,475.00.
Plaintiff’s counsel
Edgar Martirosyan (“Martirosyan”) represents as
follows:
On
October 13, 2023, Plaintiff served Braun with the subject discovery. (Martirosyan
Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. D.) Written responses were due on or before November 14, 2023.
(Id., ¶ 3). On November 13, 2023, Braun’s counsel Charles Stec
(“Stec”) requested a 30-day extension, until December 18, 2023, to provide
responses. (Id., ¶ 4, Exh. G.) On December 19, 2023, Stec contacted Martirosyan’s office to discuss
submitting the matter to mediation and requested to continue discovery
deadlines and scheduled depositions. (Id., ¶ 5). At that time, counsel
agreed to stay discovery and pending depositions until after mediation, which
was scheduled to take place on January 17, 2024. (Id., ¶ 5, Exh. H.) On
February 8, 2024, after mediation had concluded, Plaintiff’s counsel Melkon
Torosyan (“Torosyan”) emailed Stec and requested responses by February 23,
2024. (Id., ¶ 6, Exh. I.) Stec, in return, requested an additional
extension, which Martirosyan granted up
to March 1, 2024. (Id., ¶ 7, Exh. I.) On April 8, 2024, the
parties convened for an Informal Discovery Conference, during which time Stec
represented to the court that responses would be served that same day. (Id.,
¶ 8, Exh. J.) To date, Braun has not provided any responses to the outstanding
requests. (Id., ¶ 9). 
Braun, in response, contends that the motion
must be denied as moot, because he served
responses to the subject discovery “within
literal minutes” of Plaintiff serving the motion. (Stec 
Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. A.) Braun, however, fails to
provide the court with a copy of his responses to 
the subject discovery. Plaintiff, in reply,
argues that (1) Braun’s counsel untimely served 
responses to the subject discovery four days
after the IDC and only after the motion was filed 
and that (2) the responses were not verified
and contained objections. (Martirosyan Reply Decl., 
¶¶ 5-6, Exh. M.) Plaintiff represents that
Braun subsequently provided a verification dated April 
8, 2024. (Id., ¶ 7, Exh. N.)
Based on the foregoing representations, it
appears to the court that Braun has served verified
responses to the subject discovery, albeit
with objections. Neither party has attached Braun’s 
responses, however; as such, it is not clear
to the court whether Braun’s provided objection-only 
responses to some or all of the requests. 
Under these circumstances, the court orders
Braun to re-serve his responses to the subject
discovery, without objections and with
a verification, within 5 days from the date of the notice 
of ruling. 
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff seeks sanctions against Braun
and/or his attorneys of record, jointly and severally, in the amount of
$1,475.00 [calculated as follows: 6 hours preparing five motions, plus 3 hours drafting
replies and 2 hours traveling to and/or attending hearing at $375.00 /hour,
plus $300.00 filing fees (for five motions)]. 
 
First, it is unclear to the court why the total attorney’s
fees and costs for all five motions, which amounts to $4,425.00, would not be
divided by 5 (instead of by three, as attested by Martirosyan) to reach a per motion attorney’s fees and cost amount
of $885.00. 
 
Utilizing a Lodestar approach, and in view of the totality
of the circumstances, the court finds that the total and reasonable amount of
attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with
the pending motion is $410.00 (i.e., 1 hour at $350.00/hour, plus $60.00 filing
fee). Sanctions are awarded jointly and severally and are payable within 20
days from the date of the notice of ruling. 
 
2.         Motion to
Compel Re: Form Interrogatories (General)
 
Legal Standard 
 
A response to interrogatories is due
30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. 
(a).) “If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, . . . [t]he 
party propounding the interrogatories
may move for an order compelling response to the 
interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (b).) 
 
“The court
shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or attorney
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
 
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff
moves the court for an order compelling
Braun to provide verified responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories (General), Set One (“subject discovery”). Plaintiff also seeks sanctions
against Braun and/or his attorneys of record, jointly and severally, in the
amount of $1,475.00.
 
See synopsis of Motion #1. 
 
Braun,
in response, contends that the motion must be denied as moot, because he served

responses
to the subject discovery on April 15, 2024. (Stec Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. C.) Braun,
however, 
fails
to provide the court with a copy of his responses to the subject discovery. 
 
Plaintiff,
in reply, argues that (1) Braun’s counsel untimely served responses to the
subject 
discovery
seven days after the IDC and only after the motion was filed and that (2) the
responses 
were
not verified and contained objections. (Martirosyan Reply Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. M.)
Plaintiff 
represents
that Braun subsequently provided a verification dated April 8, 2024. (Id.,
¶ 7, Exh. N.)
 
Based
on the foregoing representations, it appears to the court that Braun has served
verified 
responses
to the subject discovery, albeit with objections. Neither party has attached
Braun’s 
responses,
however; as such, it is not clear to the court whether Braun’s provided
objection-only 
responses
to some or all of the requests. 
 
The
motion, then, is granted. Braun is ordered to re-serve his responses to the
subject discovery, 
without
objections and with a
verification, within 5 days from the date of the notice of ruling. 
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff
seeks sanctions against Braun and/or his attorneys of record, jointly and
severally, in the amount of $1,475.00 [see Motion #1 re: calculation].
 
The court will

calculation]. Sanctions are awarded jointly and severally and are payable
within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling.
