Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the petition filed by Michael Guirguis, a plaintiff who alleges that he twisted his ankle while stepping down from an unmarked elevation at Bonita High School. Guirguis made his application to the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors within one year after the accrual of the cause of action and filed this instant petition within six months after his application was denied. The court determines that Guirguis' failure to present the claim was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The court finds that Guirguis diligently investigated and pursued his claim and establishes the necessary elements justifying relief by a preponderance of the evidence. The petition is granted, and Guirguis is relieved from the requirements of Government Code § 945.4.
