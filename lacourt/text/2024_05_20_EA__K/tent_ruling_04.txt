Code § 911.2, subd. (a).)
“When a claim that
is required by Section 911.2 to be presented not later than six months after
the accrual of the cause of action is not presented within that time, a written
application may be made to the public entity for leave to present that claim.” (Gov.
Code § 911.4, subd. (a).)
“The application
shall be presented to the public entity . . . within a reasonable time not to
exceed one year after the accrual of the cause of action and shall state the
reason for the delay in presenting the claim. The proposed claim shall be
attached to the application.” (Gov. Code § 911.4, subd. (b).)
“If an application
for leave to present a claim is denied or deemed to be denied pursuant to
Section 911.6, a petition may be made to the court for an order relieving the
petitioner from Section 945.4[1]. . .” (Gov. Code § 946.6, subd. (a).) “The petition

under Section 911.4 and was denied or deemed denied. (2) The reason for failure
to present the claim within the time limit specified in Section 911.2. (3) The

“The court shall
relieve the petitioner from the requirements of Section 945.4 if the court
finds that the application to the board under Section 911.4 was made within a
reasonable time not to exceed that specified in subdivision (b) of Section
911.4 and was denied or deemed denied pursuant to Section 911.6 and that
one or more of the following is applicable:
(1)              
The failure to present the claim was through mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect unless the public entity
establishes that it would be prejudiced in the defense of the claim if the
court relieves the petitioner from the requirements of Section 945.4.
(2)              
The person who sustained the alleged injury, damage, or loss
was a minor during all of the time specified in Section 911.2 for the

Discussion

Guirguis moves
the court for an order relieving him from the requirements of Government Code §
945.4.
Guirguis represents as follows:
The subject incident occurred on August
30, 2022. (Guirguis Decl.,
¶ 2). On January 13, 2023, Guirguis contacted superintendent of BUSD
Sonia Eckley’s (“Eckley”) office and left a message for Eckley with Eckley’s
assistant, Christine Froio (“Froio”), requesting an immediate callback with
information on how he could report the incident and submit a claim for damages.
(Id., ¶ 6). On January 18, 2023, Eckley called Guirguis back and advised
Guirguis that his claim was not against BUSD but was instead against Pop
Warner. (Id., ¶ 7). Eckley gave Guirguis the contact information for O2
Insurance, Pop Warner’s insurer, “with the direction” that Guirguis file his
claim with them. (Id.) 
 
On January 18, 2023, Guirguis attempted
to file his claim with O2 Insurance but they initially failed to respond to his
correspondence. (Id., ¶ 8). On January 19, 2023, Guirguis spoke with
Patricia Chez (“Chavez”) an agent of O2 Insurance, who began a series of
correspondence with Guirguis over the following
month. (Id., ¶ 9). On February 22, 2023, O2 Insurance stopped responding
to Guirguis’ correspondence. (Id., ¶ 10). On February 22, 2023, Guirguis
contacted Eckley’s office again and told Froio that O2 had stopped responding
to his correspondence. (Id., ¶ 11). Eckley did not call Guirguis back. (Id.)
On April 7, 2023, Guirguis received a
call from a BUSD agent named Leeza, who informed him that he had missed the
public entity statute of limitations by 7 days. (Id., ¶ 13). On May 19,
2023, Guirguis’ counsel sent a Claims for Damages to Person or Property form
along with a Supplemental Letter Requesting Leave to Present a Late Claim. (Id.,
¶ 14; see also, Nino Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. A). On June 8, 2023, a letter was sent to
Guirguis in care of his counsel on behalf of the Los Angeles[3] Board of
Supervisors, stating that the claim was being returned because it was not
presented in the six months after the incident, that no action was taken on the
claim and that Guirguis’ only
recourse was to apply for lave to present a late claim to the Los Angeles Board
of Supervisors. (Guirguis Decl., ¶ 15; Nino Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. B). On July 17,
2023, Guirguis’ counsel sent a letter entitled “PETITION FOR LEAVE TO PRESENT A
LATER CLAIM” to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. (Guirguis Decl., ¶
16; Nino Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. C). On July 27, 2023, a letter was sent to Guirguis
in care of his counsel on behalf of the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors,
stating that his application for leave to present a late claim was denied as of
July 25, 2023. (Guirguis Decl., ¶ 17; Nino Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. D).
The instant
application was filed on August 29, 2023.
The above
information reflects that Guirguis made his application to the Los
Angeles Board of Supervisors within one year after the accrual of the cause of
action and that Guirguis filed this instant petition within six months after
his application to the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors was denied. Guirguis asserts that he is entitled to relief on the
basis of “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”
In a petition for relief from claims filing requirements, “a
petitioner has the burden of providing by a preponderance of evidence the
necessary elements for relief.” (Rodriguez v. County of Los Angeles
(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 171, 175). “The mere recital of mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
excusable neglect is not sufficient to warrant relief. Relief on grounds of
mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect is available only on a
showing that the claimant's failure to timely present a claim was reasonable
when tested by the objective ‘reasonably prudent person’ standard. The
definition of excusable neglect is defined as ‘neglect that might have been the
act or omission of a reasonably prudent person under the same or similar
circumstances.’” (Department of Water & Power v. Superior Court
(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1288, 1293.) “There must be more than the mere failure to
discover a fact; the party seeking relief must establish the failure to
discover the fact in the exercise of reasonable diligence. The party seeking
relief based on a claim of mistake must establish he was diligent in
investigating and pursuing the claim and must establish the necessary elements
justifying relief by the preponderance of the evidence.” (Id.)
The court determines that Guirguis has
shown that his failure to present the claim was through mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect. The evidence presented above reflects that
Guirguis specifically contacted Eckley’s office on January 13, 2023 (well
within the 6-month deadline) to request information on how he could report the
August 30, 2022 incident and submit a claim for damages, but that he was
misdirected to communicate with Pop Warner’s insurer. BUSD does not contest the
information contained in Guirguis’ declaration whatsoever,
“Once it has been shown that an application for leave to file
a late claim was made within a reasonable time and that the failure to present
a timely claim was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable
neglect, the burden shifts to the public entity to establish by a preponderance
of the evidence that it would be prejudiced if the court relieves the
petitioner from the six-month claim presentation requirements.” (Renteria v.
Juvenile Justice, Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (2006) 135
Cal.App.4th 903, 910.) The court determines that BUSD has not attempted
to make any such showing.
The petition is granted.
