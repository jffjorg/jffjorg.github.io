And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively decided to take off the calendar a motion filed by Gilbert Quiñones, counsel for plaintiff Efrain Medina, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed on August 29, 2023, and alleges a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. However, the notice of hearing was only served on the plaintiff, and the proof of service does not indicate that the declaration and proposed order were served. As a result, the judge is unable to consider the motion and has taken it off the calendar.
