Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's deposition and for sanctions. The plaintiff had scheduled the deposition for February 21, 2024, but the defendant objected, citing the unavailability of both herself and her counsel. Despite this, the plaintiff proceeded with the deposition and obtained a certificate of non-appearance. The defendant later proposed alternative deposition dates, and the plaintiff agreed to take the deposition on April 5, 2024. The judge finds that both parties acted with substantial justification, given the short amount of time between the notice of deposition and the filing of the motion, and the fact that the plaintiff repeatedly requested alternative dates for the deposition. As a result, the judge has denied the motion and ordered the parties to proceed with the deposition on April 5, 2024.
