And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge grants the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants, Magpies Softserve, Warren Schwartz, and Rose Schwartz, against the plaintiff, Mahdad Seyyed Berenji. The plaintiff alleges that he fell from a ladder while trying to reach the top of the walk-in cooler at the defendants' leased premises. The defendants argue that they are not liable for the plaintiff's injuries because they did not retain control over the plaintiff's work and the plaintiff was an independent contractor. The Judge finds that the defendants have met their initial burden of establishing the Privette presumption and that they did not retain control over the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion for summary judgment, and therefore, the Judge grants the motion. The Court also grants the cross-defendant, Peterberg Construction, Inc.'s, motion for summary judgment against the defendants' claim for indemnity because there can be no indemnity without liability.
