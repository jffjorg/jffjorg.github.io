And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add additional allegations to paragraph 22 of the first amended complaint, including details about the presence of unsecured, loaded firearms on the premises. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the proposed additional language constitutes a sham pleading. However, the court finds that the proposed language is not inconsistent with previous pleadings and does not omit facts from the prior pleading. The court notes that the need to defend against a new legal theory that emerges during discovery does not constitute the type of prejudice the court typically considers when granting leave to amend. Therefore, the court grants the motion for leave to file the second amended complaint.
