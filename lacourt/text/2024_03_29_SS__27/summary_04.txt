And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash and for sanctions filed by the plaintiff, Eduardo Antonio Fuentes Medina, against Amazon.com Services LLC. The motion seeks to quash a subpoena for business records from Smithfield Packaged Meats Corporation, which was previously the owner of Farmer John's Slaughterhouse, where the plaintiff was employed.

The judge finds that the plaintiff's motion is not reasonably made under Code of Civil Procedure § 1987.1 for several reasons. Firstly, the parties had previously reached an agreement on the language of the subpoena when it was initially directed at Farmer John's, and the subpoena to Smithfield is the same. Secondly, the plaintiff had already complied with subpoenas for three other employers using the same scope and language. Finally, the purpose of the current subpoena is to obtain the plaintiff's employment records from his tenure at Farmer John's, to which he has already consented.

The judge denies the motion to quash and for sanctions, finding that the subpoena is reasonable and necessary to obtain the plaintiff's employment records. The parties are advised to submit to the tentative ruling by email or appear at the hearing to argue the motion.
