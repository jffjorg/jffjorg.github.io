And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The parties have settled the lemon law action, and the Plaintiff, Agustin and Fidel Juarez, are the prevailing parties entitled to seek fees and costs by motion. The Plaintiff is seeking $49,713.00, which includes $45,213.00 in attorneys' fees and $4,500 for review of the opposition and drafting the reply brief. The Court will deduct $6,905 from the total amount claimed by the Plaintiff due to excessive time spent on discovery matters and the instant fee motion. The Court awards $42,808 in attorneys' fees to the Plaintiff. The Defendant is opposed to the fee amount, but the Court has made deductions as set forth in the ruling.
