[FN1] The
Act was previously codified as Government Code section 6250 et seq. and was
recently recodified and reorganized without substantive change effective
January 1, 2023.
[FN2] The Court is
not in possession of Castro’s mother’s notarized affidavit, nor of Castro’s
November 15, 2021 public records request or the City’s November 16, 2022
denial, which are referenced in the Complaint/Petition as attached as Exhibits
1 through 3, respectively. The Court’s analysis is premised on the assumption
that Castro’s public records request sought “all investigative reports
including supplemental reports, all audio recordings, pictures, and physical
evidence,” as represented.
[FN3] 7923.600,
subdivision (a) provides, in relevant part, as follows: “[T]his division does
not require the disclosure of records of complaints to, or investigations
conducted by, . . . any state or local police agency, . . . for . . . law
enforcement . . . purposes.”
[FN4] Rodriguez
confirms that the investigation has not closed. (Rodriguez Decl., 2:22-23.)
