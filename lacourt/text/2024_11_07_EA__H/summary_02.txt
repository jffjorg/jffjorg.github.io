And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a case between Castro and the City regarding a public records request. Castro requested all investigative reports, including supplemental reports, audio recordings, pictures, and physical evidence. The City denied the request, citing Government Code section 7923.600, which exempts records of complaints and investigations conducted by police agencies for law enforcement purposes. The judge notes that the investigation has not closed and assumes that Castro's request sought all relevant records. The judge's decision is based on the assumption that Castro's request was for all records, but the court is not in possession of the actual request or the City's denial, which are referenced in the Complaint/Petition.
