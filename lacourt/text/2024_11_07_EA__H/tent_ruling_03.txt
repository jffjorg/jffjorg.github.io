I.        Background 
Plaintiffs
Sandra Miranda Pusey, Erika Melissa Pusey, and Cassandra Marie Morales
(together, “Plaintiffs”) allege that after being admitted to Defendant Emanate
Health Foothill Presbyterian (“Defendant”) for treatment for adverse reactions
to a medication, on November 9, 2022, Elwood Thomas Pusey was moved while he
was undergoing dialysis and died the same day. 
On
January 31, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a complaint, asserting a medical malpractice
cause of action against Defendant and Does 1-50. 
Pending
before the Court is Defendant’s motion to compel responses to form
interrogatories. For the reasons stated herein, the motion is granted.
II.      Legal Standard
A response to interrogatories is due 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a).) “If a party to whom interrogatories
are directed fails to serve a timely response, . . . [t]he party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (c).)

III.     Discussion
Defendant moves the Court for an order compelling Plaintiffs
to provide verified responses, without objections, to Defendant’s form and special
interrogatories. Defendant also seeks sanctions in the amount of $1,470.00. 
At the outset, the motion has been partially withdrawn
(i.e., as it pertains to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set No. One),
pursuant to a notice filed by Defendant on October 29, 2024. The following
analysis thus pertains only to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Set No. One. 
Defendant’s counsel Evan R. Garcia (“Garcia”) represents
as follows:
On May 15, 2024, Defendant served
Plaintiffs with the subject discovery. (Garcia Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. A.) Responses
were due on June 14, 2024. (Id., ¶ 2.) On June 11, 2024, Plaintiffs’
counsel requested, and received, a 30-day extension, such that responses were
due on July 17, 2024. (Id., ¶ 3, Exh. B.) On July 18, 2024, Defendant’s counsel
reached out to Plaintiffs’ counsel to ask about the status of the now-overdue
responses and agreed to give Plaintiffs’ counsel another extension to August
16, 2024. (Id., ¶ 4, Exh. C.) No responses were received. (Id., ¶
4.) On September 6, 2024, Defendant’s counsel wrote a letter to Plaintiffs’
counsel in an attempt to obtain the overdue responses, without objections,
extending the deadline to September 16, 2024. (Id., ¶ 5, Exh. D.) On
September 23, 2024, Defendant’s counsel emailed Plaintiffs’ counsel to remind
him that Defendant had not received responses. (Id., ¶ 6, Exh. E.) Defendant’s
counsel received no response; as such, the instant motion was filed. (Id.,
¶ 6.) 
Plaintiffs, in opposition, represent that they “will
serve their responses to form interrogatories prior to the hearing on the
instant motion and will file with the Court a declaration commensurate with the
service of the responses to the form interrogatories.” (Opp., 1:26-28; see
Leech Decl., ¶ 5.) 
There is no indication that Plaintiffs have provided
verified responses to the subject discovery, without objections and/or that Defendant
has withdrawn the motion; as such, the motion is granted. Plaintiffs are ordered
to provide responses, without objections, to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories
Sets No. One, within 30 days from the date of the notice of ruling. 
 
Sanctions 
Defendant seeks sanctions against Plaintiffs in the amount of $1,470.00 [calculated as follows: 2
hours preparing motion, plus 1 hour preparing reply, plus 3 hours traveling
to/attending hearing at $235.00/hour, plus $60.00 filing fee]. 
Utilizing a Lodestar approach, and in view of the totality
of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of
attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with
the pending motion is $412.50 (i.e., 1 hour attorney time at $235.00/hour, plus
0.5 hours appearance time (split with Motion #2), plus $60.00 filing fee).
Sanctions are payable within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling.
