[TENTATIVE] order RE:
motion to set aside entry of default
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations

Plaintiff Nora Bekerian (“Plaintiff”) alleges
that she is the owner of a single-family home located at 10413 Samoa Avenue,
Tujunga, CA 91042.  Plaintiff alleges
that she hired Defendant Mickey Lynn McClinton (“Defendant”) on October 1,
2021, to construct two accessory dwelling units and legalize an already-built
ADU on the property.  Plaintiff alleges
that the total price of the project was $1,200,000.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant demanded
$575,000 to pay for permits and materials and that he represented himself as a
highly experienced contractor.  Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant never disclosed that he was an unlicensed contractor and
failed to provide a written agreement of material terms and disclosures.  Plaintiff alleges that she has paid $575,000
to Defendant, but the project remains incomplete.  In March 2022, Defendant abandoned work on
the project.  Plaintiff alleges that she
has requested the return of the money from Defendant, but to no avail. 
The first amended complaint (“FAC”), filed
December 9, 2022, alleges causes of action for: (1) recovery of unlicensed
practice; (2) violation of Business & Professions Code, § 7160; (3) fraud;
(4) recission; (5) violation of Welfare & Institutions Code, § 15610.30;
and (6) unfair business practices.  
B.    
Relevant
Background and Motion on Calendar
On August 29, 2023, the default of
Defendant was entered.  
On December 8, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed
Does 1-100 only without prejudice. 
On February 26, 2024, Defendant (in pro
per) filed a motion to set aside the entry of default.    
On March 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition brief. 
DISCUSSION

            Defendant
moves to set aside the default entered against him on August 29, 2023 and for
leave to file an answer and cross-complaint. 
A copy of the proposed answer is attached as Exhibit 1 to the
motion.  A copy of the proposed cross-complaint
is attached as Exhibit 2 to the motion.  
            Defendant requests that the Court
deems this motion timely filed.  The
default was entered on August 29, 2023. 
The motion was filed on February 26, 2024.  To be timely pursuant to CCP § 473(b), the
motion must be filed within 6 months of the dismissal, or 182 days.  (See Davis
v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892, 903 [concluding that 6 months is the
equivalent of half a year, or under Gov’t Code § 6803, 182 days for the
purposes of CCP § 473(b)].)  The 182nd
day from August 29, 2023 falls
on February 27, 2024.  Thus, the motion
was timely filed on February 26, 2024.  
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiff did not serve a Statement of Damages pursuant to CCP §
425.115 as Plaintiff is seeking punitive damages; however, Plaintiff filed a
Notice Regarding Punitive Damages on January 11, 2023.  Plaintiff’s counsel states that Defendant was
served with the FAC, the Notice of Punitive Damages, and other documents on
December 14, 2022 and he emailed Defendant the documents on January 11,
2023.  (Kosoyan Decl., ¶6, Exs. 2, 3, and
5.)  The motion will not be granted on
this basis.  
            Defendant also argues that relief
from entry of default is proper based on the mistake of fact in relying on his
paid attorney to answer the complaint on his behalf.  In his declaration, Defendant states that he
contacted attorney Larry Clough to discuss Mr. Clough’s representation of Defendant
in Plaintiff’s action and that Defendant agreed to hire Mr. Clough’s office to
file an answer.  (McClinton Decl.,
¶9.)  He states that though Mr. Clough
did not give him a written retainer agreement, he paid Mr. Clough $5,000 in
late January 2023.  (Id.,
¶10.)  He states that he left Los Angeles
on January 29, 2023, believing Mr. Clough would handle the defense in the
action and states that he did not return to Los Angeles until December 24,
2023.  (Id., ¶11.)  He states that he did not know about the
default until December 2023 around the time a second lawsuit had been filed by
Plaintiff, which he believes is related to this action.  (Id., ¶¶13-14.)  Defendant argues in his motion that though he
received a copy of the lawsuit, he was under a mistaken belief that his
attorney would respond.  (Mot. at
pp.5-6.)  
            In opposition, Plaintiff argues that
Defendant has not shown any proof that he retained Mr. Clough or proof of
payment of the retainer.  Plaintiff
argues that her counsel contacted Mr. Clough on May 9, 2023 when attempting to
serve Defendant, but Mr. Clough stated that he did not represent Defendant.  (Opp., Ex. 1 [Plaintiff’s Motion to Serve by
Publication at Exs. 8-9].) Based on the
emails between Plaintiff’s counsel and Mr. Clough, it appears that Defendant
contacted Mr. Clough to represent him but that Defendant refused to sign an
Acknowledgement of Receipt while he was out of town and had instructed Mr.
Clough not to sign the Acknowledgement without his approval.  (Opp., Ex. 1 at Ex. 8 [Emails].)  In another email, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed
Mr. Clough to confirm their conversation that Mr. Clough does not represent
Defendant.  (Opp. at Ex. 1 at Ex. 9
[Email].)
            Based
on the papers and declarations before the Court, the Court has significant
questions about Defendant’s credibility. Clearly he was on notice about this
litigation.  Although he took some steps
to contact an attorney, he admits that he did not obtain a retainer agreement
from his proposed counsel.  Further, the
communications between Mr. Clough and Plaintiff’s counsel show that Mr. Clough
was not authorized (by the express direction of Defendant) to perform actions
on Defendant’s behalf. It is not believable that Defendant would be out of town
for nearly a year while ignoring this significant matter.  Defendant has not provided a declaration from
Mr. Clough to support a showing that he had retained Mr. Clough to represent
him in this action; he did not file such a declaration with his moving papers
and he did not file a reply brief.  Defendant
has also not provided any documentary evidence of a retainer being paid. 
            Here,
Defendant has not upheld his burden in showing that the default was entered
against him pursuant to CCP § 473(b) or (d).  

CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
            Defendant Mickey Lynn McClinton’s
motion to vacate the default is denied. 
            Defendant shall provide notice of
this order.
