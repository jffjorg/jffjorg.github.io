And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge John J. Kralik regarding a motion to set aside a judgment dismissing an action with prejudice. The plaintiff, Craig R. Hargreaves, filed a complaint alleging breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and conversion against West Coast Customs, Inc. The defendant defaulted, and the court dismissed the complaint with prejudice in August 2023. The plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the dismissal in March 2024, claiming that the case had not been settled as previously thought. However, the court found that the motion was filed one month too late, as it was filed on March 8, 2024, when it should have been filed by February 8, 2024. Therefore, the motion was denied.
