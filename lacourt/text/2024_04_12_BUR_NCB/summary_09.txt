And here is the English-text summary:

The Tentative Ruling is regarding a motion for judicial determination of good faith settlement between Lainer Development, Inc. and S & S Investments General Partnership, and Plaintiff Patrick Chua. The motion was filed due to a settlement agreement between the parties for $5,000. The Court will evaluate the settlement under the factors set forth in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Assoc. The factors include the amount paid in settlement and allocation of settlement proceeds, rough approximation of plaintiff's total recovery and settlor's proportionate liability, and other relevant considerations such as financial condition and insurance policy limits of the settling defendants. The Court will also consider whether the settlement is in good faith and whether it is reasonable in light of the defendant's potential liability. The Court orders the production of the settlement agreement and supplemental briefing regarding the amount of plaintiff's claimed damages.
