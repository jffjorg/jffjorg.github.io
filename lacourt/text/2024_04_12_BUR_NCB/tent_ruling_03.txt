motions for relief from default and
  default judgment
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations

Plaintiff Moorpark Investors, LLC
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that on November 1, 2019, Plaintiff and Defendants Dena
Waldon and Joe Ann Waldon entered into a written lease agreement whereby Defendants
agreed to lease the premises located at 12246 Moorpark Street, Apt. 106Tin
Studio City from Plaintiff.  The lease
term was for 9 months, such that the lease expired on July 31, 2020.  Per the latest rent increase, the current
rent is alleged to be $3,529 per month, effective April 1, 2022.  
Plaintiff alleges that on September 7,
2021, Plaintiff served Defendants with a 15-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit with
Blank Declaration of COVID-19 Related Financial Distress for rent due September
1, 2020 to September 30, 2021.  Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants owed $42,250 in rent from September 2020 to September
2021.  (Compl., ¶17.)  Plaintiff alleges that on October 6, 2021, it
served Defendant with a 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit for rent due from
October 1, 2021 to October 3, 2022, such that Defendant owed $3,250 for rent in
October 2021.  Plaintiff alleges that
Plaintiff and Defendants submitted an application to the CA COVID-19 Rent
Relief Program for rental assistance owed from September 1, 2020 to September
30, 2021 and October 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021 in the amounts of $42,250 and
$3,250 respectively.  Plaintiff alleges
that: (a) check number 57437685 was processed for $42,250 from the program on
October 14, 2021 and issued to Dena Walden, which was cashed by Defendants on
October 21, 2021; and (b) check number 57543742 was processed for $3,250 from
the program on October 18, 2021 and issued to Dena Walden, which was cashed by
Defendants on November 19, 2021.  Plaintiff alleges that it made repeated
demands for the $45,500 in COVID-19 rental debt, but Defendants have converted
the funds for their own use.
The complaint, filed December 20, 2022, alleges
causes of action for: (1) receipt of stolen property; (2) conversion; (3)
constructive trust; (4) money had and received; (5) unjust enrichment; (6)
declaratory relief; (7) breach of contract; and (8) fraud.   
B.    
Relevant
Background and Motion on Calendar
On February 1, 2023, the default of Dena Waldon
was entered.    
On August 2, 2023, the default of Joe Ann
Waldon was entered.  
On November 27, 2023, the default judgment
of Defendants was entered in the amount of $108,991.04.  
On February 27, 2024, Dena Waldon (in pro
per) filed a motion for relief from default. 
On March 19, 2024, Joe Ann Waldon (in pro
per) filed a motion to vacate striking the answer, default, and default
judgment.  
On March 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition to Joe Ann Waldon’s motion only. 
On April 5, 2024, Joe Ann Waldon filed a reply
brief.  That same day, Defendants filed a
single request for judicial notice. 
DISCUSSION
RE DENA WALDON’S MOTION
A.    Request for
Judicial Notice
Dena Waldon requests judicial notice of documents filed in the case Moorpark
Investors, LLC v. Waldon (Pasadena Case No. 22PDUD01204), including the
unlawful detainer complaint, the Judgement – Unlawful Detainer, the October 25,
2022 Minute Order and Notice of Entry of Judgment, and Ex Parte Application for
Stay.  The request is granted.  (Evid. Code, § 453(d).)  
With the reply brief, Defendants request judicial notice the October 25,
2022 Minute Order for the Non-Jury Trial in the unlawful detainer case.  The request is granted. 
The October 25, 2022 minute order issued by the
Honorable William D. Dodson in the unlawful detainer case states in relevant
part: 
Defendants
to move out by 12/18/22. No money owed.
Stipulated
judgment entered for Plaintiff Moorpark Investors, LLC against Defendant Dena
Waldon and Defendant Joe Ann Waldon on the Complaint filed by Moorpark
Investors, LLC on 06/20/2022 for a total of $0.00. 
(10/25/22 Minute Order.) 
B.     Merits of Motion 
Dena Waldon
moves to vacate the default based on extrinsic fraud.  
“A
judgment against a party may be set aside in equity when it is obtained by
extrinsic fraud or mistake.”  (Parage v. Couedel (1997)
60 Cal.App.4th 1037, 1044.)  “Extrinsic fraud usually arises when a party is denied
a fair adversary hearing because he has been ‘deliberately kept in ignorance of
the action or proceeding, or in some other way fraudulently prevented from
presenting his claim or defense.”  (Bae v. T.D. Service Co. of Arizona (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 89, 97.)  In other words, “[e]xtrinsic fraud only arises when
one party has in some way fraudulently been prevented from presenting his or
her claim or defense.”  (Sporn
v. Home Depot USA, Inc. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1294, 1300.)  
Dena Waldon
argues that Plaintiff filed the first action in Pasadena, which the parties
settled so that Plaintiff would be entitled to possession as of December 18,
2022 in exchange for Plaintiff waiving all back rent and damages.  Dena Waldon argues that this agreement was
fraudulently induced because Plaintiff did not intend to waive its claims, but
instead split its causes of action to file an action for the monetary
damages.  (D. Waldon Decl., at p.5.)  Dena Waldon argues that Defendants vacated
the premises and removed their possessions before December 28, 2022, which was
before the time that Plaintiff’s process server in this action claimed to have
personally served Dena Waldon at the premises. 
(Id., at p.6.)  
According to the
proof of service filed on January 5, 2023, Dena Waldon was personally served on
December 28, 2022 at 5:25 p.m. at the apartment unit.  Service was effectuated by Victor Curiel, a
registered California process server.  
At most, Dena
Waldon provides her declaration stating that she vacated the premises before
December 28, 2022.  However, she provides
no documentary evidence that she was not at the property or that the
description of the person served (female, age 40, height 5’8”, weight 190,
race: African America, black hair, and brown eyes) did not describe her.  She states that she was staying at different
motels and couch-surfing at homes of friends and relatives, but does not
specify any dates.  The Court will order Dena
Waldon to provide a supplemental declaration to describe whether she was
properly served with the summons and complaint and whether the lack of notice
of the time to defend the action was not caused by her avoidance of service or
inexcusable neglect. 
Next, Dena
Waldon argues that the parties entered into a settlement agreement whereby
Plaintiff represented it would be waiving all back rent and damages.  A copy of the settlement terms (if one
exists) is not provided such that the Court cannot verify whether this was in
fact the case and to determine if Plaintiff engaged in fraudulent activity.  However, a copy of the October 25, 2022 minute
order is provided showing that Defendants agreed to move out by December 18,
2022 and that no money was owed.  There
may be a valid argument by Dena Waldon that she believed that no rent was due
and owing based on the terms of the oral stipulated judgment that was recorded
by Department R of the Pasadena Courthouse. 

The Court notes
that this motion is not opposed by Plaintiff, though Plaintiff has opposed the
motion filed by Joe Ann Waldon.  As the
motion is continued, the parties may file responsive briefs.  
DISCUSSION RE JOE
ANN WALDON’S MOTION
            Defendant Joe Ann Waldon moves to
vacate the order striking the answer, default, and default judgment, pursuant
to CCP § 657(1).  
The Court notes that CCP § 657(1) is regarding vacating a verdict and to
seek a new trial due to irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, or
adverse party, or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by which either
party was prevented from having a fair trial. 

As an initial matter, CCP § 657(1) is not the correct code section for Joe
Ann Waldon to seek relief.  Section 657
is employed following the conclusion of a trial.  Here, no trial has been conducted.  As Joe Ann Waldon has not sought relief based
on a proper legal ground, the motion is denied on this basis.  
If considering the merits, Joe Ann Waldon argues that she paid her filing
fees but the Court was misinformed that she had not paid the fees.  Joe Ann Waldon argues that the Court improperly
struck her answer based on this misinformation, resulting in her default and
the default judgment.  Joe Ann Waldon
provides a receipt dated March 15, 2023 showing that Dena Waldon paid $435 for
case no. 22BBCV01265 for “unlimited Civil – Ans non-Plaintiff incl. UD.”  (Mot., Exhibit.)  However, the receipt shows that Dena
Waldon paid her own fees.  There is
no showing that Joe Ann Waldon paid her fees or that they were paid on
her behalf.  
In addition, as pointed out by Plaintiff in opposition, the Court held a
Case Management Conference on May 11, 2023 and noted that Dena Waldon filed an
answer after defaulting and that Joe Ann Waldon filed her answer without paying
the required filing fee.  (Opp., Ex.
D.)  The Court continued the CMC to July
27, 2023 and set an OSC re: Striking the Answers of both Defendants.  (Id.) 
On May 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed with the Court and served on Defendants
the Notice of Ruling at CMC.  (Id.,
Ex. E.)  On July 27, 2023, the Court held
the CMC and OSC and struck the answers filed by Defendants for their failure to
appear.  (Id., Ex. F.)  Thus, Defendants had notice of and the
opportunity to attend the CMC and OSC hearing, but they failed to do so.  Further, though there was ground to strike Joe
Ann Waldon’s answer for failure to pay fees, the Court deferred the striking of
the answer to allow time for Joe Ann Waldon to attend the CMC and OSC, but she
failed to appear.  Thus, the striking of
the answer was proper.  
The Court notes that this was the only ground upon which Joe Ann Waldon
has moved for relief in the motion papers. 
The motion to vacate the order striking the answer and for relief from
the default and default judgment is denied on this ground.
However, Joe Ann Waldon argued for the first time in the reply brief that
the default was entered as a result of extrinsic fraud, as similarly argued by
Dena Waldon.  As this was raised for the
first time in the reply brief, this is an improper argument that the Court may
decline to consider.  Nevertheless, the
Court will continue the hearing on the motion and allow Plaintiff to file a
supplemental opposition to Joe Ann Waldon’s reply brief and Joe Ann Waldon may
file a supplemental reply brief.  
CONCLUSION

            Defendant Dena Waldon’s motion for relief from default and default judgment
is continued to May 17, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.

to file a supplemental brief/declaration detailing her whereabouts on December
