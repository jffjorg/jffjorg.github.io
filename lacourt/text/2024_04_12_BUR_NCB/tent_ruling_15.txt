B.    
Relevant
Background and Application for Writ of Attachment  
On January 4, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the application for writ of possession against Defendants Weber
Enterprise and Mr. Weber.  
On March 13, 2024,
Plaintiff filed proofs of substituted service of the summons, complaint, and
application documents on Defendants Weber Enterprise and Mr. Weber showing that
they were each served on January 25, 2024. 

The Court is not in receipt of an
opposition brief.
The matter initially came for hearing on
March 29, 2024.  The Court continued the
hearing to April 12, 2024 in order to provide Plaintiff time to file a
supplemental declaration by the end of the business day on April 5, 2024
regarding the estimated valuation of the subject trailers.  
On April 5, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed without
prejudice Does 1-20 only and the 4th and 5th causes of
action. 
On April 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
declaration pursuant to CCP § 585 in support of default judgment.  
LEGAL
STANDARD
CCP §
512.010 requires that the application for writ of possession be executed under
oath and include affidavits showing the following: 
(1)  
A
showing of the basis of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is
entitled to possession of the property claimed. If the basis of the plaintiff's
claim is a written instrument, a copy of the instrument shall be attached.
(2)  
A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, of the
manner in which the defendant came into possession of the property, and,
according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of
the reason for the detention.
(3)  
A
particular description of the property and a statement of its value.
(4)  
A statement, according to the best
knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of the location of the
property and, if the property, or some part of it, is within a private place
which may have to be entered to take possession, a showing that there is
probable cause to believe that such property is located there.
(5)  
A statement that the property has not
been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine, pursuant to a statute; or seized
under an execution against the property of the plaintiff; or, if so seized,
that it is by statute exempt from such seizure.
(CCP § 512.010(b).) 
CCP §
512.060 permits the Court to issue a writ of possession when the Court finds
the following:
(1)  
The
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the plaintiff's claim to
possession of the property.
(2)  
The
undertaking requirements of CCP § 515.010 are satisfied.
(CCP
§ 512.060.)
DISCUSSION

A.    Probable
Validity of Plaintiff’s Claims
Plaintiff filed an
application for writ of possession against Defendants Weber Enterprise and Mr.
Weber.  The claimed property includes:
(1) 1 Trailer – ACE – ABD111 – 2023 VIN#1A9ASD114PF896053; and (2) 1 Trailer –
ACE – ABD111 – 2023 VIN#1A9AFD12XPF896054. 
(App., § 4.)  
“The standard elements of a claim for
breach of contract are: “(1) the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or
excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) damage to plaintiff
therefrom. [Citation.]”  (Wall
Street Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171,
1178.)  
In support of the application, Plaintiff
provides the declaration of Traci Serreyn, who is employed by Plaintiff as a
Litigation and Recovery Specialist.  (Serreyn
Decl., ¶1.)  Ms. Serreyn states that she
is the custodian of records.  (Id.)  Ms. Serreyn states that on September 2, 2022,
Weber Enterprise entered into a written Master Equipment Finance Agreement No.
MA-05402 (“Agreement”) with Plaintiff pursuant to which Plaintiff agreed to
finance Weber Enterprise’s purchase of the two trailers.  (Id., ¶2.)  As consideration, Weber Enterprise obligated
itself to make certain specified monthly payments to Plaintiff.  (Id., ¶3.)  Plaintiff is the holder of the Agreement and
performed its obligations.  (Id.,
¶4.)  Weber Enterprise defaulted on the
Agreement by failing to may payments due on April 5, 2023 and thereafter.  (Id., ¶5.)  As a result of Weber Enterprise’s default,
Plaintiff terminated the Agreement, thus terminating Weber Enterprise’s right
to possession of the trailers.  (Id.,
¶6, Ex. 1 [Demand Letters to Weber Enterprise and Mr. Weber], Ex. 2
[Certificate of Title].)  Ms. Serreyn
states that despite Plaintiff’s repeated demands, Weber Enterprise has failed
and refused to release the trailers to Plaintiff.  (Id., ¶8.)  
Ms. Serreyn’s declaration
provides evidence to establish the probable validity of Plaintiff’s claim to
possession of the subject trailers against Defendants because it shows that
Plaintiff has the right to take immediate possession of the subject vehicle as
a result of Defendants’ default on the Agreement and Guaranty. 
B.    
Location of Vehicle 
Under CCP §
512.010(b)(4), the plaintiff must provide evidence of the location of the
property.  Further, if the property is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, section
(b)(4) requires there to be a showing that there is probable cause to believe that
the property is located there.             
Ms. Serreyn states
that Plaintiff is informed and believes that the subject trailers are located
at 429 N. Lincoln Street, Burbank, CA 91506, which is based on the address
provided on Weber Enterprise’s home page. 
(Serreyn Decl., ¶8, Ex. 3.)  
These facts are
sufficient to identify the location of the vehicle at Defendants’ address.  
C.     Undertaking 
Finally,
CCP § 512.060 requires that an undertaking be filed before a writ of possession
may be issued.  CCP § 515.010(a) states
that the undertaking shall be set at an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property. 
In addition, CCP § 515.010(a) defines the value of the defendant's
interest in the property as the market value of the property less the amount
due and owing on any conditional sales contract or security agreement and all
liens and encumbrances on the property, and any other factors necessary to
determine the defendant's interest in the property.  When a defendant does not have any interest
in the property, CCP § 515.010(b) permits the Court to waive the requirement of
the plaintiff's undertaking and set an undertaking for the defendant to keep
possession or regain possession.  
            If
the defendant seeks to retain possession of the property, CCP § 515.020 permits
the defendant to file an undertaking and retain the property in an amount equal
to the amount of the plaintiff’s undertaking determined in CCP § 515.010(a), or
in an amount determined by the Court pursuant to CCP § 515.010(b).  
            In
her initial declaration, Ms. Serreyn estimates the total value of the subject
trailers to be $119,000, but states that the most current information regarding
the vehicles are within the possession and knowledge of Defendants.  (Serreyn Decl., ¶9.)  
            On
April 8, 2024, Ms. Serreyn provided a declaration pursuant to CCP § 585 in
support of a default judgment.  The
declaration includes the Desktop Appraisal Report by Shane Weber.  (Serreyn 4/8/24 Decl., at Ex. D
[Appraisal].)  Based on the appraiser’s
conclusion, the fair market values of the vehicles are: (1) $26,000 for the
2023 ACE BD111 Steel Bottom Dump Semi Trailer; and (2) $39,000 for the 2023 ACE
ABD111 Steel Bottom Dump Pull Trailer. 
(Appraisal at p.12.)  According to
the declaration, the accelerated balance of the agreement due is
$106,371.85.  (Serreyn 8/24/24 Decl.,
¶11.)  This indicates that, for the
purposes of CCP § 515.010, Defendants have no interest in the vehicle.  Accordingly, the Court waives the requirement
for Plaintiff to file an undertaking because Defendants have no interest in the
vehicle. 
            As
the application is not opposed, it does not appear that Defendants seek to
retain possession of the vehicle and they are currently in default. 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Plaintiff’s application for a writ of
possession against Defendants is granted. 
The Court issues the requested writ of possession to obtain the (1) 1
Trailer – ACE – ABD111 – 2023 VIN#1A9ASD114PF896053; and (2) 1 Trailer – ACE –
ABD111 – 2023 VIN#1A9AFD12XPF896054 vehicles at Defendants Shane Weber,
individual and dba Weber Enterprise’s address at 429 N. Lincoln Street,
Burbank, CA 91506.  
Plaintiff shall
provide notice of this order.
