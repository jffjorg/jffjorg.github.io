  order RE:
motion to vacate dismissal under ccp § 664.6 and enter judgment

BACKGROUND

A.    Allegations

Plaintiff
Forwardline Financial, LLC (“Plaintiff”) alleges that it entered into a written
contract on March 16, 2022 with Defendants Torqqe Performance, LLC (“Torqqe”)
and Earl Smith (“Smith”).  Plaintiff
alleges that Torqqe breached the agreement on November 2, 2022 by failing to
remit further payment to Plaintiff under the loan and that Smith breached the
agreement by failing to cure the breach of his personal guaranty.  Plaintiff alleges that it has suffered
$39,947.26 in damages.  
The complaint,
filed May 3, 2023, alleges causes of action for: (1) common counts; (2) common
counts; (3) common counts; (4) breach of contract; and (5) breach of contract.
B.     Relevant
Background and Motion on Calendar 
On
June 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed proofs of service showing that Defendants were
each personally served with the summons and complaint on May 16, 2023.  
On June 16,
2023, Torqqe filed an answer to the complaint. 

On June 29,
2023, the default of Earl Smith was entered. 

On September 21,
2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement of Entire Case. 
On September 27,
2023, the Court noted at the Case Management Conference that a notice of
settlement had been filed.  The Court set
an OSC re: Dismissal (Settlement) for September 25, 2024.  The case is still active and has not yet been
dismissed. 
On December 15,
2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the dismissal under CCP § 664.6 and
enter judgment pursuant to stipulation. 
The Court is not in receipt of an opposition brief. 
The matter
initially came for hearing on March 15, 2024. 
The Court continued the hearing on the motion to April 5, 2024, ordering
Plaintiff to serve the motion papers on Earl Smith.  The Court also expressed that it could not
enter a stipulated judgment against Earl Smith until his first appearance have
been paid.  
On March 22,
2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing that the motion papers had
been served on Earl Smith by mail.  
The matter came
for hearing on April 5, 2024.  The Court
informed Plaintiff’s counsel that first appearance fees for Earl Smith had not
yet been paid and Plaintiff’s counsel requested another continuance.  The Court continued the hearing to April 12,
2024 and stated that if first appearance fees were not paid by April 11, 2024,
the motion would be denied.  
Based on the Court’s
records, it appears that Earl Smith’s first appearance fees have now been
paid.  
DISCUSSION

            Plaintiff moves for an order
vacating the dismissal and entering judgment pursuant to the stipulation,
relying on CCP § 664.6.  
            The
Court notes that the action has not been dismissed.  The action is still active.  The OSC re: Dismissal (Settlement) is set for
September 25, 2024.  Thus, Plaintiff’s
request to vacate the dismissal is moot as the case as no dismissal has been
entered in this action. 
            The
Stipulation of Entry of Judgment and Installment Payments and Dismissal of
Action with Consent to Court Retaining Jurisdiction Pursuant to CCP § 664.6
(“Stipulation”) is attached as Exhibit 1 to the motion.  The Stipulation provides that $2,000 shall be
paid on or before the 1st of each and every consecutive month
commencing on or before August 1, 2023 through and including March 1, 2025
until the total sum of $40,000 is paid in full. 
(Stipulation, ¶2(A).)  Upon
payment of the $40,000 amount, Plaintiff will dismiss the action with
prejudice.  (Id., ¶3.)  If Defendants default and fail to cure the
default, they will be in breach of the Stipulation and Plaintiff may seek
judgment of the $40,000 settlement amount, less any payments paid, plus
interest, costs, and attorney’s fees.  (Id.,
¶¶3, 7-9.)  The Stipulation is signed by
Plaintiff’s authorized agent, Smith (as an individual), and Smith (as
authorized agent for Torqqe).  (Id.
at p.7.)  
            Plaintiff’s
counsel, Jon O. Blanda, states that Defendants have made payments totaling
$4,000 in August and September of 2023, but failed to make payments
thereafter.  (Blanda Decl., ¶4.)  Mr. Blanda states that Plaintiff has emailed
defense counsel but Defendants have failed to cure the default.  (Id., ¶5.)  Plaintiff seeks $36,000 (balance), plus
interest at 10% from the date of the default beginning October 1, 2023.  (Id., ¶¶6-7.)  
Based on the terms of the Stipulation and Defendants’
default by failure to make further payments pursuant to the payment schedule,
the Court finds there is substantive merit to granting the motion to enforce
the Stipulation.  Thus, the motion to enter
judgment pursuant to the Stipulation is granted. 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
Plaintiff
Forwardline Financial, LLC’s motion to vacate the dismissal under CCP § 664.6
and enter judgment pursuant to stipulation is granted in part and denied in
part.  The motion is denied in part as to
the request to vacate the dismissal as the action has not yet been
dismissed.  The motion is granted in part
as to the request to enter judgment pursuant to stipulation against Defendants Torqqe
Performance, LLC and Earl Smith.  
Plaintiff shall give notice of
this order.
