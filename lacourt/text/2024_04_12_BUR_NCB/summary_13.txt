The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most qualified (PMQ) regarding categories 1-4 and 6-7, and to produce documents. The parties are ordered to meet and confer to determine a mutually agreeable date for the deposition. Additionally, the parties are required to meet and confer about entering into a protective order to maintain the confidentiality of the defendant's documents that contain trade secret and proprietary information. The judge has declined to award sanctions at this time, but reserves the right to impose sanctions if further discovery issues arise.
