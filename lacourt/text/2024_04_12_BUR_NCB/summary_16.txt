Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Judge grants Defendant Tesla, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration. The Court finds that the arbitration agreement is not procedurally unconscionable because it allows Plaintiff 30 days to opt out and does not require Plaintiff to sign the agreement under duress. The Court also finds that the arbitration agreement is not substantively unconscionable because it does not preclude the selection of a neutral arbitrator and does not impose prohibitive costs on Plaintiff. The Court grants the motion to compel arbitration and stays the action pending the outcome of the arbitration. The Court sets a status conference for September 4, 2024, to monitor the progress of the arbitration.
