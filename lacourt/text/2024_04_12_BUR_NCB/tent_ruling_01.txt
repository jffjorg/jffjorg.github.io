[TENTATIVE] order RE:
motion to set aside judgment dismissing
  action with prejudice
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations

Plaintiff Craig R. Hargreaves
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that he is the owner of a 1975 Ford F250 Pickup
Truck.  Plaintiff alleges that in January
2020, he approached Defendant West Coast Customs, Inc. (“WCC”) to perform
certain customizations to the truck, including a custom paint job,
reupholstering, swapping the axels, and much more.  He alleges that on May 12, 2020, the truck
was shipped to WCC for a quote.  On June
10, 2020, Plaintiff was provided a quote for the cost of $187,218.11 and was
told it would take no more than 1 year to complete, upon Plaintiff’s approval
for the work to begin and the payment of a $100,000 deposit (the remaining
$87,218.11 to be paid at the completion of the contract).  In June 2020, Plaintiff provided a check to
WCC for $100,000, which was cashed on June 19, 2020.  Plaintiff alleges that he anticipated the
vehicle to be finished around June 2021, but over the course of the year,
Plaintiff only received 1 photograph of progress.  He alleges that he went to WCC’s store in
April/early May 2021, and saw that no meaningful work had been completed on the
truck.  Plaintiff alleges that no
progress reports or photographs were received after his meeting and it has been
18 months since the initial contract was entered.  
The complaint, filed January 21, 2022, alleges
causes of action for: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of covenant of good
faith and fair dealing; and (3) conversion. 
B.    
Relevant
Background and Motion on Calendar
On March 22, 2022, the default of West
Coast Customs, Inc. was entered.  
On August 10, 2023, the Court held an
Order to Show Cause: Dismissal (Settlement). 
The Court noted that on May 3, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel represented
that the case had settled.  The Court
thereby dismissed the complaint with prejudice. 

On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion
to set aside the judgment dismissing the action with prejudice.  
The Court is not in receipt of an
opposition brief. 
DISCUSSION

            Plaintiff
moves to set aside the dismissal of the action pursuant to the discretionary
prong of CCP § 473(b). Plaintiff’s counsel Keith M. Gregory states that after
settlement discussions with defense counsel, he and Plaintiff were confident
that the case would get settled, such that Plaintiff chose not to appear at the
OSC re dismissal scheduled for August 10, 2023, but this decision was a
mistake.  (Gregory Decl., ¶7.)  
            The dismissal was entered on August
10, 2023.  The motion was filed on March
8, 2024.  To be timely pursuant to CCP §
473(b), the motion must be filed within 6 months of the dismissal, or 182
days.  (See Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892, 903 [concluding that 6
months is the equivalent of half a year, or under Gov’t Code § 6803, 182 days
for the purposes of CCP § 473(b)].)  The
182nd day from August 10, 2023 falls on February 8, 2024.  Thus, the motion was not timely filed and was
filed a month too late.  As the motion
was not timely filed, the motion to vacate the dismissal pursuant to CCP §
473(b) is denied.  
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
            Plaintiff Craig R. Hargreaves’
motion to set aside the dismissal is denied. 

            Plaintiff
shall provide notice of this order.
