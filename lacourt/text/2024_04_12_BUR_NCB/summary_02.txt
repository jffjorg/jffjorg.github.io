And here is the English-text summary:

**Tentative Ruling**

The Court has reviewed the motion to set aside the default entered against Defendant Mickey Lynn McClinton. The Court has significant questions about Defendant's credibility and his alleged retention of attorney Larry Clough. Although Defendant claims to have hired Mr. Clough to handle his defense, he failed to provide a written retainer agreement and did not file a declaration from Mr. Clough to support his claims. The Court concludes that Defendant has not upheld his burden in showing that the default was entered against him pursuant to CCP § 473(b) or (d). As a result, the Court denies Defendant's motion to vacate the default.

**Order**

Defendant Mickey Lynn McClinton's motion to vacate the default is denied. Defendant shall provide notice of this order.
