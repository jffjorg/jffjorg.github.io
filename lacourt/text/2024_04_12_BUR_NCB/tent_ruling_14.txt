APPLICATION for writ of possession
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations

Plaintiff Financial Services Vehicle
Trust, by and through its servicer, BMW Financial Services NA, LLC
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that on March 17, 2022, Defendant Hrach Panosian
(“Defendant”) entered the Motor Vehicle Lease Agreement with dealer Crevier BMW
for the use of a 2022 BMW M8 CNV motor vehicle. 
Defendant agreed to make 36 monthly base payments of $2,245.75 each,
plus applicable taxes, commencing March 17, 2022 and thereafter on the 17th
day of each consecutive month until the maturity date of March 17, 2025.  Plaintiff alleges that on February 17, 2023,
Defendant defaulted on the terms of the agreement by failing to make payment
when due. 
The complaint, filed November 21, 2023, alleges
causes of action for: (1) breach of contract; (2) common count; (3) claim and
delivery; and (4) conversion. 
B.    
Application
for Writ of Possession
On December 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
application for writ of possession against Defendant.  
The Court is not in receipt of an
opposition brief. 
The Court notes that Defendant was served with
the summons, complaint, and the application papers by personal service on January
10, 2024 at 1021 Raymond Ave., Apt. B, Glendale, CA 91201.  
LEGAL STANDARD
CCP §
512.010 requires that the application for writ of possession be executed under
oath and include affidavits showing the following: 
(1)  
A
showing of the basis of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is
entitled to possession of the property claimed. If the basis of the plaintiff's
claim is a written instrument, a copy of the instrument shall be attached.
(2)  
A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, of the
manner in which the defendant came into possession of the property, and,
according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of
the reason for the detention.
(3)  
A
particular description of the property and a statement of its value.
(4)  
A statement, according to the best
knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of the location of the
property and, if the property, or some part of it, is within a private place
which may have to be entered to take possession, a showing that there is
probable cause to believe that such property is located there.
(5)  
A statement that the property has not
been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine, pursuant to a statute; or seized
under an execution against the property of the plaintiff; or, if so seized,
that it is by statute exempt from such seizure.
(CCP
§ 512.010(b).) 
CCP §
512.060 permits the Court to issue a writ of possession when the Court finds
the following:
(1)  
The
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the plaintiff's claim to
possession of the property.
(2)  
The
undertaking requirements of CCP §515.010 are satisfied.
(CCP
§ 512.060.)
DISCUSSION

A.    Probable Validity of Plaintiff’s Claim 
Plaintiff provides the declaration of Sarah Phillips
in support of its application for writ of possession of the vehicle.  Ms. Phillips states that she is employed by BMW
Financial Services NA, LLC as a Collections Legal and Replevin Analyst and is
the custodian of records for the subject account.  (Phillips Decl., ¶¶1-7.) 
Ms. Phillips states that Plaintiff and Crevier BMW
entered into the March 17, 2022 Motor Vehicle Lease Agreement for the subject
vehicle.  (Id., ¶8, Ex. 1.)  She states that Plaintiff received an assignment
of the agreement from the dealer and that Plaintiff’s legal ownership interest
in the vehicle was perfected with the California DMV.  (Id., ¶11, Ex. 2.)  She states that on February 17, 2023,
Defendant defaulted pursuant to the terms of the agreement by failing to make
the payment due.  (Id., ¶12.)  Ms. Phillips states that Plaintiff demanded payment
from Defendant, but Defendant failed and refused to pay.  (Id., ¶13.)  She states that $132,744.88 is currently due
and owing from Defendant.  (Id.,
Ex. 3.)  Pursuant to the agreement at
paragraph 23(ii), upon default, Plaintiff is entitled to take possession of the
vehicle.  (Id., ¶14.)  
Ms. Phillips’ declaration provides evidence to
establish the probable validity of Plaintiff’s claim to possession of the vehicle
with regard to Defendant because it shows that Plaintiff has the right to take
immediate possession of the vehicle since Defendant is in default of the contract.  
B.     Location of Vehicle 
Under CCP § 512.010(b)(4),
the plaintiff must provide evidence of the location of the property.  Further, if the property is within a private
place which may have to be entered to take possession, section (b)(4) requires
there to be a showing that there is probable cause to believe that the property
is located there.             
Ms. Phillips states
that the vehicle is in the control and possession of Defendant.  She believes that the vehicle is located at Defendant’s
primary residence at 9705 Via Roma, Burbank, CA 91504, based on Plaintiff’s
records.  (Phillips Decl., ¶¶15,
18.)  
These facts are
sufficient to identify the location of the vehicle at Defendant’s residence. 
C.     Undertaking

Finally,
CCP § 512.060 requires that an undertaking be filed before a writ of possession
may be issued.  CCP § 515.010(a) states
that the undertaking shall be set at an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property. 
In addition, CCP § 515.010(a) defines the value of the defendant's
interest in the property as the market value of the property less the amount
due and owing on any conditional sales contract or security agreement and all
liens and encumbrances on the property, and any other factors necessary to
determine the defendant's interest in the property.  When a defendant does not have any interest
in the property, CCP § 515.010(b) permits the Court to waive the requirement of
the plaintiff's undertaking and set an undertaking for the defendant to keep
possession or regain possession.  
                If the defendant
seeks to retain possession of the property, CCP § 515.020 permits the defendant
to file an undertaking and retain the property in an amount equal to the amount
of the plaintiff’s undertaking determined in CCP § 515.010(a), or in an amount
determined by the Court pursuant to CCP § 515.010(b).  
            Ms.
Phillips estimates the approximate value of the vehicle to be $123,850 based on
the Kelley Blue Book Online Official Used Car Guide.  (Phillips Decl., ¶19, Ex. 4.)  Plaintiff claims that Defendant owes $132,744.88
on the agreement.  (Id., ¶13.)  Plaintiff argues
that it should not be required to post a bond because the vehicle was delivered
to Defendant based on a lease agreement, such that no equity or ownership
interest was ever conveyed to Defendant. 
(Id., ¶20; App. Mem. of Points & Authorities at p.5.)  For the purposes of CCP § 515.010, Defendant
has no interest in the vehicle.  Accordingly,
the Court waives the requirement for Plaintiff to file an undertaking because
Defendant has no interest in the vehicle. 
            As
the application is not opposed, it does not appear that Defendant seeks to
retain possession of the vehicle. 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
            Plaintiff Financial Services
Vehicle Trust, by and through its servicer, BMW Financial Services NA, LLC’s application
for a writ of possession is granted.  The
Court issues the requested writ of possession to obtain the 2022 BMW M8 CNV motor
vehicle at Defendant Hrach Panosian’s address at 9705 Via Roma, Burbank, CA
91504.  
The requirement
for Plaintiff to post an undertaking is waived.  
            Plaintiff
is ordered to provide notice of this order.
