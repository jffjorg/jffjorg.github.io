[1] In the reply brief, the Bejaranos estimate that the
range of likely recoverable damages for Plaintiff to be $25,000 to
$42,750.  (Reply at p.6.)  They believe their proportionate share of
liability would be approximately 60% and Trader Joe’s/EKSC’s liability of
approximately 40% and that the settlement is within the ballpark of their
proportional liability for damages of approximately $15,000 to $25,650.  


[2] The parties to the settlement are identified as Kelsi
Mcaleese (claimant) and Myrna Bejarano and Hernan Najarno (defendants).  (Hawkins Decl., Ex. 8.)  In the reply papers, defense counsel Megan
Hawkins states in her declaration that Hernan Bejarano was inadvertently
identified as Hernan Najarano and that this was a typographical error.  (Hawkins Reply Decl., ¶7.)
