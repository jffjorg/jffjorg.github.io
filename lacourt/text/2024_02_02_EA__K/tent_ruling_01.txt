  Case Number:  22PSCV01725    Hearing Date:   February 2, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiffs Jose M. Cervantes’ and Crystal  Viramontes’ Motion for Attorney’s Fees is  GRANTED, in the reduced amount of $17.912.50  [see below]. Background[1]   Plaintiffs Jose M. Cervantes and Crystal Viramontes (together, “Plaintiffs”) allege as  follows: On October 2, 2020, Plaintiffs  purchased a used 2019 Ford Expedition, VIN No. 1FMJUIJT7KEA29777 (“subject  vehicle”). Plaintiffs allege that the subject vehicle suffers from various  defects and that the subject vehicle has not been repaired after a reasonable  number of attempts.  On November 8, 2022, Plaintiffs filed  a complaint, asserting causes of action against Ford Motor Company (“Defendant”)  and Does 1-10 for: 1.                   Violation of Song-Beverly Act—Breach of Express  Warranty 2.                   Violation of Song-Beverly Act—Breach of Implied  Warranty 3.                   Violation of Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2(b) On July 18, 2023, a conditional  “Notice of Settlement of Entire Case” was filed. An Order to Show Cause  Re: Dismissal (Settlement) is set for February 2, 2024. Legal Standard “Any buyer of consumer goods who is  damaged by a failure to comply with any obligation under this chapter or under  an implied or express warranty or service contract may bring an action for the  recovery of damages and other legal and equitable relief.” (Civ. Code § 1794,  subd. (a).) “If the buyer prevails in an action  under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part  of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including  attorney's fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have  been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and  prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d).) Discussion Plaintiffs move the  court, per Civil Code § 1794, for an award of attorneys’ fees, costs and  expenses in the amount of $42,248.55 (i.e., $27,557.50 in fees, plus 0.5  multiplier enhancement of $13,778.75, plus $912.30 in costs and expenses). Evidentiary  Objections The court rules on  Defendant’s evidentiary objections as follows: Overruled as to Nos. 1-3, 7-8  and 22-33 and Sustained as to Nos. 4-6 and 9-21. The court rules on  Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections as follows: Sustained as to No. 1. Merits 1.                   Entitlement to Fees Here, it is undisputed that Plaintiff is the prevailing  party and is entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to  Civil Code § 1794, subdivision (d). The only dispute relates to the appropriate  amount of recovery. 2.                   Reasonableness of Fees The court turns to the issue of reasonableness of the fees  sought. “[T]rial courts have broad discretion in determining the amount of a  reasonable attorney's fee award. This determination is necessarily ad hoc and  must be resolved on the particular circumstances of each case.” (Meister v. Regents of University of  California (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th  437, 452.) “Trial judges are entrusted with this discretionary determination  because they are in the best position to assess the value of the professional  services rendered in their courts.” (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008)  165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “[O]nce a party has established he or she is entitled to  fees, the lodestar method is generally presumed to be the starting point in  analyzing the appropriate amount of attorney fees. Under this method, a court  first calculates the number of hours reasonably spent multiplied by the  reasonable hourly rate for each billing professional, and then may adjust the  amount based on various relevant factors to ensure the fee reflects the fair  market value [of the attorney services] for the particular action. (K.I. v. Wagner (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th  1412, 1425 [quotations and citations omitted].) a.                   Reasonableness  of Hourly Rates    “In determining  hourly rates, the court must look to the prevailing market rates in the  relevant community. The rates of comparable attorneys in the forum district are  usually used. In making its calculation, the court should also consider the  experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees. The court  may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market in setting  a reasonable hourly rate.” (Heritage  Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009 [internal  quotations and citations omitted].) The hourly rates in  this matter are set forth as follows: Sepehr Daghighian (“Daghighian”), partner- $625.00             Michael H. Rosenstein (“Rosenstein”),  partner- $650.00/$700.00  Brian T. Shippen-Murray (“Shippen-Murray”), senior attorney-  $500.00/$550.00 Alastair Hamblin (“Hamblin”), associate attorney- $500.00/$550.00 The court determines that a reduction in the above hourly  rates is warranted under the circumstances. This is a straightforward lemon law  case, with no cited complexities. Based on the court’s own experience and  knowledge, as well as on the experience and qualifications of counsel as set  forth in Daghighian’s declaration,  the court finds that the above hourly rates should be reduced to $425.00/hour  for Rosenstein, $400.00/hour for Daghighian,  and $350.00/hour for Shippen-Murray  and Hamblin. b.                   Reasonableness of Time Incurred    “[T]he verified time statements of the attorneys, as  officers of the court, are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear  indication the records are erroneous.” (Horsford  v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th  359, 396.) “In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of  work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the  specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the  evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or  unrelated do not suffice.” (Premier  Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008)  163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) Daghighian attests,  and the billing records attached as Exhibit A to his declaration reflect, that  the above attorneys expended the following time on this matter: (1) Daghighian:  14.9 hours; (2) Rosenstein: 4.9 hours; (3) Shippen-Murray: 0.5 hours and (4)  Hamblin: 27.7 hours. (Daghighian Decl., ¶¶ 7- 11, Exh. A). 1.                   “Block”  Billing   Defendant argues  that the court should strike out 6.8 hours billed by Hamblin on January 9, 2023  as impermissible “block billing.” “Block billing occurs when a block of time  [is assigned to multiple tasks rather than itemizing the time spent on each  task.” (Mountjoy v. Bank of America, N.A. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266,  279 [internal quotations and citation omitted].) “Block billing  presents a particular problem for a court seeking to allocate between  reimbursable and unreimbursable fees, and trial courts are granted  discretion to penalize [block billing] when the practice prevents them  from discerning which tasks are compensable and which are not.” (In  re Marriage of Nassimi (2016) 3  Cal.App.5th 667, 695 [internal quotations and citation omitted].) The January  9, 2023 entry in question reads as follows: “Analyze discovery requests to both  plaintiffs, including form interrogatories, requests for production and request  for admissions; draft responses; draft email regarding responses.” The court  determines that the above entry does not constitute block billing, inasmuch as  each of the discrete tasks performed in responding to Defendant’s discovery are  clearly identified and compensable. 2.                   Vague  Billing   Defendant next  argues that the court should strike out 0.3 hours billed by Rosenstein on July  3, 2023 (reading “fee demand”) as vague. The court disagrees, inasmuch as it  appears that the foregoing entry pertains to Rosenstein’s evaluation of the  attorney’s fees issue.  3.                   Duplicative  Billing  Defendant argues  that a December 20, 2022 billing entry by Hamblin for 1.8 hours (reading  “[c]onduct initial analysis of case, including review of complaint, answer,  repair history, purchase documents and other available client documents”) is  duplicative of a November 4, 2022 billing entry by Rosenstein for 2.4 hours  (reading: “[r]eview client’s purchase and repair documents; [a]nalyze case  facts under Song-Beverly Act; [d]raft [c]omplaint and accompanying documents”).  The court disagrees. Again, the entries  were made by two different attorneys, Rosenstein and Hamblin and involve  different task descriptions. Defendant then argues that Hamblin’s June 5, 2023  billing entry for 2.7 hours and June 6, 2023 billing entry for 1.2 hours are  duplicative; however, the first entry indicates that it was for a partial  analysis of Defendant’s discovery responses, including requests for admissions,  interrogatories and requests for production whereas the second entry was  directed to the document production and drafting of a table of contents.  Defendant also contends (not in its opposition but in its Exhibit A, which the  court declines to consider based on its ruling on Plaintiff’s evidentiary  objection) that Rosenstein’s June 16, 2023 and June 22, 2023 billing entries  for “settlement communications” are duplicative. Even if the court were to  consider Exhibit A, the court rejects Defendant’s argument, inasmuch as these  entries indicate that such communications were conducted six days apart. 4.                   “Inter-Office  Communications” Defendant argues  that the court should strike out 3.5 hours billed, which it described as  “inter-office communications.” Defendant does not cite to any particular  entries in its opposition, but instead references its Exhibit A, which again the  court declines to consider based on its ruling on Plaintiff’s evidentiary  objection. Even if the court were to consider Exhibit A, the allegedly  offending entries cannot be categorized as “inter-office communications.” The  court rejects this argument. Defendant argues  that the court should strike out Plaintiffs’ request for 5.0 hours of  anticipated fees for reviewing Defendant’s opposition, preparing the reply and  attending the hearing. The court declines this request.   The court reduces  the amount of attorney’s fees from $27,557.50 to $17,912.50. c.                    Multiplier  Plaintiffs  assert that they should be awarded a 0.5 multiplier. “[T]he lodestar. . . may  be adjusted by the court based on factors including, . . . (1) the novelty and  difficult of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting  them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other  employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award. The  purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value for the  particular action. In effect, the court determines, retrospectively, whether  the litigation involved a contingent risk or required extraordinary legal skill  justifying augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in order to approximate the  fair market rate for such services.” (Ketchum  v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131-1132.) The court  determines that Plaintiffs have not articulated any basis warranting the  imposition of a multiplier.            3.                   Costs  Plaintiffs request $912.30 in costs and expenses. The court  is unaware of a Memorandum of Costs having been filed. Costs are to be pursued  separate from the instant motion. 4.                   Conclusion The motion for attorney’s fees is granted, in the reduced  amount of $17,912.50.
