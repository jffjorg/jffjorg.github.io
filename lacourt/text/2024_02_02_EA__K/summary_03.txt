And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff had alleged that the California Mini Mart, owned by Dorthy Ann Gray and operated by Bahadar Ram Lakha, had parking barriers that violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Unruh Civil Rights Act, and the California Disabled Persons Act. The plaintiff sought a default judgment against Lakha, but the judge has denied the request due to several defects in the plaintiff's submission. The judge has requested that the plaintiff resubmit its attorney's fees request in compliance with local rules, provide an explanation and receipt for a mysterious "deed image download," and clarify and revise its proposed judgment to specify the remedies it is seeking and the laws it is relying on. The case will proceed to an Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment on February 2, 2024.
