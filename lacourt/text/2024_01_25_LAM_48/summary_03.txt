The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for sanctions against the defendant, FCA US LLC, in the amount of $2,235.00. The defendant failed to comply with the court's order to provide further responses and documents, and as a result, the plaintiff filed a motion for sanctions. The defendant filed a late opposition, but agreed that the motion should be granted and asked for the monetary sanctions to be reduced. The judge ordered the defendant's counsel to pay the sanctions within 30 days.
