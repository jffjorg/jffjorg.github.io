And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is continuing the hearing on January 25, 2024, to allow the petitioner, J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC, to file and serve an amended notice and petition that includes the missing information identified in the ruling. The petitioner seeks approval of the transfer of structured settlement payment rights from Jesse Bias, the respondent, to the petitioner. The judge has found that the transfer is in Bias's best interest, that he knowingly waived his right to receive independent professional advice, and that he received the required disclosure form. However, the judge has concerns about the lack of information regarding the annuity contract and terms, and is continuing the hearing to allow the parties to address these issues. The judge has also ordered the petitioner to provide the actual annuity contract with its precise terms and to address whether or not the terms preventing assignment are enforceable.
