  CASE NO.: 22STCV33901
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION
  FOR SANCTIONS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
January 25, 2024



 
On October 19, 2022, Plaintiffs
Elena Ayala and Jose Ayala filed this action against Defendant FCA US LLC arising
from Plaintiffs’ purchase of an allegedly defective vehicle.
On
August 24, 2023, the Court granted in part Plaintiffs’ motions to compel further
responses to Special Interrogatories and Requests for Production.
On
December 18, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion for sanctions because Defendant failed
to provide further responses, verifications, or any document production within 45
days, as ordered by the Court.
If
a party fails to obey an order compelling inspection, copying, testing, or sampling,
the Court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
sanction, an evidence sanction, a terminating sanction, or a monetary sanction.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (c).)  “In addition to any other sanctions permitted
by law, the court may order a person, after written notice and an opportunity to
be heard, to pay reasonable monetary sanctions to the court or an aggrieved person,
or both, for failure without good cause to comply with the applicable rules.”  (California Rules of Court, rule 2.30.)
Defendant
did not comply with the Court’s August 24, 2023 order.  (Lopez Decl. ¶ 9.)  Plaintiffs therefore seek monetary sanctions of
$2,235.00.  (Lopez Decl. ¶ 10.)
Defendants
did not file a timely opposition to this motion.  However, on January 19, 2024, Defendant filed
a late opposition.  According to Defendant,
it has now produced the documents.  (Opposition
at p. 3.)  Defendant agrees that Plaintiffs’
motion should be granted, but it asks for the monetary sanctions to be reduced.  (Id. at p. 4.)  There is no declaration or other evidence showing
when Defendant produced the documents, except for the inference that the production
occurred because Plaintiffs filed this motion.
The
motion is GRANTED.  Defendant’s counsel is
ordered to pay sanctions of $2,235.00 to Plaintiff within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
