  CASE NO.: 22STUD03191
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR SUMMARY
  JUDGMENT 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
January 25, 2024



 
On June 24, 2022, Plaintiff Cirrus Asset Management Inc.
filed this unlawful detainer action against Defendants Eddie Ramon Rosas and Nelly
Melchor.  Eddie Ramon Rosas was placed in
default on June 8, 2023.
On November
28, 2023, the Court set a December 14, 2023 hearing for Plaintiff’s motion for summary
judgment.  Plaintiff did not file its motion
before the December 14, 2023 hearing, so the Court continued the motion.
Plaintiff
filed its motion for summary judgment on December 26, 2024.  Defendant Nelly Melchor did not file a written
opposition before the Court posted its tentative ruling, but the Court will still
consider any opposition at the hearing.  (California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1351(b).)
LEGAL
STANDARD
A
motion for summary judgment in an unlawful detainer action may be made on five days’
notice, and “[s]ummary judgment shall be granted or denied on the same basis as
a motion under Section 437c.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1170.7.)
A
plaintiff moving for summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof
by proving each element of a cause of action. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) 
That includes damages when damages are an element.  (Paramount Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court
(2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 226, 241.)  Then the
burden shifts to the defendant to show that a triable issue of material fact exists
as to the cause of action or a defense.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)  To establish
a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce “substantial
responsive evidence.”  (Sangster v. Paetkau
(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 162-163.)
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff’s
motion is based solely on Defendant Melly Melchor’s deemed admissions (“RFAs”).  The motion is supported by a declaration from
Plaintiff’s agent and a declaration from Plaintiff’s counsel that authenticates
Defendant’s Requests for Admissions and the Court’s June 20, 2023 order deeming
the admissions admitted.
A.        The Court Will Not Deny the Motion Due
to Plaintiff’s Failure to Include a Separate Statement.
The
motion does not include “a separate statement setting forth plainly and concisely
all material facts that the moving party contends are undisputed.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (b)(1).)
“Separate
statements are required not to satisfy a sadistic urge to torment lawyers, but rather
to afford due process to opposing parties and to permit trial courts to expeditiously
review complex motions for [summary adjudication] and summary judgment to determine
quickly and efficiently whether material facts are undisputed.”  ((United
Community Church v. Garcin (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 327, 335 (United Community Church).)  “The separate statement ‘provides a convenient
and expeditious vehicle permitting the trial court to hone in on the truly disputed
facts.’ [Citation.]”  (Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 243, 252 (Nazir).)  “[I]t is no answer to
say the facts set out in the supporting evidence and memorandum of points and authorities
are sufficient.  ‘Such an argument does not
aid the trial court at all since it then has to cull through often discursive argument
to determine what is admitted, what is contested, and where the evidence on each
side of the issue is located.’”  (United Community Church, supra, 231 Cal.App.3d at p. 335.)  “The due process aspect of the separate statement
requirement is self-evident—to inform the opposing party of the evidence to be disputed
to defeat the motion.”  (Id. at p. 337.)
“The
failure to comply with this requirement of a separate statement may in the court’s
discretion constitute a sufficient ground for denying the motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (b)(1).)
Pages
4 and 5 of the motion set forth a list of specific facts that Plaintiff contends
are undisputed due to Defendant’s admissions. 
This serves the same purpose as a separate statement.  Therefore, the Court will not deny the motion
due to Plaintiff’s failure to include a separate statement.
B.        Defendant’s Deemed Admissions Establish
Each Element of Unlawful Detainer.
A
tenant of real property is guilty of unlawful detainer when the tenant remains in
possession without the landlord’s permission after default in the payment of rent
and three days’ notice requiring payment of rent.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1161, subd. (2).)
Plaintiff
argues that there are no disputed facts because Defendant has admitted all matters
to establish unlawful detainer.  (Motion at
pp. 4-6.)
Where
a party fails to timely respond to a request for admission, the propounding party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  “[A] deemed admitted order establishes, by judicial
fiat, that a nonresponding party has responded to the requests by admitting the
truth of all matters contained therein.” 
(Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 979.)  “Any matter admitted in response to a request
for admission is conclusively established against the party making the admission
in the pending action.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.410, subd. (a).)  “As a general rule
an admission is conclusive in the action as to the party making it.  [Citations.] 
Absent leave of court to amend or withdraw the admission, no contradictory
evidence may be introduced.”  (Murillo
v. Superior Court (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 730, 736 (Murillo).)
On
April 4, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with Requests for Admissions, Set One,
but Defendant did not serve responses.  (Rossetto
Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. 2.)  On June 20, 2023,
the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to deem the RFAs admitted.  (Rossetto Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. 3.)
Through
the deemed admissions, Plaintiff has established that it was the owner and landlord
of the property, Defendant was a tenant who owed at least $1,669.00 in past-due
rent, Defendant received the three-day notice on April 22, 2022, the notice was
not defective, and Defendant failed to comply with the notice.  (Rossetto Decl., Ex. 3 [RFA Nos. 1, 3-4, 7-8,
12].)  The monthly rent was at least $1,669.00,
and the fair rental value was at least $55.63 per day.  (Rossetto Decl., Ex. 3 [RFA Nos. 5-6].)  Defendant remains in possession of the premises,
does not have a legitimate reason for failing to comply with the notice, and did
not provide a declaration of financial distress.  (Rossetto Decl., Ex. 3 [RFA Nos. 9-11, 23-24].)  The property was habitable with no substantial
defective conditions and no outstanding government citations about substantial defective
conditions.  (Rossetto Decl., Ex. 3 [RFA Nos.
14-16].)  Plaintiff has not received rental
assistance or other financial compensation from any source corresponding to the
amount demanded or the amount accrued after the notice, and it does not have any
pending application for rental assistance or other financial compensation.  (Rossetto Decl., Ex. 3 [RFA Nos. 25-27].)
Plaintiff
has met its burden of proving each element of unlawful detainer.
Defendant
did not file a written opposition with evidence to show that a triable issue of
material fact exists, nor can she submit evidence to contradict her judicial admissions.  (Murillo, supra, 143 Cal.App.4th at p.
736.)
Accordingly,
summary judgment is granted in favor of Plaintiff.
CONCLUSION
The
motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
The
Court will sign the Proposed Order with the following modifications:
(1)
Striking “in the amount of $500” in subsection (d); and
(2)
Adding “per properly filed memorandum of costs” at the end of subsection (d).
The
Court will also enter judgment in accordance with these terms.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
