* "On petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it determines that: (a) The right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or (b) Grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement."
* "Defendants' initial evidence failed to show that Plaintiff electronically signed the Agreement. Kara Morrison, Defendants' Director of Human Resources, asserted that Plaintiff electronically signed the Agreement on March 8, 2022, but gave no explanation of 'how she arrived at that conclusion or inferred [Plaintiff] was the person who electronically signed the agreement.'"
* "Morrison's supplemental declaration purports to verify Plaintiff's signature on the Agreement with the claim that Plaintiff also signed various other documents electronically on March 8, 2022. But Morrison has not properly verified Plaintiff's electronic signature on these other documents in the first place; as with the Agreement, she merely 'summarily assert[s]' that Plaintiff signed them."

**English Text Summary**

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to compel arbitration, finding that they have failed to establish the existence of an arbitration agreement with admissible evidence. The defendants seek to compel arbitration based on a document entitled "Notice to Employees About Our Mutual Arbitration Policy", which states that all employees, including the plaintiff, agreed to arbitrate disputes related to their employment. However, the plaintiff disputes the existence of the arbitration agreement, arguing that the defendants have failed to authenticate his electronic signature on the agreement. The judge finds that the defendants' evidence, including a supplemental declaration from the director of human resources, is insufficient to establish the existence of the arbitration agreement, and therefore denies the motion to compel arbitration.
