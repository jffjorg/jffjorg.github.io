DEMURRER
WITH MOTION TO STRIKE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Joel Bond Deas
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Babak
Mobasser
 
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND 
 
On
April 22, 2021, Plaintiff Babak Mobasser, filed a form complaint in pro per
against Defendants, Joel Bond Deas (“Deas”) and Edmundo Gerardo Llamas, for
injuries arising from a motor vehicle collision.  The Complaint asserts causes
of action for (1) Motor Vehicle – Personal Injury and (2) Exemplary Damages for
fraud.  Plaintiff is currently
represented by counsel.
 
On October 4, 2023, Deas filed this Demurrer and Motion to
Strike portions of Plaintiff’s Complaint.  
 
On October 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed an Opposition to the Demurrer
only.  The Motion to Strike is unopposed.
 
On October 25, 2023, Deas filed a Reply.[1]
 
As a threshold matter, Plaintiff indicates in his Opposition that he
agrees to remove the Second Cause of Action for Exemplary Damages.  Thus, the sole issue to be decided in
connection with the Demurrer is whether the Complaint states a cause of action
for Motor Vehicle – Personal Injury.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
FOR DEMURRER 
 
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and
will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on its face.  (City
of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)  “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact
or law.  We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and also consider
matters which may be judicially noticed.  [Citation.]”  (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604
[“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable
they may be”].)  Allegations are to be liberally construed.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 452.)  In construing the allegations, the court is to give
effect to specific factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent
general or conclusory allegations.  (Financial Corporation of America
v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd 764, 769.)   Judicial Council
form complaints are not invulnerable to demurrer.  (People ex rel.
Dept. of Transportation v. Superior Court (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1480, 1482.) 
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10,
subd. (e).)  “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where
a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.”  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California,
Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)   
 
Where the complaint contains substantial factual
allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to
meet, a demurrer for uncertainty will be overruled or plaintiff will be given
leave to amend.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)  Leave to amend must be allowed where there
is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.  (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on the complainant
to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.) 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
            
            A.  Meet and Confer 
            Defense
counsel has complied with the meet and confer requirement.¿ (See
Declaration of Lisa Mersereau.) 
B.  Analysis
“The
elements of a cause of action for negligence are well established.¿ They are
(a) a legal duty to use due care; (b) a breach of such legal duty; and (c) the
breach as the proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.”¿ (Ladd v.
County of San Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 917; CACI No. 400.) (Quotations
omitted.)¿¿ The elements are the same for a Motor Vehicle cause of
action.  (See Judicial Council Form, Cause of Action-Motor Vehicle.) 
Deas demurs
to the Motor Vehicle cause of action as being uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible.  The Court agrees.  Although the form Complaint alleges the
elements of a Motor Vehicle claim, i.e, “the acts of defendants were negligent;
the acts were the legal (proximate) cause of injuries and damages to plaintiff”,
the Complaint is devoid of allegations making clear which of Deas’s actions
were negligent.  For instance, the
Complaint does not apprise Deas whether the basis for the action is a collision
involving motor vehicles, a pedestrian, or a cyclist.  The Complaint is uncertain.  
IV.       CONCLUSION         
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer is SUSTAINED. 
Leave to amend is GRANTED.[AS1] 
 
Plaintiff Babak Mobasser is ordered to serve and file a First Amended
Complaint within 15 days of this order.
 
Defendant Joel Bond Deas is ordered to serve and file a responsive
pleading within 30 days of being served with the First Amended Complaint.
 
The Motion to Strike is MOOT.
 
Moving party to give notice.
