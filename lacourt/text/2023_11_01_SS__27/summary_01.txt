Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively denied the Plaintiffs' application for default judgment without prejudice. The Plaintiffs had previously filed multiple applications for default judgment, which were denied due to various errors. In the most recent application, the Plaintiffs seek separate judgments against the Defendants, totaling $153,720.24. However, the Court finds that the application is still deficient due to errors in the CIV-100 and JUD-100 forms, including inconsistencies in the costs claimed by the Plaintiffs. The Court sets a status conference for December 1, 2023, at which time the Plaintiffs must resubmit their application for default judgment.
