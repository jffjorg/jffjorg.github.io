APPLICATION
FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiffs
Orly Humberto Reyes and Rosa Dalinda Reyes 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     N/A
 
 
On May 1, 2019, Plaintiffs Orly Humberto Reyes (“Orly”) and
Rosa Dalinda Reyes (“Rosa”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action
against Defendants Jose Antonio Isas (“Jose”) and Brenda Isas (“Brenda”)
(collectively, “Defendants”) arising from a November 21, 2018 motor vehicle
accident.  Plaintiffs allege Jose was
operating a motor vehicle owned by Brenda when the vehicle rear-ended
Plaintiffs’ vehicle.  Plaintiff Blanca
Lisette Reyes (“Blanca”) was later substituted as Orly’s successor-in-interest after
Orly passed away.  
 
            Plaintiffs
served Defendants with the summons, complaint, and statement of damages on May
24, 2019, by substituted service.  Default
was entered against Jose on July 16, 2020, and against Brenda on July 22,
2020.  Doe defendants were dismissed from this action on October 4,
2021.
 
On December 1, 2021, the Court denied Plaintiffs’
application for default judgment because Plaintiffs did not submit Form
CIV-100; Plaintiffs did not submit one proposed judgment on Form JUD-100 for
both Plaintiffs; the application did not comply with Vehicle Code section
17151; prejudgment interest was improperly calculated; Blanca improperly
claimed damages for pain and suffering; and Rosa’s declaration was insufficient
to support her general damages request of $500,000. 
 
On September 16, 2022, the Court denied Plaintiffs’
application for default judgment because Plaintiffs did not accurately complete
Item 7 on Form CIV-100; Plaintiffs did not accurately complete Item 7 of Form
JUD-100; Rosa did not substantiate her request for $100,000 in general damages;
and Plaintiffs’ application did not include a declaration calculating
interest. 
 
On
May 16, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ application for default judgment,
filed May 16, 2023, for inconsistencies in the CIV-100 and JUD-100 forms and
failing to apportion liability between Jose and Brenda
pursuant to Vehicle Code section 17151.
 
On August 24, 2023, Plaintiffs filed another application
for default judgment.  Plaintiffs now
seek separate judgments against Defendants as follows:
 
·        
Plaintiff Rosa
Dalinda Reyes seeks a judgment against Defendants in the sum of $140,642.32,
consisting of $39,963.40 in special damages, $100,000 in general damages, and
$678.92 in costs.
·        
Plaintiff Blanca Lisette Reyes as successor in
interest to Orly Humberto Reyes seeks a judgment against Defendants in the sum
of $13,077.92, consisting $12,399 in special damages and $678.92 in costs.
 
            Upon review, the Court finds that
Plaintiffs sufficiently support the judgments requested.   However, the application is still deficient
for the following reasons:
 
·        
The declaration of Plaintiffs’ counsel,
Vanessa Fantasia, indicates costs of $678.92 were incurred in this matter.  Yet, each Plaintiff seeks $678.92 in costs
for a total of $1,357.84.  Plaintiffs
together cannot recover more than $678.92 in costs.
·        
The CIV-100
forms do not match the JUD-100 form. 
Plaintiff Rosa Dalinda Reyes’s CIV-100 form indicates judgment is sought
against both defendants yet the JUD-100 form indicates she seeks a judgment
against Defendant Brenda Isas only.  Additionally,
the name listed in Item 1b of Plaintiff Rosa Dalinda Reyes’s CIV-100
form does not match her name in the Complaint.
·        
Plaintiffs
submit two requests for entry of default judgment (CIV-100) but only one
proposed judgment (JUD-100).  Plaintiffs
are directed to submit separate proposed judgments.
·        
Item 2f of Plaintiff Blanca Lisette Reyes’s
CIV-100 form does not properly state the total judgment to be entered.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ application for default judgment is
DENIED without prejudice. The Court sets a Status Conference Re: Default
Judgment for December 1, 2023 at 08:30 AM in Department 27 at Spring Street
Courthouse.  Plaintiffs are to resubmit their default judgment
application no later than 5 court days before the conference. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
