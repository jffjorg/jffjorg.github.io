CASE:                                Bertha Lidia Rapalo Rivera v. Oscar Misael Viera, et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 20STCV49058
 





















 
MOTION
TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF’S DEPOSITION



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendants
Oscar Misael Vira dba OMD Trucking, et al.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This action arises from a three-vehicle collision allegedly
caused by Victor Hugo Cardona (“Cardona”) and involving Bertha Lidia Rapalo
Rivera (“Rivera”) and Jesus Soto (“Soto”).¿ On May 1, 2019, Cardona was
driving a semi-truck purportedly owned by Oscar Misael Viera dba OMD Trucking
(“Viera”).¿ All parties were traveling on the freeway.  Soto was in the
far left lane and Rivera was in the lane to Soto’s right.  Cardona allegedly
made an unsafe lane change, forcing Rivera to veer left into Soto’s lane and
collide with Soto.  Rivera and Soto each filed separate actions (Case Nos.
20STCV49058 and 21STCV12703).  The cases were consolidated on September
25, 2023.
 
            On July 28,
2023, Defendants Viera and Cardona filed this motion to compel Plaintiff’s
deposition.  Defendants do not seek sanctions.
 
            The motion
is unopposed.[1] 
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD TO COMPEL DEPOSITION 
            Any party may obtain discovery by
taking in California the oral deposition of any person.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.010.)¿ “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action…without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)¿¿¿ 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
Defendants noticed
Plaintiff’s deposition on two occasions. 
The first date was for February 21, 2023.  The second date was for July 17, 2023.  (See Motion, Exs. A and B.) However, Plaintiff
did not appear for deposition at either date. 
(See Declaration of Mark E. Capell.)  
 
Defendants properly noticed Plaintiff’s
deposition and Plaintiff did not appear. 
Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to an order compelling Plaintiff’s
appearance at deposition.¿ 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
The motion is granted.  Plaintiff Bertha Lidia Rapalo
Rivera is ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days of this order.
            
Moving party to give notice.
