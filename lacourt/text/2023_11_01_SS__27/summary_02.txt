And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's unopposed motions to compel responses to discovery requests from the plaintiff. The defendant had served the plaintiff with discovery requests on December 28, 2022, but the plaintiff has not provided responses. As a result, all objections to the requests are waived. The judge finds that the defendant is entitled to an order directing the plaintiff to provide responses to the discovery requests.

Additionally, the judge has granted the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff. The plaintiff's failure to provide responses to the discovery requests warrants sanctions, and the judge imposes sanctions in the amount of $584.95, representing 2 hours of defense counsel's hourly rate and filing fees.

The plaintiff is ordered to provide verified, objection-free responses to the defendant's discovery requests and to pay the sanctions within 30 days of the date of this order.
