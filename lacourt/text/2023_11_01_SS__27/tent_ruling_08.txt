 [AS1]Plaintiff
does not put up much of a fight. 
However, if you are inclined to move this case forward, I think there is
a good argument that the complaint is sufficiently pled.  The complaint identifies the date, time, and
location of the incident. Although the complaint doesn't indicate whether this
is an auto v. auto, auto v. pedestrian, etc. case, we could liberally construe
the complaint as infer its, at least a motor vehicle collision. Presumably,
defendant has knowledge of the underlying events.
