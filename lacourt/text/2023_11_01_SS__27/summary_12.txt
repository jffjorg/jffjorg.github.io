And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is regarding the motion filed by Fred G. Muscarella, counsel for Defendant Brian Egan, to be relieved as counsel. The motion complies with California Rule of Court rule 3.1362, which requires notice of motion, declaration stating reasons for motion, service of notice and declaration on all parties, and proposed order relieving counsel. The Court finds that the motion should be granted as there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The client has failed to sign and return Substitution of Attorney and irreconcilable differences have arisen between the client and attorney, making it unreasonably difficult to further carry out the representation effectively.
