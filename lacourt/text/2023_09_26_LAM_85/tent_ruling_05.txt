 Case Number:  23STCV09801    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  85 
Pacific Western Bank v.
Norman Kravetz et al, 23STCV09801
Tentative decision on motion
to determine claim of exemption: denied



 
 
            
            Defendants
Norman J. Kravetz (“Norman”) and Glenda J. Kravetz (“Glenda”) seek exemptions to
the attachment order granted to Plaintiff Pacific Western Bank (“Bank”).
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers and opposition (no reply was
filed) and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff
Bank filed the Complaint against Norman, Glenda, E&O Asset Holdings, LLC, (“E&O”);
Lone Oak Fund, LLC (“Lone Oak”), and Qualfax, Inc. (“Qualfax”) on May 2, 2023.  The Complaint alleges causes of action for
(1) breach of promissory note, (2) conspiracy to fraudulently conceal assets,
(3) aiding and abetting fraudulent concealment of assets, (4) voidable transfer
under Civil Code sections 3439 et seq., and (5) declaratory relief.  The Complaint alleges in pertinent part as
follows.
            Norman
and Glenda are a married couple.  Norman
is the Managing Member of E&O.
 
            a.
The Loan
            On
January 24, 2022, Bank and Norman entered into a Business Loan Agreement
(“BLA”) by which Bank advanced monies to Norman from time to time that totaled $7,845,000
(“Loan”).  Norman agreed to use the Loan
solely for his business operations. 
Norman also agreed to maintain a Minimum Liquidity of $6,000,000.  Norman executed a Note for the $7,845,000
Loan and provided Bank with a Disbursement Request and Authorization (“DRA”)
that affirmed that the Loan’s primary purpose was for business.
            On
March 24, 2023, Norman defaulted on the BLA and Note for failure to make the $165,348.66
payment due.  Bank exercised its right
under the BLA and Note to accelerate all amounts due thereunder.
 
            b.
The Property
            On
February 8, 1991, Norman and Glenda acquired title via grant deed to property located
at 21701 Erwin Street, Woodland Hills, California 91367 (“Erwin Property”).  On March 21, 1994, they acquired any
remaining interest and title to the Erwin Property pursuant to a quit claim deed.  
            On
December 1, 2020, in an action filed by Citibank, N.A. (“Citybank”), the court
granted summary judgment against Norman and Glenda.  The couple then executed a grant deed for the Erwin
Property to E&O.  Although this grant
deed was dated January 7, 2020, Norman and Glenda signed and notarized it on
December 7, 2020, and had it recorded on December 15, 2020.
            Bank
has since obtained a Policy of Insurance of Record Title from California from
Chicago Title Insurance Company for the Erwin Property.  The title insurance policy shows deeds of trust
(“DOT”) recorded against the Erwin Property in favor of Lone Oak and Qualfax on
June 10, 2022.
 
            c.
Requested Relief
            For
breach of the Note, Bank seeks $6,699,328.22 in unpaid principal, $56,804.72
in accrued unpaid interest, additional accruing unpaid interest at the default
rate, late charges, and all related fees and costs, including attorney’s fees.  Bank also seeks damages from Norman, Glenda,
and E&O for conspiracy to fraudulently conceal assets and for aiding and
abetting fraudulent concealment of assets. 
Bank further requests that the court void the December 2020 Grant
Deed and issue a temporary restraining order enjoining Norman, Glenda, and E&O from
disposing of or transferring the Erwin Property.  
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On May 3, 2023, Bank recorded
a lis pendens fir the Erwin Property.
            On May 10, 2023, Bank
served Glenda and Norman with the Complaint and Summons by substitute service,
effective May 20, 2023.
            On May 15, 2023, Bank
served E&O with the Complaint and Summons.
            On May 16, 2023, Bank
served Qualfax with the Complaint and Summons by substitute service, effective
May 26, 2023.
            On May 17, 2023, Bank
served Lone Oak with the Complaint and Summons by substitute service, effective
May 27, 2023.
            On June 14, 2023, the
court denied Bank’s ex parte application for a right to attach order
against Norman for $6,855,804.67.
            On
June 20, 2023, Qualfax filed an Answer.
            On
June 30, 2023, Norman, Glenda, and E&O filed a joint Answer.
            On
July 11, 2023, Lone Oak filed an Answer.
            On
August 15, 2023, the court granted Bank’s application for a right to
attach order against Norman in the amount of $6,852,804.67.  The court denied Norman’s claims for a
homestead exemption and an exemption for amounts necessary to support his
family.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            Attachment
is a prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the
defendant’s assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the
outcome of the trial of the action.  See
Whitehouse v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et
seq.) that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v.
Appellate Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536. 
See Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (1986) 176
Cal.App.3d 1108, 1115.  As the attachment
statutes are purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly
construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner,
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 879, 882.
 
            1.
Exemptions
            The
property exempt from attachment consists of (a) all property exempt from
enforcement of a money judgment,[1]
(b) property which is necessary for the support of a defendant who is a natural
person or the family of such defendant supported in whole or in part by the
defendant, (c) “earnings” as defined by CCP section 706.011, and (d) all
property not subject to attachment pursuant to CCP section 487.010.  CCP §487.020. 

            If
the defendant claims that any personal property described in
the application is exempt from attachment, the defendant may include that exemption
claim in the notice of opposition to the right to attach order.  CCP §484.060(a).   Alternatively, the defendant may file and
serve a separate claim of exemption for the personal property.  CCP §484.070(b).  If the defendant does do either, the claim of
exemption will be barred in the absence of a showing of a change in
circumstances occurring after the expiration of the time for claiming
exemptions.  CCP §484.070(a); Bank of America
v. Salinas Nissan, Inc. (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260,
268 (plaintiff’s failure to oppose defendant’s exemption claim conceded its
propriety).  This waiver applies only to
personal property.  Thus, a homestead
exemption for a dwelling is not waived by failing to make a claim for
exemption.  Martom v. Aboyan,
(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 826, 831.
            The
defendant may obtain a determination at the hearing whether real or personal
property not described in the application, or real property
described in the application, is exempt from attachment by including an
exemption claim for such property in the notice of opposition/separate claim of
exemption.  The defendant’s failure to
claim such property as exempt does not preclude the defendant from raising the
issue at a later time.  CCP
§484.070(b).  The claim of exemption
shall (1) describe the property claimed to be exempt, and (2) specify the
statute section supporting the claim. 
CCP §484.070(c).  The claim of
exemption shall be accompanied by an affidavit supporting any factual issues
raised by the claim and points and authorities supporting any legal issues
raised.  CCP §484.070(d).  The defendant must file and serve the claim
of exemption and supporting papers not less than five court days before the
date set for the hearing.  CCP
§484.070(e).
            
            2. Untimely Claim Based on Change
in Circumstances
            A
defendant claiming an exemption as the result of a change in circumstances
after (1) denial of a claim of exemption or (2) expiration of the time for claiming
the exemption earlier in the action shall follow the procedure set forth in CCP
section 703.510 et seq.  CCP §482.100. 
A claimant seeking after levy to file a claim of exemption with the
levying officer which includes the following information: (1) the name of the
claimant and the mailing address where service of a notice of opposition to the
claim may be made upon the claimant; (2) the name and last known address of the
judgment debtor if the claimant is not the judgment debtor; (3) a description
of the property claimed to be exempt; (4) a financial statement if required by
Section 703.530; (5) a citation of the provision of this chapter or other
statute upon which the claim is based; and (6) a statement of the facts
necessary to support the claim.  CCP
§703.520(a), (b).
 
            3. Plaintiff’s Opposition
            If
the plaintiff opposes the claim of exemption, the plaintiff shall file and
serve a notice of opposition to the claim of exemption, accompanied by an
affidavit and memorandum of points and authorities on any legal issues, not
less than two days before the date set for the hearing.  If the plaintiff does not file and serve a
notice of opposition, no writ of attachment shall be issued as to the property
claimed to be exempt.  Bank of America,
supra, 207 Cal.App.3d at 270 (plaintiff’s failure to oppose exemption
claim conceded its propriety).  If the
defendant claims an exemption to all the property described in the plaintiff’s
application and the plaintiff does not file and serve a notice of opposition,
no hearing shall be held, no right to attach order or writ of attachment shall
issue, and any temporary protective order previously issued shall immediately
expire.  CCP §484.070(f).
            If
the plaintiff files and serves a notice of opposition to the claim, the
defendant has the burden of proving that the property is exempt from
attachment.  CCP §484.070(g).
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            1.
Norman’s Evidence
            On
August 15, 2023, two weeks before this motion, this court granted an
application for a right to attach order against two real properties and all
money that Norman and Glenda own.  Norman
Decl., ¶3; Genga Decl., ¶3.  Although the
court denied all requested exemptions, it stated that it did not believe Norman
had waived the right to apply for them and could do so in a subsequent motion
complying with the requirements for doing so. 
Genga Decl., ¶3.  
Although Norman and Glenda have three grown children, Norman
does not financially support them. 
Norman Decl., ¶4.
            Bank
has begun serving the writs of attachment on financial institutions where
Norman has funds on deposit.  Norman
Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  $87,000 out of
$104,000 in 12 accounts has become unavailable, leaving only $17,000.  Norman Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  Four automatic debits from these accounts,
including payments on a $500,000 line of credit with Bank of America, total
$121,000 per month.  Norman Decl., ¶6,
Ex. A.  The closing balance for some of
these accounts is now $1,000 or less.  Norman
Decl., ¶6, Ex. A.  
            The
account ending in 3632 is a trust account for one of Norman’s children, and for
which Norman is just a custodian.  Norman
Decl., ¶7, Ex. A.  Bank has levied all $12,060.42
therein.  Norman Decl., ¶7, Ex. A.  
            Having
substantial assets does not mean having abundant available cash, especially as
expenses are commensurate with asset value. 
Norman Decl., ¶9.  Norman has the
funds needed to pay of any final judgment against him, but needs those funds in
the interim.  Norman Decl., ¶9.  
 
            a.
Income
            Norman
and his wife Glenda receive $4,106 and $1,419 in monthly Social Security
payments, respectively.  Norman Decl.,
¶11, Ex. B, ln. 18-19, Ex. C.  An
investment account pays an average of $1,815 per month.  Norman Decl., ¶12, Ex. B, ln. 20, Ex. D.  Beyond that, Glenda has no income of her
own.  Norman Decl., ¶13.
            Most
family income is from shares in profits from companies that either Glenda or
Norman owns.  Norman Decl., ¶13, Ex. B,
ln. 7-13.  Last year’s distributions
totaled $2,847,000, or about $245,000 per month.  Norman Decl., ¶13, Ex. E.  The source for these distributions is 14
commercial properties, each with an estimated value in the millions.   Norman
Decl., ¶14, Ex. B, ln. 31-44.  
            Norman
owns over 50% of Equity Orchestration, the parent of a group of companies.  Norman Decl., ¶15.  Independent appraisal of its patents value
them at $365 million.  Norman Decl., ¶15,
Ex. F.  Once the company goes public or
is sold, Norman estimates that he will receive $132 million in earnings.  Norman Decl., ¶15, Exs. G-H.
            Norman
estimates his primary home in Tarzana (“Tarzana Property”) is worth $12.5
million, while his vacation home in Lake Arrowhead (“Arrowhead Property”) is
worth $3 million.  Norman Decl., ¶16, Ex.
B, ln. 42-43.  Norman sometimes has
business associates stay at the Arrowhead Property.  Norman Decl., ¶16.  Norman and Glenda co-own E&O, which owns
commercial property at Erwin Street and Owensmouth Avenue in the Woodland Hills
area (“E&O Property”).  Norman Decl.,
¶17.  This commercial property almost
sold for $14.375 million in November 2022 and is now likely valued at $12
million.  Norman Decl., ¶17. 
 
            b.
Expenses
            (1)
Mortgages
            Two
loans on the Tarzana Property have a cumulative outstanding balance of $8.1
million.  Norman Decl., ¶20, Ex. B, ln.
53-54, Ex. I.  Norman must make monthly
payments of $9,858 and $34,500.  Norman
Decl., ¶20, Ex. I.  He estimates the
value of the Tarzana Property at $12.5 million. 
Norman Decl., ¶20, Ex. B ln. 42, Ex. I. 

            The
Arrowhead Property has an outstanding mortgage of $2.1 million and a monthly
payment of $8,495.  Norman Decl., ¶21, Ex.
B ln. 63, Ex. J.  The E&O Property
has a monthly mortgage payment of $73,146. 
Norman Decl., ¶22, Ex. B ln. 83-84, Ex. K.  That amount will increase to $160,000 in
October 2023 if Norman cannot renegotiate the loan.  Norman Decl., ¶22.
            The
monthly mortgage obligations on all the Properties total $125,999.  Norman Decl., ¶23.  Failure to pay these mortgages will
result in foreclosure.  Norman Decl.,
¶23.  
 
            (2)
Taxes and Insurance
            Each
loan for the three properties requires Norman to carry insurance and keep
current on taxes.  Norman Decl., ¶24.  The Tarzana Property incurs $4,159 in taxes
and $5,612 in insurance per month.  Norman
Decl., ¶25, Exs. B, ln. 58-59, Ex. L. 
The Arrowhead Property incurs $1,884 in taxes and $2,572 in insurance
per month.  Norman Decl., ¶26, Exs. B,
ln. 66-67, Ex. M.  The E&O Property
incurs $3,307 in taxes and $227 in insurance per month.  Norman Decl., ¶27, Exs. B, ln. 87-88, Ex.
N.  Taxes and insurance total $17,761 per
month.  Norman Decl., ¶28.
 
            (3)
Utilities and Maintenance
            Utilities
average $9,084 per month for the Tarzana Property, $3,284 for the Arrowhead
Property, and $523 for the E&O Property. 
Norman Decl., ¶30, Ex. B, ln. 56, 64, 86, Exs. O-Q.  This totals $12,891 per month.  Norman Decl., ¶30.
            The
Tarzana Property requires substantial maintenance and repair.  Norman Decl., ¶31.  Norman pays two full-time housekeepers and
gardeners.  Norman Decl., ¶31.  A large oak tree recently fell on the
property and took days to clear and repair the damage.  Norman Decl., ¶31.  Before that, storms had required costly plumbing
repair.  Norman Decl., ¶31.  Norman had to pay these expenses to keep
living in the house.  Norman Decl.,
¶31.  Maintenance and repair costs of the
Tarzana Property average $11,057 per month. 
Norman Decl., ¶31, Ex. B, ln. 55, 57, Ex. R.
            The
same is true for the Arrowhead and E&O Properties to a lesser extent.  Norman Decl., ¶32.  Maintenance and operating costs average
$1,920 per month for the Arrowhead Property and $1,928 per month for the
E&O Property.  Norman Decl., ¶33, Ex.
B, ln. 65, 85, Exs. S-T.
 
            (3)
Other Expenses
            Although
Norman’s cars are fully paid off, related expenses for gas and insurance total $1,239
per month.  Norman Decl., ¶34, Ex. B, ln.
50.
            Life
insurance premiums total about $49,000 per year, or $4,084 per month.  Norman Decl., ¶35, Ex. B, ln. 72, Ex. U.
            Medical
expenses include $1,504 per month in medical insurance premiums (Norman Decl.,
¶36, Ex. B, ln. 74), $1,076 in uncovered medical and dental costs (Norman
Decl., ¶36, Ex. B, ln. 73), and $1,920 a month for Glenda’s brother for kidney
dialysis and related care (Norman Decl., ¶36, Ex. B ln. 76). This totals $4,500
a month.  Norman Decl., ¶36.
            Basic
necessities of groceries, clothing, and some travel and entertainment total $23,149
per month.  Norman Decl., ¶37, Ex. B ln.
75, Ex. V.
            The
family’s financial situation is complex and Norman employs accountants who
charge an average of $22,091 per month.  Norman
Decl., ¶38, Ex. B ln. 79, Ex. W.  From
August 2023 thereafter, attorney’s fees have added $35,000 per month, or a
little under 60 hours a month at $600 per month.  Norman Decl., ¶38, Ex. B ln. 79; Genga Decl.,
¶5.
            Actual
and estimated expenditures in 2023 total $2,856,546 per year.  Norman Decl., Ex. B.
 
            2.
Bank’s Evidence
            In
opposition to the application for a right to attach order, Norman included
evidence that he had liquid assets of about $4.1 million as of June 30, 2022.  Goldflam Decl., ¶4, Ex. 3 (Norman Attachment
Decl., Ex. N).  Various loan agreements
required him to maintain liquid assets of between $2 million and $5
million.  Norman Attachment Decl., Exs.
KK, NN.
            Norman’s
original ledger in support of his requests for exemptions included $15,000 a
month deposited into Glenda’s account, dues to country clubs and resorts, and
season tickets to Rams games.  Norman
Attachment Decl., ¶24, Ex. OO.
            When
this court granted the application for a right to attach order, the list of
attachable property included Norman’s interest in multiple parcels of real
property, any securities, any stocks, and any bonds.  Goldflam Decl., ¶3, Ex. 2.  Bank also sought to attach any interest in
money on premises where a trade or business is conducted, plus money in excess
of $1,000 located elsewhere or in a deposit account.  Goldflam Decl., ¶3, Ex. 2.  
            The
court denied all requests for exemptions. 
Goldflam Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1 (Order Notice Exs 1-2).  The adopted tentative held that Norman could
renew the claim for a homestead exemption, but it did not say the same for
amounts necessary to support a family. 
Order Notice Ex. 1; Goldflam Decl., ¶3, Ex. 2.
 
            D. Analysis
            Norman and Glenda[2] apply for various exemptions to the
previously issued right to attach order, including for vehicles, life
insurance, amounts necessary to support his family, and amounts held only as a
custodian of a trust account for one of his children.
 
            1. Procedural Issues
            a. Renewed Motion
            A party who originally made an application for an order
which was refused in whole or part, or granted conditionally or on terms, may
make a subsequent application for the same order upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law.  CCP §1008(b).¿ The moving party must present an
attorney declaration stating when the party previously appeared, who the judge
was, how the judge ruled, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or
law are claimed to be shown. §1008(b).  The party must also provide a satisfactory
explanation for failing to produce such evidence in the first
application.  Kalivas v. Barry Controls Corp., (1996), 49
Cal.App.4th 1152, 1160-61.  The requirement of satisfactory explanation
for failing to provide the evidence earlier can only be described as a strict
requirement of diligence.  Garcia v. Hejmadi, (“Garcia”)
(1997), 58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690.   
Norman admits that
this motion seeks the same exemption relief as his opposition to the
application for a right to attach order. 
Norman Decl., ¶3; Genga Decl., ¶3; Order Notice Exs 1-2.  In this motion, Norman now provides
substantial detail of his expenses.  See
generally Norman Decl., Ex. B. 
Bank asserts that
the motion fails because Norman’s alleged facts existed at the time of his
previous opposition and Norman could have presented them.  See Garcia, supra, 58
Cal.App.4th at 690. Opp. at 3.  
Compliance with CCP
section 1008(b) requires an attorney declaration that provides a satisfactory
explanation for failing to provide the evidence earlier, which can only be
described as a strict requirement of diligence. 
Garcia, supra, 58 Cal.App.4th at 690.  Norman provides evidence that the court
stated at the August 15, 2023 hearing that, while it was denying all requested
exemptions, it did not believe Norman had waived the right to apply for them
and could do so in a subsequent motion. 
Genga Decl., ¶3.  The court does
not recall the hearing, and the statement attributed to it does not seem
precisely like something the court would say. 
The court’s notes and its August 15, 2023 minute order do not reflect
Norman’s position either.  Nonetheless,
Bank does not present any declaration contradicting Norman’s counsel and the
court accepts Norman’s counsel’s declaration. 

The court’s
statement means that Norman can make a motion for exemptions as if it were an
initial attempt to claim exemption without the constraints of CCP section 1008(b)
and (e). 
 
            b. Untimely
Claim Based on Change in Circumstances 
            If a defendant fails to make a
timely claim for exemption or makes the claim but fails to prove that the
personal property is exempt, the defendant may not later claim the exemption
except as provided in CCP section 482.100. 
CCP §484.070(a).
            A defendant claiming an exemption as
the result of a change in circumstances after (1) denial of a claim of
exemption or (2) expiration of the time claiming the exemption earlier in the
action shall follow the procedure set forth in CCP section 703.510 et seq.  CCP §482.100. 
CCP section 703.520 requires the claimant seeking an exemption after
levy to file a claim of exemption with the levying officer which includes the
following information: (1) the name of the claimant and the mailing address
where service of a notice of opposition to the claim may be made upon the
claimant; (2) the name and last known address of the judgment debtor if the
claimant is not the judgment debtor; (3) a description of the property claimed
to be exempt; (4) a financial statement if required by Section 703.530; (5) a
citation of the provision of this chapter or other statute upon which the claim
is based; and (6) a statement of the facts necessary to support the claim.  CCP §703.520(a), (b).

            Bank
again cites the court’s previous denial of exemptions based on property
necessary for the support of the defendant and notes that the instant motion is
not based on a change in circumstances.  Opp.
at 2-3; Order Notice Exs. 1-2.  However, CCP
section 484.070(a) has no bearing on an application considered as an initial
attempt to show exemption. 
 
            2.
Merits
            The
court will address the merits of Norman’s application.  
 
            a. Vehicles 
            The
aggregate equity in motor vehicles is exempt up to $3,325.  CCP §704.010(a).  
            Although
Norman’s cars are owned without lease or financing, he cites $1,239 per month
in car expenses like gas and insurance.  Norman
Decl., ¶34, Ex. B, ln. 50.  
Bank responds that it does
not seek to attach Norman’s vehicles. 
Opp. at 4.  Bank misunderstands Norman’s
request.  He seeks to exempt
transportation costs.   The exemption
applies only to the value of the vehicles, not the related expenses for their
use.  To the extent that Norman seeks to
exempt transportation costs, those are a part of amounts necessary to for the support of the defendant’s family.  See post.  
            The vehicle exemption is denied. 
             
            b. Life
Insurance 
            Unmatured
life insurance policies, including endowment and annuity policies, but not the
loan value of such policies, are exempt without making a claim.  CCP
§704.100(a).   
            Norman’s life
insurance premiums total about $49,000 per year, or $4,084 per month. Norman
Decl., ¶35, Ex. B, ln. 72, Ex. U.  Bank
agrees not to attach the insurance policies. 
Opp. at 4.  Again, Bank
misunderstands Norman’s request.  He
seeks to exempt $49,000 per year in life insurance premium, not the policies
themselves.  CCP section 704.100(a) does
not exempt premium payments.  While the
policies themselves are exempt, the requested exemption for payment of life
insurance premium is denied.
 
            c. Retirement
Benefits 
            All amounts held, controlled, or in
process of distribution by a public entity derived from contributions by the
public entity or by an officer or employee of the public entity for public
retirement benefit purposes, and all rights and benefits accrued or accruing to
any person under a public retirement system, are exempt without making a
claim.  CCP §704.110(b).  All amounts held, controlled,
or in process of distribution by a private retirement plan, for the payment of
benefits as an annuity, pension, retirement allowance, disability payment, or
death benefit from a private retirement plan are also exempt.  CCP
§704.115(b).

$4,106 and $1,419 in monthly Social Security payments, respectively.  Mot. at 9; Norman Decl., ¶11, Ex. B, ln.
18-19, Ex. C.  An exemption for these
payments of $5,525 per month, or $66,300 per year ($5,525 x 12 = $66,300), is
granted.  
 
            d. Amount Necessary to Support a Family

and attorney’s fees (Norman Decl., ¶38, Ex. B ln. 79, Ex. W).  Opp. at 9-10. 

            The
exemption is for property which is necessary for the support of a defendant or
his family dependents, not property necessary to maintain the defendant’s existing
lifestyle.  Code CCP §487.020(b). 
Norman’s expenses for the mortgages and maintenance of his commercial property
in Woodland Hills and his home in Lake Arrowhead are not necessary to support him
and his family.[3]  
The Tarzana Property is Norman’s primary residence.  Norman Decl., ¶16, Ex. B, ln. 42.  The reasonable expenses for maintenance and
operation of his, or to prevent its foreclosure, are necessary.  This includes monthly payments of (1) $44,358
in mortgage payments, (2) $4,159 in taxes and $5,612 in property insurance, and
(3) $9,084 in utilities.   
Norman also seeks $11,057 in monthly maintenance and repair
costs for his home.  Norman argues that
these expenses are necessary because his home requires several full-time
workers and other work has been necessary to keep his home in good repair from
storm damage.  App. at 7.  The employment of full-time workers -- which
Bank says are two maids (Opp. at 4) --- and the use outside maintenance workers
are not necessary for Norman’s support.  
            Norman
seeks exemption for monthly expenses of $1,239 in automobile gas and insurance
expenses, $1,504 in medical insurance premiums, $1,076 in uncovered medical and
dental costs, and $1,920 for Glenda’s brother for kidney dialysis and related
care.  Norman does not show that Glenda’s
brother is a dependent and that expense is disallowed.  The other expenses are necessary for his and
his family’s support.
Norman groups groceries, clothing, travel, entertainment
into a single category averaging $23,149 per month.  Norman Decl., ¶37, Ex. B ln. 75, Ex. V.  Travel and entertainment do not qualify as
necessities.  Because the ledger does not
distinguish between them and acceptable necessities like food, the full $23,149
is disallowed.
Norman asserts that his finances are complicated and he
needs $22,091 per month for his accountants. 
Kravetz Decl., ¶38, Ex. B ln. 79, Ex. W. 
The court disagrees.  Payments to
his accountants are not necessary for family support.  However, Norman’s anticipated $35,000 per
month in attorney’s fees for this case is exempt.  
Norman requests that the court increase this by 10% to
account for one-time expenses.  Mot. at
9.  There is no legal reason to provide a
plug increase for necessary expenses and it is disallowed.  
The court need not total Norman’s reasonable monthly support
expenses because he has not shown that he has an inability to pay them.  All property of the defendant is considered
when determining the needs of the defendant, his spouse, and his
dependents.  CCP §703.115.  As a result, the court must
balance Norman’s income and liquid assets against his necessary monthly expenses.  Norman admits that he received millions in
distributions last year from 14 commercial properties.  Norman Decl., ¶¶ 13-14, Ex. B, ln. 31-44, Ex.
E.[4]  Bank notes that Norman’s opposition to the
application for a right to attach order provided evidence that he had liquid
assets of about $4.1 million as of June 30, 2022.  Goldflam Decl., ¶4, Ex. 3 (Norman Attachment Decl.,
Ex. N).  Norman’s various loan agreements
also require him to maintain liquid assets of between $2 million and $5
million.  Norman Attachment Decl., Exs.
KK, NN.
Norman has not shown that his income and liquid assets are
insufficient to defray the reasonable expenses necessary to support him and his
family.  The exemption is denied.         
 
e. Trust Funds 
Escrow or trust funds are
not subject to enforcement of a money judgment arising out of any claim against
the licensee or person acting as escrow agent, and in no instance shall such
escrow or trust funds be considered or treated as an asset of the licensee or
person performing the functions of an escrow agent.  Financial Code
§17410. 
            Among
the levied funds are $12,060.42 from an account Norman claims he holds in trust
for one of his children.  Norman Decl.,
¶7, Ex. A.  As Bank notes, Norman
provides no proof of this fact beyond his own declaration and his ledger entry
stating that he is the account’s custodian for “MATT PK”.  Opp. at 4-5; Norman Decl., Ex. A.  The exemption is denied.
 
            E.
Conclusion
            An
$66,300
annual exemption for Social Security benefits is granted.  The remaining exemption claims are denied.
