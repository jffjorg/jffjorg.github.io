And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The District Attorney (DA) requests judicial notice of certain documents related to a criminal case, including a criminal case summary, preliminary hearing transcript, and appellate case summaries. The judge grants judicial notice of some of these documents, but denies it for others that are not relevant. The DA also requests judicial notice of minute orders and CPRA requests, which are granted and denied, respectively. The judge notes that the DA's responses to the CPRA request are dated 2021 but appear to be written in 2022, and that Denham incorrectly asserts that the DA's March 22 letter reiterates the arguments from the DA's February 8 response. Finally, the judge denies Denham's request for judicial notice of certain documents because they are not subject to judicial notice and can be reviewed in the court file.
