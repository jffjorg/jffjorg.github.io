relevant the requests are denied.  Evid.
Code §452(d).
            The DA also requests judicial notice of minute orders
from People v. Denham, Case No. NA031090, dated (1) February 14, 2022 (Jardin
Decl., Ex. 25). (2) September 26, 2022 (Jardin Decl., Exs. 26-27). and (3)

            Finally, the DA requests judicial notice of (1) Denham’s
CPRA request attached to the Petition (Jardin Decl., Ex. 29), (2) DA’s response
to the CPRA request (Jardin Decl., Ex. 30), (3) Denham’s reply to the DA’s
response (Jardin Decl., Ex. 31), and (4) the DA’s response thereto (Jardin
Decl., Ex. 32).  These documents are not
subject to judicial notice and the requests are denied.  To the extent that these documents are
attached to the Petition, the court need not judicially notice them because it
is always free to review the court file in the pending case.  See Jardin Decl., ¶¶ 30-31.


            [3] The CPRA
request also asked for DDA Laesecke’s starting and ending dates with the DA.  Denham Decl., Ex. A.  The DA provided this information.  Denham Decl., Ex. B.  


[4] The DA’s
responses are dated 2021 but in context appear to be written in 2022.


            [5] Dunham
incorrectly asserts that the DA’s March 22 letter reiterates the arguments from
the DA’s February 8 response.  Denham
Decl., ¶6.  They are not the same.


[6] Denham has
not pursued the third class of responsive documents: witness lists.  The DA correctly argues that request is
waived.  Opp. at 6.
