  Case Number:  22STCP01938    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  85 
Paul John Denham v. George
Gascon, 22STCP01938
Tentative decision on
petition for writ of mandate: granted



 
            
 
            Petitioner
Paul John Denham (“Denham”) seeks a writ of mandate directing Respondent George
Gascon in his official capacity as Los Angeles District Attorney (“DA”) to
release public records responsive to Denham’s request under the California
Public Records Act (“CPRA”).  
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and
renders the following tentative decision. 
            
            A.
Statement of the Case
            1.
Petition
            Petitioner
Denham filed the Petition on May 20, 2022 alleging a cause of action for mandamus
for violation of the CPRA in pertinent part as follows.
            From
August 1992 to March 2010, the DA’s office employed Deputy District Attorney
(“DDA”) Laura Laesecke (afterwards appointed as a judge but referred to herein
as DDA Laesecke”).  During this period,
the DA employed Dale Higashi (“Higashi”) and Michelle Lepisto (“Lepisto”) of
the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (“LASD”) Scientific Services Bureau
(“SSB”) as expert witnesses and consulting experts.  Higashi and Lepisto both provided
consultation services for at least one case assigned to DDA Laesecke.  The DA possesses public records showing the
identity of the experts used in DDA Laesecke’s criminal cases.
            On
January 25, 2022, Denham filed a CPRA request for public records with the DA’s
office as to whether DDA Laesecke worked on any case that received assistance
from the SSB, Higashi, or Lapisto.  On
February 8, 2022, the DA’s office denied the request.  The DA’s office explained that finding those
records and determining when Higashi and Lapisto were witnesses on particular
cases would require searching the Prosecutor’s Information Management System
(“PIMS”).  It also asserted that a
listing of cases on which a particular individual’s name appears on a witness
list is exempt and cannot be disclosed.
            On
February 18, 2022, Denham responded that he did not want witness listings, but
rather information about DA and LASD employees’ performance of official
duties.  He also asserted that the
exemption did not apply because he did not seek arrest records or compilations
from PIMS.  He just wanted records
confirming when DDA Laesecke worked with either Higashi or Lepisto.  The DA’s office March 23, 2022 response
reiterated the arguments from its February 8 response.
            Denham
seeks a writ of mandate compelling the DA’s office to produce the requested
records for inspection, or alternatively show cause as to why the court should
not issue such an order, and to pay Denham’s costs of this suit.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
May 17, 2022, Denham served the DA with the Petition by delivery in a prepaid
envelop to prison officials for mailing.
            No
Answer is on file.
 
            B.
Standard of Review
            A
party may seek to set aside an agency decision by petitioning for either a writ
of administrative mandamus (CCP §1094.5) or of traditional mandamus.  CCP §1085. 
A petition for traditional mandamus is appropriate in all actions “to
compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins as a duty
resulting from an office, trust, or station....”  CCP §1085. 

            A
traditional writ of mandate under CCP section 1085 is the method of compelling
the performance of a legal, ministerial duty. 
Pomona Police Officers’ Assn. v. City of Pomona, (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 578, 583-84.  Generally,
mandamus will lie when (1) there is no plain, speedy, and adequate alternative
remedy, (2) the respondent has a duty to perform, and (3) the petitioner has a
clear and beneficial right to performance. 
Id. at 584 (internal citations omitted).  Whether a statute imposes a ministerial duty
for which mandamus is available, or a mere obligation to perform a
discretionary function, is a question of statutory interpretation.  AIDS Healthcare Foundation v. Los Angeles
County Dept. of Public Health, (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 693, 701.
            No
administrative record is required for traditional mandamus to compel
performance of a ministerial duty or as an abuse of discretion. 
 
            C.
Governing Law
            1. The CPRA
            The
CPRA was enacted in 1968 to safeguard the accountability of government to the
public.  San Gabriel Tribune v.
Superior Court, (1983) 143 Cal.App. 762, 771-72.  Government Code[1] section
6250 declares that “access to information concerning the conduct of the
people’s business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this
state.”  The CPRA’s purpose is to
increase freedom of information by giving the public access to information in
possession of public agencies. CBS. Inc. v. Block, (1986) 42 Cal. 3d
646, 651.  The CPRA was intended to
safeguard the accountability of government to the public, and it makes public
access to governmental records a fundamental right of citizenship.  Wilson v. Superior Court, (1996) 51
Cal.App.4th 1136, 1141.  This requires
maximum disclosure of the conduct of government operations.  California State University Fresno Assn.,
Inc. v. Superior Court, (“California State University”) (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 810, 823.  In 2004, the
voters endorsed the CPRA by approving Prop 59, which amended the state
Constitution to declare that “the writings of public agencies…shall be open to
public scrutiny.”  Cal. Const. Art. I,
§3(b).
            The
CPRA makes clear that “every person” has a right to inspect any public
record.  §7922.525(a).  The inspection may be for any purpose; the
requester’s motivation is irrelevant. §7921.300.  The term “public record” is broadly defined
to include “any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the
people’s business prepared, owned, used or retained by any state or local
agency regardless of physical form or characteristics.  §7920.530. 
The definition of “state agency” excludes agencies described in Articles
IV and VI of the state constitution, which describe the legislative and
judicial branches, except the State Bar of California.  §7920.540.
            Upon
receiving a request for a copy of public records, an agency must determine
within ten days whether the request seeks public records in the possession of
the agency that are subject to disclosure, but that deadline may be extended up
to 14 days for unusual circumstances.  §§
7922.535(a)-(b).  Nothing in the CPRA
“shall be construed to permit an agency to delay or obstruct the inspection or
copying of public records.”  §7922.500.  
            Even
significant expense to the agency will not excuse an agency from conducting a
thorough search for responsive records unless it constitutes an undue
burden.  See, e.g., CBS
Broadcasting Inc. v. Superior Ct., (2001) 91 Cal. App. 4th 892, 909
($43,000 cost to agency to compile responsive public records was not valid
reason to deny CPRA request). 
“Reasonable efforts do not require that agencies undertake
extraordinarily extensive or intrusive searches, however.  In general, the scope of an agency’s search
for public records ‘need only be reasonably calculated to locate responsive
documents.’” City of San Jose v. Superior Court, (2017) 2 Cal.5th 608,
627 (citation omitted). The “CPRA does not prescribe specific methods of
searching for those documents and agencies may develop their own internal
policies for conducting searches.  Some
general principles have emerged, however. Once an agency receives a CPRA
request, it must “‘communicate the scope of the information requested to the
custodians of its records,’ although it need not use the precise language of
the request...” Ibid. (citation omitted).
            The
right to inspect is subject to certain exemptions, which are narrowly
construed.  California State
University, 90 Cal.App.4th at 831. 
The exemptions are found in sections 6254 and 6255.  In pertinent part, public records exempt from
disclosure include records for which disclosure “is exempted or prohibited
pursuant to federal or state law, including, but not limited to, provisions of
the Evidence Code relating to privilege” §7927.705.  
            Additionally,
if a state or local agency discloses a public record that is otherwise exempt to
a member of the public, this disclosure shall constitute a waiver of the
applicable exemptions.  §7921.505.  However, this does not apply to disclosures (1)
made through legal proceedings or as otherwise required by law (§7921.505(c)(2));
(2) within the scope of disclosure of a statute that limits disclosure of
specified writings to certain purposes (§7921.505(c)(3)); or (3) made to a
governmental agency that agrees to treat the disclosed material as confidential
(§7921.505(c)(5)).  Furthermore, exempt
records do not lose their protected status if they are disclosed to the
district attorney.  §7921.710; Fagan
v. Superior Court (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 607, 617.  
            The
burden of demonstrating that exemptions apply lies with the governmental
entity.  §7922.000. 
            If
the agency determines that the requested records are subject to disclosure, it
must state in the determination “the estimated date and time when the records
will be made available.”  Ibid.
There is no deadline expressed in number of days for producing the records.
Rather, the agency “shall make the records promptly available.” §7922.530(a).
            If
the agency determines that the requested records are not subject to disclosure,
the agency promptly must notify the person making the request and provide the
reasons for its determination. Ibid. 
The agency must justify withholding a responsive record by demonstrating
it is exempt or that on the facts of the case the public interest served by not
disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by
disclosure of the record.  §7922.000.  The determination that the request is denied
must be made in writing.  §7922.540(a). 
            A
CPRA claim to compel compliance with a public records request may proceed
through either mandamus or declaratory relief. 
§7923.000. Because the petitioner may proceed through either mandamus or
declaratory relief, the trial court independently decides whether disclosure is
required.  See City of San Jose v. Superior Court, (“City of San
Jose”) (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1018 (appellate court independently
reviews trial court CPRA decision).  No
administrative record is required, and the parties must submit admissible
evidence. 
                        
            2.
Criminal Law
            No
order requiring discovery shall be made in criminal cases except as provided in
Penal Code sections 1054 et seq. 
Penal Code §1054.5(a). That chapter also provides the only means by
which the defendant may compel the disclosure or production of information from
prosecuting attorneys, law enforcement agencies which investigated or prepared
the case against the defendant, or any other persons or agencies which the
prosecuting attorney or investigating agency may have employed to assist them
in performing their duties.  Id.
            Penal
Code section 1054.9 partially abrogates the general rule that a petitioner
seeking habeas corpus relief is not entitled to post-conviction discovery
unless and until the criminal court issues an order to show cause.  In re Steele, (“Steele”) (2004)
32 Cal.4th 682, 690.  If a defendant is
or has ever been convicted of a serious felony or a violent felony resulting in
a sentence of 15 years or more, upon the prosecution of a postconviction writ
of habeas corpus or a motion to vacate a judgment, or in preparation to file
that writ or motion, and on a showing that good faith efforts to obtain
discovery materials from trial counsel were made and were unsuccessful, the
court shall order that the defendant be provided reasonable access to discovery
materials from that case.  Penal Code
§1054.9(a).  “Discovery materials” means materials
in the possession of the prosecution and law enforcement authorities to which
the same defendant would have been entitled at time of trial.  Penal Code §1054.9(c).  
            If
a sentence other than death or life in prison without the possibility of parole
is or has ever been imposed and the court has entered a previous order granting
discovery, it has discretion to issue a subsequent order granting
discovery.  Penal Code §1054.9(b).  A party who requests discovery subject to
this discretion shall submit a statement as to whether that person has
previously been granted an order for discovery pursuant to this section.  Id.
            The
scope of permissible discovery includes materials currently in the possession
of the prosecution or law enforcement authorities involved in the prosecution,
which (1) the prosecution did provide at the time of trial but have since
become lost to the defendant; (2) the prosecution should have provided at the
time of trial because they came within the scope of a discovery order, a
statutory duty to provide discovery, or the constitutional duty to disclose
exculpatory evidence; (3) the prosecution should have provided at the time
because the defense specifically requested them; and (4) the prosecution had no
obligation to provide absent a specific defense request, but to which the
defendant would have been entitled upon a specific request.  Steele, supra, 32 Cal.4th at
697.  The scope of permissible discovery
is limited to only those law enforcement agencies that were involved in the
investigation or prosecution of the case.  Id. at 696.

Statement of Facts[2]
            1.
Denham’s Evidence
            On
January 25, 2022, Denham mailed his CPRA request to the DA.  Denham Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  He sought disclosure of any records that showed
whether DDA Laesecke worked on any case that received assistance from SSB
employees Higashi or Lepisto.  Denham
Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.[3]  
            On
February 8, 2022[4], DA
responded that the requested records were exempt from disclosure.  Denham Decl., ¶4, Ex. B.  The request would require the DA to search
PIMS to determine in which cases Higashi or Lepisrto were identified as witnesses.  Denham Decl., ¶4, Ex. B.  The DA cited 89 Ops. Cal. Atty. Gen. 204, 215
(2006), in which the California Attorney General determined that listings of
cases on which a particular individual’s name appeared on a witness list are exempt
and cannot be disclosed.  Denham Decl.,
¶4, Ex. B.
            On
February 18, 2022, Denham responded that he did not want “listings” regarding
“individuals.”  Denham Decl., ¶5, Ex.
C.  He wanted official information about the
performance of official duties by DA and LASD officials.  Denham Decl., ¶5, Ex. C.  The Attorney General opinion addresses the
release of criminal offender information where access is restricted pursuant to
Penal Code section 13300.  Denham Decl.,
¶5, Ex. C.  The responsive records for
his request are not arrest records or compilations from PIMS.  Denham Decl., ¶5, Ex. C.  He only wanted records confirming whether DDA
Laesecke worked with either Higashi or Lepisto on any case.  Denham Decl., ¶5, Ex. C.  A “yes” or “no” in response would suffice
without infringing on arrested person’s privacy rights.  Denham Decl., ¶5, Ex. C.  
            On
March 23, 2022, the DA responded that no record contains all the information
needed to answer the “yes” or “no” question. 
Denham Decl., Ex. D.  The DA is
not required to generate such a document when it does not already exist.  Denham Decl., Ex. D.[5]
            The
DA did not file an Answer to the Petition. 
Denham Decl., ¶¶ 7-8, Ex. E.  
On March 2, 2023, DA Principal Application Developer Richmond
Chua (“Chua”) filed a declaration asserting that 6,287 pages of potentially responsive
documents are imaged and accessible on PIMS. 
Denham Decl., ¶9, Ex. F.
            On
April 10, 2023, DA informed Denham it identified three classes of documents
responsive to the CPRA request: criminal case detail listings, preliminary hearing
transcripts, and internal witness lists. 
Denham Decl., ¶10, Ex. G.  For the
witness lists, DA again cited the Attorney General’s determination that witness
lists are exempt and cannot be disclosed. 
Denham Decl., ¶10, Ex. G.  For all
three classes of documents, Denham could not compel production via the CPRA and
must instead comply with Penal Code section 1054.9.   Denham
Decl., ¶10, Ex. G.  
 
            2.
The DA’s Evidence
            On
February 6, 1998, Denham was convicted of murder in People v. Denham, (“Denham
I”) Case No. NA031090.  Jardin Decl.,
¶2, Ex. 1.  Higashi and Lepisto testified
at the trial.  Jardin Decl., ¶3, Ex. 2,
pp. 90-104.  On September 24, 1998, Denham
was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.  Jardin Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1.
            Denham
appealed the conviction.  Jardin Decl., ¶4,
Ex. 3.  On January 27, 2000, the
appellate court affirmed Denham’s conviction with modifications.  Jardin Decl., ¶4, Ex. 3.  Denham has since filed 21 challenges to the
conviction, challenges to the denial of requests for post-conviction discovery,
and petitions for writ of mandamus to challenge DDA Laesecke’s requests for
post-conviction discovery.  Jardin Decl.,
¶¶ 5-25, Exs. 4-24.
            On
September 22, 2020, Denham filed a request to appoint counsel to investigate
and file a motion for DNA testing if appropriate.  Jardin Decl., ¶26, Ex. 25.  Counsel did file such a motion, but Department
100 denied it on September 26, 2022.  Jardin
Decl., ¶¶ 26-27, Exs. 25-26.  The court noted
the state’s argument that this was an attempt to bootstrap litigation regarding
a previous order from DDA Laesecke as to a discovery motion under Penal Code
section 1054.9.  Jardin Decl., ¶27, Ex. 26.
            Also
on September 26, 2022, Department 100 granted a motion to allow Denham to view
and photograph exhibits from his trial.  Jardin
Decl., ¶28, Ex. 27.  On October 18, 2022,
the court ordered the release of ballistic evidence for testing.  Jardin Decl., ¶29, Ex. 28.  
 
            E.
Analysis
            Petitioner
Denham seeks to compel the DA to produce the criminal case detail listings and
preliminary hearing transcripts which it admits are responsive to his request
for records that show whether DDA Laesecke worked on any case that received
assistance from SSB employees Higashi or Lepisto.[6]
            Denham
argues that the DA has the burden of showing that a specific exemption
applies.  See §7922.000.  He relies on Weaver v. Superior Court,
(2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 746, which considered a CPRA request by a
prisoner sentenced to death for all charging documents filed by the DA in
homicide cases over a certain period, for the purpose of assisting his argument
that the district attorney impermissibly sought the death penalty against him based
on race.  Id. at 747-48.  The district attorney objected to production based
on the investigatory file exemption, privacy rights of victims and defendants,
and undue burden.  Id. at
749.  The district attorney admitted that
the records were “court documents” that had been filed in court.  Id. 
In light of this fact, the court rejected the district attorney’s
argument of victim and defendant privacy. 
Id. at 751.  The district 1054.9(b);
attorney claimed that Penal Code section 13302, which forbids a local criminal
justice agency from furnishing a record to a person not authorized by law to
receive it, but the court noticed that Penal Code section 13302 had been
amended to state that disclosure under the CPRA is an exemption.  Id. at 751.  Finally, the court rejected the district
attorneys’ undue burden claim and ordered the requested production of complaints.  Id. at 752-53.
Denham contends that Weaver holds that the DA’s
copies of documents filed in superior court, are note exempt from disclosure
and must be made available to the public upon request.  In so ruling, Weaver found the
petitioner’s post-conviction motions under Penal Code section 1054.9 to be irrelevant
because “under the CPRA there are no limitations on access to a public record
based on the purpose for which the record is being requested, if the record is
otherwise subject to disclosure.”  Id.
at 749.  Pet. Op. Br. at 4-5.  Denham concludes that the DA cannot rely on
Penal Code section 1054.9 to justify withholding the responsive criminal case
detail listings and preliminary hearing transcripts because the purpose for
which he requests public records is irrelevant. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 5, 7.
            The
DA’s sole defense is that Denham’s request is barred by Penal Code section
1054.9.  Prior to 2003, an inmate seeking
habeas relief was not entitled to court-ordered discovery unless and until an
order to show cause was issued.  Steele,
supra, 32 Cal.4th at 690. 
Effective January 1, 2003, the Legislature added Penal Code section
1054.9, which allows post-conviction discovery in connection with a habeas
petition where death or life in prison has been imposed on a showing of good
faith efforts to obtain the discovery materials from his lawyer.  Id. 
The scope of section 1054.9 concerns discovery materials in the
possession of the prosecution and law enforcement to which the defendant would
have been entitled at time of trial.   Penal Code §1054.9(c) Steele, supra,
32 Cal.4th at 693.  Such
materials include reconstruction of a lost case file, but also include materials
the prosecution should have provided and materials that the prosecution would
have been obligated to provide upon request but no request at trial was
made.  Id. at 697.
            The
DA argues that Denhan is serving a sentence of life without parole and Penal Code
section 1054.9 applies to him.  He has
made no attempt to comply with its procedure and instead has made an improper
attempt to seek post-conviction discovery related to alleged constitutional
infirmities in his trial related to ballistic and physical evidence.  Those matters have already been addressed in
Denham’s post-conviction discovery requests in the criminal court.  See Jardin Decl., ¶¶ 26-29, Exs,
25-28.  The DA notes that Weaver’s
reference to the inmate’s post-conviction discovery motions was not part of its
holding and therefore did not address whether an inmate must comply with Penal
Code section 1054.9 to obtain post-conviction discovery.  Opp. at 5-6.
            The
court need not decide whether an inmate making a CPRA request to the
prosecution or law enforcement must instead seek post-conviction discovery pursuant
to Penal Code section 1054.9 because the DA does not show that the requested
information – records which show whether DDA Laesecke worked on any case with
SSB employees Higashi or Lepisto – is material the prosecution should have
provided or would have been obligated to provide upon request, in Denham’s
criminal case.  See Steele,
supra, 32 Cal.4th at 697. 
On their face, records showing that the prosecutor and criminalists
worked on other cases together would not normally be provided as discovery in a
criminal case.  Whether they should be
provided upon request by the defense is a closer question, but the DA has the
burden of showing that to be true and has not met that burden.  Thus, the DA must provide the records sought
by Denham.  
The court recognizes the DA’s evidence that Denham has made 21
challenges to his conviction or the denial of his requests for post-conviction
discovery, and the burden that may imposed (Opp. at 3), but the criminal courts
are equipped to handle these issues. 
Should Denham make multiple CPRA requests or file other civil actions
that merely harass, the DA has the remedy available of a motion pursuant to the
vexatious litigant statutes, CCP section 391 et seq.
 
            F.
Conclusion
            The
Petition is granted.  As Denham appears
to seek only information showing any cases on which DDA Laesecke worked SSB
employees Higashi or Lepisto, it may be sufficient that the DA provide any
document(s) providing this information for all such cases without providing all
the documents showing that information. 
The court will address this issue with the parties at hearing.
