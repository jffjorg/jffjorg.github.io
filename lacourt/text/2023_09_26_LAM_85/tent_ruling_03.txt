 Case Number:  23STCP02217    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  85 
Ryan Lawrence, Alex
Duncan, and Tyler Diamond v. California Public Employees’ Retirement System,
23STCP02217

Tentative decision on demurrer:
 sustained in part with leave to amend



 
            
            Respondent California Public
Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) demurs to the Petition filed by Petitioner
Alex Duncan (“Duncan”), Ryan Lawrence (“Lawrence”), and Tyler Diamond
(“Diamond”). 
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply,[1] and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the
Case
            1. Petition
            Petitioners
Duncan, Lawrence, and Diamond filed the Petition against Respondent CalPERS on June
23, 2023, alleging a claim for administrative mandamus.  The Petition alleges in pertinent part as
follows.
            Duncan
was hired by the City of Beverly Hills Police Department (“BHPD”) on June 22,
2009.  Pet., ¶4.  Lawrence and Diamond were hired on May 30,
2012.  Pet., ¶4.  All three were advised that they were the
last police academy class to be categorized in the “3% at age 50” retirement
formula.  Pet., ¶4.  
After extensive negotiation between BHPD and the Beverly
Hills Police Officers Association (“POA”) from October 2011 to November 2012, a
2011 Memorandum of Understanding (“2011 MOU”) provided that, pursuant to Government
Code (“Govt. Code”) section 21362.2, all current sworn police personnel hired
prior to July 1, 2012 are subject to a 3% at 50 retirement formula.  Pet., ¶7. 
Pursuant to Govt. Code section 21363.1, employees hired after July 1,
2012 were subject to a 3% at 55 retirement formula.  Pet., ¶7.  On November 18, 2012, Petitioner Lawrence
confirmed a the Human Resources analyst of the City of Beverly Hills (“City”)
that he would be enrolled in the 3% at 50 retirement plan under which he was
hired.  Pet., ¶8.
            On
September 8, 2012, without any negotiation with the POA, the City submitted an
amended contract to CalPERS which applied the 3% at 55 retirement formula to local
safety members entering membership for the first time in the safety
classification after the effective date of the September 8, 2012 amendment.  Pet., ¶9.
            In
2016, Lawrence discovered he was improperly placed in the 3% at 55 retirement
category.  Pet., ¶10.  He later learned Duncan and Diamond were improperly
placed as well.  Pet., ¶10.  On December 22, 2020, Petitioners submitted to
CalPERS a Request to Correct Status of Retirement Benefits.  Pet., ¶11. 
On February 2, 2021, CalPERS sent each Petitioner at his home address a
Determination Letter that informed him of his right to appeal. Pet., ¶12.  
            All
three Petitioners filed appeals in February 2021.  Pet., ¶13. 
The administrative law judge (“ALJ”) heard the appeals on February 1,
April 13, and April 22, 2022.  Pet.,
¶14.  On September 12, 2022, the ALJ issued
a proposed order denying the appeals (“Proposed Decision”).  Pet., ¶15. 
The ALJ found that CalPERS had correctly interpreted the City’s 2012
contract amendment with CalPERS as accurately reflecting the retirement
provisions in the 2011 MOU, and that the City correctly enrolled Petitioners in
the 3% at 55 retirement benefit formula. 
Pet., ¶15.
            On
September 13, 2022, CalPERS sent a letter to Petitioners’ counsel Richard
Levine, Esq. (“Levine”) but not to Petitioners themselves.  Pet., ¶¶ 11, 16.  The letter advised Levine that the Proposed
Decision had no effect until the CalPERS Board of Administration (“Board”) formally
adopted, remanded, or declined to adopt it. 
Pet., ¶16.  The appeal was
calendared for the Board’s consideration on November 16, 2022.  Pet., ¶16.
            On
November 22, 2022, CalPERS informed Levine of its decision to adopt the Proposed
Decision (“Final Decision”).  Pet., ¶17.  The letter referenced the Administrative
Procedure Act, Govt. Code sections 11521 and 11523, and Title 2 of the
California Code of Regulations (“2 CCR”) sections 555-555.4, but not CCP
sections 1084-97.  Pet., ¶17.  The letter did not reference the 90-day deadline
in CCP section 1094.6.  Pet., ¶17.  The attached proof of service did not show
service on the three individual Petitioners. 
Pet., ¶17.
            Petitioners
seek a writ of administrative mandate compelling CalPERS to set aside the Final
Decision, issue a new decision that acknowledges the City erred by communicating
a miscategorization of the Petitioners’ retirement benefits to CalPERS, and
categorize Petitioners in the 3% at 50 formula. 
Pet. Prayer for Relief, ¶1.  Petitioners
also seek costs and attorney’s fees under both CCP section 1021.5 and Govt.
Code section 800.  Pet. Prayer for
Relief, ¶¶ 3-5.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
June 29, 2023, Petitioners served CalPERS with the Petition and Summons.
 
            B. Applicable
Law 
            Demurrers
are permitted in administrative mandate proceedings.  CCP §§1108,
1109.  A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleading alone and
will be sustained where the pleading is defective on its face. 
            Where
pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect by way of a demurrer or
motion to strike or by motion for judgment on the pleadings.  CCP
§430.30(a); Coyne v. Krempels, (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257.  The party
against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may object by
demurrer or answer to the pleading.  CCP §430.10.  A demurrer is
timely filed within the 30-day period after service of the complaint.  CCP
§430.40; Skrbina v. Fleming Companies, (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1353,
1364. 
            A demurrer
may be asserted on any one or more of the following grounds: (a) The court has
no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the pleading;
(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have legal capacity to sue; (c)
There is another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of
action; (d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties; (e) The pleading does
not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; (f) The pleading is
uncertain; (g) In an action founded on a contract, it cannot be ascertained
from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is implied by
conduct; (h) No certificate was filed as required by CCP sections 411.35 or
411.36.  CCP §430.10.  
A demurrer tests the
sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer must appear on the
face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.  CCP
§430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan, (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.  The face
of the pleading includes attachments and incorporations by reference (Frantz
v. Blackwell, (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94), but it does not include
inadmissible hearsay.  Day v. Sharp, (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 904,
914.   
            The sole
issue on demurrer for failure to state a cause of action is whether the facts
pleaded, if true, would entitle the plaintiff to relief.  Garcetti v.
Superior Court, (“Garcetti”) (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1533, 1547; Limandri
v. Judkins, (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 339.  The question of
plaintiff’s ability to prove the allegations of the complaint or the possible
difficulty in making such proof does not concern the reviewing court.  Quelimane
Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co., (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 47.  
The ultimate facts alleged
in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all facts that may be implied
or inferred from those expressly alleged.  Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn
& Crutcher, (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403.  This rule does not
apply to allegations expressing mere conclusions of law, or allegations
contradicted by the exhibits to the complaint or by matters of which judicial
notice may be taken.  Vance v. Villa Park Mobilehome
Estates, (“Vance”) (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 698, 709. 
            For all
demurrers filed after January 1, 2016, the demurring party must meet and confer
in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading for the purpose
of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.  CCP §430.31(a).  As part of
the meet and confer process, the demurring party must identify all of the
specific causes of action that it believes are subject to demurrer and provide
legal support for the claimed deficiencies.  CCP §430.31(a)(1).  The
party who filed the pleading must in turn provide legal support for its
position that the pleading is legally sufficient or, in the alternative, how
the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer could be amended to cure any legal
insufficiency.  Id.  The demurring party is responsible for
filing and serving a declaration that the meet and confer requirement has been
met.  CCP §430.31(a)(3).
            “[A]
demurrer based on a statute of limitations will not lie where the action may
be, but is not necessarily, barred. [Citation.] In order for the bar of the
statute of limitations to be raised by demurrer, the defect must clearly and
affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint; it is not enough that the
complaint shows that the action may be barred.” State ex rel. Metz v. CCC
Information Services, Inc., (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 402, 413.
            If a demurrer is
sustained, the court may grant leave to amend the pleading upon any terms as
may be just and shall fix the time within which the amendment or amended
pleading shall be filed.  CCP §472a(c). 
However, in response to a demurrer and prior to the case being at issue,
a complaint or cross-complaint shall not be amended more than three times,
absent an offer to the trial court as to such additional facts to be pleaded
that there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured to state a cause
of action.  CCP §430.41(e)(1).
 
            C. Statement
of Facts[2]
            1. CalPERS’
Evidence
            The City
appeared at the ALJ’s hearing.  Dem. RJN
Ex. 1, p. 5.  The ALJ’s Proposed Decision
listed the City as the Respondent and Levine as Petitioners’ counsel.  Dem. RJN Ex. 1, pp. 4-5.  
            The
Proposed Decision was issued on September 12, 2022.  Dem. RJN Ex. 1.  The Proposed Decision found that Petitioners (therein
the respondents) failed to establish that CalPERS incorrectly interpreted the City’s
contract amendment with CalPERS to be consistent with the 2011 MOU.  Dem. RJN Ex. 1, p. 7.  It also clarified that the ALJ’s authority
under the Public Employees’ Retirement Law (“PERL”) means that it could
determine if the City had made a mistake in interpreting the 2011 MOU with
respect to a member’s retirement and entering into the 2012 CalPERS contract
amendment.  Dem. RJN Ex. 1, p. 22.
            On
November 16, 2022, CalPERS issued a Final Decision adopting the Proposed
Decision.  Dem. RJN Ex. 1, p.3.  On November 22, 2022, CalPERS mailed the
Final Decision and a cover letter to Levine via certified mail.   Dem.
RJN Ex. 1, pp. 1-2, 30.  CalPERS also
served the Final Decision on Levine electronically the same day.  Dem. RJN Ex. 1, p. 30.  
            The November
22, 2022 cover letter explained that the Final Decision would become effective
30 days after mailing.  Dem. RJN Ex. 1,
p. 1.  Any party could petition the Board
for reconsideration within that 30-day period. 
Id.  After the time for
reconsideration passed, the Board would lose jurisdiction.  Id. 
Any party could appeal to the courts within 30 days after the last day
on which reconsideration can be ordered, citing Govt. Code sections 11521 and
11523.  Dem. RJN Ex. 1, p.1.  
 
            2. Petitioners’
Evidence
            On December
17, 2020, this court sustained without leave to amend multiple demurrers to the
second amended petition in POA on the basis that Petitioners had failed
to exhaust administrative remedies for issues concerning the 2011 MOU.  Opp. RJN Ex. 2, p.12.
 
            3. Reply
Evidence
            On October
6, 2022, Petitioners filed an opposition to the City’s ex parte application
to continue the trial date in POA. 
Reply RJN Ex. A.  In it, Petitioners
acknowledged that they received notice of the Proposed Decision on September
12, 2022.  Reply RJN Ex. A, p. 2.
            On March
22, 2023, Petitioners filed an opposition to the City’s motion for
summary judgment in POA.  Reply
RJN Ex. B.  In it, they acknowledged that
CalPERS adopted the Proposed Decision as its Final Decision on November 16,
2022.  Reply RJN Ex. B, p. 8.  
 
            C. Analysis
            Respondent
CalPERS demurs to the Petition on the basis that (1) it is barred by the
statute of limitations in Govt. Code section 11523, and (2) the City must be
joined as an indispensable party.  
 
            1.
Meet and Confer
            On June 26, 2023, CalPERS notified
Petitioners of its intent to file a demurrer. 
Kaur Decl., ¶3.  CalPErS also
asked Petitioners to join the City as an indispensable party because judgment
could not be granted without doing so. 
Kaur Decl., ¶3.  Petitioners
refused.  Kaur Decl., ¶3.
            On July 18, 2023, CalPERS again emailed
Petitioners notice that it would file a demurrer based on the statute of
limitations and failure to name the City as a party.  Kaur Decl., ¶4.  Despite several emails on the subject, the
parties failed to reach any agreement.  Kaur
Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.
            CalPERS fulfilled
the meet and confer requirement.
 
            2.
Statute of Limitations 
            “[A]
demurrer based on a statute of limitations will not lie where the action may
be, but is not necessarily, barred. In order for the bar of the statute of
limitations to be raised by demurrer, the defect must clearly and affirmatively
appear on the face of the complaint; it is not enough that the complaint shows
that the action may be barred.” State ex rel. Metz v. CCC Information
Services, Inc., (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 402, 413 (citation omitted).
CalPERS
proceedings are conducted pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act
(“APA”), Govt. Code section 11500 et seq., which generally
applies to all state agencies.  Pursuant
to APA procedure, a petition for writ of mandate must be filed within 30 days
after the last date on which reconsideration by the administrative agency can
be ordered.  Govt. Code §11523.  The
power to order a reconsideration shall expire 30 days “after the delivery or
mailing of a decision to a respondent, or on the date set by the agency itself
as the effective date of the decision if that date occurs prior to the
expiration of the 30-day period….”  Govt.
Code §11521(a).  
On November 22, 2022, CalPERS sent
Levine the Final Decision and a letter via certified mail and electronic mail.  Dem. RJN Ex. 1.  The Final Decision stated that
it would become effective 30 days after it was mailed.   RJN, Ex. 1, p. 3; Govt. Code §11523.  There is no
allegation or evidence that Petitioners sought reconsideration of the Final
Decision.  The Petition was filed on June
23, 2023 and CalPERS contends that it was untimely.  Dem. at 7-8.
Petitioners cite
CCP section 1094.6(b), which requires administrative mandamus to be filed no
later than 90 days after the decision becomes final.  If there is a provision for written findings,
the decision is final on the date it is mailed by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, including a copy of the affidavit or certificate of mailing, to the
party seeking the writ.  CCP
§1094.6(b).  
Petitioners rely
on Herman v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, (“Herman”)
(1999) 71 Cal. App. 4th 819, which held that mailed notice to a party’s lawyer
does not suffice to trigger the 90-day limitations period in CCP section
1094.6.  In Herman, the MTA fired
Herman, who was a police force lieutenant. 
Id. at 822.  After an
administrative hearing, the MTA rejected an arbitrator’s recommendation and
still fired Herman.  Id.  The MTA sent notice of this decision to the
attorney who represented Herman at the administrative hearing.  Id. 
Herman submitted a declaration stating that he did not know who would
represent him in his mandamus proceeding until two months after MTA sent the
notice.  Id. at 827.  The appellate court held that notice to the
lawyer was insufficient to begin the CCP section 1094.6 90-day limitations
clock because CCP section 1094.6(b) expressly requires service by first-class
mail “to the party seeking the writ.” Id.  at 825-26. 
It is true that CCP section 1010 provides that notice may be served upon
“the party or attorney”, meaning that service on the attorney effects service
on the party.  Id.  at 827. 
However, CCP section 1010 applies only to pending actions and no action was
pending when the final administrative decision is served.  Id. 
Nor do principles of agency apply to impute knowledge to Herman because
CCP section 1094.6(f) provides that notice must be given to the party, which defined
in pertinent part as the employee who has been suspended or dismissed.  Id. 
at 828.  If the Legislature wanted
notice to be made to a party or his attorney, it could have said so as it did
in CCP section 1010 governing notice in civil actions.  Id.
            As
CalPERS correctly replies (Reply at 2), CCP section 1094.6 applies only to local
agencies and CalPERS is a state agency. 
Govt. Code §20002.  While the City is a
local agency and the City’s 2011 MOU and 2012 amended CalPERS contract are at
issue, it is the Board’s administrative decision that is at issue.  CCP section 1094.6 does not apply to that
decision; Govt. Code section 11523 does. 

In dictum, Herman
discussed the APA, noting that it requires notice to the party or person
affected for a notice of intent to revoke, suspend, or condition a right,
license, or privilege (Govt. Code §11500(b), (c)), §11505(a), (c), §11518, and make
the decision effective only after such notice (Govt. Code §11519).  71 Cal. App. 4th at 828-29.  Several cases hold that mailed notice to the
party under these provisions satisfies the notice provision and that personal
notice is not necessary.  Id.  These cases do not address whether service on
an attorney suffices for notice, but they suggest that these APA statutes,
which have similar notice sections to CCP section 1094.6, require mailed notice
to the party and imply that notice to a party’s lawyer would not suffice.  Id. 
 
The limitations
statute at issue in this case is Govt. Code section 11523, which requires that
a petition be filed within 30 days after the last day reconsideration can be
ordered.  The power to order a reconsideration
expires 30 days “after the delivery or mailing of a decision to a respondent,
or on the date set by the agency itself as the effective date of the decision
if that date occurs prior to the expiration of the 30-day period….”  This language is similar to the language in
CCP section 1094.6(b) and, although Herman is not controlling, its
reasoning is persuasive.  Thus, the
30-day statute of limitations in Govt. Code section did not begin until
Petitioners -- not their lawyer -- were served by the Board.  There is no evidence that the Board mailed
the Final Decision to Petitioners and not just their lawyer.
            CalPERS
provides evidence that Petitioners had notice of the Final Decision.  On October 6, 2022, Petitioners filed
an opposition to the City’s ex parte application to continue the
trial date in POA.  Reply RJN Ex.
A.  In their opposition, Petitioners
acknowledged that they received notice of the Proposed Decision on September
12, 2022.  Reply RJN Ex. A, p. 2.  On March 22, 2023, Petitioners
filed an opposition to the City’s motion for summary judgment in POA.  Reply RJN Ex. B.  In it, they acknowledged that CalPERS had adopted
the Proposed Decision as its Final Decision on November 16, 2022.  Reply RJN Ex. B, p. 8.  
            These facts show that Petitioners’
counsel knew, by March 22, 2023 at the latest, that CalPERS had issued the
Final Decision.  As Herman
acknowledged, an attorney’s knowledge of notice is irrebuttable constructive
notice to the client.  71 Cal. App. 4th at 839. 
Therefore, Petitioners had constructive notice of the Final Decision no
later than March 22, 2023.
            Does this constructive
notice trigger the Govt. Code section 11523 30-day statute of limitations or
would a more general limitations period such as CCP section 338 (three or four
years) apply?  In other words, was
CalPERS required to mail the Final Decision to Petitioners themselves in order
to benefit from Govt. Code section 11523’s short 30-day limitations period?  Herman thought so for purposes of CCP
section 1094.6, and the court sees no reason to think differently for Govt.
Code section 11523.  CalPERS has not
shown that the statute of limitations passed. 

 
            2.
Indispensable Party
            CCP
section 389 governs joinder of parties, and there are two types of parties to
be joined: “necessary” and “indispensable”. 
CCP section 389(a) sets forth the requirements for determining a
necessary party: “A person who is subject to service of process and whose
joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of
the action shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in his absence
complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties or (2) he claims
an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the
disposition of the action in his absence may (i) as a practical matter impair
or impeded his ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the person
already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or
otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed interest.”
            A
party found “necessary” pursuant to subdivision (a) may then be found
“indispensable” pursuant to subdivision (b). 
County of Imperial v. Superior Court, (“Imperial”) (2007)
152 Cal.App.4th 13, 26.  A determination
that a party is necessary is the predicate for a determination of whether the
party is indispensable.  Deltakeeper
v. Oakdale Irrigation Dist., (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 1092, 1100.  CCP section 389(b) provides: “If a person as
described in paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a) cannot be made a party,
the court shall determine whether in equity and good conscience the action
should proceed among the parties before it, or should be dismissed without
prejudice, the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable.  The factors to be considered by the court
include: (1) to what extent a judgment rendered in the person’s absence might
be prejudicial to him or those already parties; (2) the extent to which, by
protective provisions in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, or other
measures, the prejudice can be lessened or avoided; (3) whether a judgment
rendered in the person’s absence will be adequate; (4) whether the plaintiff or
cross-complainant will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for
nonjoinder.”
            A
necessary party is regarded as indispensable if the court determines, in equity
and good conscience, that the action must be dismissed in the party’s absence
in light of, inter alia, whether a
judgment rendered in the party’s absence will be adequate.  TG Oceanside, L.P. v. City of Oceanside,
(2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1365-66. 
The controlling test for whether a necessary party is also indispensable
is whether “the plaintiff seeks some type of affirmative relief which, if
granted, would injure or affect the interest of a third person not joined.  Save Our Bay v. San Diego United Port
District, (“Save Our Bay”) (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 686, 692.  In other words, a third party is
indispensable if his or her rights must necessarily be affected by the
judgment.  Id.  Each of the four factors in subdivision (b)
must be considered, but “no factor is determinative or necessarily more
persuasive than another.”  Imperial,
supra, 152 Cal.App. 4th at 35.  
            A
failure to join an indispensable party is not a jurisdictional defect in the
fundamental sense of jurisdiction.  The
court has the power to render a decision as to the parties before it in the
absence of an indispensable party.  It is
for reasons of equity and convenience only that a court will not proceed with a
case where it determines that an indispensable party is absent and cannot be
joined.  Save Our Bay, supra,
42 Cal.App.4th at 693.  
            CalPERS
notes that Petitioners are employees of the City, which was a respondent in the
underlying administrative proceeding. 
The Final Decision states that CalPERS properly interpreted the City’s
2012 contract amendment with CalPERS to be consistent with the 2011 MOU.  CalPERS has no authority to compel the City
to report a different formula or to pay benefits on a different formula than in
the 2012 contract amendment.  Even under
the Board’s plenary authority, it has no duty to command its employer participants
to comply with a requirement.  Pomona
Police Officers’ Association v. City of Pomona¸ (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th
578, 589-90.  Petitioners have not named
the City as a Respondent, and they have refused a request to join it.  Kaur Decl., ¶3.  CalPERS contends that the City must be
included because an order that Petitioners would be entitled to a higher
pension formula pursuant to the 2011 MOU will require the City to pay
additional funds towards Petitioners’ pension benefits.  Dem. at 9-10.
            Petitioners assert that CalPERS has
the authority to review the 2011 MOU evaluate the 2012 contract amendment’s
consistency with it.  It has the
authority to change Petitioners’ retirement category to the 3% at 50 retirement
formula to reflect the 2011 MOU.  CalPERS
has a fiduciary duty to Petitioners and a mandamus ruling in their favor would
not require the City to make any change in its financial contributions to
CalPERS.  Opp. at 10-11.  
CalPERS replies that it has a fiduciary, but that does
not make it an insurer of the promises made by public employers to their
employees.  Petitioners also fail to show
why a ruling in their favor would not require the City to fund Petitioners’
higher retirement benefits.  Reply at
4-5. 
As the statute of limitations has
not passed, the court need not decide whether the City is indispensable such
that the case cannot go forward without it. 
With respect to necessary party, the court agrees that the City should
be joined.  This case does not just involve
an increased retirement benefit for Petitioners based on their proper
classification; it involves the proper interpretation of the City’s 2011 MOU
with the POA.  The Final Decision clarified
that the Board’s authority under PERL allows it to determine if the City had
made a mistake in interpreting the 2011 MOU with respect to a member’s
retirement and in entering into the 2012 CalPERS contract amendment.  Dem. RJN Ex. 1, p. 22.  The City was the respondent in the
underlying administrative proceeding (Dem. RJN Ex. 1, pp. 4-5) and its counsel
appeared at the hearing.  Dem. RJN Ex. 1,
p. 5.  Whether
the City made a mistake is an issue for which the City claims an
interest and the disposition of which in its absence may impair or impede its ability
to protect that interest.  See CCP
§389(a).  This is true whether or not the
City would be required to increase its contributions to CalPERS as a result of
Petitioners’ claim.  The City should have
the opportunity to defend its interpretation of the 2011 MOU and 2012 contract
amendment in this mandamus case. 
 
            D. Conclusion
            The
demurrer to the Petition is overruled on the statute of limitations and sustained
with respect to joinder.  Petitioners
have 20 days’ leave to amend to add the City as a party.
