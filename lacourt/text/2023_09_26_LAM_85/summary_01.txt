  - "The burden of demonstrating that exemptions apply lies with the governmental entity."
  - "The court need not decide whether an inmate making a CPRA request to the prosecution or law enforcement must instead seek post-conviction discovery pursuant to Penal Code section 1054.9 because the DA does not show that the requested information – records which show whether DDA Laesecke worked on any case with SSB employees Higashi or Lepisto – is material the prosecution should have provided or would have been obligated to provide upon request, in Denham's criminal case."
  - "Whether they should be provided upon request by the defense is a closer question, but the DA has the burden of showing that to be true and has not met that burden."
