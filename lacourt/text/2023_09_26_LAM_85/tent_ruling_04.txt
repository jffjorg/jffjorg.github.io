            [1] Petitioners
failed to
lodge a courtesy copy of the opposition, and CalPERS failed in the
same manner for its reply, in violation of the Presiding Judge’s First Amended
General Order Re: Mandatory Electronic Filing.  Both counsel are
admonished to provide courtesy copies in all future filings.


            [2] In its
moving papers, CalPERS requests judicial notice of (1) the Final Decision dated
November 22, 2022 (Dem. RJN Ex. 1); and (2) Petitioners’ argument against the
Proposed Decision, filed October 19, 2022 (Dem. RJN Ex. 2).  Request No. 1 is granted.  Evid. Code §452(c).  Request No. 2 is denied because the parties’ filings
in an administrative case are not official acts of the agency unless there is
an administrative record.  
            Petitioners seek judicial notice of (1) Petitioners’
request for judicial notice in Beverly Hills Police Officer’s Association,
et al v. City of Beverly Hills et al., (“POA”), Case No. 19STCV34358,
filed on September 20, 2021 (Opp. RJN Ex. 1); (2) this court’s tentative
decision decision in POA dated December 17, 2020 (Opp. RJN Ex. 2); and (3)
the second amended petition in POA dated February 24, 2020 (Opp. RJN Ex.
3).  While these exhibits otherwise would
be subject to judicial notice under Evid. Code section 452(d), they must also
be relevant.  Petitioners rely on their
request for judicial notice and second amended petition in POA not to
show that they were filed, but for the truth of their contents.  See Opp. at 6.  This is improper.  The requests to judicially notice Opp. RJN
Exs. 1 and 3 are denied as irrelevant. 
The request to judicially notice Opp. RHN Ex. 2 is granted.  Evid. Code §452(d).
            In reply, CalPERS requests judicial notice of (1) Petitioners’
opposition to the City’s ex parte application to continue the trial date
in POA dated October 6, 2022 (Reply RJN Ex. A) and (2) Petitioners’
opposition to the City’s motion for summary judgment in POA dated March
22, 2023 (Reply RJN Ex. B).  The requests
are granted.  Evid. Code §452(d).  The existence of these filings is judicially
noticed.
