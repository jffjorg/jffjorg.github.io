**Hearing Date:** May 6, 2024
**Dept:** 32

**Tentative Ruling:**

**I. Introduction**

The court has conducted a review of the pleadings, evidence, and motions filed in this case. The court's tentative ruling sets forth its conclusions regarding the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants, Century Housing Corporation and Century Villages at Cabrillo, Inc.

**II. Background**

On May 3, 2022, plaintiffs Anaiya Smith, Jenell Nelson, and Jenine Nelson-Piggott filed the operative first amended complaint against defendants, alleging a wrongful death action based on negligence and premises liability.

**III. Privette Doctrine**

The defendants argue that the Privette doctrine bars liability. The court finds that there is a triable issue of fact regarding the delegation of responsibility to the independent contractor. The court also finds that there is a triable issue of fact regarding the retained control exception under Hooker.

**IV. Criminal Conduct of Third Parties**

The defendants argue that there is no evidence of foreseeability of the risk. The court finds that there is a triable issue of fact regarding the foreseeability of the risk and the duty to take reasonable steps to prevent criminal acts.

**V. Evidence of Dangerous Condition**

The court finds that there is a triable issue of fact regarding the dangerous condition of the guard shack. The court also finds that there is a triable issue of fact regarding the notice of the dangerous condition.

**VI. Conclusion**

The court's tentative ruling sets forth its conclusions regarding the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants. The court finds that there are triable issues of fact regarding the Privette doctrine, criminal conduct of third parties, and evidence of dangerous condition. The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further arguments and evidence presented during the hearing.

**Significant Statements:**

* The Privette doctrine presumptively delegates responsibility to the independent contractor.
* The court must consider what inferences favoring the opposing party a factfinder could reasonably draw from the evidence.
* A hirer's passive conduct in allowing a dangerous condition to exist does not satisfy the exception under Hooker.
* The court must weigh the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.
