And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling denies Defendant's motion to continue trial and all related deadlines. Defendant requested the continuance due to the proximity of the trial date and the need for additional time to prepare for trial. However, the Court finds no good cause for the continuance at this time. The Court notes that Defendant has not yet filed its summary judgment motion and has reserved a hearing date for February 20, 2025. The Court also denies Plaintiff's request that Defendant submit a prehearing separate statement of undisputed material facts before filing its summary judgment motion.
