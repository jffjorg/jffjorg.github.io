[1] Plaintiffs
contend that Defendants may not rely on the FAC to support the fact that they
owned or controlled the Premises. (See Opp., 14–15.) However, this argument
appears irrelevant since ownership is a required element for premises liability—without
which Plaintiffs could not recover. Since Defendants do not appear to contest
this element, the Court will not address Plaintiffs’ assertion that it is a
legal conclusion within the FAC and may not be used as supporting evidence in a
summary judgment motion. 


[2] Penal
Code section 192(c)(1) states: “Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human
being without malice. It is of three kinds: . . . Vehicular-- (1) Except as
provided in subdivision (a) of Section 191.5, driving a vehicle in the
commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to a felony, and with gross
negligence; or driving a vehicle in the commission of a lawful act which might
produce death, in an unlawful manner, and with gross negligence.”
