And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the relevance of the FAC (Facility) in supporting the fact that the defendants owned or controlled the premises. The plaintiffs argue that the defendants may not rely on the FAC, but the court finds this argument irrelevant since ownership is a required element for premises liability. The court will not address the plaintiffs' assertion that the FAC is a legal conclusion and may not be used as supporting evidence in a summary judgment motion. The ruling also references Penal Code section 192(c)(1), which defines manslaughter, and Penal Code section 191.5, which is relevant to the case.
