And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel the deposition of Exel, Inc.'s person most knowledgeable (PMK) and a request for monetary sanctions. The Plaintiff, Natividad Sandoval, filed a complaint against several defendants, including Exel, Inc., stemming from a motor vehicle accident. After multiple attempts to schedule the deposition, the Defendant failed to appear, and the Plaintiff moved to compel the deposition. The Court grants the motion and orders the Defendant to produce its PMK for deposition within 10 days. The Court also awards the Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,359.95.
