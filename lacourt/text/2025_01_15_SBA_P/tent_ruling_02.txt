 Case Number:  24TRCV02378    Hearing Date:   January 15, 2025    Dept:  P Motion to SealMoving Party: Plaintiff Janna Pharmacy, LLCResponding Party: NoneRULINGThe court considered the moving papers. The court continues this motion so that Plaintiff may file an accompanying declaration.PROCEDURAL BACKGROUNDOn July 17, 2024, Plaintiff Janna Pharmacy d/b/a Apotheco (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Minh Tri Van Nguyen (“Nguyen”); Envy Pharmacy (“Envy”); MTN Pharmacists (“MTN”); Tien Minh Vo (“Vo”); and DOES 1-100, inclusive (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage; (3) Conversion; (4) Misappropriation of Trade Secrets; (5) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (6) Unfair Competition; and (7) Declaratory Relief.On September 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”) against the same Defendants, alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage; (3) Conversion; (4) Misappropriation of Trade Secrets; (5) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (6) Violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030(A); (7) Violations of the Unauthorized Access to Computers Act, Cal. Penal Code § 502(C); (8) Unfair Competition; and (9) Declaratory Relief.On November 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to seal. As of January 7, no opposition has been filed.FACTUAL BACKGROUNDPlaintiff seeks to seal portions of Exhibit B of the Declaration of Jonathon Tang and Exhibits E-H of the Declaration of the Michael Newborn, as they contain protected health information of Plaintiff’s clients. (Motion, p. 1, lines 2-6.)LEGAL STANDARDA party that requests that a record or portion of a record be filed under seal must file a motion or an application for an order sealing it. The motion must be accompanied by a supporting memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify the sealing. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(1); Savaglio v Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 588, 597-601.) All parties that have appeared in the case must be served with a copy of the motion or application. Unless the judge orders otherwise, a party that already possesses copies of the records to be sealed must be served with a complete, unredacted version of all papers as well as a redacted version. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(2).)Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d), a judge may order that a record be filed under seal only if the judge expressly finds facts that establish all the following:(1) There exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record;(2) The overriding interest supports sealing the record;(3) A substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed;(4) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and(5) No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.In ruling on a motion to seal, the court must weigh the competing interests and concerns. This process necessitates (1) identifying the specific information claimed to be entitled to protection from public disclosure, (2) identifying the nature of the harm threatened by disclosure, and (3) identifying and accounting for countervailing considerations. (H.B. Fuller Co. v. Doe (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 879, 894.) Therefore, in order to prevail on his motion, the moving party must present a specific enumeration of the facts sought to be withheld and the specific reasons for withholding them. (Id. at 904.)The California Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment provides “a right of access to ordinary civil trial and proceedings.” (NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1212.) The court further noted its belief that “the public has an interest, in all civil cases, in observing and assessing the performance of its public judicial system.” (Id. at 1210.) There is a presumption of openness in civil court proceedings. (Id. at 1217.) This presumption may apply to seemingly private proceedings. (In re Marriage of Burkle (2006) 135 Cal. App.4th 1045, 1052 [divorce proceedings].)Before ordering filed documents sealed, courts must find compelling reasons, prejudice absent sealing and the lack of less-restrictive means. (NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc., supra, 20 Cal.4th at 1208–1209 n. 25; Hurvitz v. Hoefflin (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1232, 1246; Champion v. Sup. Ct. (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 777, 787.) A proposed sealing must be narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest, such as by sealing portions of pleadings or redacting particular text. (Burkle, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th at 1052, 1070.) An application to seal must be accompanied by a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify sealing. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(1).)DISCUSSIONPlaintiff argues that there is good cause to grant the motion, as their patients’ right to privacy outweighs the public right of access to the record. (See John B. v. Superior Court (Bridget B.) (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1177, 1198.) Further, the motion is narrowly tailored as it only seeks to seal certain exhibits which contain the HIPAA-protected information. Accordingly, no less restrictive means can achieve the overriding interest of protecting patients’ privacy.The court agrees that there is an overriding interest in protecting the health information of Plaintiff’s patients, as they are likely to be prejudiced if their private information is made public. As the motion only seeks to seal certain exhibits, it is narrowly tailored and no less restrictive means exists.As to Exhibit B, it is not apparent to the court what is confidential and the basis for that claim of confidentiality.Regardless, the court cannot grant the motion as it is procedurally deficient. Rule 2.551(b)(1) states that a motion to seal must be accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify the sealing. Here, Plaintiff submitted a memorandum but not a declaration.Accordingly, the court CONTINUES the hearing on the motion so that Plaintiff may file the required declaration.CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, the court CONTINUES the hearing on the motion so that Plaintiff may correct the procedural deficiencies of the motion.
