ACTION
(Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600; Cal. Rules of Court 7.950)
 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING:
 
Minor Plaintiff Benyamin Hendeles (“Minor
Plaintiff”), by and through their Guardian Ad Litem Avraham Hendeles
(“Petitioner”), filed the instant action for personal injuries against
Defendant John Doe (“Defendant”) on February 8, 2023. On June 12, 2024,
Petitioner filed an Expedited Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action
(“the Expedited Petition”) on behalf of minor Plaintiff. Following review, the
Court denied the Expedited Petition for failing to attach a copy of a doctor’s report
of Minor Plaintiff’s injuries or a prognosis of their recovery. (Minute Order,
06/24/24.) The Court ordered Petitioner to file an amended petition. (Ibid.)
Petitioner filed an Amended Petition on August 9, 2024. No response has been
filed to date. 
 
Court
approval is required for all settlements
of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) “‘[W]ithout trial court approval
of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid.
[Citation.]  [¶] Nor is the settlement
binding [on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson
v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.) A minor, like
Claimant, “shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by
a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is
pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372, subd.
(a)(1).) Alternatively, the petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating
that they have a right to compromise the minor’s claim under Cal. Probate Code
section 3500. 
 
Having
reviewed the instant Amended Petition for Minor Plaintiff, the Court finds it
is complete and provides for a reasonable settlement based on the injuries
sustained and future prognosis. Proposed orders with respect to the Amended
Petition on behalf of minor Plaintiff were previously filed. 
 
 
 
Conclusion
 
The Amended Petition to Approve
Compromise of Disputed Claim on behalf of Minor Plaintiff Benyamin Hendeles is GRANTED
