REQUEST
FOR SANCTIONS
(CCP
§ 2033.280)
TENTATIVE RULING:

Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF
HASSAN AMINGHAZAEI IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $592.50 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL

ANALYSIS:
 
On September 18, 2023, Defendant Discover Bank (“Defendant”)
served Requests for Admissions on Plaintiff Hassan Aminghazaei (“Plaintiff”). (Motion, Armstrong Decl., Exh. 1.) To date,
Defendant has not served verified responses to the Requests for Admission. (Id.
at ¶3.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Deem Requests for Admission
Admitted (“the Motion”) on January 2, 2024. The Motion initially came for
hearing on June 25, 2024 and was continued for proper notice. (Minute Order,
06/25/24.) No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Due to Plaintiff’s failure to timely serve verified responses and resultant
waiver of objections, Defendant is entitled to an order deeming the Requests
for Admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
The Court is required to award sanctions under the moving
statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) While properly noticed, the
sanctions sought are excessive. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
granted against Defendant Davis in the amount of $592.50 based on 1.5 hours of
attorney time billed at $395.00 per hour. (Motion, Armstrong Decl., ¶6.)
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Discover Bank’s Motion to Deem Requests for
Admission Admitted and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF HASSAN
AMINGHAZAEI IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $592.50 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL WITHIN 20
DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
