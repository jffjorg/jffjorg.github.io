ANALYSIS:
 
On January 23, 2024, Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of
the Automobile Club (“Plaintiff”) served Requests for Admissions on Defendants Jose Gabriel Montoya, Jr. (“Defendant
Montoya, Jr.”) and Martha Rocha (“Defendant Rocha”). (Motions, Tapper Decl., Exh. A.) Despite a meet and confer effort,
to date, Defendants Montoya, Jr. and Rocha have not served verified responses
to the Requests for Admission. (Id. at ¶3 and Exh. B.) Plaintiff filed
the instant (1) Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted Served on
Defendant Jose Gabriel Montoya, Jr. and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion
to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted Served on Defendant Martha Rocha and
Request for Sanctions, on June 17, 2024. No oppositions have been filed to
date. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Due to Defendant Montoya, Jr.’s and
Defendant Rocha’s failure to timely serve verified responses and
resultant waiver of objections, Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the
Requests for Admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
The Court is required to award sanctions under the moving
statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) While properly noticed, the
sanctions sought are excessive. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
granted against Defendant Montoya, Jr.
and Defendant Rocha each in the amount of $265.00 based on one hour of
attorney time billed at $225.00 per hour, plus the $40.00 filing fee. (Motions,
Tapper Decl., ¶4.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange
of the Automobile Club’s (1) Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted Served
on Defendant Jose Gabriel Montoya, Jr. and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion
to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted Served on Defendant Martha Rocha and
Request for Sanctions, are GRANTED. DEFENDANTS JOSE GABRIEL MONTOYA, JR. AND
MARTHA ROCHA ARE EACH ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $265.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S
COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
