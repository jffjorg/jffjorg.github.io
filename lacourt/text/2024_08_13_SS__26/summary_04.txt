And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint is denied. The plaintiff, Doo H. Moon, filed the complaint on September 27, 2023, alleging breach of lease agreement. The defendant, Joseph Sguigna, failed to file a responsive pleading, resulting in default judgment being entered on December 6, 2023. The defendant later filed a motion to vacate default and default judgment, which was granted. The defendant then filed a motion to strike, which was denied. The defendant's current motion to dismiss is based on a general denial and lacks sufficient legal authority. The judge notes that the defendant failed to provide a memorandum as required by court rules, which is an admission that the request is without merit and cause for its denial. The trial is set for February 25, 2025, at 8:30 am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
