And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to deem the requests for admission admitted and to award sanctions. The plaintiff, Hassan Aminghazaei, has failed to timely serve verified responses to the requests for admission, which waived any objections he may have had. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to pay sanctions of $592.50 to the defense counsel, Armstrong, within 20 days of service of this order. The judge has also noted that the sanctions sought by the defendant are excessive, but has awarded the amount of $592.50 based on a lodestar calculation.
