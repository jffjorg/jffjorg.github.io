Moon v. Sguigna, et al.MOTION TO DISMISSTENTATIVE RULING: 
 
Defendant Joseph Sguigna’s Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.
 
TRIAL IS SET FOR FEBRUARY 25, 2025 AT 8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT

ANALYSIS:
 
On September 27, 2023, Plaintiff Doo H. Moon (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for breach of lease agreement against Defendant Joseph
Sguigna (“Defendant”). Following Defendant’s failure to file a responsive
pleading, the Court entered their default on November 27, 2023. Default
judgment was entered on December 6, 2023. On March 19, 2024, the Court granted
Defendant’s Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment and ordered Defendant
to file and serve the proposed Motion to Strike. (Minute Order, 03/19/24.)
 
The Court denied the Motion to Strike Portions of the
Complaint on May 21, 2024. (Minute Order, 05/21/24.) Defendant now brings the
instant Motion to Dismiss, filed on June 10, 2024. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on July 8, 2024.
 
Discussion
Defendant’s moving papers do
not provide the Court with a sufficient legal basis or relevant authority to
dismiss the Complaint. They merely request dismissal and attach a copy of
Defendant’s general denial.  Code of
Civil Procedure section 1010 specifically provides that the notice of a motion
“must state … the grounds upon which it will be made, and the papers, if any,
upon which it is to be based. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.) Additionally, Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(a) provides that a notice of motion, “must state in
the opening paragraph the nature of the order being sought and the grounds for
issuance of the order.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(a).) Defendant’s
papers cite no legal authority that gives the Court the authority to dismiss
the Complaint.
Furthermore, “[t]he memorandum
must contain a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and
arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks
cited in support of the position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1113(b).) Indeed, Defendant’s failure to provide a memorandum as required by
the Rule is an “admission that the [request] is without merit and cause for its
denial.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(a), (b); In re Marriage of
Falcone & Fyke (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 964, 976.)
 
Finally, the Court notes that
Defendant was ordered by this Court to file and serve their answer to the
Complaint within 20 days of the ruling denying the Motion to Strike on May 21,
2024. (Minute Order, 05/21/24.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Joseph Sguigna’s Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.
 
TRIAL IS SET FOR FEBRUARY 25, 2025 AT 8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT
