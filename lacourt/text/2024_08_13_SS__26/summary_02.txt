And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the amended petition to approve a compromise of the disputed claim on behalf of minor plaintiff Benyamin Hendeles. The petition is complete and provides for a reasonable settlement based on the injuries sustained and future prognosis. The court has approved the amended petition and will give notice to the court clerk. The court's approval is required for all settlements of a minor's claim, and the settlement cannot be valid without it.
