Summary:

The judge is considering an application for determination of good faith settlement between the City of Santa Monica and the Plaintiff. The City settled with the Plaintiff for $95,000, but the Defendants, Lily Sellers and Dylan Sellers, oppose the application, arguing that the settlement is not in good faith. The City contends that the settlement is reasonable and that the Plaintiff's damages are uncertain at this time. The judge must determine whether the settlement is in good faith and whether the City's liability is proportionate to the settlement amount. The judge will consider the following factors: (1) the rough approximation of the Plaintiff's total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, (2) the amount paid in settlement, (3) the allocation of settlement proceeds among defendants, (4) the recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than they would if found liable after trial, (5) the financial condition of the settling party, and (6) the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of the non-settling defendants.
