And here is a summary of the judicial tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a petition filed by Giana Guzman (GMA) to withdraw funds from a blocked account. The petition was filed on October 21, 2024, and an amended petition was filed on October 24, 2024. The Court notes that the petition does not comply with the California Rules of Court, rule 7.954(a), which requires that a petition for the withdrawal of funds deposited for a minor or person with a disability must be verified and include specific information. The Court finds that GMA is no longer a minor and that the petition should be completed correctly, including verifying the information. As a result, the Court denies the petition without prejudice.
