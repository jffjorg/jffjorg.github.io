  CASE NO.:  BC690624
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
PETITION TO WITHDRAW FUNDS FROM BLOCKED
  ACCOUNT
 
 
Date: November 15, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
 
BACKGROUND
             Plaintiffs filed a complaint against
Defendants arising from alleged substandard living conditions in an apartment
building in which Plaintiffs resided. 
 
An
Order Approving Compromise of Pending Action involving a minor claimant, Giana
Guzman was entered on December 19, 2019. 
The settlement reserved for Giana Guzman in the amount of $3,641.14 was
placed in a blocked account (the “Account”). 

 
On
October 21, 2024, Giana Guzman filed a Petition to Withdraw Funds from Blocked
Account, and filed an Amended Petition on October 24, 2024 (the “Petition”). 
 
DISCUSSION
Under California Rules of Court, rule
7.954(a), a petition for the withdrawal of funds deposited for a minor or
person with a disability must be verified and must include the identity of the
depository, a showing of the amounts previously withdrawn, a statement of the
balance on the deposit at the time of the filing of the petition, and a
justification for the withdrawal. 
 
            Initially, the Court notes that although
the Petition indicates that the Petitioner is Gianna Melody Guzman (“GMA”),
paragraph 5 states that “Petitioner brings the petition as the parent of the
person named in paragraph 2.”  If GMA is
filing on her own behalf, which is proper now that she has reached the age of
majority given the date of birth of October 21, 2006 used in the original Order,
then paragraph 5 should have the “Other” box checked with “Self” listed as the
relationship.  In addition, all the
information requested in the top left box should be completed, as well as the
name of the person whose funds are to be withdrawn in paragraph 3 and the
additional information currently left blank. 
Paragraph 4, on the other hand, should be blank, as GMA is no longer a
minor.  Moreover, paragraph 6 (b) (1) and
(2) must be filled in as well as 6(3), 7, 8 and 9.  
 
            For these reasons, the hearing on
the Petition is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Dated this 15th day of November 2024
