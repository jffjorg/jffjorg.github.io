STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
On December 20, 2022, Plaintiff Kandace M. Dudley
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant County of Los Angeles
(“Defendant.”) The compliant alleged seven causes of action based upon
discrimination and retaliation in violation of FEHA as well as a failure to
accommodate. The complaint alleges that Plaintiff was illegally terminated.
During her time working for Defendant, Plaintiff was in treatment for cancer
and requested accommodations. In 2021, Plaintiff was required to go out in the field,
but she requested a transfer to protect her compromised immune system. However,
Defendant failed to implement the accommodation, and Plaintiff has essentially
been constructively terminated. 
 
On March 3, 2023, Defendant filed a Demurrer, with a Motion
to Strike. 
 
On May 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint. 
 
On June 16, 2023, Defendant filed a Motion to Strike.
Plaintiff’s Opposition was filed on September 13, 2023. Defendant’s Reply was
filed on September 19, 2023. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Motion to Strike
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at
any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 436(a).) The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an
order of the court. (Id., § 436(b).)
The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by
way of judicial notice. (Id. § 437.) “When
the defect which justifies striking a complaint is capable of cure, the court
should allow leave to amend.” (Vaccaro v.
Kaiman (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 761, 768.)
 
Meet and Confer: 
 
Prior to filing a demurrer, the
demurring party is required to satisfy their meet and confer obligations
pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. §430.41, and demonstrate that they so satisfied
their meet and confer obligation by submitting a declaration pursuant to Code
of Civ. Proc. §430.41(a)(2) & (3). The Declaration of
Skyla L. Gordon indicates that a meet and confer letter was sent on June 8,
2023, asking that the prayer strike the pre and post judgment interest damages.
Plaintiff did not receive a response and contacted Plaintiff again. Plaintiff
did not provide a response as of the date of filing the Motion. (Dec. Gordon, ¶
8-10.) 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Defendant requests that the Court
strike various portions of the FAC. The specific portions are as follows: 
 
1.      FAC,
at pg. 1, lines 11-13: “Plaintiff brings this action against defendants for
economic, non-economic, compensatory, pre-judgment interest pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 3291…”
2.      FAC,
pg. 5, lines 4-5: “interest on unpaid wages at the legal rate from and after
each payday on which those wages should have been paid, in a sum to be proven
at trial.”
3.      FAC,
at pg. 13, lines 2-3: “For pre-judgment (Cal. Civ. Code § 3288) and post-judgment
(Cal. Civ. Code § 3287) interest on all damages awarded.”
Defendant argues that under Civil
Code §§ 3278, 3288, or 3291, the County is not liable for interest damages.
However, the opposition concedes that Plaintiff does not oppose the Motion to
Strike as to Civil Code § 3291 and 3287. Therefore, the merits of this matter
will only pertain to Civil Code § 3288. 
 
Defendant argues that CCP § 3288
does not allow pre-judgment interest on general damages. Moreover, Defendant
also argues that CCP § 3288 includes language about oppression, fraud, and
malice, but Plaintiff does not allege in the FAC that any County employee acted
with oppression, fraud, or malice. 
 
Plaintiff argues that she is
entitled to prejudgment interest under Civil Code § 3288 based on economic
damages. 
 
Civil Code § 3288 states: “In an
action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, and in every
case of oppression, fraud, or malice, interest may be given, in the discretion
of the jury.” 
 
            The Court
finds that both parties agree that the portions of the FAC which concern Civil
Code § 3291 and § 3287. As for the Civil Code § 3288, the Court finds that
Defendant is correct in their argument. Under Civil Code § 3288, a party is
entitled pre-judgment interest on the economic damages. The California Supreme
Court stated in Greater Westchester
Homeowners Association stated the
following: 
 
We have recently affirmed that,
unlike Civil Code section 3287, which relates to liquidated and contractual
claims, section 3288 permits discretionary prejudgment interest for
unliquidated tort claims…The award of such interest represents the accretion of
wealth which money or particular property could have produced during a period
of loss. Using recognized and established techniques a fact finder can usually
compute with fair accuracy the interest on a specific sum of money, or on
property subject to specific valuation. Furthermore, the date of loss of the
property is usually ascertainable, thus permitting an accurate interest
computation .[citation omitted] However, damages for the intangible,
noneconomic aspects of mental and emotional injury are of a different nature.
They are inherently nonpecuniary, unliquidated and not readily subject to
precise calculation.
 
(Greater Westchester
Homeowners Assn. v. City of Los Angeles (1979) 26 Cal.3d 86, 102–103.)
 
Thus, looking at the Prayer for Relief, No. 2, the FAC
incorrectly requests pre-judgment interest on “all damages awarded.”
Both parties agree that pre-judgment interest pursuant to CCP § 3288 is
available for economic damages. 
 
            Motion
to Strike is GRANTED, as to all requested sections. 
 
Leave to Amend: 
 
Leave to amend should
be liberally granted if there is a reasonable possibility an amendment could
cure the defect.  (County of Santa Clara v. Superior Court (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 1018,1035.)
 The Plaintiff has the
burden of demonstrating that leave to amend should be granted, and that the
defects can be cured by amendment. (“Plaintiff must show in what manner he can
amend his complaint and how that amendment will change the legal effect of his
pleading.” Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) Here, as the parties both agree that CCP § 3288 allows for
pre-judgment interest as to economic damages, the Court will allow Plaintiff to
amend the FAC to request pre-judgment interest pursuant to CCP § 3288 as to
economic damages only. 
 
Leave to Amend is
GRANTED. 
 
CONCLUSION: 
 
For the foregoing reasons, the Court
decides the pending motion as follows:
 
            Motion to
Strike is GRANTED, with leave to amend within 10 days of service of this order.

 
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
