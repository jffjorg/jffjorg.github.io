And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a Motion to Strike filed by the Defendant, County of Los Angeles, against the Plaintiff, Kandace M. Dudley. The Motion seeks to strike certain portions of the First Amended Complaint, which alleges discrimination and retaliation against the County. The Plaintiff has requested pre-judgment and post-judgment interest on damages, including economic and non-economic damages. The Defendant argues that the County is not liable for interest damages under Civil Code § 3288, which allows for pre-judgment interest on economic damages. The Court finds that the Defendant is correct in its argument and grants the Motion to Strike as to the requested sections. However, the Court also grants leave to amend the complaint to request pre-judgment interest on economic damages only.
