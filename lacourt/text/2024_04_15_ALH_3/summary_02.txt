Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge sustains the demurrer and enters a judgment of dismissal. The judge sets a status conference for October 15, 2024, to review the status of the appeal. The judge orders that the parties submit a joint statement to the court regarding the status of the appeal. The judge continues the hearing for six months.
