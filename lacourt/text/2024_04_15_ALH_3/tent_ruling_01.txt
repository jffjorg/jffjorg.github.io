[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS AGAINST
  PLAINTIFF

 
Dept.

On October
27, 2022, plaintiff Ray Gomez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendant
Benjamin Pena (“Defendant”) arising from a motor vehicle collision that
occurred on November 12, 2021. On January 29, 30, and 31, 2024, the Court
ordered Plaintiff to serve initial discovery responses to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Request for
Production of Documents (Set One) within 20 days and to pay monetary sanctions
(collectively, the “Discovery Orders”). 
On
March 14, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for terminating sanctions on the
grounds that Plaintiff disobeyed the Discovery Orders by failing to serve
responses and pay sanctions as ordered. Defendant requests terminating
sanctions as well as monetary sanctions in the amount of $525. 
Where
a party fails to obey an order compelling answers to discovery, “the court may
make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction,
an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (c), 2023.010, subd. (c); R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) The court should consider the totality
of the circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine if the
actions were willful, the detriment to the propounding party, and the number of
formal and informal attempts to obtain discovery. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) If a lesser
sanction fails to curb abuse, a greater sanction is warranted. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) 
Before
any sanctions may be imposed the court must make an express finding that there
has been a willful failure of the party to serve the required answers. (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los Angeles
County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.) Lack of diligence may be deemed
willful where the party understood its obligation, had the ability to comply,
and failed to comply. (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787; Fred
Howland Co. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d
605, 610-611.) The party who failed to comply with discovery obligations has
the burden of showing that the failure was not willful. (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 788; Cornwall v. Santa
Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500, 605.)

Plaintiff filed no opposition to this motion
and it is undisputed they failed to serve responses to discovery, failed to pay
monetary sanctions, and disobeyed a court order to do so. Defendant served three
notices of ruling on Plaintiff. Therefore, the Court concludes Plaintiff knew
of their discovery obligations, knew of the Court’s Discovery Orders compelling
their compliance, and failed to show their noncompliance was not willful. Given
Plaintiff’s prior failures to comply with discovery obligations, their failure
to oppose this motion, and their apparent disinterest in prosecuting this
action, the Court finds lesser sanctions would not curb the abuse.
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for
terminating sanctions is GRANTED and Plaintiff’s action is hereby dismissed. As
the Court is granting terminating sanctions it declines to also impose monetary
sanctions.
 
Moving party to give notice.

this 15th
day of April, 2024
