And here is the English-text summary:

The Court grants the motion to compel arbitration and stays the action pending arbitration. The Court finds that the arbitration agreements are valid and binding, and that the parties have met their initial burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement. The Court declines to address the parties' respective arguments about the scope of the claims, as the issue of arbitrability is to be determined by the arbitrator. The Court will set a status conference re arbitration and orders the defendants to give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days.
