And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the court grants the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's order granting the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The court finds that the holding in Ochoa v. Ford Motor Company, which rejects the equitable estoppel theory, is more persuasive. The court also notes that the arbitration provision in the sales contract is insufficient to support the manufacturer's equitable estoppel argument. The court denies the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and vacates its previous order.
