  - "Whether a plaintiff may amend the complaint to change a party's description or characterization 'after the statute of limitations has run depends on whether the misdescription or mischaracterization is merely a misnomer or defect in the description or characterization, or whether it is a substitution or entire change of parties." (Hawkins v. Pacific Coast Bldg. Products, Inc.)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a third amended complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add new causes of action to the complaint, which are related to the facts originally pleaded in the action. The court finds that the amendment is timely and will not prejudice the defendant. The court also finds that the relation back doctrine applies, meaning that the amendment will relate back to the original filing of the complaint. The court notes that the defendant's argument that the new causes of action are barred by the statute of limitations is premature and should be raised at the demurrer stage once the new complaint has been filed.
