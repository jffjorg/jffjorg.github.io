And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the City of Los Angeles, which seeks to dismiss the complaint filed by Jose Manuel Gonzalez. The Judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the City of Los Angeles is successful in its bid to dismiss the complaint. The Judge's decision is based on the fact that the City of Los Angeles did not properly meet and confer with Gonzalez, as required by law, and that Gonzalez's complaint does not allege facts sufficient to establish each element of a cause of action for assault or discrimination. The Judge has also noted that the City of Los Angeles is immune from liability under Government Code section 815, subdivision (a), and that Gonzalez has not filed any opposition to the demurrer. As a result, the Judge has denied leave to amend the complaint, meaning that Gonzalez will not be allowed to re-file the complaint.
