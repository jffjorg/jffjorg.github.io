Valdez, et al. v. Isoria, et al.PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING
ACTION
(Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600; Cal. Rules of Court 7.950)
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Minor Plaintiff Israel Cardenas
(“Plaintiff Israel”), by and through their Guardian Ad Litem Jamilet Gonzalez
(“Petitioner”), filed the instant action for personal injuries against
Defendant Prescilla Isoria (“Defendant”) on July 18, 2023. On October 12, 2023,
Petitioner filed the instant Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action (“the
Petition”) on behalf of minor Plaintiff. No opposition has been filed to date.
The court granted Petitioner’s application to be appointed minor Plaintiff
Israel’s Guardian Ad Litem on December 1, 2023. 
 
Court
approval is required for all settlements
of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) “‘[W]ithout trial court approval
of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid.
[Citation.]  [¶] Nor is the settlement
binding [on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson
v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.) A minor, like
Claimant, “shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by
a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is
pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372, subd.
(a)(1).) Alternatively, the petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating
that they have a right to compromise the minor’s claim under Cal. Probate Code
section 3500. 
 
Having
reviewed the instant Petition for minor Plaintiff Israel, the Court finds it is
complete and provides for a reasonable settlement based on the injuries
sustained and future prognosis. Proposed orders with respect to the Petition on
behalf of minor Plaintiff Israel have also been filed. 
 
Conclusion
 
Petitioner Lina Valdez’s Petition
to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim on behalf of minor Plaintiffs Israel
Cardenas is GRANTED.
 
 
 
Moving
party to give notice.
