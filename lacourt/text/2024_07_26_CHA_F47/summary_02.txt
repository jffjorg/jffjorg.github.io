And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) are moot. This is because the plaintiffs have filed requests for dismissal of the entire complaint with respect to the defendant State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection, and another request for dismissal without prejudice as to the defendant California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. As a result, the demurrer and motion to strike are no longer relevant and are placed off calendar. The case is dismissed.
