And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by attorney Safora Nowrouzi to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Kyle A. Perez. The motion was filed on March 22, 2024, and states that the attorney-client relationship has been irreparably compromised due to disagreements over litigation strategy. The plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion on July 19, 2024, admitting that the relationship has deteriorated and claiming that the attorney has not diligently pursued his claims. The plaintiff also implies that he has a claim against the attorney for legal malpractice. Despite this, the plaintiff asks the court to deny the motion and require the attorney to continue representing him, claiming that he will be prejudiced if the attorney is allowed to withdraw. The judge has ruled that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship warrants relieving the attorney as counsel, and that the plaintiff has had sufficient time to retain replacement counsel.
