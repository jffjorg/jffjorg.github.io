LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part: 
“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party
to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party,
or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under
Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it,
or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the
notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and
testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when
the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition
notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent
to inquire about the nonappearance. 
* * *
“(g) (1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. 
“(2) On motion of any other party who, in person or by
attorney, attended at the time and place specified in the deposition notice in
the expectation that the deponent’s testimony would be taken, the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
in favor of that party and against the deponent or the party with whom the
deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (a), (b), (g).) 
DISCUSSION 
A.  
The
complaint 
The complaint alleges that on January 12, 2020, at the
intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and North Western Avenue in Los Angeles, Azor
negligently, carelessly, recklessly, wantonly, and unlawfully drove, operated,
maintained, conducted, controlled and entrusted his vehicle, causing the
vehicle to drive into Plaintiff at high speed, injuring Plaintiff. 
B.   Plaintiff’s motion to compel 
On June 28, 2023, Plaintiff served a notice of taking
the deposition of Lyft’s person most qualified and request for production of
documents, setting the deposition for August 9, 2023.  (Exh. A.) 
On August 3, 2023, Lyft served objections to the deposition
notice and request for production of documents. 
(Exh. B.) 
Plaintiff argues that her counsel has attempted to
meet and confer with Lyft’s counsel but Lyft has not agreed to produce its
person most qualified for deposition or provide responsive documents and has
not provided dates for a deposition. 
Lyft argues that Plaintiff’s motion is moot because,
on March 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed an amended notice of deposition of Lyft’s person
most qualified, superseding the June 28, 2024 deposition notice at issue in
Plaintiff’s motion.  The amended
deposition notice scheduled the deposition for April 15, 2024.  On April 12, 2024, Lyft objected to the
amended deposition notice. 
Plaintiff denies that the motion is moot, arguing that
Lyft relies on legal authority holding that supplemental “pleadings” moot original
pleadings and deposition notices are not “pleadings.” 
In objecting to Plaintiff’s deposition notice, Lyft
stated: “[T]he issue of whether and to what extent Lyft’s Person Most Qualified
deposition will go forward is set to be heard before the court on June 3, 2024.
. . . Plaintiff’s effort to circumvent the June 3, 2024 hearings based on
service of the Amended Notice is improper gamesmanship. To be abundantly clear,
Lyft will not produce any witness for deposition on April 15, 2024, because the
issue of Lyft’s PMQ deposition is stayed pending the outcome of the June 3,
2024 hearings.” 
Based on these objections, the Court finds that Lyft
has waived any argument that Plaintiff’s motion to compel the deposition of its
person most qualified scheduled for June 3, 2024 is moot due to the filing of
an amended deposition notice.  Lyft also argues that the information which Plaintiff
seeks in a deposition of Lyft’s person most qualified is irrelevant because
Lyft cannot be liable based on the actions of a driver (Azor) who was not using
the Lyft app at the time of the accident. 
(Amended Opposition pp. 9-10, citing Marez v. Lyft (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th
569, 585-587 (Marez).)  According
to Lyft “Merez stands for the rule that there is no relationship between
Lyft and the driver so Lyft cannot be liable for the acts of the driver.”  (Amended Opposition p. 9, fn. 6.) 
Marez is distinguishable. 
There, it was “undisputed” that the driver (Gaurano) “had not worked for
Lyft on the day of the accident and had no intention of doing so.”  (Marez, supra, 48 Cal.App.5th
at p. 581.)  Here, by contrast, whether
Azor was working for Lyft – that is, using the Lyft app – at the time of the accident
appears to be a matter in dispute.  The
Court cannot adopt Lyft’s view of the disputed evidence to resolve this motion. 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision
(a), the Court may grant a motion to compel a deposition when the deponent
fails to appear “without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410
. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (a).)  A valid objection is one
that identifies errors and irregularities that prevent a deposition notice from
“comply[ing] with Article 2 (commencing with [Code of Civil Procedure] Section
2025.210) . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.410, subd. (a); see P. Knighten, Cal. Judges Benchbook: Civil Proceedings,
Discovery (Thomson Reuters 2022) § 15.16, pp. 371-372 [listing valid ground for
objecting to deposition subpoena].)  Lyft’s’s
objections do not meet this standard because they do not identify errors or
irregularities that prevent Plaintiff’s deposition notice from complying with
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 to 2025.295. 
The Court concludes that Lyft’s objections did not
justify its failure to produce its person most qualified at the August 9, 2023
deposition.  The Court
grants the motion and orders Lyft to produce its person most qualified
for deposition and produce responsive documents within 30 days of the Court’s
order. 
Sanctions are mandatory under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2025.450, subdivision (g)(1), unless the Court finds that “the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
The Court finds that Lyft did not act with substantial
justification in failing to produce its person most qualified for deposition and produce responsive documents. 
 Plaintiff
requests $3,060.00 in sanctions based on six hours of attorney time at a rate
of $500.00 per hour and one $60.00 filing fee. 
The Court awards $810.00 in sanctions based on three hours of attorney
time at a rate of $250.00 per hour and one filing fee. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff D’cameron Granger’s motion
to compel Defendant Lyft, Inc. to produce its person most qualified for
deposition. The Court orders Defendant Lyft, Inc. to produce its person most
qualified for deposition within 30 days of the Court’s order. 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff D’cameron Granger’s request for sanctions and orders
Defendant Lyft, Inc. and its counsel to pay Plaintiff D’cameron
Granger $810.00 within 30 days of the Court’s order. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
