[Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on  the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior  Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et  seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.)  To  obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner  must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and  must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of  the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.  (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)  DISCUSSION       A.   Katrina Culver  The petition states the following:  Gross settlement amount: $7,131.00 Attorney’s fees: $1,782.75 Total medical expenses: $41,702.76 Negotiated, contractual, and statutory reductions: $40,262.76 Amount of medical expenses paid: $1,440.00  Amount to be paid/reimbursed from proceeds: $1,440.00 Non-medical expenses: $1,098.68 Net settlement amount: $2,809.57  Section  12b(1) of the petition states that the total amount offered to others is  $82,131.00.  However, Section 12b(3)  lists amounts paid to others that total $95,000.00.  Petitioner should modify one or both of the  figures to make them consistent or explain why the figures are different.  Section  14b of the petition lists “Attorney Cost” of $1,098.68.  Petitioner should provide a breakdown of  these costs and supporting documentation.  Based  on Sections 13a(2), 13b(1), 13c(1), and 13g(2), it appears that private  insurance paid $1,440.00 of Katrina Culver’s medical expenses.  However, Petitioner did not fill out Section  13d of the petition, which asks (1) whether the claimant’s health plan is  asking for reimbursement of medical expenses paid under the plan and (2) what amount  the health plan is requesting to satisfy its lien rights.  At pages 754-755 of the 765-page attachment, Petitioner  has provided a November 30, 2022 letter from The Rawlings Company and a chart  listing medical expenses which Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc., paid on  behalf of Katrina Culver.  The chart  shows a “Bill Amount” of $2,731.00, “Benefits Provided” of $1,440.00, and “Remaining  Amount” of $1,440.00.  If appropriate, Petitioner  should include the information contained in the November 30, 2022 letter from  The Rawlings Company and attached chart in Section 13d of the petition.  The  Court denies the petition without prejudice.  B.   Landon CulverThe  petition states the following:  Gross  settlement amount: $20,000.00Attorney’s  fees: $5,000.00Total  medical expenses: $6,082.00Negotiated,  contractual, and statutory reductions: $4,237.00Amount  of medical expenses paid: $1,845.00Amount to  be paid/reimbursed from proceeds: $1,845.00Non-medical  expenses: $1,068.71Net  settlement amount: $12,086.29  Section  14b of the petition lists “Attorney Cost” of $1,068.71.  Petitioner should provide a breakdown of  these costs and supporting documentation.  Based  on Sections 13a(2), 13b(1), 13c(1), and 13g(2), it appears that private  insurance paid $1,845.00 of Landon Culver’s medical expenses.  However, Petitioner did not fill out Section  13d of the petition, which asks (1) whether the claimant’s health plan is  asking for reimbursement of medical expenses paid under the plan and (2) what  amount the health plan is requesting to satisfy its lien rights.  At pages 175-177 of the 187-page attachment,  Petitioner has provided a November 30, 2022 letter from The Rawlings Company  and a chart listing medical expenses which Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc.,  paid on behalf of Landon Culver.  The  chart shows a “Bill Amount” of $4,249.00, “Benefits Provided” of $1,845.00, and  “Remaining Amount” of $1,845.00.  If  appropriate, Petitioner should include the information contained in the  November 30, 2022 letter from The Rawlings Company and attached chart in  Section 13d of the petition.  The  Court denies the petition without prejudice.  CONCLUSION  The Court DENIES without prejudice the petition for  expedited approval of the compromise of Plaintiff Katrina Culver’s action filed  by Petitioner Paul Culver on April 24, 2024.
