And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion to conduct a neuropsychiatric examination of the plaintiff. The defendant had requested the examination, citing the plaintiff's own expert neuropsychiatrist had already examined the plaintiff. The plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that the defendant had improperly designated its expert neuropsychologist after the deadline to exchange expert information had passed. The court found that the plaintiff did not make a formal objection to the defendant's expert by raising the allegedly improper designation in opposition to the defendant's motion. However, the court denied the defendant's motion for leave to conduct the plaintiff's neuropsychiatric examination because the motion did not specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, as well as the identity of the person who would perform the examination.

The court also granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial and reopen discovery. The defendant had requested a continuance to September 2024, citing that the parties were not ready for trial, the defendant's lead counsel had a busy trial schedule, and the defendant's neuropsychiatric expert believed that a defense medical examination was needed to evaluate the nature and extent of the plaintiff's alleged injuries. The court found that there was good cause for the continuance and continued the trial for 30 days or to the next available date. The final status conference, discovery, and related dates will be based on the new trial date.
