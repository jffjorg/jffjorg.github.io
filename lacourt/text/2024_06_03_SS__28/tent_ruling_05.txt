 Case Number:  22STCV10709    Hearing Date:   June 3, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
March 29, 2022, Plaintiff Rayvon Aldridge (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Van Co Loi (“Loi”) and Alounkone Malavong (“Malavong”) for
motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
Although Plaintiff did not list Doe defendants in the caption or in Section
1 of the complaint, Section 6 of the complaint and the Judicial Council form
attachments for Motor Vehicle and General Negligence name Doe defendants 1-25. 
On
June 9, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted service on
Loi of the summons, complaint, and other documents on April 24, 2022. 
On
May 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of publication of the summons and
statement of damages. The statement of damages contained in the proof of
publication sought $100,000.00 in general damages for pain, suffering, and
inconvenience and $11,435.00 in special damages for medical expenses. 
On
July 19, 2023, the clerk entered Loi’s default. 
On
December 11, 2023, the Court dismissed Malavong without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On May
15, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment to be heard on June 3,
2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
Rayvon Aldridge asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant
Van Co Loi and award Plaintiff $212,357.23, consisting of $200,000.00 in
general damages, $11,435.00 in special damages, and $922.23 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
Section 6 of the CIV-100 form does not state the name(s)
and address(es) of the Defendant’s attorney(s) of record or, if none, the
defendant(s) to whom Plaintiff mailed the request for entry of default and does
not state the date of mailing. 
In addition, the CIV-100 form does not include the
signature of a person declaring under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
State of California that items 4, 5, and 6 are true and correct. 
Section 8 of the CIV-100 form is not filled out or
signed. 
Plaintiff’s request for $200,000.00 in general damages
exceeds the amount listed in Plaintiff’s statement of damages ($100,000.00).  Plaintiff has not shown that (1) he served a
subsequent statement of damages listing $200,000.00 or more in general damages
and (2) he then obtained a new default against Loi.  Therefore, the Court cannot grant $200,000.00
in general damages. 
As the Court noted in its March 20, 2024 order, Plaintiff’s
complaint lists Doe defendants on page 2 and in the complaint’s attachments.
The Court cannot enter default judgment unless Plaintiff dismisses the Doe
defendants or applies for a separate judgment against them. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1800(a)(7).)  
The Court denies the application. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES the application for default judgment
filed by Plaintiff Rayvon Aldridge filed on May 15, 2024. 
The Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal
for Failure to Resubmit Default Judgment Packet for 08/05/2024 at 08:30 AM in
Department 28 at Spring Street Courthouse. 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
