And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiff's application for a default judgment against the defendant. The plaintiff seeks damages of $200,000, consisting of $100,000 in special damages and $100,000 in general damages. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support his damages claims. The court notes that the plaintiff has submitted bills and statements from Dr. Doan and Winn, but these are not sufficient to establish a prima facie case for damages. The court therefore denies the application and sets an order to show cause for the plaintiff to resubmit the default judgment packet.
