And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering the plaintiff's request for a default judgment against the defendant Van Co Loi. The plaintiff is seeking $212,357.23 in damages, including $100,000.00 in general damages, $11,435.00 in special damages, and $922.23 in costs. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff's request exceeds the amount listed in the statement of damages. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not shown that he served a subsequent statement of damages listing $200,000.00 or more in general damages and has not obtained a new default against Loi. Therefore, the judge cannot grant $200,000.00 in general damages. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's complaint lists Doe defendants and that the court cannot enter default judgment unless the plaintiff dismisses the Doe defendants or applies for a separate judgment against them. The judge denies the application for default judgment and sets an order to show cause for dismissal for failure to resubmit the default judgment packet.
