And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendants' Motion for Summary Adjudication. The Defendants have moved for summary adjudication against the Plaintiffs on several causes of action, including common law wrongful eviction and breach of contract. The Judge has granted summary adjudication as to the Plaintiffs' second, fifth, and sixth causes of action, but has denied it as to the Plaintiffs' first and eighth causes of action.

Regarding the Plaintiffs' first cause of action for common law wrongful eviction, the Judge finds that the Defendants have not met their burden of showing that the Plaintiffs cannot establish they have vacated their unit. While the Plaintiffs have retained their keys and intend to return to their unit once construction is complete, there is evidence that they were forced to leave the unit due to the construction. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiffs have made a showing of constructive eviction, as the construction on the roof of their unit began in March 2022 and caused dust and debris to fill their unit, which likely contained asbestos.

Regarding the Plaintiffs' eighth cause of action for breach of contract, the Judge finds that the Defendants have not met their burden of showing that they did not breach the lease and construction acknowledgement. The Judge finds that the acknowledgement gave Defendants permission to alter, extend, or change the hours of construction, but that they are restricted to those hours permitted by the City of Marina Del Rey. The Judge also finds that the construction occasionally occurred before 7 a.m., which constitutes a breach of the acknowledgement as it is prohibited by the City of Marina Del Rey.

Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendants' motion for summary adjudication as to the Plaintiffs' first and eighth causes of action, and grants it as to the Plaintiffs' second, fifth, and sixth causes of action.
