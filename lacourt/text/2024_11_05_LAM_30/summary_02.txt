And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for summary adjudication by the defendants, GK Management Co., Inc. and Dolphin Marina LTD, against the plaintiffs, Marc Kayne and Paula Kayne. The defendants are seeking summary adjudication on the plaintiffs' second, fifth, and sixth causes of action, while the plaintiffs are opposing summary adjudication on their first and eighth causes of action.

The judge finds that the defendants have met their burden regarding the plaintiffs' second, fifth, and sixth causes of action and grants summary adjudication on those claims. However, the judge finds that the defendants have not met their burden regarding the plaintiffs' first cause of action for common law wrongful eviction and denies summary adjudication on that claim.

The judge also finds that the defendants have not met their burden regarding the plaintiffs' eighth cause of action for breach of contract and denies summary adjudication on that claim. The judge concludes that the plaintiffs have established a triable issue of material fact regarding the defendants' breach of the construction advisory acknowledgement and that the defendants are in breach if construction occurs outside of the permitted hours.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is that summary adjudication is denied as to the plaintiffs' first and eighth causes of action, while summary adjudication is granted as to the plaintiffs' second, fifth, and sixth causes of action.
