The court has considered the motion to lift the stay and compel arbitration of the plaintiff's individual and representative PAGA claims. The plaintiff seeks to compel arbitration of all claims, while the defendants argue that the motion is untimely and seeks reconsideration of a prior ruling. The court finds that the plaintiff's representative PAGA claims should be compelled into arbitration and grants the motion in part. The court sets a status conference for October 23, 2024, to discuss the status of the arbitration.
