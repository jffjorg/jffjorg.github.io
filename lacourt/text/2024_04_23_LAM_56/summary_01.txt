And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to disqualify counsel for the plaintiff, Miller Barondess LLP, based on alleged exposure to privileged documents. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's counsel had reviewed documents that were intentionally disclosed to them, and that this constituted a valid ground for disqualification. The court finds that this argument is without merit. The court notes that the intentional disclosure of documents to the plaintiff's counsel does not constitute a valid ground for disqualification. The court cites the case of Fox Searchlight Pictures, Inc. v. Paladino (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 294, in which the court held that an attorney representing a former in-house counsel against her employer was not required to be disqualified. Therefore, the motion to disqualify counsel is denied.
