And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion to quash service of summons filed by Stylenquaza, LLC and has granted the motion. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have not met their burden of proof that the court has personal jurisdiction over Stylenquaza, LLC. The judge concludes that the company has no contacts with California and that the court lacks jurisdiction over it. The judge notes that the plaintiffs have not provided evidence to rebut the company's showing that its distribution area does not include the West Coast and that it has no principal place of business in California. The judge also notes that the company has not been licensed to do business in California and has no distribution centers in California. As a result, the judge grants the motion to quash service of summons and orders that the company be notified of the ruling.
