  Case Number:  23CHCV01711    Hearing Date:   May 9, 2024    Dept:  F49    Dept.    F49      Date:    5/9/24     Case    Name: Sorush Sharif v. BMW of North America, LLC; Santa Monica BMW; and    Does 1-50     Case    # 23CHCV01711      LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT F49    MAY 9, 2024    MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER ANSWERS  TO FIRST SET OF REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS  Los Angeles Superior  Court Case # 23CHCV01711    Motion  filed: 11/13/23   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Sorush Sharif (“Plaintiff”) RESPONDING PARTY: None NOTICE: OK    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order from this Court to compel Defendant Santa Monica BMW (“SM BMW”) to produce  supplemental responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions (“RFA”), Nos. 7,  11, 13, 17, 22-23, and 27, to compel SM BMW to verify its responses to RFA,  Nos. 1-6, 12, 14-21, and 24-33, and to impose monetary sanctions against SM BMW  and its attorney of record, jointly and severally, in the amount of $3,901.51.    TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is GRANTED. The Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.    BACKGROUND   Plaintiff filed this Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act  lawsuit over alleged defects in his 2021 BMW 430i Coupe (the “Subject Vehicle”),  which was manufactured by Defendant BMW of North America, LLC (“BMW NA”).  Plaintiff leased the Vehicle in new condition on March 6, 2021, from Crevier  BMW Santa Ana, under the manufacturer’s express warranty.  Defendant SM BMW is an authorized service and  repair facility of BMW NA.   On June 12, 2023, Plaintiff initiated the action against  Defendants BMW NA, SM BMW, (collectively, “Defendants”), and Does 1 through 50.  The Complaint alleges four causes of action: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act  – Breach of Express Warranty, (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of  Implied Warranty; (3) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2(b), and  (4) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Section 1796.5. Subsequently, Defendants  filed their Answer to the Complaint on September 20, 2023.   On November 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed  the instant Motion to Compel Further Answers to RFA, Set One.    No opposing papers have been received  by the Court.   ANALYSIS   “On receipt of a response to  requests for admissions, the party requesting admissions may move for an order  compelling a further response if that party deems that either or both of the  following apply: ¶ (1) An answer to a particular request is evasive or  incomplete. ¶ (2) An objection to a particular request is without merit or too  general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (a).)    A.     Procedural  Requirements   1.       Timeliness   A motion to compel further responses to requests for  admission must be brought within 45 days of service of the verified response,  supplemental verified response, or on a date to which the propounding and  responding parties have agreed to in writing; otherwise, the propounding party  waives the right to compel further responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290,  subd. (c); but see Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court  (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 134-136 [suggesting that the 45-day deadline does  not apply to (i.e., it does not begin to run with service of) objections-only  responses; it only applies to responses that are required to be verified].)   “[T]he time within which to make a motion to compel  production of documents is mandatory and jurisdictional just as it is for  motions to compel further answers to interrogatories.”  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58  Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) The 45-day deadline “is ‘jurisdictional’ in the sense  that it renders the court without authority to rule on motions to compel other  than to deny them.”  (Ibid.)               Here, Plaintiff attests that  SM BMW’s unverified responses were served by email on October 17, 2023.  (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 8.) Plaintiff correctly notes that unverified responses are  tantamount to no response until verifications are provided. (See Appleton v.  Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 (Appleton).) Thus, the  45-day limit does not apply to the service of unverified responses.                Therefore,  the Court finds the Motion is filed timely.   2.       Meet and Confer   “A motion [to compel further responses to requests for  admission] shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section  2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (b)(1).)    Here, Plaintiff has satisfied the  meet and confer requirement. (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 10.)   3.       Separate  Statement   The California  Rules of Court rule 3.1345 (b)(5) explicitly states that “A separate statement is not  required under the following circumstances: (1) When no response has been  provided to the request for discovery[.]”   Here, Plaintiff has  satisfied the requirement by concurrently filing a separate statement with the  Motion.    B.      Motion to  Compel Further Responses    1)       Insufficient  Responses   Plaintiff asserts that  Defendant’s responses to RFP Nos. 7, 11, 13, 17, 22-23, and 27, Set One, are  insufficient. (Mot., at p. 6.)   REQUEST  FOR ADMISSION NO. 7: Admit  that BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, LLC uses a pre-determined rate schedule to pay YOU  for repair work.   REQUEST  FOR ADMISSION NO. 11: Admit  that YOU received payments from BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, LLC for the warranty  repair work performed by YOU on SUBJECT VEHICLE.   REQUEST  FOR ADMISSION NO. 13: Admit  that BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, LLC uses a pre-determined time schedule for each  type of repair that determines how much time BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, LLC will pay  YOU for any particular repair.   REQUEST  FOR ADMISSION NO. 17: Admit  that BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, LLC provides BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, LLC factory  training to YOUR dealership employees.   REQUEST  FOR ADMISSION NO. 22: Admit  that BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, LLC did not request that YOU perform any review of  whether Plaintiff’s vehicle qualifies for repurchase or replacement under the  Song-Beverly Act.   REQUEST  FOR ADMISSION NO. 23: Admit  that YOU did not perform any review of whether the SUBJECT VEHICLE qualifies  for repurchase or replacement under the Song-Beverly Act.   REQUEST  FOR ADMISSION NO. 27: Admit  that YOU did not charge Plaintiff for any of the repair attempts performed by  YOU on the SUBJECT VEHICLE.   Defendant asserts boilerplate objections to the above RFA  Nos. Specifically, the objections state, “SANTA MONICA BMW objects to this request based on Evidence  Code section 352, as whether or not Plaintiff’s vehicle is somehow  substantially impaired due to a warrantable defect has nothing to do with any  warranty reimbursement payments made by BMW NA. SANTA MONICA BMW further  objects to this request as overly broad, unduly burdensome, oppressive, seeks  information and/or documents that are not relevant to any party’s claims or  defenses and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible  evidence, may seek information and/or documents that are protected by the  attorney-client and/or work product doctrine and/or the expert consultant  privilege, may seek information and/or documents that may be confidential and  protected as proprietary, trade secret, and/or commercially sensitive without  prior entry of an appropriate protective order, and seeks information and/or  documents that are not relevant and not proportional to the needs of the case,  considering the importance of the issues at stake in this action, the amount in  controversy, and the parties’ relative access to the information and/or documents.  SANTA MONICA BMW objects to this request to the extent that it requires the preparation of a  compilation, abstract, audit or summary. ¶ SANTA MONICA BMW objects to the  extent the request exceeds the permissible scope of discovery and the  limitations that are set forth in the California Code of Civil Procedure, and/or  any other applicable court rules. SANTA MONICA BMW’s discovery and  investigation are ongoing.” (See generally, Pl.’s Separate Statement.)   The Court finds SM BMW’s objections to be meritless and the  information sought by the RFAs to be relevant to the issue of repair and  repurchase of the Subject Vehicle. Furthermore, the Court determines that SM  BWM’s responses are not compliant with the requirements of Code of Civil  Procedure section 2033.220, subdivision (b), which provides, “[e]ach answer shall: ¶ (1) Admit so much of  the matter involved in the request as is true, either as expressed in the  request itself or as reasonably and clearly qualified by the responding party.  ¶ (2) Deny so much of the matter involved in the request as is untrue. ¶ (3)  Specify so much of the matter involved in the request as to the truth of which  the responding party lacks sufficient information or knowledge.”   Consequently, the Court GRANTS the Motion to Compel  Further Responses to Requests for Admissions, Nos. 7, 11, 13, 17, 22-23, and 27, Set One.    2)       Unverified  Responses   “Unsworn responses  are tantamount to no responses at all.” (Appleton, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at p. 636, citing Zorro Inv. Co. v. Great  Pacific Securities Corp. (1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 907, 914.)    Here, SM BMW served its  unverified responses on October 17, 2023, including the remaining RFA Nos. 1-6,  12, 14-21, and 24-33. (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 7.) Following the precedent set in Appleton,  these responses are deemed ineffective until they are verified. Consequently, the  Court finds that Defendant should be compelled to provide verified, complete,  and code-compliant responses to Set One of Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions.   Accordingly,  the Court GRANTS Motion to Compel Further Response to Requests for Admissions,  Nos. 1-6, 12, 14-16, 18-21, and 24-33, Set One.   C.     Monetary  Sanctions   Additionally, Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions against SM  BMW, in the amount of $3,901.51, under the authority of Code of Civil Procedure  sections 2023.030, and 2033.290, subdivision (d).   Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.290, subdivision (d)  provides, “The court shall impose a monetary sanction ... against any party,  person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel  further response, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust.”   “The  court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files  a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was  filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery  was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of  Court, rule 3.1348(a).)   As  the Court has granted the Motion, it determines that the mandatory sanctions  under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.290 subdivision (d), are applicable.  Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the  circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of  attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the instant Motion is $1,121.51,  calculated at $695.00 per hour for 1.5 hours, in addition to $79.01 filing fee.   CONCLUSION   The  unopposed Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Admissions, Set  One, is GRANTED.   Santa Monica BMW is ordered to produce verified  supplemental responses to Requests for Admissions, Nos. Nos. 7, 11, 13, 17, 22-23, and 27, Set One, within 20 days.   Santa Monica BMW is further ordered to produce  verifications to its responses to Requests for Admissions, Nos. 1-6, 12,  14-16, 18-21, and 24-33, Set One, within 20 days.   Plaintiff’s  Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.   Santa  Monica BMW and its attorney(s) of record are ordered to jointly and severally  pay $1,121.51 to Plaintiff.   Moving  party is ordered to give notice.
