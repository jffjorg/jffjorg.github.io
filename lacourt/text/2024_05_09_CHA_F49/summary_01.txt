The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for admissions.

The defendants had objected to these requests, claiming they were overly broad and unduly burdensome. The judge found that the defendants' responses were insufficient and failed to comply with the California Code of Civil Procedure. The judge ordered the defendants to provide verified and complete responses to the requests for admissions within 20 days. The judge also granted the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the defendants in the amount of $1,121.51, which includes attorney's fees and costs.
