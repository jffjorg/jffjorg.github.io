And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling grants the Motion to Compel Arbitration and orders the parties to lodge with the court lists of at least four arbitrators who handle Song-Beverly actions arbitration in the Los Angeles area. The parties have disagreed on who should be the arbitrator, with the Defendants wishing to proceed with AAA and the Plaintiff preferring JAMS. The Judge finds that the arbitration agreement provides a method for selecting the arbitrator, and since the parties have been unable to agree, the Judge must appoint an arbitrator. The Judge will nominate five arbitrators from the parties' lists, and if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the Judge will select one from the nominees. The Judge orders the parties to comply with the arbitration agreement and to proceed with arbitration according to its terms.
