And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to continue the trial pending appeal on the dismissed cross-claims. The defendant argues that the trial should be continued to avoid irreconcilable outcomes and to protect its appeal, while the plaintiff opposes the motion and argues that the claims are not related and that the defendant's arguments have already been rejected in a previous case. The court agrees with the plaintiff that continuing the trial pending the appeal is inappropriate, citing the California Code of Civil Procedure section 916(a) and previous case law. The court notes that the defendant has already raised its affirmative defenses in its answer and that the issues are intertwined. The motion is denied, and the trial will proceed as scheduled.
