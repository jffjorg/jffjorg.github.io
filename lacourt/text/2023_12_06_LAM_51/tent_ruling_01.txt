On October 11, 2019, Plaintiffs filed an Amendment to the
Complaint, Fictitious/Incorrect Name, designating Doe 1 as Branded Online, Inc.
Defendant Branded Online, Inc., filed an Answer on March 3, 2020.  
 
On April 28, 2022, Defendants Alfonso Rodriguez filed a
Demurrer to the FAC, which the court Sustained without leave to amend on August
16, 2022. 
 
On June 21, 2022, Defendant Branded Online Inc., filed a
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, which the court Denied on July 18, 2022. 
 
On August 25, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended

On November 22, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an Opposition to
Defendant Branded Online, Inc.’s MSJ. Defendants did not file a Reply brief. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Separate Statement
 
Plaintiffs contend that the court should deny the MSJ
because Moving Defendant failed to set forth each issue and the facts to
support each issue in violation of Cal. Rules of Court 3.1350(d).
 
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1350(d) provides:
“(1) The Separate Statement of
Undisputed Material Facts in support of a motion must separately identify:
(A) Each cause of action, claim for
damages, issue of duty, or affirmative defense that is the subject of the
motion; and
(B) Each supporting material fact
claimed to be without dispute with respect to the cause of action, claim for
damages, issue of duty, or affirmative defense that is the subject of the
motion.
(2) The separate statement should
include only material facts and not any facts that are not pertinent to the
disposition of the motion.
(3) The separate statement must be in
the two-column format specified in (h). The statement must state in numerical
sequence the undisputed material facts in the first column followed by the
evidence that establishes those undisputed facts in that same column. Citation
to the evidence in support of each material fact must include reference to the
exhibit, title, page, and line numbers.”
 
CCP 437c(b)(1) states in pertinent part: “The supporting
papers shall include a separate statement setting forth plainly and concisely
all material facts that the moving party contends are undisputed. Each of the
material facts stated shall be followed by a reference to the supporting
evidence. The failure to comply with this requirement of a separate statement
may in the court's discretion constitute a sufficient ground for denying the
motion.” 
 
The court disagrees with Plaintiffs’ contention that it must
deny the MSJ due to faulty Separate Statement. Indeed, the code provides such a
response when there is no Separate
Statement filed with the MSJ. Here, Moving Defendant has provided a Separate
Statement of the material facts upon which it relies to support its motion.
 
Accordingly, the court will consider the merits of the
motion.
 
Summary Judgment
 
The function of a motion for summary judgment or
adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot
show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of
summary dismissal without the need for trial.¿(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843 (Aguilar).) In analyzing such motions,
courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the
pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent's
claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence
of a triable, material factual issue.”¿(Hinesley¿v.¿Oakshade¿Town
Center¿(2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294).¿Thus, summary judgment or summary
adjudication is granted when, after the Court’s consideration of the evidence
set forth in the papers and all reasonable inferences accordingly, no triable
issues of fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter
of law.¿(CCP § 437c(c);¿Villa v.¿McFarren¿(1995)
35 Cal.App.4th 733, 741.) 
 
A triable issue of material fact exists where “the evidence
would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of
the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of
proof.” (Aguilar, supra, at p. 850.) 
 
As to each claim as framed by the complaint, the
party¿moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the
initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element.¿(Scalf¿v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc.¿(2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support
of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the
evidence in favor of that party.”¿(Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) A motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication must be denied where the moving party's
evidence does not prove all material facts, even in the absence of any
opposition or where the opposition is weak.¿(See¿Leyva v. Superior Court (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 462, 475;¿Salesguevara¿v. Wyeth Labs., Inc. (1990)
222 Cal.App.3d 379, 384, 387.)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
Once the¿moving¿party has met the burden, the burden shifts
to the opposing party¿to show via specific facts that a triable issue of
material facts exists as to a cause of action or a defense thereto.¿(CCP §
437c(o)(2).)¿ When¿a¿party¿cannot¿establish an essential element or defense, a
court must grant a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication.¿(CCP §
437c(o)(1)-(2).)¿ 
 
Evidentiary Objections
 
The
court rules on Plaintiff’s Objections to Evidence as Follows:
-         
1 – 13: Overruled
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
The court grants Moving Defendant’s
request for judicial notice as to Exhibits 2-4 and Plaintiffs’ request for
judicial notice as to Exhibits 1 through 13. (Evid. Code § 452(c), (h); See Kalnoki v. First American Trustee Servicing
Solutions, LLC (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 23,37.) However, the court only takes
judicial notice of the foregoing documents only as to “the existence, content
and authenticity of public records and other specified documents”; it does not
take judicial notice of the truth of the factual matters asserted in those
documents. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022)
87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Issues 3 - 9: No
Employment by Moving Defendant
 
Moving Defendant contends that Plaintiffs’ claims fail
because Moving Defendant was not their employer since they did not control or
direct Plaintiff’s activities, did not pay Plaintiffs, Defendant One Stop
terminated Plaintiffs’ employment one month before Moving Defendant purchased
any assets from One Stop, and there was no unity of interest with One Stop. Additionally,
Moving Defendant contends that it is not liable for Plaintiffs’ claims because
it did not explicitly assume liability for any of One Stop’s liabilities in the
assignment of the benefit of creditors. Finally, Moving Defendant contends that
it does not have successor liability because it did not assume One Stop’s
liabilities, it did not maintain an identical workforce as compared to One Stop,
none of its officers, directors, or board members worked for or owned any
interest in One Stop, or had any control over One Stop’s assignment for benefit
of creditors process, or had any influence over the trustee’s decision, and
none of One Stop’s officers, directors, shareholders, or board members worked
for Moving Defendant before or after the asset purchase.
 
Plaintiff argues that there is a triable issue of fact as to
whether the transfer was a fraudulent conveyance. Alternatively, Plaintiffs
argue that the transaction amounted to a consolidation or merger of the two
companies. Plaintiffs argue that Moving Defendant did not disprove at least one
element of each of the four exceptions to successor liability. Additionally,
Plaintiffs argue that Moving Defendant did assume One Stop’s liabilities or
that it is a “mere continuation” of One Stop. 
 
“The general rule of successor nonliability provides that
where a corporation purchases, or otherwise acquires by transfer, the assets of
another corporation, the acquiring corporation does not assume the selling
corporation’s debts and liabilities.” (Fisher
v. Allis-Chalmers Corp. Product Liability Trust (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 1182,
1188 (Fisher) [citing Ray v. Alad Corp. (1977) 19 Cal.3d 22,
28 (Ray).] The exceptions to this
general rule are: “(1) there is an express or implied agreement of assumption,
(2) the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger of the two
corporation, (3) the purchasing corporation is a mere continuation of the
seller, or (4) the transfer of assets to the purchaser is for the fraudulent
purpose of escaping liability for the seller’s debts.”[1]
(Fisher, supra, at 1188; CenterPoint
Energy, Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 157 Cal.Ap.4th 1101, 1120 (CenterPoint).) A defendant requesting
summary judgment “must show the exceptions that create successor liability do
not apply in this case” which requires “disproving at lease one element of each
exception or showing that at least one such element cannot be established.” (Fisher, supra, at 1188.) 
 
Here, the court agrees with Plaintiffs that a triable issue
of material fact exists as to Moving Defendant’s successor liability under the
mere continuation exception and/or the fraudulent purpose exception.[2]

 
i.                   
Mere Continuation
When a purchasing corporation is “a continuation of the old”
(i.e., the selling corporation) despite “change of name or a shift of assets”
then it cannot escape liability. (Cleveland
v. Johnson (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327 (Cleveland).) The test is one or both of the following factual
elements: “(1) no adequate consideration was given for the predecessor
corporation’s assets and made available for meeting the claims of its unsecured
creditors; (2) one or more persons were officers, directors, or stockholders of
both corporations.” (Ibid.) (citing Ray, supra, at p. 29.) 
 
Here, the court agrees with Plaintiffs that there is a
triable issue of material fact. Moving Defendant acquired One Stop in July 2018
for $337,650.00. (Exhibit D.) This sale included One Stop’s customer base and
the developed software. (Exhibit J, 56:5-9.) However, another company, Allomer
Capital Group LLC, was prepared to acquire One Stop “at an enterprise valuation
between $10 million and $13 million” in February 2018. (Exhibit V.) There was
also a “some calculation” that totaled about $12 million representing One
Stop’s value.[3]
(Exhibit I, 68:16-69:1.) And, that Sherwood would not have sold One Stop for
$337,000 only. (Exhibit I, 71:20-72:1.) This is a stark contrast that indicates
a question of inadequate consideration for the jury to decide.
 
There was also overlap in operations, equipment, ownership,
and records. First, Moving Defendant continued to run One Stop for a number of
months after the purchase. (Exhibit D, 31:21-23.) Moving Defendant hired approx.
70 of One Stop’s employees. (Exhibit D, 33:10-12, 34:9-13.) Moving Defendant
took over One Stop’s lease and operations. (Exhibit J.) Moving Defendant
decided which One Stop employees to hire. (Exhibit I.) At least one officer, Jennifer
Smith (VP of Finance and Administration/Controller) moved from One Stop to
Moving Defendant in the same role. (Exhibit J.) 
 
ii.                 
Fraudulent Purpose
Here, the chronology creates a triable issue of material
fact as to fraudulent purpose for the transfer because Moving Defendant should
have been on notice of the charges prior to the initiation of this lawsuit.[4]
Plaintiffs were employed by One Stop. (Third Amended Complaint (TAC) ¶¶ 26,
27.) Plaintiffs’ employment ended on June 4, 2018. (Additional Material Facts
(AMF) No. 7.) Moving Defendant purchased assets and rights from One Stop on
July 13, 2018.[5]
(RJN No. 4, Asset Purchase Agreement.) On October 29, 2018, Bonilla filed a
complaint with the DFEH naming One Stop, Alfonso Rodriguez, and Juan Beltran
has respondents. (Request for Judicial Notice, No. 2 – Bonilla’s First DFEH
Complaint.) On March 26, 2019, Bonilla filed an amended DFEH complaint adding
One Stop, LLC as a respondent. (Request for Judicial Notice, No. 3 – Bonilla’s Amended
DFEH Complaint.) Plaintiffs filed their initial complaint in this matter on
March 28, 2019. (Complaint.) Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended
Complaint on September 19, 2019. On October 10, 2019, Plaintiffs added Branded
Online, Inc. as a Doe Defendant (Doe Amendment). 
 
Accordingly, the court DENIES Moving Defendant’s motion
for summary judgment, or alternatively for summary adjudication as to Issues
3-9.
 
Issue 1: Failure to
Exhaust Administrative Remedies
 
Moving Defendant contends that Plaintiffs failed to exhaust
administrative remedies prior to filing the instant action because they did not
name Moving Defendant in their administrative complaints.[6]
Moving Defendant additionally contends that Plaintiffs’ amendment to their
administrative complaint fails because the statute of limitations had expired
prior to the amendment and the amendment did not relate back to the initial
filing.[7]
Plaintiffs argue that because Moving Defendant is a successor in interest to
One Stop, the DFEH charges apply to them, too. 
 
Plaintiffs rely on Martin
v. Fisher (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 118, 122-123 (Martin), Nazir v. United
Airlines (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 243, 268 (Nazir)[8],
and Wills v. Superior Court (2011)
195 Cal.App.4th 143, 157-159 (Wills).[9]
The Court in Martin concluded that
naming the respondent in the caption was not necessary because they were named
in the body of the complaint and participated in the administrative
investigation. (Martin, supra, at pg.
122-123.) Moving Defendant cites Alexander v. Community Hospital of Long
Beach (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 238, 250-252, 254 (Alexander). There, the Court found the plaintiffs did not exhaust
their administrative remedies because they did not name the defendant in their
FEHA complaint at all. 
 
The purpose is to put the defendant on notice of the charges
and to provide an opportunity to participate in any administrative
investigation. (Cole v. Antelope Valley
Union High School Dist. (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 1505, 1511.) Alternatively,
naming the defendants allows the DFEH to investigate claims. (Alexander, supra, at p. 251.) 
 
Here, the court agrees with Plaintiffs that there is a
triable issue of material fact as to Moving Defendant’s successor in interest
liability. 
 
Accordingly, the court DENIES Moving Defendant’s motion
for summary judgment, or for summary adjudication, as to Issue 1. 
 
Issue 2: Plaintiff
Bonilla’s Waiver of Claims
 
Moving Defendant contends that Plaintiff Bonilla Released
all of her claims against One Stop, including Moving Defendant as an assignee, that
were known as of March 4, 2019, which include the claims at issue here. Plaintiff
Bonilla argues that the purported Release is not authenticated, lacks
foundation, and is unsupported hearsay. Additionally, Plaintiffs argue that
workers’ compensation does not preclude FEHA causes of action. 
 
Preprinted language in a workers’ compensation compromise
and release form should be narrowly construed to apply only to workers’
compensation claims. (Claxton v. Waters
(2004) 34 Cal.4th 367, 375-376 (Claxton).)
Here, like in Claxton, the purported
workers compensation release had different attorneys representing Plaintiff
Bonilla and does not mention the pending DFEH complaint. (Exhibit 5.) 
 
Accordingly, the court DENIES Moving Defendant’s motion
for summary judgment, or alternatively summary adjudication, as to Issue 2. 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
