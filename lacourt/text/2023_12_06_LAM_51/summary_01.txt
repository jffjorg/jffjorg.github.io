And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication on several issues. The issues include:

* Whether the Defendant is liable for the claims brought by the Plaintiffs, including claims of harassment and discrimination based on disabilities and wrongful termination.
* Whether the Plaintiffs exhausted their administrative remedies before filing the lawsuit.
* Whether Plaintiff Bonilla waived her claims against One Stop Internet, Inc.

The Judge found that there are triable issues of material fact in each of these issues, and therefore the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication was denied.

The Judge's ruling is based on the following:

* The sale of One Stop Internet, Inc. to Branded Online, Inc. in July 2018, which raises questions about whether the Defendant is liable for the claims brought by the Plaintiffs.
* The hiring of 70 of One Stop's employees by the Defendant, which raises questions about whether the Defendant is a successor in interest to One Stop.
* The continued running of One Stop's operations by the Defendant for several months, which raises questions about whether the Defendant is liable for the claims brought by the Plaintiffs.

The Judge also found that the Defendant's arguments about the Plaintiffs' failure to exhaust their administrative remedies and Plaintiff Bonilla's waiver of claims were without merit.
