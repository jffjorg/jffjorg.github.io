And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the summary judgment request of Moving Defendant and has determined that the product line successor rule does not apply in this case because it is not a product liability dispute. The judge is also persuaded by a previous case, U.S. Equal Emp. Opportunity Comm'n v. Phase 2 Invs. Inc. (D. Md. 2018) 310 F.Supp 3d 550. Additionally, the judge notes that there is a dispute as to whether the transaction between Moving Defendant and One Stop was arms-length. The judge cautions the plaintiffs against mischaracterizing their complaints and suggests that the court need not develop all theories of the case because one theory defeats the summary judgment request.
