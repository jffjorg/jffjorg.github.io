Fisher also noted a fifth exception,
the “product line successor” rule when “a person injured by the predecessor’s
product is given a remedy against the successor corporation.” (Fisher, supra, at 1188.) The court does
not believe this fifth exception applies because the instant matter is not
product liability dispute. 


[2]
Plaintiffs address the other two exceptions, but the court need not develop
those as just one theory defeats Moving Defendant’s summary judgment request.

Sherwood’s success fee may have been calculated using the $12 million value,
not the $337,000 purported purchase price. (Exhibit I, 78:12-16.)

The court was persuaded by U.S. Equal
Emp. Opportunity Comm’n v. Phase 2 Invs. Inc. (D. Md. 2018) 310 F.Supp 3d
550, 564-565.

Additionally, there is a dispute as to whether the transaction between Moving
Defendant and One Stop was arms-length. (AMF No. 12, Exhibit OO.)
 


[6]
Moving Defendant uses this argument to attack the First through Eleventh, and
Fifteenth causes of action.
 


[7]
The court cautions Plaintiffs against mischaracterizing their DFEH complaints. (See
UMF No. 4 [indicating the original and amended complaints allege that Branded
was an employer.]).
 


[8]
Nazir held that claims need to be
interpreted broadly (there, in the context of harassment and discrimination).
It did not discuss naming parties to the complaint.
 


[9]
Plaintiffs also rely on U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission v. Phase 2 Investments Inc. (D. Md. 2018)
310 F.Supp.3d 500 to support their argument about successor liability. However,
the court is not bound by this decision.
