And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a medical malpractice case. The defendant is seeking to compel the plaintiff to fully comply with certain requests for production (RFP's) and to produce the requested documents. The discovery was served on March 8, 2024, and the plaintiff provided statements of compliance in full on August 30, 2024, but has not yet produced any documents. The defendant has moved to compel the production of documents and has also requested sanctions. The plaintiff has not opposed the motion. The judge has granted the motion to compel further and has granted the request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $3220.50, payable by the plaintiff within 30 days. The defendant is required to produce the documents sought within 10 court days of this order. The judge notes that the 10-day deadline is short, but that the defendant has had over 9 months to produce the documents and should have done so sooner.
