 Case Number:  23SMCV03964    Hearing Date:   December 20, 2024    Dept:  I The motion to compel further is GRANTED.  The request for sanctions is GRANTED in the
reduced amount of $3220.50 and is payable by plaintiff, but not counsel, within
30 days.  The reduced amount is because
there was no opposition and therefore no time was spent reviewing the
opposition or preparing a reply. 
 
This is a medical malpractice case.  Defendant seeks to compel full compliance
with certain RFP’s.  The discovery was
served on March 8, 2024.  After a number
of delays, plaintiff provided statements of compliance in full on August 30,
but has not yet produced any documents. 
Defendant moves to have the documents produced.  Plaintiff has not opposed the motion.
 
Defendant will produce the documents sought within 10 court
days of this order.  Because production
in full was promised, that is what will be delivered.  The court is aware that 10 days is not very
long.  On the other hand, defendant has
had over 9 months to produce the documents, and about four months since
defendant promised to do so.  Time to get
to work.
