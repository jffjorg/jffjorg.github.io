And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is reviewing an ex parte application by Buckley, who claims that the court failed to adequately consider his claim of legal malpractice and due process. Buckley argues that Pomerantz's delay in filing the Special Motion to Strike (SMS) and a subsequent ex parte application for leave to file the SMS led to the imposition of sanctions against him, which in turn led to a State Bar investigation. Although the State Bar eventually dropped charges against Buckley, he still claims that Pomerantz's malpractice is what led to the ordeal. The court will inquire about the sanctions issue and whether it constitutes damages sufficient to defeat summary adjudication. However, the court remains convinced that the State Bar inquiry is too attenuated an alleged harm to survive. The court also believes that Buckley was not denied due process, but rather the court did its level best to review Buckley's papers and arguments. In all respects other than the one about which the court will inquire, the ex parte application is denied.
