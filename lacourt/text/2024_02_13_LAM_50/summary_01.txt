Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Orly Shoe Corp's motion to dismiss Pegasus Trucking, LLC's First Amended Cross-Complaint. The court found that Pegasus failed to enter the appearance of substitute counsel after its previous counsel was relieved, and failed to oppose the motion to dismiss. The court cited California Rule of Court 8.54(c), which states that a failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion. The court also relied on the case of CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, which held that a corporation's failure to be represented by an attorney is a curable defect that may be corrected by the court. The court granted Orly's motion to dismiss Pegasus's First Amended Cross-Complaint and ordered Orly to file and serve a proposed judgment of dismissal within 10 days.
