And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for summary adjudication filed by the defendants, Sea View Inn at the Beach, Incorporated, Hal Keasler, Jim Murphy, Branden Alonzo, and Vuong Nguyen. The motion is based on the alleged unpaid commissions and the violation of Labor Code section 2699, et seq.

The plaintiff, James McLeary, filed a lawsuit against the defendants alleging breach of oral contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, failure to pay wages, and other claims. The defendants filed a cross-complaint alleging conversion, injury to property, breach of fiduciary duty, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and other claims.

The court found that the defendants' motion for summary adjudication of the third cause of action for failure to pay wages is denied as moot, as the parties have stipulated to dismiss the claim for alleged unpaid commissions.

The court also denied the defendants' motion for summary adjudication of the fourteenth cause of action for violation of Labor Code section 2699, et seq. The court found that the plaintiff's notice of the alleged violations was sufficient to meet the requirements of the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004, and that the defendants had not met their burden to show that the notice was deficient.

The court noted that the plaintiff's notice alleged that he was misclassified as an exempt employee, was not reimbursed for business expenditures, and was not paid overtime or provided with meal and rest breaks. The court also noted that the plaintiff alleged that he was fired for protesting the company's illegal conduct of not paying transient occupancy tax.

The court found that the defendants' arguments that the notice was deficient were without merit, and that the plaintiff's notice was sufficient to meet the requirements of the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004. The court also noted that the defendants had not met their burden to show that the notice was deficient, and that the plaintiff had provided sufficient facts and theories to support his claims.
