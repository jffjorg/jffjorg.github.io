Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike in the case of Sara Sullivan vs. Dean Marks, et al. The plaintiff alleges that she was injured on the defendant's premises due to a non-compliant surface condition on the stairs. The defendant has filed a demurrer to the third cause of action for fraudulent conveyance and a motion to strike the allegations for punitive damages.

The Court has sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action, finding that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to support her claim. The plaintiff has alleged that the defendant made an off-record transfer of property to Doe 100, but has not provided any evidence to support this allegation. The Court has given the plaintiff the opportunity to obtain evidence of an off-record transfer and file a motion for leave to amend the complaint.

The motion to strike is taken off-calendar as moot in light of the Court's ruling on the demurrer. The case will proceed with the remaining causes of action, and the plaintiff will have the opportunity to file a new complaint if she obtains evidence of an off-record transfer.
