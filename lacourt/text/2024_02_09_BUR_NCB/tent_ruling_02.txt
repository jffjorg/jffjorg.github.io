[1] The proof of service of the summons and complaint on Anthony Crescenzi (filed November 5, 2020) shows that he was served by personal service at 6720 St. Esteban St., Tujunga, CA 91042.  Service was effectuated by Yarida Martinez, a registered California process server. However, the motion is brought only by Dean Crescenzi.  Anthony Crescenzi has since passed away.[2] This appears to be a typographical error.  Defendant states that he lives at 22727 Stagg Street, while service was effectuated at 22737 Stagg Street.  However, based on Exhibit E’s Chase Letter, his address is listed as 22737 Stagg Street.  Defendant does not raise any arguments that the location where he was served by substituted service was improper.  As such, the Court will consider Defendant’s address to the 22737 Stagg Street.  In the reply declaration, Defendant states that his address is 22737 Stagg Street.
