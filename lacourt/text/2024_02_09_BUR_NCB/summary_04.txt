And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to an unlawful detainer complaint filed by AVB STUDIO CITY III-A, LP (Plaintiff) against Svetlana Ausheva (Defendant). The complaint seeks possession of the premises, costs, past due rent, attorney's fees, and damages. Defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that it fails to state sufficient facts and is uncertain, specifically that a 30-day notice was required under the LA County Tenant Protections Resolution. The Judge denies the demurrer, finding that the complaint and exhibits do not fail to state sufficient facts and are not uncertain. The Judge also notes that the issue of whether a 30-day notice was required may be raised later in the motion for summary judgment or trial phase.
