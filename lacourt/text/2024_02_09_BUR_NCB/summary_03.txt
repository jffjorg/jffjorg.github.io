And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the motions to be relieved as counsel filed by defense counsel, Hillary Arrow Booth, on behalf of defendants Aneaka English and several corporate entities. The defense counsel seeks to withdraw from representing the defendants due to an absolute and irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship stemming from the defendants' failure to communicate and cooperate in the representation. The court notes that the proposed order forms have been rejected due to an incomplete phone number, and orders the defense counsel to electronically submit updated proposed order forms. The court also sets an Order to Show Cause re Status of Representation for the corporate defendants, as they cannot represent themselves in propria persona. The motions to be relieved as counsel are granted, and the defense counsel is ordered to obtain substitute counsel.
