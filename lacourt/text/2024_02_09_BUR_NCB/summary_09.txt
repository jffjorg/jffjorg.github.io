And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the motion to quash the deposition subpoenas filed by Plaintiff Sako Shahbazian. The subpoenas were served on Progressive Group of Insurance Companies and Travelers Property Casualty Company of America, seeking information about Plaintiff's medical history and other accidents he was involved in from 2017 to 2019. The judge has granted the motion in part, allowing the discovery of information related to Plaintiff's injuries, which include the mid back, low back radiating to right thigh, bilateral lower extremities, right wrist, tailbone, and head pain. The judge has also limited the scope of the subpoenas to only include information related to these specific injuries. The motion to quash the subpoenas is denied in part, as the judge finds that the information sought is relevant to the case and may show whether Plaintiff's injuries in this action were preexisting conditions from prior accidents.
