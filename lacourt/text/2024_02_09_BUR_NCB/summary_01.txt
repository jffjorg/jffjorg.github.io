And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to set aside a default and default judgment in a lawsuit between Foothill Retirement Operator, LLC (Plaintiff) and Anthony Crescenzi and others (Defendants). The lawsuit stems from a written contract between Plaintiff and Anthony Crescenzi, in which Plaintiff alleges that it is owed $27,750 for residency, care, and services provided to Anthony Crescenzi. The Defendants argue that they were not properly served with the summons and complaint, and that they did not receive notice of the lawsuit until a letter from Chase Bank in May 2023. The judge has reviewed the evidence and has concerns about the credibility of the Defendants' claims. The judge has ordered the parties to attend a hearing on February 9, 2024, to resolve the dispute.
