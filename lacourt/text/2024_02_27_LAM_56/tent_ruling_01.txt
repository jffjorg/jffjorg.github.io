BACKGROUND
            This tort action arises from
Plaintiffs Richard Galvan and Paige Galvan’s lease for the subject property
located at 26168 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu, CA 90265 owned by Defendant
Thomas Edward Waljeski and DOES 1-100, inclusive. Plaintiffs filed a Complaint
against Defendant Waljeski, alleging causes of action for (1) Violation of
California Civil Code § 1942.4; (2) Tortious Breach of the Warranty of
Habitability; (3) Private Nuisance; (4) Business and Professions Code § 17200, et
seq; (5) Negligence; (6) Breach of Covenant of quiet Enjoyment; (7) Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress; (8) Fraud and Deceit; (9) Negligence Per Se;
and (10) Violation of Retaliatory eviction and Anti-Harassment Ordinance. 
            
Defendant
Waljeski filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiffs alleging causes of action
for (1) Breach of Written Agreement; (2) Negligent Destruction of Property; and
(3) Intentional Destruction of Property. 
            
Plaintiffs
filed this instant demurrer with motion to strike to Defendant Waljeski’s
cross-complaint. Defendant Waljeski filed an objection to the demurrer on the
grounds that the demurrer and motion to strike were never served upon him. Defendant
Waljeski also requested 30 days to review the demurrer and motion to strike to
file an opposition.
            
This
Court continued this matter on January 29, 2024 pursuant Plaintiffs’ request
and ordered Defendant Waljeski to file an opposition on or before February 16,
2024. No opposition has been filed. Instead, Defendant Waljeski filed a
response to the demurrer and motion to strike requesting the Court grant him 30
days in which to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint.
 
As
the Demurrer and Motion to Strike are unopposed, the Court SUSTAINS the
Demurrer and GRANTS the Motion to Strike with 30 days leave to amend..
 
            Responding party is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
