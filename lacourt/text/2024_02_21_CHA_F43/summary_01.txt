And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the distribution of surplus funds from the trustee sale of a property located at 12571 Mercer St., Pacoima, California. The surplus funds, in the amount of $152,238.08, were deposited with the Court after the property was sold at a trustee sale on March 23, 2023. The California Franchise Tax Board has filed a claim for $8,757.18, which is the amount of a tax lien placed on the property prior to the sale. Invinctus Lison, as the Successor Trustee of the Roxella Hudson Trust, has also filed a claim for the entire surplus funds, citing Civil Code section 2924k(a)(4).

The judge has ruled that the Franchise Tax Board shall receive its funds first, followed by Invinctus Lison. The order of distribution is determined by Civil Code section 2924(a), which provides that costs of sale and junior liens or other encumbrances on the property shall be paid first, followed by the trustor's successor in interest. Therefore, the judge has ordered that the $8,757.18 tax lien be paid to the Franchise Tax Board, and the remaining $143,480.90 be distributed to Invinctus Lison.
