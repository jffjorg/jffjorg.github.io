SUMMARY OF
ACTION
This filing concerns
the disbursement of surplus funds from the trustee sale of the property located
at 12571 Mercer St., Pacoima, California, 91331-1323. The property was sold at
a trustee sale on March 23, 2023. Surplus funds in the amount of $152,238.08
have been deposited with the Court.
 
The property
was originally owned by Roxella Hudson. While she owned the property, a tax
lien in the amount of $8,757.18 was placed on the property by the California
Franchise Tax Board. In a claim filed on August 28, 2023, the FTB is requesting
that $8,757.18 be distributed to it from the surplus funds, pursuant to Revenue
and Taxation Code section 19221 and Gov. Code section 7170.
 
Invinctus
Lison, who is the Successor Trustee of the Roxella Hudson Trust, is requesting
all of the surplus funds because the Trust owned the property at the time of
the sale on March 23, 2023. Lison has made this claim pursuant to Civ. Code §
2924k(a)(4).
 
The order of
distribution of surplus funds is determined by Civ. Code § 2924(a). After the
costs of sale are paid and any obligations by deed of trust or mortgage (Civ.
Code § 2924(a)(1), (2)), the next to be paid are junior liens or other
encumbrances on the property (Civ. Code § 2924(a)(3)), followed by the
trustor’s successor in interest (Civ. Code § 2924(a)(4)).
 
Based on the
foregoing, $8,757.18 shall first be paid to the California Franchise Tax Board
for its tax lien. The remaining $143,480.90 shall be distributed to Invinctus
Lison as the Successor Trustee.
