And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a petition to confirm an arbitration award between Book and Vig, LLC (Petitioner) and 8029 Sunset, LLC (Respondent). The arbitrator's award did not award costs to either party, finding that neither party had proven damages and that costs would be borne equally by both parties. Respondent argued that the award should be corrected to award costs under Section 998, as it had made a settlement offer of $50,000 and Petitioner failed to obtain a more favorable result. The judge denied Respondent's request, finding that the arbitrator did not exceed his powers or make an evident mistake, and that the arbitrator's decision was within the scope of the controversy submitted to him. The judge also denied Petitioner's request for attorneys' fees for having to reply to Respondent's opposition, as the Court is not the arbitrator and cannot award costs and fees under the AAA Commercial Rules. The petition to confirm the arbitration award is granted, and the request for attorneys' fees is denied.
