     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for assignment of
  payment rights 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On July 13, 2021, Plaintiff 411
Music Group, LLC filed this action against Defendants Silverlake Sync and
Rachel Nichole Brouse. The action arises from Brouse’s alleged scheme to steal
Plaintiff’s proprietary information to create an identical business of her own,
Silverlake Sync, to directly compete with Plaintiff and divert business from
Plaintiff. 
            On July 11, 2022, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s application for default judgment after finding that Defendants
failed to appear. The Court awarded: (a) $559,181 in damages; (b) $103,410 in
prejudgment interest, plus $153.20 per day from March 7, 2022 to the date of
judgment; (c) $1,743.49 in costs; (d) $7,481.81 in attorneys’ fees; and (e)
interest on the judgment at a rate of 10% per annum from the date of judgment until
full satisfaction of judgment. 
            On February 26, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion for an assignment of payment rights. Defendants have
not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“[U]pon application of the judgment
creditor on noticed motion, the court may order the judgment debtor to assign
to the judgment creditor . . . all or part of a right to payment due or to
become due . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.510(a).) “A right to payment may be
assigned pursuant to this article only to the extent necessary to satisfy the
money judgment.” (Id., subd. (d).) “When an application is made pursuant
to Section 708.510 or thereafter, the judgment creditor may apply to the court
for an order restraining the judgment debtor from assigning or otherwise
disposing of the right to payment that is sought to be assigned.” (Id.,
§ 708.520(a).)
DISCUSSION
            The undisputed evidence shows the
following. Brouse is the CEO and primary member of Vansa Music Group LLC
(Vansa) and receives distributions therefrom. (Jen Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. B.) Brouse also
receives royalties from the American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers (ASCAP) and Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) for her music that is
registered with those companies. (Id., ¶¶ 5-6, Ex. C, D.) The total
balance owed to date, including interest and costs, is $786,544.45. (Id.,
¶¶ 7-9.) 
            Plaintiff seeks an assignment of the
payments that Brouse receives from Vansa, ASCAP, and BMI to satisfy the
outstanding amount. There is no opposition to the motion and no dispute as to
the evidence. Therefore, an assignment is warranted. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion for assignment of
payment rights is GRANTED.
