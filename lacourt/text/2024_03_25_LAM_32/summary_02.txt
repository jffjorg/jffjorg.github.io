Summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for a protective order filed by the Plaintiff and other tenants, limiting the scope of depositions to the newly produced communications. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff and Rassouli do not need to be further deposed, as no new substance has been produced since their depositions. The depositions of Bettadapur and Naik are limited to the newly produced communications. The Judge also notes that the motion does not seek to relitigate the previous order, but rather to clarify the scope of the depositions.
