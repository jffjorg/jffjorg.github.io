[1] Petitioner also
argues, for the first time in reply, that the Hearing Officer acted as an
advocate for DMV when he purportedly “[c]hang[ed] the hearing issues from a
.08% hearing to a refusal hearing.” 
(Reply 2.)  Petitioner does not
show good cause to raise this argument in reply.  (Balboa
Ins. Co. v. Aguirre (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 1002, 1010.)  Accordingly, the court does not consider
it.  
 


[2] Respondent argues
that Form DS367 gave Petitioner notice of the chemical test refusal issue because
it stated that Petitioner had refused the preliminary alcohol screening (“PAS”)
tests.  (Oppo. 8.)  That argument lacks merits.  As shown on the DS367 form, the PAS tests
were “optional.”  (AR 8.)  Petitioner’s refusal of the PAS tests does
not prove that a chemical test refusal occurred under the implied consent
law.  
 


[3] In particular, the scope of the sealing order pursuant to
Penal Code sections 851.91 and 851.92, and the admissibility of form DS367, are
evidentiary issues that must be decided by an impartial DMV hearing officer in
the first instance.  (See OB 10-11; Oppo.
12-13; Reply 4-5.)
