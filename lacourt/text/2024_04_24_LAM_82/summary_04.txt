**Tentative Ruling**

The court has tentatively ruled in favor of Petitioner, Cemex, Inc., in its petition for writ of mandate against the State Water Resources Control Board. The dispute centers around the Board's decision to re-notice Petitioner's water rights application, which has been pending for over 30 years. The court found that the Board's decision was a final and subject to judicial review, despite Respondent's argument that it was not a final decision. The court also found that the Board's dismissal of Petitioner's petition for reconsideration was subject to judicial review. The court overruled Respondent's demurrer to both causes of action and ordered Respondent to provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
