And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to enforce writ of mandate is denied. The petition for writ of administrative mandate was granted in 2021, setting aside the Commission's decision. However, the Commission held a new hearing and imposed the same discipline in 2022. The judge finds that the motion is procedurally defective and that the Commission complied with the prior court order. The judge also notes that the motion is effectively a supplemental petition for writ of mandate, which requires proper notice, full briefing, and lodging of the administrative record.
