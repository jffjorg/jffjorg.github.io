**Tentative Ruling**

In this case, the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) is considering an application that was delayed for more than one year after the close of the original protest period. The SWRCB has determined that the record does not reflect up-to-date circumstances due to changes in the project or in the circumstances of affected downstream water users or other interested persons. As a result, the SWRCB intends to issue a new notice and direct the applicant to post or publish it. The applicant agrees to do so. Affected downstream water users may either submit a new protest or stand on their existing protest. This ruling is based on Title 23, section 684(b) of the California Code of Regulations.
