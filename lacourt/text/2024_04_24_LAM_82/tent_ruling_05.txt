[1] Title 23, section
684(b) of the California Code of Regulations states: “If a hearing on an application is delayed for more than one
year after the close of the protest period, the board may issue a new notice
and direct the applicant to post or publish it. The board will take such action
when, in its judgment, the record does not reflect up-to-date circumstances
because of changes in the project or in the circumstances of affected
downstream water users or other interested persons. The board will mail a copy
of the new notice to all persons who filed a protest to the application in
response to the original notice and will inform them that they may either
submit a new protest or stand on their existing protest.”
