INTRODUCTION 
 
            Petitioner
Cemex, Inc. (“Petitioner”) filed this petition for writ of mandate under Water
Code section 1126 and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 against
the State Water Resources Control Board (“Respondent” or the “Board”).  In 1991, Petitioner’s predecessor-in-interest
filed an application to appropriate water for its Soledad Canyon Project, which
was a proposal to develop a sand and gravel mine on an approximately 500-acre
site in the unincorporated Soledad Canyon area of Los Angeles County.  The Board issued a notice of Petitioner’s
application on May 7, 1993, which triggered the 40-day protest period.  On June 1, 2023, the Board sent a letter to
Petitioner stating that it intends to re-notice the application, triggering a
new 40-day protest period.  Petitioner
submitted a timely petition for reconsideration of this decision, and the Board
dismissed the petition on procedural grounds. 
Petitioner filed the instant petition challenging the Board’s decision
to re-notice the application and dismiss its petition for reconsideration of
that decision.  Now, the Board demurs,
arguing that these are not final decision and thus not ripe for review.  The court overrules the demurrer.
 
SUMMARY OF PETITION
 
            Petitioner is a construction and
building materials producer.  (Petition
for Writ of Mandate (“Pet.”) ¶ 7.)  In
June 1991, Petitioner filed a water rights application with Respondent “which
proposed the diversion of water from the Santa Clara River for mining and
industrial uses, and sought 0.95 cubic feet per second, not to exceed 322
acre-feet per annum.”  (Id. ¶
24.)  On May 7, 1993, Respondent deemed
the application complete and issued a public notice, which triggered a public
protest period mandated by the Water Code. 
(Id. ¶ 25.)  During the
protest period, ten protests were filed with the Board.  (Ibid.)  One was rejected by the Board for late
filing.  (Ibid.)  According to the petition, Petitioner “has
since worked to resolve outstanding protests and perfect its water rights
application. Such efforts have included the dismissal or voluntary withdrawal
of all but four pending protests, which have remained consistent since
2006.”  (Id. ¶ 27.)
 
            Petitioner alleges that the original
protest period closed in 1993, and the City of Santa Clarita (“City”) did not
file a protest during that period.  (Id.
¶ 2; see also Id. ¶¶ 17-23.)  In
2004 and 2016, Respondent rejected requests of City to re-notice the
application, noting that Petitioner had not requested an increase in the amount
of water for the project and the circumstances surrounding the application
remained unchanged.  (Id. ¶¶
28-34.)  
 
According to the petition, the
circumstances surrounding Petitioner’s application remain unchanged. (Id.
¶ 34.)  Nevertheless, on June 1, 2023,
the Board’s Executive Director sent a letter to counsel for Petitioner stating
that, “I have decided the application will be re-noticed.” (the “June 2023
Letter” or “Re-Notice Decision”). (Id., ¶ 35, Exh. 3.)  The Executive Director explained this
decision, as follows:
 
The application was originally noticed
on May 7,1993 and a decision on the application has been delayed for nearly
thirty years. Since that time, the circumstances of affected downstream water
users or other interested persons have changed. For example, many of the
entities that have filed protests against the application no longer exist due
to changes in property ownership and other factors. In addition, multiple
entities which did not file protests in response to the 1993 notice have
contacted the Division to request that the application be re-noticed so that
they have an opportunity to file a protest and participate in the proceedings
related to the application. For these reasons, I have determined that the
record does not reflect up-to-date circumstances and re-noticing of the
application is necessary. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, § 684, subd. (b).)[1]
 
(Ibid.)
 
The Petition alleges that the June 2023
Letter adopts the substance of proposed Assembly Bill 1631 (2023), “effectively
creating a de facto Board policy, without undergoing appropriate rule
making procedures, that would justify re-noticing long-pending applications
without meeting the actual regulation requirements adopted by the Board in 23
Cal. Code Regs. § 684(b).”  (Id. ¶
36.)  The petition alleges that the
Executive Director copied the coauthors of AB 1631 when she issued the June
2023 Letter. (Id., ¶ 36.)
 
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
 
            On June 28, 2023, Petitioner
submitted a timely petition for reconsideration of the June 2023 Letter.  (Id. ¶ 43, Exh. B.)  On August 30, 2023, Respondent dismissed the
petition on procedural grounds, specifically that the June 2023 Letter “does
not constitute a final water right decision or order” (the “Dismissal”).  (Id. ¶¶ 48-50 and Exh. 5.)
 
            On September 29, 2023, Petitioner
filed the instant petition asserting two causes of action.  The first cause of action challenges the
Re-Notice Decision.  The second cause of
action challenges the Dismissal.  Petitioner
contends that Board’s decisions were arbitrary, capricious, and entirely
lacking in evidentiary support; did not include sufficient findings to satisfy
the Topanga decision; were based on findings not supported by the
evidence; deprived Petitioner due process and would cause Petitioner
irreparable harm; and/or were contrary to law.  
(Id. ¶¶ 54-79.)  
 
            On January 10, 2024, Respondent
filed a demurrer, arguing that the petition is not ripe because neither
decision was a final decision subject to judicial review.  Petitioner filed an opposition on March 6,
2024, and Respondent filed a reply brief on April 10, 2024.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer must appear on the face of the
pleading or from judicially noticeable matters. (Code Civil Proc. § 430.30,
subd. (a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “We assume the
truth of the allegations in the complaint, but do not assume the truth of
contentions, deductions, or conclusions of law.”  (California
Logistics, Inc. v. State (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 242, 247.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and
not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.” 
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  The allegations in the petition must be
liberally construed in favor of Petitioner on demurrer.  (See Mobil Oil Corp. v Exxon Corp.
(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 942, 947.)  “A demurrer
must dispose of an entire cause of action to be sustained.”  (Poizner
v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            A.        The First Cause of Action: The Re-Notice
Decision 
 
            Respondent
demurs to the first cause of action—the Executive Director’s decision to
re-notice Petitioner’s application—arguing that it is not a final decision ripe
for review.  Respondent argues that this
petition is governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, which authorizes
writ relief for “a final administrative order or decision.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(a).)  By contrast, Petitioner argues that this
petition is governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, which authorizes
writ relief for “an act which the law specially enjoins.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1085(a).)  “[S]ection 1094.5 does not preclude a
broader challenge to agency conduct or procedures alleged to breach the agency’s
statutory obligations …. It is not inconsistent to award relief under
both sections 1094.5 and 1085 of the Code of
Civil Procedure.”  (Conlan v.
Bonta (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 745, 752.) 
The court need not resolve this issue at this stage, however,  because Respondent does not demonstrate that
the petition is unripe under section 1094.5(a).
 
“‘[A] basic prerequisite to
judicial review of administrative acts is the existence of a ripe
controversy.’ (Pacific Legal
Foundation v. California Coastal Com. (1982) 33 Cal.3d 158, 169, 188
Cal.Rptr. 104, 655 P.2d 306.) 
The ripeness doctrine is based upon the recognition that judicial
decisions are best made in the context of an actual set of facts so that the
issues will be framed with sufficient definiteness to enable the court to make
a decree finally disposing of the controversy. (Id. at
p. 170, 188 Cal.Rptr. 104, 655 P.2d 306.) ‘The controversy must be
definite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse
legal interests. [Citation.] It must be a real and substantial controversy
admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as
distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a
hypothetical state of facts.’ (Id. at
pp. 170–171, 188 Cal.Rptr. 104, 655 P.2d 306.) ‘A
controversy is ‘ripe’ when it has reached, but has not passed, the point that
the facts have sufficiently congealed to permit an intelligent and useful
decision to be made’.”  (Santa Teresa
Citizen Action Group v. City of San Jose (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 689,
708.)  
 
Respondent relies on Water Code
section 1126, which states, in pertinent part, as follows: “(b) Any party aggrieved
by any decision or order may, not later than 30 days from the date of final
action by the board, file a petition for a writ of mandate for review of the
decision or order. Except in cases where the decision or order is issued under
authority delegated to an officer or employee of the board, reconsideration
before the board is not an administrative remedy that is required to be
exhausted before filing a petition for writ of mandate…. (c)  Section 1094.5 of
the Code of Civil Procedure shall govern judicial proceedings
under this section….” (Water Code § 1126(a), (b), emphasis added.)  This language—“aggrieved by any decision or
order”—is broad. “Consistent with the ripeness doctrine, section 1126,
subdivision (b) applies to “[a]ny party aggrieved by
any decision or order....’ (Italics added.)  In other words, where an agency applies
regulations to a party’s injury, a sufficient controversy exists to satisfy the
ripeness requirement.”  (Phelps v,
State Water Resources Control Board (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 89, 103, citing Coral
Construction, Inc. v. City and County of San Francisco (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th
6, 26.)  
 
Here, the petition alleges that
the Board’s decision to re-notice Petitioner’s application is a “final
decision.”  (Pet. ¶ 70.)  In support of that allegation, the June 2023
Letter states that the Executive Director has determined that the application
“will be re-noticed.”  The Executive Director
did not identify any procedure for administrative appeal of this Re-Notice
Decision.  The Executive Director also
identified the specific reasons she “determined that the record does not
reflect up-to-date circumstances and re-noticing of the application is
necessary.  (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, §
684, subd. (b).)”  (Pet. Exh. 3.)  Thus, it appears from the petition that there
is a “final decision” and “the facts have sufficiently congealed to permit an
intelligent and useful decision to be made’.” 
(Santa Teresa, supra, 114 Cal.App.4th at 708.)  Further, Petitioner alleges how the Re-Notice
Decision could cause further delay to an application that has been pending for
more than 30 years and cause Petitioner irreparable harm.  (Pet. ¶ 62.) 
Because the Executive Director allegedly applied a regulation (23 Cal.
Code Reg. § 684(b)) to Petitioner’s injury, “a sufficient controversy exists to
satisfy the ripeness requirement.”  (Phelps,
supra, 157 Cal.App.4th at 98-99.)  
 
Respondent argues that Water
Code section 1126 authorizes judicial review of a “final action” of the Board,
and section 1094.5 addresses the validity of a “final administrative order.”
(Dem. 13.)  “‘A decision attains the requisite
administrative finality when the agency has exhausted its jurisdiction and
possesses ‘no further power to reconsider or rehear the claim.’ Finality may be
defined either expressly in the statutes governing the administrative process
or it may be determined from the framework in the statutory scheme…. Until a
public agency makes a ‘final’ decision, the matter is not ripe for judicial
review.”  (Cal. Water Impact Network v. Newhall County
Water Dist. (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1464, 1482.)  “The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative
remedies is a closely related concept to finality.  The policy reasons behind the two doctrines
are similar.  The exhaustion doctrine
precludes review of an intermediate or interlocutory action of an
administrative agency.”  (Id. at
1489.)
 
Respondent argues that
Petitioner must wait until it issues a final decision on the water rights
application to seek judicial review. 
(Dem. 13-14.)  Respondent does not
cite any statute or regulation governing water rights applications that clearly
supports that assertion.  Respondent
cites section 685 of the pertinent regulations, which states that “[i]ssuance
of a notice of application shall not be construed as a final determination that
the application is complete in all details.” 
(23 Cal. Code Reg. § 685.) 
Section 685 does not state that Respondent’s decision to re-notice an
application is only final after the Respondent reviews the water rights application.  Respondent also has not cited a statute or
regulation stating that there is any administrative appeal to exhaust to
challenge a decision to re-notice an application under section 684(b).    
 
Finally, Respondent does not demonstrate that the petition
necessarily fails to state cause of action. 
Generally, “the exhaustion doctrine precludes review of an intermediate
or interlocutory action of an administrative agency.”  (Alta Loma
School Dist. v. San Bernardino County Com. On School District Reorganization (1981)
124 Cal.App.3d 542, 554.)  However, there
are exceptions to the exhaustion requirement, including “when pursuit of an
administrative remedy would result in irreparable harm.”  (Edgren
v. Regents of University of California (1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 515, 520.)  Here, Petitioner filed its water rights
application in June 1991, and Respondent deemed the application complete in May
1993.  (Pet. ¶¶ 24, 25.)  Thus, the complete application has been
pending before Respondent for more than 30 years.  Petitioner also alleges that it “has since
worked to resolve outstanding protests and perfect its water rights
application” and “[s]uch efforts have included the dismissal or voluntary
withdrawal of all but four pending protests, which have remained consistent
since 2006.”  (Id. ¶ 27.)  Petitioner then alleges that the Re-Notice
Decision will cause Petitioner irreparable harm: “The Board’s Decision to
Re-Notice, if implemented, will allow parties who missed the statutory deadline
to file protests, to now file new protests, thus forcing CEMEX to respond as
required by the Water Code, perform new analysis, expend significant resources,
and further delay CEMEX’s ability to obtain necessary approvals for its Soledad
Canyon Project.” (Id. ¶ 62.) 
Respondent does not address these allegations in the petition or show
that they are insufficient to plead an exception to the exhaustion doctrine
based on irreparable harm.  
 
Given that Petitioner’s water
rights application has been pending for more than 30 years, there is a
reasonable inference that the re-noticed application could also require a
lengthy protest and review period.  Petitioner
also alleges that Respondent issued the Re-Notice Decision “despite there being
no changes in circumstances since the Board’s prior 2004 and 2016 decisions,
and despite CEMEX making no changes to the Application.”  (Pet. ¶ 35.) 
The court must accept the truth of these allegations for purposes of
demurrer.  In light of these allegations
concerning irreparable harm to Petitioner, the court is not persuaded by
Respondent’s contention, at the pleading stage, that the Re-Notice Decision is
immune from judicial review until after Respondent makes a final decision on
the re-noticed application and associated protests.  Respondent may further develop its ripeness
argument in the briefing for the writ trial.
 
B.        The Second Cause of Action: The Dismissal of the Petition for
Reconsideration 
 
In the second cause of action,
Petitioner alleges that Respondent failed to proceed as required by law when it
dismissed the petition for reconsideration on the grounds that the Re-Notice
Decision was not a final decision subject to judicial review.  (Pet. ¶¶ 67-79.)  Respondent contends that the second cause of
action fails because Respondent has no obligation to entertain petitions for
reconsideration and that its dismissal of the petition is not subject to
judicial review.  (Dem. 15-20.)  
 
            Pursuant
to Water Code section 1122, “[t]he board may order a reconsideration of all or
part of a decision or order on the board's own motion or on the filing of a
petition of any interested person or entity.”  The regulations provide that any person
interested in an application “may petition the board for reconsideration of the
matter upon any of the following causes: (a) Irregularity in the proceedings,
or any ruling, or abuse of discretion, by which the person was prevented from
having a fair hearing; (b) The decision or order is not supported by
substantial evidence; (c) There is relevant evidence which, in the exercise of
reasonable diligence, could not have been produced; (d) Error in law.”  (23 Cal. Code Reg. § 768.)  Respondent “may: (1) Refuse to reconsider the
decision or order if the petition fails to raise substantial issues related to
the causes for reconsideration set out in Section 768….”  (23 Cal. Code Reg. § 770(a).)  
 
            Respondent
acknowledges that “courts have not squarely addressed whether the State Water
Board must entertain petitions for reconsideration in the water rights context
under Water Code section 1122.”  (Dem.
16.)  Interpreting Water Code section
13320, the Court of Appeal has held that “a discretionary decision by the State
Board as to whether to review a regional board's decision imposing
administrative penalties is not subject to judicial review.”  (Johnson v. State Water Res. Control Bd.
(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1107, 1113.) 
Further, the Court of Appeal has held that “the state board retains
unreviewable discretion to determine what issues are ‘substantial’ and whether
they are ‘appropriate for review.’”  (People
ex rel. Cal. Regional Water Quality Control Board v. Barry (1987) 194
Cal.App.3d 158, 176.)
 
Here, Petitioner does not
challenge a decision by Respondent to deny reconsideration on the grounds that
the petition did not raise a “substantial” issue.  Rather, Petitioner contends that Respondent’s
dismissal of the petition—on the grounds there was no final decision or order—was
“contrary to law” because the Re-Notice Decision was final and subject to
reconsideration.  (Pet. ¶¶ 67-79.)  Thus, in effect, Petitioner contends that
Respondent did not even exercise discretion on the petition.  Further, as discussed above, Petitioner
alleges that it will suffer irreparable harm if the application is re-noticed
and the protest procedure is restarted after the current application has been
pending for more than 30 years.  
 
Given the allegations of the
petition, Petitioner has a colorable argument that mandamus could issue if
Respondent erroneously refused to exercise its discretion on the petition for
reconsideration.  (See AIDS Healthcare
Foundation v. Los Angeles County Dept. of Public Health (2011) 197
Cal.App.4th 693, 700 [“Mandamus does not lie to compel a public agency to exercise
discretionary powers in a particular manner, only to compel it to exercise
its discretion in some manner.”].)  In
the demurrer, Respondent does not cite any published appellate decision
holding that an agency’s refusal even to entertain a petition for
reconsideration and exercise its discretion, on legally erroneous grounds, cannot
be reviewed by mandate.  Respondent may
further develop its position in the briefing for the writ trial.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the court overrules the demurrer to the first and second causes
of action.  Respondent’s counsel shall
provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
