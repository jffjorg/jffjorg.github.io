  - "A challenge to the procedural fairness of the administrative hearing is reviewed de novo on appeal because the ultimate determination of procedural fairness amounts to a question of law."

The court grants the petition for a writ of administrative mandate, setting aside the DMV's decision to suspend Petitioner's driver's license. The matter is remanded to the DMV for a new administrative hearing.
