COURT’S [TENTATIVE] RULING
  RE: Motion to (1) Compel Verified Responses to Form Interrogatories and (2)
  Deem Requests for Admission Admitted
 



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE
RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]:
 
I. BACKGROUND
On September 14, 2021,
plaintiff Mariana Sinai Sanchez Tinoco (“Plaintiff”) and defendant Sara Rincon
(“Defendant”) were involved in a motor vehicle collision. (Complaint pp. 4–5.)
Plaintiff alleges that she thereby sustained injuries. (Id. at p. 5.)
 
On October 13, 2022,
Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit by filing a form complaint (the “Complaint”)
alleging causes of action for (1) motor vehicle negligence and (2) general
negligence.
 
On August 16, 2023,
Defendant filed an answer.
 
On December 11, 2023,
Plaintiff propounded a set of form interrogatories on Defendant and a set of
requests for admission. (Motion p. 3.) 
 
On March 20, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion to compel verified responses to form interrogatories
(the “Motion to Compel”) and the instant motion to deem requests for admission
admitted (the “Motion to Deem Admitted” and, together with the Motion to
Compel, the “Motions”). Both Motions are unopposed.
 
II. DISCUSSION
 

Motion to Compel Verified
     Responses to Form Interrogatories

 
Plaintiff
seeks an order compelling Defendant to provide verified responses, without
objection, to the form interrogatories it propounded on Defendant on December
11, 2023 and monetary sanctions against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel in
the amount of $2,660.00. (Notice of Motion pp. 1–2.)
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response,…[t]he party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.” (Cal. C. Civ.
Proc. §¿2030.290.) And, “a party's failure to object to
interrogatories within 30 days, or such additional time as extended by the
court, constitutes a waiver of any right to object.” (Leach v. Superior Court
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) In the absence of any response to the
discovery request, all that a motion to compel need show is that a set of¿interrogatories¿was
properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired,
and that no response of any kind has been served. (See id., 905–06.) 
 
Plaintiff attaches to the Motion to Compel evidence
that its discovery request was properly served on Defendant’s attorney by e-mail
on December 11, 2023 and that Defendant acknowledged receipt of the
interrogatories. (Motion Exh. A; Wright Decl. ¶ 7.) Defendant’s responses
thereto were therefore due 30 days later, on January 10, 2024. (Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. § 2030.260(a).) Plaintiff attaches to the Motion to Compel evidence
that no substantive response to its discovery request was received by that
response due date or thereafter. (Wright Decl. ¶¿10.)
Thus, Plaintiff has met its burden of showing that the Motion to Compel is
necessary.
 
Accordingly, the Motion to Compel is GRANTED.
 

Motion to Deem Requests for
     Admission Admitted 

 
Plaintiff
seeks an order compelling Defendant to admit the requests for admission
Plaintiff propounded on Defendant on December 11, 2023, or in the alternative,
an order compelling Defendant to provide verified responses to the requests for
admission, and for monetary sanctions against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel
in the amount of $2,660.00. (Notice of Motion pp. 1–2.)
 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by a written
request that any other party to the action admit the genuineness of specified
documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact, opinion relating to fact,
or application of law to fact. A request for admission may relate to a matter
that is in controversy between the parties.”¿(Cal. C. Civ. Proc. § 2033.010.) “Within 30 days
after service of requests for admission, the party to whom the requests are
directed shall serve the original of the response to them on the requesting
party, and a copy of the response on all other parties who have appeared.”¿(Cal. C. Civ. Proc. §¿2033.250(a).) 
 
If a party to whom request for admissions are served
fails to provide a timely response, the party to whom the request was directed
waives any objections, including based on privilege or the work product
doctrine. (Cal. C. Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(a).)
The requesting party can move for an order that the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted, as well as for monetary sanctions. (Cal. C.
Civ. Proc § 2033.280(b).) The court shall issue this order unless the
party to whom the request was made serves a response in substantial compliance
prior to the hearing on the motion. (Cal. C. Civ.
Proc. § 2033.280(c).) 
 
Plaintiff attaches to the Motion to Deem Admitted
evidence that the requests for admission were properly served on Defendant’s
attorney by email on December 11, 2023 and that Defendant acknowledged receipt
of the requests for admission. (Motion Exh. A; Wright Decl. ¶ 7.) Defendant’s
responses thereto were therefore due 30 days later, on January 10, 2024. (Cal.
C. Civ. Proc. § 2033.250(a).) Plaintiff attaches to the Motion to Deem Admitted
evidence that no response of any kind was received by that response due date or
thereafter. (Wright Decl. ¶¿10.)
Thus, Plaintiff has met its burden of showing that the Motion to Deem Admitted
is necessary. 
 
Accordingly,
the Motion to Deem Admitted is GRANTED. 
 

Sanctions

 
Sanctions are mandatory against the party, the
attorney, or both whose failure to serve a timely response to the request
necessitated the motion to compel response to interrogatories or the motion to
deem a request for admissions as admitted. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290,
subd. (c), 2033.280, subd. (c); see also Cal. Rules of Court R. 3.1348(a) (the
court can award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party seeking
to compel discovery even though no opposition was filed, the opposition was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed). “As to the amount of sanctions, California Code of Civil
Procedure §¿2023.030, subdivision (a)¿authorizes the trial court to impose an amount
representing ‘the
reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result’ of a party's misuse of the discovery
process.”
(Parker v. Wolters Kluwer United States, Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th
285, 294.) 
 
Each Motion request sanctions in the amount of $2,660.00
for a total of $5,320.00. (Notice of Motion p. 2.) For each Motion, this is
based upon two hours of attorney time spent preparing the Motion at a rate of $650.00
per hour and two hours of attorney time replying to any opposition and attending
the hearing on the Motion at the same rate, plus the $60.00 filing fee. (Wright
Decl. ¶ 11.) 
 
We note that no opposition to either Motion was ever
filed by Defendant, so Plaintiff’s counsel never needed to expend any time
responding to such. Also, the Motions are now being heard together, so
Plaintiff’s attorney only needs to appear at one hearing. We therefore believe
Plaintiff’s counsel should only be permitted to bill one hour once for appearing
at the hearing for both Motions. We find that two hours spent preparing each
Motion and Plaintiff’s counsel’s rate of $650.00 per hour are reasonable.
 
Thus, we believe that the reasonable amount of
attorney time spent on the Motions is the sum of two hours for each of the
Motions and one hour attending the hearing for a total of five hours. Five
hours billed at a rate of $650.00 per hour is $3,250.00. We believe that the
$60.00 expense to file each of the Motions is reasonable. The sum of reasonable
attorney’s fees and reasonable filing fees is therefore $3,370.00.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions against
Defendant is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $3,370.00. Sanctions are payable
within 30 days of service of this order.
