And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for attorney's fees filed by plaintiff Soghrat Khorsandi. The plaintiff seeks to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in a Song-Beverly action against defendants Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC and Triunity JLRNA, LLC dba Jaguar Land Rover North America Los Angeles. The defendants opposed the motion, claiming the time incurred was excessive.

The court granted the motion in part, awarding $31,500.00 in attorney's fees. The court also awarded costs in the amount of $2,665.08. The court ordered the moving party to give notice.

The court's analysis considered the rates and hours worked by plaintiff's counsel, as well as the complexity of the case. The court determined that a blended hourly rate of $450.00 per hour was reasonable. The court also reviewed the billing records and found that many of the defendants' objections to the fees were well-taken. However, the court found that the fees were still reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances.
