And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the Defendant, City of Los Angeles, granting their motion to compel the Plaintiff, Malvina Mkhchyan, Ovsanna Mkhchian, and Adam Bersigian, to respond to discovery requests. The Defendant had filed the motion after the Plaintiff failed to respond to requests for production of documents. The Judge also granted the Defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $525, to be paid by the Plaintiff and their counsel, K & L Associates. The ruling is based on the California Civil Procedure Code and California Rules of Court, which require parties to respond to discovery requests in a timely manner and impose sanctions for failure to do so. The Defendant had propounded the requests for production on February 16, 2023, and the Plaintiff failed to respond. The Judge found that the Defendant need show nothing more to demonstrate that the motion to compel was justified, and therefore granted the motion.
