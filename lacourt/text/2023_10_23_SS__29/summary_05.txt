And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motions to dismiss the claims of two plaintiffs (Juana Garcia Rolon and Rigoberto J. Magana) as terminating sanctions for discovery violations. The defendant had argued that the plaintiffs had failed to comply with court orders and discovery requests, and therefore, the court should impose a terminating sanction. However, the judge found that a terminating sanction was not warranted at this time, as the plaintiffs had made some small steps towards meeting their obligations, and the defendant had not demonstrated that a terminating sanction was necessary. The judge noted that the primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery Act and court orders, not to punish or to place a party in a better position than it would have been if the opposing party had complied with its obligations.
