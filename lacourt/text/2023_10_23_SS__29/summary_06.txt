And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to respond to discovery requests. The plaintiff had failed to respond to the defendant's Special Interrogatories (Set One) despite being served on May 25, 2023. The judge has also granted the defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $697.50, which is calculated as 1.5 hours of attorney work multiplied by counsel's reasonable billing rate of $425 per hour, plus the $60 filing fee. The plaintiff is ordered to provide verified, code-compliant, written responses to the defendant's discovery requests without objections within 30 days of notice of this order.
