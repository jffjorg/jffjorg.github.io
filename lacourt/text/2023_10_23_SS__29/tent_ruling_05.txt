 Case Number:  21STCV14135    Hearing Date:   October 23, 2023    Dept:  29 Tentative
 
The
motions to dismiss the claims of two of the plaintiffs as terminating sanctions
for discovery violations is DENIED.
 
Background
 
This case arises out of an alleged motor vehicle
accident on May 26, 2019, on the I-5 Freeway near Van Nuys Boulevard in
Pacoima, California.  
 
On April 13, 2021, Plaintiffs Jaime Rodriguez-Palos,
Rigoberto J. Magana, and Juana Garcia Rolon filed a complaint asserting causes
of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence against Henry
Muyomba, the Estate of Henry Muyomba, Susan Tamale Nantongo, Fook Choon Lee, PV
Holding Corp., and Does 1 through 100.
 
Defendants Fook Choon Lee and PV Holding Corp.
filed answers in July and August 2022.
 
On August 12, 2022, Defendants Fook Choon
Lee and PV Holding Corp. filed a cross-complaint against Henry Muyomba, the
Estate of Henry Muyomba, Susan Tamale Nantongo, and Roes 1 through 20. On
November 18, 2022, Cross-Defendant Susan Tamale Nantongo filed an answer to the
cross-complaint.
 
On December 16, 2022, Plaintiffs dismissed
their claims against Defendant Susan Tamale Nantongo without prejudice.
 
On August 1 and 2, 2023, the Court ordered
Plaintiffs Rigoberto J. Magana and Juana Garcia Rolon (“Plaintiffs”) to respond
to Defendant PV Holding Corp.’s Special Interrogatories, Form Interrogatories
and Requests for Production within 30 days. 
 
On September 21, 2023, Defendant PV Holding
Corp. (“Defendant”) filed the instant motions to dismiss the claims of
Plaintiffs, asserting that they had failed to comply with the Court’s August discovery
orders. On October 10, Plaintiffs filed their oppositions, and on October 13, Defendant
filed replies.   
 
Legal
Standard
 
“To the extent authorized by the chapter
governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of this title,
the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after
opportunity for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging
in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process: ... (d) The court may
impose a terminating sanction …."  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) “Misuses of the discovery process include, but are not
limited to, the following: ... (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery. ... (g) Disobeying a court order to provide
discovery."  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010.)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and “incremental
approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending
with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible &
Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be
appropriate to and commensurate with the misconduct, and they “should not
exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to
but denied discovery.” (Doppes v. Bentley
Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser sanction fails
to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of the
discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is
reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.;
see also, e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) 

Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes,
supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative
Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases
a court has the authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a
terminating sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has
attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the
record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246
Cal.App.4th at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are
“willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th
at p. 992.) Repeated
and willful violations of discovery orders that prejudice the opposing party
may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124
Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang
v. Hachman (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The primary purpose of discovery
sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery Act and the Court’s
orders. It is not to punish. (Newland
v. Super. Ct. (1995) 40
Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v.
Super Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery sanction should not create a “windfall” for
a party or place a party in a better position than it would have been if the
opposing party had simply complied with its obligations under the Court’s
orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
Discussion
 
As a threshold matter, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant failed to meet and
confer prior to filing this motion. Meeting and conferring before filing a
sanctions motion is undoubtedly a good and wise practice, but it is not mandatory.
(Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
 
Turning to the
merits, the Court has
carefully considered Defendant’s request for terminating sanctions. On this
record, the Court finds that it is not appropriate to grant that request at
this time. 
 
A terminating sanction is a drastic remedy
that is appropriate only in the extreme case. Discovery sanctions are meant to
enforce the obligations of the Civil Discovery Act, not to punish or to place
the propounding party in a better position than it would be in if it had
received timely responses. Here, Plaintiffs’ conduct merits substantial
sanctions. The ongoing failure to bring themselves into compliance with their
obligations under the Civil Discovery Act and this Court’s order raises serious
concerns. The Court also notes, however, that Plaintiffs and their counsel have
made some small steps – although plainly incomplete – toward meeting their
obligations. (See Suarez Decl., ¶ 3(r)-(t).) On balance, at this time, Defendant
has not yet demonstrated that a terminating sanction is warranted. 
 
Defendant does not request issue, evidentiary, or monetary sanctions.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant PV Holding Corp.’s Motions to Dismiss the claims of
Plaintiffs Juana Garcia Rolon and Rigoberto J. Magana are DENIED.  
 
Moving party to give notice.
