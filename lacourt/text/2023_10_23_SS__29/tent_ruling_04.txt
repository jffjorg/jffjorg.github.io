            On

relieved as counsel. On September 21, 2023, the Court continued the hearing on

Legal
Standard
 
The court may order that an attorney be
changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final
determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from
one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted
to withdraw where conflicts between the attorney and client make it
unreasonable to continue the representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof.
Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion
to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must
be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on
the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the
order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on
the client has been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
            Counsel has filed the
requisite forms pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1362. Counsel has served the forms on
Plaintiff and confirmed Plaintiff’s address by mail with return receipt
requested. Additionally, there is evidence that Counsel served Defendant at the
address of record.   
 
            Counsel declares that there
has been a “severe conflict of interest” as well as “derogative accusations”
that Plaintiff has made to counsel. Additionally, Counsel declares that
Plaintiff has failed to cooperate with Counsel. 
 
            The next hearing is set
for November 28, 2023 as a Trial Setting Conference. Additionally, on December
26, 2023, an OSC re: Dismissal is set. Trial is not set. As such, the Court
does not determine that Plaintiff will be prejudiced if Counsel is permitted to
withdraw. 
 
            As such, the motion to
be relieved as counsel is GRANTED. 
 
Conclusion
 
The motion to
be relieved as counsel is GRANTED. 
 
The order is
effective upon the filing with the Court of a proof of service showing service
of the order on Plaintiff.
 
Moving
counsel to give notice.
