And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Uber Technologies, Inc.'s motion to continue the trial from January 2, 2024 to early April 2024. The motion was granted based on good cause, as the plaintiff only recently sent new medical reports to the defendant alleging new injuries. The judge found that Uber needs more time to conduct further discovery and prepare for trial. The judge also noted that the recent developments in the plaintiff's condition and treatment warrant further discovery and a brief continuance of trial. The final status conference and all discovery deadlines will be reset based on the new trial date.
