Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District (“LAUSD”)
moves for judgment on the pleadings as to the Complaint filed by Plaintiff John
Doe A.P. (“Plaintiff”).
 
The Court DENIES LAUSD’s motion.
 
Background
 
This is a childhood sexual assault case. Plaintiff alleges
that Defendant Yanez, during his employment as a teacher at Defendant Los
Angeles Unified School District (“LAUSD”), committed acts of sexual abuse
against Plaintiff during the 1981 school year, when Plaintiff was a minor
student at LAUSD.
 
Around 1997, Yanez was convicted of sexual abuse of another
minor.
 
In around 1997 or 1998, the Commission suspended and
subsequently revoked Yanez’s teaching credentials.
 
Plaintiff filed this action against Doe 1 and Doe 2 on
November 15, 2022, raising claims for (1) childhood sexual abuse; (2)
intentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”); (3) negligent hiring,
supervision, and retention of unfit employee under Government Code, sections
815.2 and 820; (4) failure to report suspected child abuse under Government
Code, sections 815.2 and 820; (5) negligent supervision of a minor; and (6)
negligence.
 
LAUSD was named as a defendant by Doe amendment on April 21,
2023. Yanez was named as a defendant by Doe amendment on April 27, 2023.
 
On July 14, 2023, Yanez was dismissed from this action per
Plaintiff’s request.
 
Legal Standard
 
Either prior to trial, but after the time to answer or demur
has passed, or at the trial, the plaintiff or the defendant may move for
judgment on the pleadings and that the appropriate ground for such a motion is
the same as that arguable by general demurrer, namely, the failure to state a
cause of action or defense. (Dobbins v. Hardister (1966) 242 Cal.App.2d
787, 791; See also Sofias v. Bank of America (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 583,
586 [The non-statutory motion for judgment on the pleadings can be made at any
time, even during trial, since the grounds for a general demurrer are never
waived.], see also Code Civ. Proc., §438(f).)  
 
A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same
function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the
face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed. (See, e.g.,
Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (TRG 1998)
§§ 7:275, 7:322; Lance Camper Manufacturing Corp. v. Republic Indemnity Co.
(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198.) Presentation of extrinsic evidence is
therefore not proper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings. (Id.; Cloud
v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.) Both a demurrer
and a motion for judgment on the pleadings accept as true all material factual
allegations of the challenged pleading, unless contrary to law or to facts of
which a court may take judicial notice. (Mechanical Contractors Assn. v.
Greater Bay Area Assn. (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 672, 677; Edwards v. Centex
Real Estate Corp, (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 15, 27.) 
 
The motion may be made only after one of the following
conditions has occurred: (1) If the moving party is a plaintiff, and the
defendant has already filed his or her answer to the complaint and the time for
the plaintiff to demur to the answer has expired; (2) If the moving party is a
defendant, and the defendant has already filed his or her answer to the
complaint and the time for the defendant to demur to the complaint has expired.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 438(f).) The motion provided for in Code of Civil Procedure
section 438 may be made even though either of the following conditions
exist:  (1) The moving party has already demurred to the complaint or
answer, as the case may be, on the same grounds as is the basis for the motion
provided for in this section and the demurrer has been overruled, provided that
there has been a material change in applicable case law or statute since the
ruling on the demurrer; (2) The moving party did not demur to the complaint or
answer, as the case may be, on the same grounds as is the basis for the motion
provided for in this section. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438(g).) No motion may be
made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 438 if a pretrial conference
order has been entered pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 575, or
within 30 days of the date the action is initially set for trial, whichever is
later, unless the court otherwise permits. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438(e).)
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
did not submit a claim under the Government Claims Act (“GCA”) prior to filing
suit and does not allege that he did. LAUSD argues that this bars Plaintiff’s
claims. LAUSD argues that Government Code, section 905, subd. (m) and Code of
Civil Procedure, section 340.1 are unconstitutional to the extent that they
retroactively waive the GCA requirement.
 
Government Claims Act
 
 
            “The
Government Tort Claims Act (Gov. Code, § 810 et seq.) requires that ‘[b]efore
suing a public entity, the plaintiff must present a timely written claim for
damages to the entity. [Citations.]’” (A.M. v. Ventura Unified School Dist.
(2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1252, 1257, as modified (Oct. 19, 2016), quoting Shirk
v. Vista Unified School Dist. (2007) 42 Cal.4th 201, 208 [superseded on
other grounds by statute as discussed, infra].) “A claim relating to a
cause of action for […] injury to person[s] […] shall be presented […] not
later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.” (Gov. Code, §
911.2, subd. (a).) “With certain exceptions, once a claim has been presented
and rejected, a plaintiff has six months to file a lawsuit.” (A.M. v.
Ventura Unified School Dist., supra, 3 Cal.App.5th at p. 1257.)
 
Background on AB 218
 
            Code
of Civil Procedure, section 340.1 provides the statute of limitations for
recovery of damages for childhood sexual assault. (Code Civ. Proc., § 340.1.)
 
            In
Shirk v. Vista Unified School Dist., the California Supreme Court held
that a timely six-month claim is a prerequisite to maintaining an action for
childhood sexual abuse against a public entity school. (Shirk, supra,
42 Cal.4th at p. 214, 64.)
 
            “In
direct response to Shirk, the Legislature enacted Government Code section 905,
subdivision (m), which eliminates the claim presentation requirement for
‘[c]laims made pursuant to Section 340.1 ... for the recovery of damages
suffered as a result of childhood sexual abuse.’” (A.M. v. Ventura Unified
School Dist., supra, 3 Cal.App.5th at p. 1258, quoting Assem. Com.
on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 640 (2007–2008 Reg. Sess.) as amended
June 9, 2008, p. 3.) “This exemption [applied] to claims arising out of conduct
occurring on or after January 1, 2009.” (Ibid.)
 
“AB 218, which took effect January 1, 2020, revived claims
for childhood sexual abuse, regardless of when the sexual abuse allegedly took
place, for a three-year period that expired December 31, 2022.” (West Contra
Costa Unified School District v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County
(Cal. Ct. App., July 31, 2024, No. A169314) --- Cal.Rptr.3d ---, 2024 WL
3593932, at *2 (“West Contra”.) “The statute expressly revived claims
that would otherwise be barred as of January 1, 2020, because the applicable
statute of limitations, claim presentation deadline, or any other time limit
had expired.” (Ibid [quotation marks and citation omitted].) “AB 218
removed [Government Code, section 905, subd. (m)’s limitation to claims arising
on or after January 1, 2009], so Government Code section 905, subdivision (m)
exempts all claims based on childhood sexual assault from the claim
presentation requirement.” (Ibid.)
 
The Prohibition on Gifts of Public Funds
 
            LAUSD
raises legal issues concerning the waiver presentation that appear to have been
decided by the Court of Appeal a few weeks ago. 
In both this case and the Court of Appeal case, the issue is the same: “The
District contends that AB 218's retroactive waiver of the claim presentation
requirement constitutes an unconstitutional gift of public funds.” (West
Contra, supra, --- Cal.Rptr.3d ---, 2024 WL 3593932, at *3; see also
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings at p. 6:4-10.) 
 
            The
gift clause states that “[t]he Legislature shall have no power ... to make any
gift or authorize the making of any gift, of any public money or thing of value
to any individual, municipal or other corporation whatever […]” (Cal. Const.,
art. XVI, § 6.) “The gift clause denies to the legislature the right to make
direct appropriations to individuals from general considerations of charity or
gratitude, or because of some supposed moral obligation resting upon the people
of the state […] It was because of abuses which had crept into legislation by
reason of the unlimited power theretofore exercised by the legislature in
determining what individual claims should be recognized by private statute, and
to relieve in some degree legislators from the importunities of persons
interested in securing such appropriations, that the power of the legislature
was thus limited by the present constitution of this state.” (West Contra,
supra, --- Cal.Rptr.3d ---, 2024 WL 3593932, at *3 [quotation marks and
citation omitted].)
 
            “However,
a ‘gift’ of public funds is not unconstitutional if ‘it is to be used for a
public rather than a private purpose.... That is because “[t]he benefit to the
state from an expenditure for a ‘public purpose’ is in the nature of
consideration and the funds expended are therefore not a gift even though
private persons are benefited there from.” ’ ” (West Contra, supra,
--- Cal.Rptr.3d ---, 2024 WL 3593932, at *3, quoting Westly v. U.S. Bancorp
(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 577, 583.)
 
            LAUSD
raises nearly identical arguments to the defendant in West Contra. 
 
West Contra contains two instructive holdings on this
issue. First, “waiver of the claim presentation requirement did not constitute
an expenditure of public funds that may be considered a “gift” because AB 218
did not create new “substantive liability” [citation] for the underlying
alleged wrongful conduct. Instead, AB 218 simply waived a condition the state
had imposed on its consent to suit.” (West Contra, supra, ---
Cal.Rptr.3d ---, 2024 WL 3593932, at *4.)
 
Second, even if the GCA waiver constituted a gift, “AB 218
may be sustained [….] [because] the Legislature's purpose to aid the
disadvantaged group of childhood sex assault victims in the present case is
analogous to the intent to offer relief to other disadvantaged groups” in
caselaw upholding gifts intended to aid disadvantaged groups. (West Contra,
supra, --- Cal.Rptr.3d ---, 2024 WL 3593932, at *10.)
 
LAUSD argues that West Contra’s conclusion that that
AB 218 does not create new liability was wrong because the California Supreme
Court held in Shirk that “[t]imely claim presentation is not merely a
procedural requirement, but is, […] a condition precedent to plaintiff's
maintaining an action against defendant, and thus an element of the plaintiff's
cause of action.” (Shirk v. Vista Unified School Dist., supra, 42
Cal.4th at p. 209 [quotation marks and citations omitted].) As an initial
matter, the Court considers itself bound by the Court of Appeal decision in West
Contra. Moreover, the Court does not need to determine whether LAUSD’s argument
against West Contra’s analysis of the new liability issue is correct,
because of West Contra’s further holding that AB 218 has a public
purpose even if it is a gift. (West Contra, supra, ---
Cal.Rptr.3d ---, 2024 WL 3593932, at *10.)
 
            LAUSD
argues that AB 218 lacks a public purpose. The case law it cites indicates  otherwise. (See California Housing Finance
Agency v. Elliott (1976) 17 Cal.3d 575, 583-84, [“There is considerable
case law supporting the Agency's contention that the Legislature acted
reasonably in concluding that decent housing for the affected persons serves a
public purpose.”]; Los Angeles County v. La Fuente (1942) 20 Cal.2d 870,
877 [“The care and relief of aged persons who are in need clearly may be a
special matter of state concern in promoting public health and welfare.”]; City
& Cnty. of San Francisco v. Collins (1932) 216 Cal. 187, 190, 13 P.2d
912 [approving bonds for “the relief of [the City's] indigent sick and
dependent poor”].)  Similarly, here, the
provision of relief for child victims of sexual abuse is a public purpose.
 
            The
Court therefore applies West Contra’s holding that AB 218 does not
violate the gift clause. Plaintiff’s claims are therefore not barred by the
GCA.
 
            The
Court denies the motion for judgment on the pleadings.
