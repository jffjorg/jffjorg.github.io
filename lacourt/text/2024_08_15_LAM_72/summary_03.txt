```

Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies LAUSD's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which sought to dismiss Plaintiff's claims for childhood sexual abuse. The Judge found that the waiver of the claim presentation requirement in AB 218, which revived claims for childhood sexual abuse, does not constitute an unconstitutional gift of public funds. The Judge also held that providing relief for child victims of sexual abuse is a public purpose, and therefore, Plaintiff's claims are not barred by the Government Claims Act (GCA).
