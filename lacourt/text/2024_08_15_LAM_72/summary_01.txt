And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has ruled on Aykem's motion for reconsideration of the May 29 Order, which granted the motion for leave to amend the complaint to add Aykem as a defendant and denied Aykem's motion to intervene. The Court denies Aykem's motion for reconsideration in its entirety.

The Court finds that Aykem has not raised a meritorious argument for denial of leave to amend in the present motion, despite additional time to prepare following the May 29 Order. The Court also declines to exercise its discretion to relieve Aykem from the judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), as Aykem has not demonstrated a mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect that would warrant relief.

The Court also denies Aykem's motion to intervene, as it was previously denied as moot following the decision to grant leave to amend. The Court finds that the decision to grant leave to amend was correct, as the plain text of section 473 permits amendment to add a party. The Court will follow the interpretation of section 473 laid out in Fifth & Broadway Partnership v. Kimny, Inc. and Nissan v. Barton, which holds that section 473 allows amendment to add a party.

The Court grants the parties' requests for judicial notice and takes notice of the requested materials as public records. The Court's ruling will be final unless one of the parties files a timely appeal.
