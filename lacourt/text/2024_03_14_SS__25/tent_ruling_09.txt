BACKGROUND
 
On October 04, 2023, Petitioner Van’s
Mobilehome Park, LLC (“Petitioner”) filed a Petition for Declaration of
Abandonment of Mobilehome (the “Petition”) against Respondents Margaret J
Dawson (“Dawson”) and Green Tree Financial Servicing Corporation (“GFSC”)
(collectively, “Respondents”). On January 04, 2024, Petitioner filed the
instant First Amended Petition to Declare Mobile Home Abandoned (“Amended
Petition”). 
 
Petitioner seeks a declaration that
the mobilehome located at 8723 E Artesia Sp 38, Bellflower, California 90706,
and described as a 1969 Fleetwood, Decal Number AAV7511, Serial Number S11753, (the
“Mobilehome”) is abandoned. Petitioner also seeks: (1) rent and other
applicable charges as of the date of judgment; (2) storage costs equal to the
rent due and other applicable charges from the date of judgment till sale of
the Mobilehome or other disposition; (3) attorneys’ fees; (4) court costs; and
(5) other and further relief as the Court shall deem just and proper.
(Petition, p.3.) 
 
            On January
29, 2024, Petitioner moved for default and default judgment to be entered
against both Respondents. The Clerk did not enter default noting deficiencies
with the request. 
 
            On February
07, 2024, the Court on its own motion continued the hearing on the Petition to
March 14, 2024, noting deficiencies in the instant Petition. The Court ordered
Petitioner to file supplemental papers addressing the issue of whether the
Mobilehome can be defined as an “abandoned mobilehome” under Civil Code §
798.61(a)(1). 
 
            On February
13, 2024, the Petitioner filed a supplemental declaration in support of the
Petition.
 
No opposition has been filed.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard & Discussion 
A.         Determination
of “Abandoned Mobilehome” —Civ. Code § 798.61(a)(1) 
 
Pursuant to Civil Code, section
798.61, subdivision (a)(1), an “‘abandoned mobilehome’ means a mobilehome about
which all of the following are true: 
 
(A) It is located in a mobilehome park on a site for which
no rent has been paid to the management for the preceding 60 days. 
 
(B) It is unoccupied. 
                                                                                                                                         
(C) A reasonable person would
believe it to be abandoned. 
 
(D) It is not permanently affixed
to the land.” 
 
(Civ. Code, §
798.61(a)(1)(A)-(D).)
 
In the Court’s previous order, the
Court found that Petitioner had not made a sufficient showing under Civil Code
section 798.61(a)(1). (02/07/24 Minute Order.) Specifically, that Petitioner
did not provide any indication via admissible evidence as to whether a
reasonable person would believe the Mobilehome to be abandoned. (Id.)
 
Here, Petitioner provides a
supplemental declaration from Alison Phillips, the property manager of Van’s
Mobilehome Park. Ms. Phillips declares that no rent has been paid to management
for the Mobilehome since June 2023. (Alison Phillips Suppl. Decl. ¶ 4.) The
Mobilehome is not permanently affixed to the space it is located on. (Id.
¶ 7.) A reasonable person would believe the Mobilehome to be unoccupied because
the former occupant, Joe Bean, who was not the registered or legal owner of the
Mobilehome, has not been seen at the premises since June 2023. (Id. ¶
5.) Ms. Phillips further states that no one else has been seen at or reported
to be occupying the Mobilehome, and that the utility usage reflects the minimum
base charges. (Id.) Moreover, a reasonable person would believe that the
Mobilehome is abandoned for the same reasons. (Id. ¶ 6.)
 
Here, the Court finds that based on
Petitioner’s supplemental declaration, Petitioner provides evidence that
satisfies the statutory definition of an “abandoned mobilehome”. Thus, the Amended
Petition satisfies the requirements under Civil Code § 798.61(a).
 
B.         Notice of Belief of Abandonment—Civ.
Code § 798.61(b)
 
Civil
Code, section 798.61, subdivision (b) requires: 
 
After determining a mobilehome in a
mobilehome park to be an abandoned mobilehome, the management shall post a
notice of belief of abandonment on the mobilehome for not less than 30 days,
and shall deposit copies of the notice in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the homeowner at the last known address and to any known
registered owner, if different from the homeowner, and to any known holder of a
security interest in the abandoned mobilehome. This notice shall be mailed by
registered or certified mail with a return receipt requested. 
 
(Civ. Code, §
798.61(b).)
 
The Court finds that the Amended
Petition complies with Civil Code section 798.61(b). Here, in Petitioner’s original
accompanying declaration, the Notice of Abandonment, which is attached as
Exhibit 1 to the Amended Petition, was posted on the mobile home pursuant to
Civ. Code Section 798.61 and served via certified mail on August 09, 2023. (Amended
Pet. P. 2; Alison Phillips Decl. ¶ 7.) Therefore, Petitioner has made a
sufficient showing that it complied with Civil Code section 798.61(b).
 
C.        Petition for Judicial Declaration—Civ. Code § 798.61(c) 
 
Civil Code section 798.61,
subdivision (c)(1) states that:
 
Thirty or more days following posting pursuant to
subdivision (b), the management may file a petition in the superior court in
the county in which the mobilehome park is located, for a judicial declaration
of abandonment of the mobilehome. A proceeding under this subdivision is a
limited civil case. Copies of the petition shall be served upon the homeowner,
any known registered owner, and any known person having a lien or security
interest of record in the mobilehome by posting a copy on the mobilehome and mailing
copies to those persons at their last known addresses by registered or
certified mail with a return receipt requested in the United States mail,
postage prepaid.
 
(Civ. Code, § 798.61(c).)

 
Here, the Court finds that the Petitioner
has complied with Civil Code section 798.61(c)(1). Proofs of service filed on
January 29, 2024, indicate that both Dawson and GFSC were served with the
Petition by posting a copy on the mobilehome and by mail. (01/29/24 Proof of
Service by Posting.) Thus, Petitioner has complied with Civil Code section
798.61(c)(1).        
 
D.        Charges, Attorney’s Fees, and Costs 
 
Civil Code section 798.61,
subdivision (d)(2) provides that: 
 
If, at the hearing, the petitioner shows by a
preponderance of the evidence that the criteria for an abandoned mobilehome has
been satisfied and no party establishes an interest therein at the hearing and
tenders all past due rent and other charges, the court shall enter a judgment
of abandonment, determine the amount of charges to which the petitioner is
entitled, and award attorney's fees and costs to the petitioner. 
 
(Civ. Code, § 798.61(d)(2).)
 
The Court finds that the Petitioner has shown by a
preponderance of evidence that the criteria for an abandoned mobilehome has
been satisfied. Further, the Court notes that no other party has established an
interest in the Mobilehome as evidenced by the lack of opposition to the
Petition.  
 
In Petitioner’s initial declaration filed January 29, 2023,
Petitioner sought six months of storage costs, calculated at $831.40 per
month based on the former space rent Respondent was paying at the time the
Mobilehome was abandoned, in the total amount of $4,988.40. (Phillips Decl. ¶¶
8-10; Exh.4) Petitioner provides in its supplemental declaration, unpaid
statements beginning July 1, 2023, through February 1, 2024, noting that the
last time rent was paid was on June 1, 2023. (Alison Phillips Suppl. Decl. ¶ 4.)  Therefore, the Court awards Petitioner
storage costs in the amount of $6,651.20, for eight months from July 1, 2023,
through February 2024.  
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the Petition
and awards the Petitioner $6,651.20 in storage costs.      
 
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Petitioner Van’s
Mobilehome Park, LLC’s Petition to Declare Mobilehome Abandoned is GRANTED. 
 
Petitioner is awarded $6,651.20 in storage
costs.
 
Counsel for Petitioner is ordered to
electronically submit to the Court a proposed “Judgment of Abandonment”, consistent
with this Court’s Ruling, within 10-days.
 
Petitioner is ordered to give
notice of the Court’s ruling.
