Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, filed a motion to vacate the dismissal of the case and enter judgment against the defendants, Ana Mazariegos-Martinez, Jesus Lugo Soto, and Ricardo Garcia. The motion is granted. The court finds that the settlement agreement between the parties is valid and enforceable under California Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6. The settlement agreement provides that the parties had reached a settlement for $10,877.96, with the defendants making monthly payments of $50.00 until the remaining amount was paid in full. However, the defendants defaulted on their payments, and the plaintiff mailed default letters to the defendants. Since the defendants failed to cure the default, the plaintiff is entitled to file a motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment. The court grants the motion and enters judgment against the defendants in the amount of $3,442.60.
