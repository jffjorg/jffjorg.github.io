BACKGROUND
On April 24, 2017, Judgment Creditor Tres Pueblos Homeowners
Association (“Judgment Creditor”) filed an Application for Entry of Judgment on
Sister-State Judgment against Judgment Debtors Claudia Quihuis and Aurelio
Vecchiola (collectively, “Judgment Debtors”). A judgment of $6,585.23 was
entered in favor of Judgment Creditor on April 24, 2017. Following a motion for
attorney’s fees and additional costs, the Court amended the judgment to
$11,566.23 on October 3, 2018.
On August 17, 2020, Judgment Creditor filed a Motion for Attorney’s
Fees and Costs to recover costs to enforce judgment incurred between June 11,
2018, and the filing of its motion. On March 25, 2021, the Court granted
Judgment Creditor’s Motion for $2,698.00. 
On June 30, 2022, Judgment Creditor filed a second Motion for
Attorney’s Fees and Costs (the “Motion”) to recover costs to enforce judgment
incurred between July 1, 2020, and June 29, 2022, in the amount of $2,589.26.
On September 29, 2022, the Court granted Judgment Creditor’s Motion for $2,589.26.
On December 19, 2023, Judgment Creditor filed the instant (third)
Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs (the “Motion”) to recover costs to enforce
judgment incurred from June 29, 2022, to the present, in the amount of $2,536.49.
No opposition has been filed.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Request
for Judicial Notice
The motion is
accompanied by a request for judicial notice of the (1) the Declaration of
Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions and Easements for Tres Pueblos, Lots
1-595 and Common Areas"A-1" thru "A-4" recorded in the Pima
County, Arizona Recorder's Office on July 8, 2005 as Instrument No. 20051310872
labeled as “Exhibit 1” (2) the Judgement entered in the Pima Consolidated
Justice Court, in Pima County, Arizona, entitled Tres Pueblos Homeowners
Association v. Claudia Quihuis and Aurelio Vecchio/a with case number
CV15-009496 labeled as “Exhibit 2”; and (3) the Notice of Entry of judgement on
Sister-State Judgement entered in the Los Angeles County Superior Court with
the case number 17K04418 and labeled as “Exhibit 3.”
Judgment
Creditor’s request for judicial notice is DENIED because Judgment Creditor has
not provided proof of service indicating that the requests were properly served
on Judgment Debtors. Moreover, the Court notes that the request is improperly
filed as it is filed with the motion instead of being filed separately.
Therefore, the Court denies the request to take judicial notice.
 
II.        Legal
Standard
 A prevailing
party is entitled to recover costs, including attorney’s fees, as a matter of
right.  (See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1032(a)(4), 1032(b), 1033.5.) 
Attorney’s fees are allowable as costs when
authorized by contract, statute, or law.  (Code Civ. Proc. §
1033.5(a)(10).)  
 
“The judgment creditor is entitled to the reasonable and
necessary costs of enforcing a judgment.  Attorney’s fees incurred in
enforcing a judgment are not included in costs collectible under this title
unless otherwise provided by law.  Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a
judgment are included as costs collectible under this title if the underlying
judgment includes an award of attorney’s fees to the judgment creditor pursuant
to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section 1033.5.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 685.040.) 
 
“The judgment creditor may claim costs authorized by
Section 685.040 by noticed motion.  The motion shall be made before the
judgment is satisfied in full, but not later than two years after the costs
have been incurred.  The costs claimed under this section may include, but
are not limited to, costs that may be claimed under Section 685.070 and costs
incurred but not approved by the court or referee in a proceeding under Chapter
6 (commencing with Section 708.010) of Division 2.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
685.080(a).) 
 
“The notice of motion shall describe the costs claimed,
shall state their amount, and shall be supported by an affidavit of a person
who has knowledge of the facts stating that to the person’s best knowledge and
belief the costs are correct, are reasonable and necessary, and have not been
satisfied.  The notice of motion shall be served on the Judgment Debtor. 
Service shall be made personally or by mail.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
685.080(b).) 
 
III.       Discussion 
 
Here, the Court
notes that Judgment Creditor has not filed Proof of Service indicating that
Judgment Debtor was served with the moving papers either personally or by mail.
Moreover, Judgment Creditor improperly files its request for judicial notice as
part of the motion instead of as a separately filed noticed motion. Thus, for this
reason the Court CONTINUES the hearing on the instant Motion to April 29, 2024
at 10:00 a.m. 
 
IV.       Conclusion 
            
            Judgment Creditor Tres
Pueblos Homeowners Association’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs is CONTINUED TO
April  29, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. in
Department 25 of the  SPRING STREET
COURTHOUSE. 
 
At least 16 court days before the
next scheduled hearing, Creditor must file and serve supplemental papers
addressing the issuance of service of the motion on Judgment Debtors as well as
provide a separately noticed request for judicial notice. Failure to do so will
result in the Motion being placed off calendar or denied.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
