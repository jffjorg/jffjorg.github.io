The  Court granted Plaintiff’s motions, ordering Defendant to serve verified  responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production without objection, and deeming  Plaintiff’s request for admissions as admitted against the Defendant. The Court  additionally granted in part Plaintiff’s request for sanctions and awarded Plaintiff  sanctions in the amount of $1,310.00.    On January 08, 2024, Plaintiff  filed the instant Motion to Enter Default and for Monetary Sanctions against  Asif Iqbal in the total amount of $2,185.00.    No opposition has been filed.    MOVING PARTY  POSITION   Plaintiff prays for the Court to issue an order striking Defendant’s  Answer and for entry of default against Defendant for failure to obey the  Court’s prior discovery orders under CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.310, 2033.280 and 2023.030.  Plaintiff asserts that Defendant’s actions constitute a misuse of the discovery  process because Defendant has not provided any verified, objection free  responses to Plaintiff’s discovery request or paid sanctions as required by the  Court’s November 13, 2023, order. Plaintiff additionally requests that  sanctions be entered against the Defendant in the amount of $2,185.00.   OPPOSITION               No  opposition has been filed.    REPLY               No reply  has been filed.    ANALYSIS   I.          Legal  Standard Where a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts  have discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence, or monetary  sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010(d), (g), 2023.030; R.S. Creative,  Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.)    Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.040 requires that “[a]  request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every person,  party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify the type  of sanction sought.”  Furthermore, the notice of motion shall be supported  by a memorandum of points and authorities and accompanied by a declaration  setting forth facts supporting the amount of any monetary sanction  sought.  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.040.)    Monetary sanctions may be imposed “ordering that one engaging in the  misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both  pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a  result of that conduct…unless [the Court] finds that the one subject to the  sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make  the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. §  2030.030(a).)    Issue sanctions may be imposed “ordering that designated  facts shall be taken as established in the action in accordance with the claim  of the party adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery process. The  court may also impose an issue sanction by an order prohibiting any party  engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from supporting or opposing  designated claims or defenses.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(b).)    Evidence sanctions may be imposed “by an order prohibiting any party  engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from introducing designated  matters in evidence.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(c).)    In more extreme cases, the Court may also impose  terminating sanctions by “striking out the pleadings or parts of the  pleadings,” “staying further proceedings,” “dismissing the action, or any part  of the action,” or “rending a judgment by default” against the party misusing  the discovery process.  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(d).)  The  court should look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether  terminating sanctions are appropriate.  (Lang v. Hochman (2000)  77¿Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)  Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified  where there is a willful discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and  evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with  discovery rules.  (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196¿Cal.App.4th 1495,  1516.)  “[A] penalty as severe as dismissal or default is not authorized  where noncompliance with discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather  than willfulness or bad faith.”  (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d  701, 707.)  “Although in extreme cases a court has the authority to order  a terminating sanction as a first measure [citations], a terminating sanction  should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less severe  alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows  lesser sanctions would be ineffective.”  (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible and  Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604-605.)    II.        Discussion    Plaintiff moves for terminating sanctions,  striking Defendant’s Answer to the Complaint, for default to be entered against  Defendant, and for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,185.00 for expenses  incurred in bringing the instant Motion. (Mot. p. 7.) Plaintiff argues that  sanctions are appropriate because Defendant has failed to respond to  Plaintiff’s Request for Production, Set One, even after the Court order  Defendant to provide verified responses on November 13, 2023. (Id. p.2)    Plaintiff provides the Court with the  declaration of its Counsel who states that Plaintiff served its first set of  discovery requests on July 10, 2023. (Joshua P. Friedman Decl. ¶ 2.) Defendant  did not respond to the discovery request, nor counsel’s attempt to meet and  confer, so Plaintiff filed its motion to compel responses. (Id. ¶¶ 3-4.)  Defendant did not oppose Plaintiff’s motions and on November 13, 2023, the  Court granted the motion, ordering the Defendant to provide verified responses,  without objections, and to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,310.00, within 20  days of notice of the order. (Id.  ¶  4; 11-13-23 Minute Order.) Counsel avers that to date Defendant has  refused to provide verified responses despite the Court’s order and Plaintiff’s  request. (Id. ¶ 5.)  Moreover, the  parties have been unable to informally resolve the issues outside of court. (Id.)  Thus, the Court finds that Defendant has not complied with the Court’s order. Plaintiff argues that because of Defendant’s obstinance in  responding to Plaintiff’s discovery request or Plaintiff’s meet and confer efforts,  Defendant has abused the discovery process. (Mot. p. 6.)   Plaintiff seeks $2,185.00 in monetary sanctions for more than two  (2) hours drafting the motion at a rate of $425.00 per hour. Plaintiff anticipates  spending an additional one hour preparing a reply to any opposition, and two  (2) hours attending the hearing on the motion. (Friedman Decl. ¶ 6.)  Plaintiff also seeks $60.00 in costs, for a  total of $2,185.00 in sanctions. (Mot. p.6)   The Court notes that since filing his Answer  on June 27, 2023, Defendant has not responded to Plaintiff’s discovery  requests, motions to compel discovery, or the instant motion for terminating sanctions.  It appears that Defendant has willfully abandoned this litigation. Although  terminating sanctions are a harsh penalty, the history in the instant case  demonstrates that Defendant is unwilling to comply with Plaintiff’s requests or  the Court’s orders and thus, lesser sanctions have not been effective in  producing compliance. Here, Defendant has not filed any opposition to this Motion  to argue why his failure to engage in discovery was due to an inability to  comply or otherwise as opposed to bad faith.    Thus, for these reasons, the Court finds  an order striking Defendants’ Answer to be appropriate. Defendant Asif  Iqbal’s Answer is HEREBY STRICKEN. Plaintiff may separately move for default to  be entered against Defendant.    However, the Court declines to award  further monetary sanctions as doing so would be futile in producing compliance.    III.       Conclusion      Plaintiff Westlake Services’ Motion for Terminating  Sanctions by Striking Defendant’s Answer is GRANTED IN PART.   Defendant  Asif Iqbal’s Answer, filed on June 27, 2023, is HEREBY STRICKEN.   Plaintiff may file a request for entry of default.    Plaintiff’s request for further monetary sanctions is  DENIED.    The Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Plaintiff’s  Request for Entry of Default/Default Judgment for May 16, 2024 at 9:30AM in  in Department 25 at Spring Street Courthouse Moving party is ordered to give  notice.
