Hearing
Date:             April 26, 2024
Case
Name:                McMillan v. Charter
Spectrum
Case
No.:                    23STCV08510
Matter:                        Motion to Compel
Arbitration 
Moving Party:             Defendant Charter
Communications, LLC

Responding
Party:      Plaintiff Denise McMillan

Tentative
Ruling:      The Motion to Compel
Arbitration is granted; the matter is stayed pending resolution of the arbitration.

 
In this
action, filed on April 17, 2023, Plaintiff Denise McMillan (Plaintiff) filed
a complaint against Defendant
Charter Communications, LLC (Defendant), her cable service provider. The
Complaint contains causes of action arising from allegations that Defendant has been periodically and
deliberately throttling its data throughput speed for Plaintiff’s internet services even
though Plaintiff pays Defendant for providing accelerated speeds. 
 
            On
March 6, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to the
parties’ arbitration agreement. In opposition, Plaintiff argues Defendant
failed to carry its burden of showing the existence of a valid arbitration
agreement.

 
            The
motion to compel arbitration is granted; the matter is stayed pending the
outcome of arbitration. 
 
Legal
Standard 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281.2, a court may order arbitration of a controversy if it finds that
the parties have agreed to arbitrate that dispute. Because the obligation to
arbitrate arises from contract, the court may compel arbitration only if the
dispute in question is one in which the parties have agreed to arbitrate. (Weeks
v. Crow (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 350, 352.) Since arbitration is a favored
method of dispute resolution, arbitration agreements should be liberally
interpreted, and arbitration should be ordered unless the agreement clearly
does not apply to the dispute in question. (Id. at p. 353; Segal v.
Silberstein (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 627, 633.)
 
Analysis
 
Existence of a Valid Agreement
 
In ruling on
a motion to compel arbitration, a court must determine two threshold matters:
first, whether a valid agreement to arbitrate exists; and second, whether that
agreement encompasses the dispute at issue. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.2.)   
 
            By way of
background, Plaintiff has been a subscriber to Defendant Spectrum’s Residential
Internet Services since June 15, 2011. (Flores Decl., ¶ 4.)[1]
Upon signing up for Defendant’s internet services, each customer, including
Plaintiff, receives a copy of the Spectrum Residential General Terms and
Conditions (Terms and Conditions). (Flores Decl., ¶ 5.)  At the top of the Terms and Conditions contains
the following language:
 
THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CONTAIN (1) A
BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION, WHICH INCLUDES A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO BRING
CLAIMS AS CLASS ACTIONS; (2) A LIMITATION ON YOUR RIGHT TO BRING CLAIMS AGAINST
SPECTRUM MORE THAN 1 YEAR AFTER THE RELEVANT EVENTS OCCURRED; AND (3) THE RIGHT
TO OPT OUT OF THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS. THESE PROVISIONS AFFECT SUBSCRIBER'S RIGHTS
UNDER THESE TERMS OF SERVICE WITH RESPECT TO ALL SERVICES. SEE SECTION 30 FOR
DETAILS ON THESE PROVISIONS. 1. Introduction a. Acceptance. Subscriber accepts
these Terms of Service by doing any of the following: (i) written or electronic
signature; (ii) informing Spectrum electronically or orally of such acceptance;
(iii) activating a Service, Equipment or Device; (iv) breaking the seal on any
package or box containing any Equipment or Device; or (v) use of or payment
for, in whole or in part, the Service, Equipment or Device. This is a binding
legal document and Subscriber should regularly consult
www.spectrum.com/policies for updates.” (Flores Decl., ¶ 12, Ex. 4.) 
 
            Further, at
Paragraph 30, the Terms and Conditions state in relevant part:
 
“Spectrum and Subscriber agree to
arbitrate disputes and claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of
Service, the Services, the Equipment, or marketing of the Services Subscriber
has received from Spectrum.” (Flores Decl., ¶ 13, Ex. 4.) 
 
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiff accepted these Terms and Conditions in multiple ways over
the course of Defendant’s provision of its services to Plaintiff.
 
            First,
Defendant Charter’s business records reflect that Plaintiff most recently
clicked to accept the Terms on November 26 and 30, 2021. (Flores Decl., ¶¶ 6-7,
Ex. 1-2.) 
 
            Second, the
Terms and Conditions were additionally referenced in every billing statement;
here, Defendant sent a billing statement to Plaintiff for every monthly billing
cycle. (Flores Decl., ¶¶ 9-10, Ex. 3.) 
 
            Finally,
Defendant represents that when a subscriber receives new equipment, a
technician would provide a service call to the subscriber’s residence and –
after completing the service – have the subscriber sign the work order, which
includes accepting the terms and conditions stated in the work order. On November
26, 2021, Defendant represents that Plaintiff signed a work order containing
the following terms:
 
“I represent that the information I
have provided Charter is accurate, I acknowledge the Charter Privacy Policy and
agree with the terms and conditions of the applicable Charter service to which
I am subscribing, copies of which are available at www.charter.com under Terms of Service/Policies and
Your Privacy Rights or may be obtained without charge by calling
1-88-Get-Charter(1-888-438-2427), and which include a mandatory arbitration
requirement with respect to all disputes. . . . I agree that my continued use
of Charter services constitutes my acceptance of any changes to the standard
terms of service that Charter may take from time to time.” (Flores Decl., ¶ 16,
Ex. 5.)
 
            Finally,
the Terms and Conditions also informed Plaintiff that she could opt out of
arbitration by simply notifying Defendant of her decision to opt-out. (Flores
decl., ¶ 17.) Her right to opt out is prominently displayed on the first page
of the Terms in capital and bolded letters: “THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CONTAIN . .
. THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT.”  (Flores Decl.,
Ex. 4, at 1.) In particular, under the Terms, if Plaintiff did not want to
resolve disputes by arbitration, she had to notify Defendant Charter in writing
within 30 days of starting her services. (Flores Decl., Ex. 4 at ¶ 30 [“Right
to Opt Out. If Subscriber does not wish to be bound by these arbitration
provisions, Subscriber must notify Spectrum in writing within 30 days of. . .
the date that Subscriber first subscribes to the Service(s). Subscriber may opt
out by mail to the Arbitration Notice Address.”].) Defendant has no record of Plaintiff
exercising her right to opt out of the arbitration provision. (Flores Decl., ¶
20.)
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues she
never agreed to the Terms and Conditions. She first states that she recalls
sending some correspondence in late 2006 and early 2007 communicating her
unwillingness to participate in any arbitration provision. (McMillan Decl., ¶
6.) 
 
She also states she has refused other
attempts by Defendant to have her agree to arbitration provisions. Specifically,
on February 14, 2018, she states she refused to sign a work order. (McMillan Decl.,
¶ 8.) When she rescheduled the service, she states that she prepared a memo
summarizing the events of Charter's previous visit and concluding with the
words "I DO NOT AGREE TO ARBITRATION". (McMillan Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. D.)
She also disputes signing or clicking to agree to arbitrate on November 26,
2021 and November 30, 2021. (MacMillan Decl., ¶¶ 10-11,
13.) She states that “D.M.” initial signature is not consistent with her signature
and provides exemplars of her signature in other contexts. (McMillan Decl., ¶
12, Ex. A.) 
 
Plaintiff does not, however, dispute
that her claims are within the scope of the arbitration provision in Charter’s
Terms and Conditions. Therefore, the Court only need to determine if a valid,
written agreement to arbitrate exists. The issue before this Court, therefore,
is whether there exists an agreement to arbitrate based on mutual consent. 
 
“In
California, ‘[g]eneral principles of contract law determine whether the parties
have entered a binding agreement to arbitrate.’ [Citations.]” (Pinnacle
Museum Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC (2012) 55
Cal.4th 223, 236.) “An essential element of any contract is the consent of the
parties, or mutual assent.” (Donovan v. RRL Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 261,
270.) Further, the consent of the parties to a contract must be communicated by
each party to the other. (Civ. Code, § 1565, subd. 3.) “Mutual assent is
determined under an objective standard applied to the outward manifestations or
expressions of the parties, i.e., the reasonable meaning of their words and
acts, and not their unexpressed intentions or understandings. [Citation.]” (Alexander
v.Codemasters Group Limited (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 129, 141.)


“Generally, an arbitration agreement
must be memorialized in writing. [Citation.] A party's acceptance of an
agreement to arbitrate may be express, as where a party signs the agreement. A
signed agreement is not necessary, however, and a party’s acceptance may be
implied in fact (e.g., [Craig v. Brown & Root, Inc. (2000) 84
Cal.App.4th 416,] 420 [employee’s continued employment constitutes
acceptance of an arbitration agreement proposed by the employer] ).... An
arbitration clause within a contract may be binding on a party even if the
party never actually read the clause. [Citation.]” (Pinnacle, supra, 55
Cal.4th at p. 236.)
 
Here, in considering all the
evidence before this Court and the relevant case authority, the Court finds
that the evidence is sufficient to show Plaintiff’s consent to the arbitration
provision in the Terms and Conditions. 

            First, as argued in the reply,
Plaintiff’s declaration that she opted out of a Time Warner arbitration
agreement in 2006 is irrelevant. Moreover, as the reply notes, Plaintiff has
been unable to locate her purported opt-out letter. (McMillan Decl., ¶ 6.) Separately,
the Court is skeptical of Plaintiff’s recollection of opting out of this
arbitration agreement almost twenty years earlier. However, most importantly,
Defendant is not
seeking to enforce Terms that Time Warner Cable may have had in 2006. 
 
Rather, the evidence shows no evidence
of an opt-out to Defendant Charter’s Terms and Conditions. First, Defendant
asserts it has no record of an opt-out and Plaintiff does not submit any evidence
that she opted out of Defendant’s arbitration provision of its Terms and
Condition in the manner required by its terms: ““Subscriber must notify
Spectrum in writing…Subscriber’s written notification to Spectrum must include
Subscriber’s name, address, and Spectrum account number as well as a clear
statement that Subscriber does not wish to resolve disputes with Spectrum under
these arbitration provisions.” (Flores Decl., ¶¶ 17, 20; McMillan Decl, Ex. D.)
 
Further,
Plaintiff explicitly consented to the Terms, on November 30, 2020, November 26,
2021, and most recently on November 30, 2021. (Flores Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. 1 [Online
Contracts Transaction History details].) Moreover, Plaintiff had notice of the
Terms and Condition at a minimum through monthly billing statements. (Flores
Decl., ¶¶ 9-13.) There is no dispute that Plaintiff continued to accept Defendant
Charter’s services and received billing statements with Notice of the Terms and
Conditions. (Flores Decl., ¶¶ 10, 13, Ex. 3.)
 
Citing
Baird v. Charter Communications, Inc. (C.D. Cal., June 1, 2020, No. CV1910621DSFKSX) 2020
WL 11626081, Moran v. Charter Communications, Inc. (C.D. Cal., June 11,
2020, No. SACV2000303JVSJDEX) 2020 WL 5833640, and Hart v. Charter
Communications, Inc. (C.D. Cal., Nov. 8, 2017, No. SACV170556DOCRAOX) 2017
WL 6942425, Defendant argues that federal courts have held
that Defendant Charter’s arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable.
 
As
explained in Moran v. Charter
Communications, Inc. (C.D. Cal., June
11, 2020, No. SACV2000303JVSJDEX) 2020 WL 5833640, “[f]ailure to opt out after
adequate notice of the arbitration provision, coupled with Plaintiffs'
continued acceptance of Defendants' services, bound Plaintiffs to the
arbitration provision.” (Moran v. Charter Communications, Inc. (C.D.
Cal., June 11, 2020, No. SACV2000303JVSJDEX) 2020 WL 5833640, at *5 [quoting Hart
v. Charter Communications, Inc. (C.D. Cal., Nov. 8, 2017, No.
SACV170556DOCRAOX) 2017 WL 6942425, at *5].)
 
Thus,
in the absence of sufficient evidence of a contractually compliant opt-out, Plaintiff’s
notice of the Terms and Conditions and her continued use of Defendant’s internet
services is sufficient to manifest asset to the arbitration provision in the Terms
of Conditions. (See
e.g., Baird, 2020 WL 11626081, at *5; Moran, 2020 WL 5833640, at
*5; Hart, 2017 WL 6942425 at *5.)


             Based on the foregoing,
Defendant has carried its initial burden of demonstrating the existence of a
valid, binding arbitration agreements and that Plaintiff’s claims fall
within the scope of the Agreement.[2]

 
CONCLUSION
 
            Accordingly,
the Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration. The motion to compel
arbitration is granted; the matter is stayed pending the outcome of
arbitration.
