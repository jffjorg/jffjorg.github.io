And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to sustain the demurrer filed by the Defendant, Maven Arena, Inc. The second cause of action for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is deemed duplicative of the first cause of action for breach of contract. The Plaintiff, Storyfile, Inc., has failed to sufficiently plead a cause of action for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. As a result, the demurrer is sustained, and the Plaintiff is given leave to amend the pleading. The amended pleading must be filed and served on or before May 24, 2024.
