disputes this fact and states she was a subscriber of Defendants as early as
2006. (McMillan Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.) The reply explains that Plaintiff may have been a Time
Warner Cable subscriber prior to the merger between Defendant Charter and Time
Warner Cable (McMillan Decl. ¶ 6), but Defendant’s own records may not show
subscriber information pre-2011.

be subject to the delegation clause in the arbitration provision. (See Mot.,
5:4-6:4.)
