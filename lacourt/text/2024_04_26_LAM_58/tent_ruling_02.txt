Case
Name:                Pech v. Morgan
Case
No.:                    18STCV04084
Matter:                        Motion for Attorney Fees
Moving
Party:             Defendant Thomas E.
Morgann, III 

Responding Party:      Plaintiff
Richard Pech


Tentative
Ruling:      The Motion for attorney’s fees
is granted in the amount of $271,291.25. 

 
Plaintiff,
attorney Richard Pech, represented Defendant Thomas E. Morgan, III (Morgan) in
numerous legal matters. Pech alleged that Morgan breached the parties’ written
retainer agreement by failing to pay all amounts owed, which had reached
$525,914.90 at the time of Pech’s withdrawal as attorney in an underlying trust
litigation matter. 
 
Plaintiff Pech’s
Second Amended Complaint alleged causes of action for (1.) breach of written
contract, (2.) account stated, (3.) false promise, (4.) intentional
misrepresentation, (5.) quantum meruit, (6.) breach of oral contract, and (8.)
quantum meruit.
 
Defendant Morgan
filed a cross-complaint. The Second Amended Cross-Complaint alleges causes of
action for (1.) legal malpractice, (2.) breach of fiduciary duty, (3.) legal malpractice,
(4.) breach of fiduciary duty, and (5.) equitable disgorgement. 
 
The jury returned
a mixed verdict. It rejected attorney Pech’s claim for breach of contract, and
awarded him, on theories of quantum meruit and account stated, $497,880.90 in
“damages.” The jury also found that Plaintiff Pech had acted negligently
toward, and thereby caused harm to, his client and awarded Morgan $323,188.25. A
Judgment was entered on September 29, 2023, which found Plaintiff Pech was
entitled to a judgment against Defendant Morgan in the net amount of
$174,692.65. 
 
Thereafter, Defendant
Morgan filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and Plaintiff
Pech filed a motion for new trial. The Court denied Pech’s motion for new trial,
but granted Defendant Morgan’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.
On January 19, 2024, a new Judgment was entered finding that Defendant Morgan
was the prevailing party and that Plaintiff Pech was liable to Defendant Morgan
the amount of $323,188.25.
 
On February 2,
2024, Defendant Morgan filed and served a Memorandum of Costs in the amount of
$59,232.33. No motion to tax costs was filed. 
 
On February 29,
2024, Defendant Morgan filed a motion for attorney fees that also included a
request for $88,245.42 in costs. 
 
On March 20, 2024,
Plaintiff Pech filed a motion for relief from his failure to file a motion to
tax costs. After the Court issued a tentative ruling to deny the motion, Pech
withdrew it.
 
Plaintiff Pech
also filed an opposition to the motion for attorney fees.[1]

 
The Court grants
the motion for attorney’s fees in the amount of $217,291.25. The
request for costs, except for the $61.25 for filing fees of this motion, is
denied. 
 
Discussion
 
            Defendant Morgan is the Prevailing
Party:
 
Defendant Morgan
seeks attorney’s fees pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 6204,
subdivision (d). Defendant Morgan is the prevailing party pursuant to this
statute. 
 
Business and Professions Code section 6204, subdivision (d), which
provides: 
 
“The party seeking a trial after arbitration shall be the prevailing
party if that party obtains a judgment more favorable
than that provided by the arbitration award, and in all other cases the
other party shall be the prevailing party. The prevailing party may, in the
discretion of the court, be entitled to an allowance for reasonable attorney's
fees and costs incurred in the trial after arbitration, which allowance shall
be fixed by the court. In fixing the attorney's fees, the court shall consider
the award and determinations of the arbitrators, in addition to any other
relevant evidence.”


By way of background to this motion, Plaintiff claimed he was entitled
to approximately $600,000 in unpaid attorney fees from Defendant Morgan. As
result of this fee dispute, Plaintiff Pech and Defendant Morgan attended a
fee arbitration under the Mandatory Fee Arbitration Act (MFAA) to resolve
Pech’s fee claim. At the arbitration proceeding, Defendant Morgan claimed that
the parties’ Fee Agreement was not valid, and the amount charged were
unreasonable.
 
At the conclusion
of the proceeding, the arbitration panel determined that there was no valid fee
agreement between Plaintiff Pech and Defendant Morgan, and thus, Plaintiff
Pech was only entitled to – at most – the reasonable value of his services. The
Arbitrators determined that the amount of unpaid legal fees incurred for the
benefit of Defendant Morgan was $0; additionally, Plaintiff Pech was required
to pay to Defendant Morgan the cost of $5,000 in arbitration filing fees. (Furman
Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.) 
 
Thereafter, Plaintiff Pech rejected the arbitration award pursuant to
Business and Professions Code section 6204 and filed the instant civil action
seeking these unpaid fees. (Furman Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. B.) 
 
At the conclusion of a jury trial and several post-trial motions, the
Court entered judgment finding that Plaintiff Pech was entitled to nothing on his
claims for quantum meruit and account stated and Defendant Morgan was entitled
to $323,188.25 on his cross-claims for legal malpractice. (12/6/2023 Minute
Order; 1/19/2024 Judgment.)
 
Thus, based on the foregoing, Plaintiff Pech – as the party moving for
trial after arbitration – did not obtain “a judgment more favorable than that
provided by the arbitration award.” As such, Defendant Morgan is the prevailing
party under the statute and entitled to reasonable attorney fees at the
discretion of the Court. 
 
The Amount of Fees are Reasonable:
 
In support of his motion for attorney fees, Defendant Morgan seeks attorney
fees in the amount of $212,130, based on an hourly rate of $425. 
 
The Court first considers whether the hourly rate is reasonable. 
 
In assessing the reasonableness
of hourly billing rates,¿“the court may rely on its own knowledge and
familiarity with the legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and
reputation of the attorney requesting fees [citation], the difficulty or
complexity of the litigation to which that skill was applied [citations], and
affidavits from other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the community and
rate determinations in other cases.”¿(569 East County Boulevard LLC v.
Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc.¿(2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 437; see¿Mountjoy
v. Bank of America, N.A.¿(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 272 [“ ‘ “a reasonable
hourly rate is the product of a multiplicity of factors…[including] the level
of skill necessary, time limitations, the amount to be obtained in the
litigation, the attorney’s reputation, and the undesirability of the case” ’
”].)¿
 
A review of the
declaration submitted in support of the motion for attorney’s fees supports
finding that Defendant’s attorney’s hourly rate of $425 is reasonable; the rate
is supported by substantial evidence. (Furman Decl., ¶ 8.) Moreover, Plaintiff Pech does not argue otherwise in opposition. 
 
Defendant’s counsel also submits billing records showing 528.70 hours of
work for a total of $224,485 in fees. The billing records were reduced by
$22,335 to account for hours incurred that were redacted and deemed “Not
applicable.” (Furman Decl., ¶10.) Defendant’s
counsel also requests $5,100 for this fee motion for 12 hours of work. (Furman
Decl., ¶ 12.)
 
The amount of fees
requested is reasonable. The billing records demonstrate this litigation has
been ongoing for almost 5 years. Further, this matter has been heavily
litigated; there has been extensive motion practice involved (including challenges
to the pleadings, discovery disputes and post-trial motions), litigation on both
a complaint and cross-complaint, and a more than weeklong jury trial. (Furman
Decl., Ex. E.) Plaintiff Pech’s opposition
does not challenge these amounts as unreasonable. 
 
Nor does Plaintiff contend that Defendant should have apportioned these
fees based to exclude the fees Defendant Morgan incurred on his crossclaims. As
the moving papers concede, only Plaintiff’s claims were subject to the
arbitration proceeding and thus these are the only fees recoverable under
Business and Professions Code section 6204. However, the moving papers argue, and
the opposition does not dispute, that the billing entries establish that these issues
“were
inextricably intertwined and cannot be suitably allocated to any specific
issue.” (Mot., 7:19-22.)
 
The principle of apportioning fee awards has long been recognized. When,
for example, a claim based on a contract providing for attorney fees is joined
with noncontract claims, the prevailing party is only entitled to recover fees
related to the contract action and the court may properly apportion out the
fees for the noncontract claims. (Reynolds Metals Co. v. Alperson (1979)
25 Cal.3d 124, 129.) Where the attorney fees are incurred in connection with
both the contract and noncontract claims, they may, but need not, be
apportioned. (Id. at pp. 129–130.) 
“ ‘ “Apportionment
is not required when the claims for relief are so intertwined that it would be
impracticable, if not impossible, to separate the attorney's time into
compensable and noncompensable units.” ’ ” (Hjelm v. Prometheus Real Estate
Group, Inc. (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1155, 1178.)
 
“[A]pportionment of that award rests within the court's sound
discretion.’ ” (Hjelm, supra, 3 Cal.App.5th at p. 1177.) 
 
Here, the legal malpractice issues and the unpaid legal fee issues
cannot be readily apportioned from the billing records and Plaintiff does not
contend any apportionment is required. 
 
Thus, the Court grants the motion for attorney fees in the amount of $217,291.25
($212,130 + $5,100 + $61.25 filing fee).
 
Additional Issues:
 
Defendant requests additional costs beyond what was included – and
allowed – in Defendant’s Memorandum of Costs, in the amount of $88,245.42.
On February 2, 2024, Defendant Morgan filed a Memorandum of Costs seeking
prejudgment costs in the amount of $59,232.33. Now, Defendant seeks additional prejudgment
costs that all predate the February 2, 2024 costs memorandum. This request for omitted
prejudgment costs is not well taken. 
 
Except as otherwise provided, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter
of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1032, subd. (b).) To obtain costs, the prevailing party must file and serve a
memorandum of costs “within 15 days after the date of  of the
notice of entry of judgment,” which “must be verified by
a statement of the party, attorney, or agent that to the best of his or her
knowledge the items of cost are correct and were necessarily incurred in the
case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(a).)


These newly
requested costs should have been included in the February 2, 2024 cost memorandum.
Seeking these fees that were omitted from the timely filed memorandum of costs by
way of this motion now is improper because it does not comply with Rule 3.1700.[2] 
 
Finally, as noted above, the arbitration award issued by the panel on
July 11, 2019, provided that Pech was not owed any additional fees, and that he
was required to pay Morgan the $5,000 arbitration filing fee, plus interest.
(Decl. Furman, ¶ 2; Ex. A.)


Morgan now argues
that the arbitration award’s determination that Plaintiff Pech was required to
pay to Defendant Morgan the $5,000 filing fee plus interest should be added to
the civil judgment here. It is unclear why this portion of the arbitrator’s
award is binding on this Court under Business and Professions Code section 6203,
subdivision (a) where a party opted to pursuant civil litigation after an arbitration
award. The Court is disinclined to add this arbitration cost from the
non-binding arbitration panel decision.   
 
Conclusion
 
            The motion for attorneys’ fees is
granted in the total amount of $217,291.25. Plaintiff Morgan’s
request for $88,245.42 costs is denied. 

 
            Plaintiff Pech is ordered to pay to Defendant’s
counsel the sum of $217,291.25 on or before June 5, 2024.
