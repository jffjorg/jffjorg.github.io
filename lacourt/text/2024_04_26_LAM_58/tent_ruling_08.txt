Storyfile, Inc.

Tentative Ruling:      The
Demurrer to the Complaint is sustained.

             
             On December 8, 2023, Storyfile,
Inc. (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against Maven Arena, Inc (Defendant)
alleging a breach of a licensing agreement. Specifically, on May 1, 2022, Plaintiff
entered into a license agreement (Agreement) with Defendant “for various
rights, licenses, and services provided by” Plaintiff. Plaintiff then invoiced
for those licensing services and Defendant paid all invoices until November
2022. On November 2, 2023, Plaintiff sent a notice of termination to Defendant,
terminating the Agreement with immediate effect. Plaintiff alleges that the
unpaid invoices owed by Defendant total $490,094.65.  
 
The
Complaint alleges causes of action for (1.) breach of contract; (2.) breach of implied covenant of good faith; (3.)
account stated; and (4.) quantum meruit. 
 
Defendant Maven Arena, Inc. now
demurs to the second cause of action in the Complaint. Plaintiff opposes the
demurrer.
 
The
demurrer is sustained. 
 
Demurrer
 
            A
demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from
either the face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take
judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to
challenge the sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law . . ..” ’ ” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518,
525.)  
 
Analysis 
            
            Defendant
demurs to the second cause of action for breach of implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealings on the grounds that this claim is duplicative of
the first cause of action for breach of contract. 
            “There is implied in every contract
a covenant by each party not to do anything which will deprive the other
parties thereto of the benefits of the contract. [Citations.] This covenant not
only imposes upon each contracting party the duty to refrain from doing
anything which would render performance of the contract impossible by any act
of his own, but also the duty to do everything that the contract presupposes
that he will do to accomplish its purpose.” (Harm v. Frasher (1960) 181
Cal.App.2d 405, 417.) “The covenant of good faith finds particular application
in situations where one party is invested with a discretionary power affecting
the rights of another. Such power must be exercised in good faith.” (Carma
Developers (Cal.), Inc. v. Marathon Development California, Inc. (1992) 2
Cal.4th 342, 372.) 
However, an implied covenant claim does not extend so far as to
impose enforceable duties that are beyond the scope of the contract, nor does
the covenant prohibit actions that are expressly authorized by the contract's
terms. (Pasadena Live v. City of Pasadena (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1089,
1094 [“ ‘implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is limited to assuring
compliance with the express terms of the contract, and cannot be
extended to create obligations not contemplated by the contract.’ ”]; Carma
Developers (Cal.), Inc. v. Marathon Development California, Inc., supra, 2
Cal.4th at p. 373 [“[i]t is universally recognized the scope of conduct
prohibited by the covenant of good faith is circumscribed by the purposes and
express terms of the contract.”].)
Further, if a plaintiff's allegations of breach of the
covenant of good faith “do[es] not go beyond the statement of a mere contract
breach and, relying on the same alleged acts, simply seek[s] the same damages
or other relief already claimed in a companion contract cause of action, they
may be disregarded as superfluous as no additional claim is actually stated.” (Careau
& Co. v. Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d
1371, 1395.)
Here, the allegations in the second cause of action of the Complaint
are nearly identical to the first cause of action. (Compare Compl., ¶¶
12-19 with ¶¶ 20-24.) Thus, the second cause of action is impermissibly
duplicative of the first cause of action.           
            In
opposition, Plaintiff suggests that the good faith and fair dealing cause of action
may be pled in an alternative to the breach of contract claim. Plaintiff is
correct that alternative pleading is permitted. However, this doctrine holds
that “[w]hile a complaint may not plead inconsistent facts, it may plead
inconsistent legal theories or causes of action.” (Vichy Springs Resort,
Inc. v. City of Ukiah (Cal. Ct. App., Mar. 29, 2024, No. A165345) 2024 WL
1340842, at *9 [citing Berman v. Bromberg (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 936,
944–945].) 
 
Thus,
this doctrine does nothing to alleviate Plaintiff of its duty to sufficiently plead
a cause of action for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealings; that is, Plaintiff is still required to distinguish the allegations in the breach of contract claim from the
breach of the implied covenant claim.
 
Conclusion
 
            The demurrer is sustained. Plaintiff
shall have leave to amend. The amended pleading shall be filed and served on or
before May 24, 2024.
