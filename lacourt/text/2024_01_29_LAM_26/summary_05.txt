And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Petitioner has failed to provide any form of identification tied to a fingerprint on file, which is necessary for Probation to run a criminal history assessment. The Petitioner must provide Probation with some form of identification verified by a fingerprint, which can be done through one of three options: providing a California driver's license number or California ID number, providing a driver's license number or DMV-issued ID number from another state, or contacting Probation to request instructions on how to have fingerprints taken for a Livescan and results sent to Probation. The petition is continued to March 11, 2024, to enable the Petitioner to pursue one of these options. If the Petitioner fails to provide Probation with sufficient information prior to the next hearing date, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice.
