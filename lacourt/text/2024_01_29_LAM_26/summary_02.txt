The Petitioner is instructed to provide one of the following forms of identification: a California driver's license number or California ID number, a driver's license or ID number from another state, or to contact Probation to have their fingerprints taken for a LIVESCAN. The petition is continued to March 11, 2024, at 9 am to allow the Petitioner to provide the necessary information. If the Petitioner fails to do so, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice.
