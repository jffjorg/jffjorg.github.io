And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's motion to terminate sanctions is moot and has placed the hearing off calendar. The judge has ordered the plaintiffs to file a copy of the signed 998 offer with the court within 10 days. The judge has found that the parties have entered into a settlement agreement and that the 998 offer has been accepted. The judge has cited several cases to support the ruling, including Bias v. Wright, Saba v. Crater, and Berg v. Darden. The judge has stated that the court's authority is limited to entering judgment according to the terms of the parties' agreement and that the court is not authorized to adjudicate disputes over the terms of the agreement.
