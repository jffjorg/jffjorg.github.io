ANALYSIS: 
 
On March 7, 2023, Plaintiffs
Yohanson Walkir Castellanos Orozco and Ana Lucia Elizabeth Lantan Garcia (“Plaintiffs”) filed this motor vehicle action against Defendant
Manuel Ocampo (“Defendant”). Defendant filed an answer and cross-complaint on
April 28, 2023. Defendant filed (1) Motion to Compel
Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Request for
Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
Request for Sanctions, on August 14, 2023. The Court granted the discovery
motions on October 9, 2023 and ordered Plaintiffs to serve responses and pay
sanctions to Defendant within 20 days of the order. (Minute Order, 10/09/23.) 
 
Defendant
filed the instant Motion for Terminating Sanctions on April 23, 2024. The Motion came for
hearing on June 13, 2024 and was continued due to Plaintiff’s counsel’s
representation that the case had settled. (Minute Order, 06/13/24.) On
September 26, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed declarations in opposition. 
 
Discussion
 
At the hearing on June 13, 2024, the Court’s tentative
ruling was to grant the Motion and dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint. However,
following oral argument, the Court continued the matter to allow Plaintiffs to
demonstrate that the parties had settled the action, rendering the instant
Motion moot. 
 
Plaintiffs now present evidence that the parties entered
into a settlement agreement pursuant to a 998 offer made by Defendants and
timely accepted by Plaintiffs. Specifically, on May 10, 2024, Defendants served
Plaintiffs with an Offer to Compromise under Code of Civil Procedure section
998, by electronic mail. (Opp., Oh Decl., ¶4 and Exh. A.) The deadline to
return the offer was June 12, 2024. (Code Civ. Proc., § 998, subd. (b)(2); §
1010, subd. (a)(3)(B).) Plaintiffs returned a signed acceptance of the 998
offer on June 12, 2024. (Opp., Oh Decl., ¶9 and Exh. F; Abarca Decl., ¶7 and
Exh. E.) 
 
[S]ection 998 offers must be written
with sufficient specificity because the trial court lacks authority to
adjudicate the terms of a purported settlement. “Section 998 was designed to
encourage settlement of disputes through a straightforward and expedited procedure.”
(Bias v. Wright (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 811, 819, 127 Cal.Rptr.2d 137.) Once the
offer is accepted, the clerk or court performs the purely ministerial task of
entering judgment according to the terms of the parties' agreement. (§ 998,
subd. (b)(1) [“If the offer is accepted, the offer with proof of acceptance
shall be filed and the clerk or the judge shall enter judgment accordingly.”].)
Neither the clerk nor the court is authorized to adjudicate a dispute over the
terms of section 998 agreements before entering judgment. (Bias, supra, 103
Cal.App.4th at p. 819, 127 Cal.Rptr.2d 137; Saba v. Crater (1998) 62
Cal.App.4th 150, 153, 72 Cal.Rptr.2d 401 (Saba) [“[T]he clerk or judge merely
enters judgment following the filing of a written acceptance of the offer.”].)
 
(Berg v. Darden (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 721, 727.)
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds the Motion for Terminating Sanctions is
now moot and places the hearing off calendar. 
 
 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Manuel Ocampo’s Motion for
Terminating Sanctions is PLACED OFF
CALENDAR AS MOOT. PLAINTIFFS ARE TO FILE A COPY OF THE SIGNED 998 OFFER
WITH THE COURT WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS.
