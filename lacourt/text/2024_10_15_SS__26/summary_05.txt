And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in plain English:

The Judge has ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Ken Koury, and against the defendants, 1127 La Maida St., LLC, Yaaqov Rahlin, and 1 Stop Property Solutions, LLC. The defendants had filed a demurrer, which is a legal challenge to the complaint, arguing that it did not adequately allege a cause of action. The Judge has found that the defendants' demurrer is without merit and has ordered them to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 20 days. The Judge's ruling is based on the allegations in the complaint, which state that the defendants made a recorded advertising call to Koury's phone number without his consent, in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA). The Judge has concluded that the complaint adequately alleges a cause of action for violation of the TCPA and CLRA and has denied the defendants' demurrer.
