ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff Allstate Property &
Casualty Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for insurance
subrogation against Defendant Jovonny Holloway (“Defendant”) on August 15,
2023. No proof of service of the Summons and Complaint is on file with the
Court. Defendant recently filed an answer to the Complaint on September 4, 2024.
Two days later, Defendant filed the
instant Motion to Continue Trial. No opposition to the instant Motion has been
filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
“Although continuances of
trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its
own merits. The Court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subd.
(c).) The Court may look to the following factors in determining whether a
trial continuance is warranted: (1) proximity of the trial date; (2) whether
there was any previous continuance of trial due to any party; (3) the length of
the continuance requested; (4) the availability of alternative means to address
the problem that gave rise to the motion; (5) the prejudice that parties or
witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; and (6) whether trial
counsel is engaged in another trial. 
(See generally, Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subd. (d)(1)-(11).)
Additionally, factors for the Court to consider include: a party’s excused
inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence
despite diligent efforts; whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance;
and any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the
motion or application. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subds. (c), (d).)
 
Defendant argues that good
cause exists for a continuance of the trial date, which is currently set for February
11, 2025, because they just filed an answer and require additional time to
conduct and complete discovery. (Motion, Nestler Decl., ¶¶3-6.) Specifically, service
was only recently attempted on Defendant on August 7, 2024 and Defendant just
answered the Complaint on September 4, 2024. (Id. at ¶¶3-4.) There has
been no prior continuance of the trial date, nor has Plaintiff filed an
opposition to the request for a continuance. Based on the foregoing, the Court
finds that the factors of Rule 3.1332 weigh in favor of the requested
continuance of the trial date.
