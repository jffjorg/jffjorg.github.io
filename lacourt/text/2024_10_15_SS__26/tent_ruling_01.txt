ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff Mold Masters, Inc (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action against Defendant Nahid Lahiji, individually, and as Trustee of the
Nahid Lahiji Trust dated September 22, 2017, (“Defendant”) on January 7, 2020.
On December 13, 2021, Defendant filed an answer to the Complaint in propria
persona.
 
Defendant filed a substitution of attorney on July 17,
2024. The Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend the Complaint on
September 11, 2024. (Minute Order, 09/11/24.) The First Amended Complaint was
filed on the same date. On September 24, 2024, the Court denied Defendant’s
Motion to Reopen Discovery. (Minute Order, 09/24/25.)
 
Defendant filed the instant Motion to Release Mechanic’s
Lien on August 19, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on September 24, 2024
and Defendant replied on October 8, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves for a court order releasing the mechanic’s
lien recorded by Plaintiff against their property on October 18, 2020 on the
grounds that it was recorded beyond the time period allowed under the law for
the recording of mechanic's liens. Civil Code section 8412 provides that a
direct contractor may record a mechanic’s lien within 90 days of completion of
the work of improvement. (Civ. Code, § 8412.) Once an action to foreclose
mechanic’s lien is filed, the property owner may move for removal of the lien
prior to trial. (Lambert v. Superior Court (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 383, 387.)
When work is considered “complete” under Civil Code section 8412 requires a
factual determination in each case. (Picerne Construction Corp. v.
Castellano Villas (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 1201, 1208.)
 
Defendant’s evidence that Plaintiff completed its work
consists of the declaration of Arat Lahijji, Defendant’s daughter, who states
that no workers were at the property after July 8, 2019. (Motion, Arat Lahiji
Decl., ¶2.) Defendant’s declaration includes an email from Plaintiff’s counsel
stating that its work was completed on or around July 1, 2019. (Motion, Nahid
Lahiji Decl., Exh. E.) However, an email from Plaintiff on July 20, 2019 asked
Defendant to find another contractor to complete the work. (Id. at Exh.
F.) This is conflicting evidence regarding the completion date. Plaintiff’s
July 20, 2019 email suggests that there was still work to be completed. Also,
as Plaintiff points out in opposition, its attorney’s representations regarding
the completion date do not speak for Plaintiff. Plaintiff’s opposition also
includes evidence that disputes the date of completion of the project. On July
8, 2019, Arat Lahiji emailed Plaintiff and stated that the job was not complete
as a reason why payment had not yet been made. (Opp., Reid Decl., Exh. 8.)
Plaintiff responded to that email on July 15, 2019 explaining in detail what
remaining work needed to be done. (Id. at Exh. 9.)  
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant has not demonstrated that
the work was complete as of July 8, 2019 such that the mechanic’s lien was
untimely recorded. Defendant’s reply contends that the clearance testing
mentioned by Plaintiff is outside of the scope of work to be performed by
Plaintiff under the parties’ contract. It appears the provision to which
Defendant cites concerns additional testing by a third party at Defendant’s
option. (Compl., Exh. 1, p. 5 at ¶h.) The contract, however, also expressly
states that the agreed upon price includes “post abatement removal
certification and full warranty.” (Id. at p. 3.) Defendant has not shown
that this was achieved by Plaintiff by July 8, 2019.
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant Nahid Lahiji’s Motion to
Remove Mechanic’s Lien is DENIED.
