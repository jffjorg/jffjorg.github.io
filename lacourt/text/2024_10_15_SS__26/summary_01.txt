And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the defendant's motion to remove a mechanic's lien recorded by the plaintiff against the defendant's property. The defendant argued that the mechanic's lien was recorded beyond the allowed time period under California Civil Code section 8412, which allows a direct contractor to record a mechanic's lien within 90 days of completing the work of improvement. The defendant presented evidence that the work was completed on July 8, 2019, but the plaintiff presented conflicting evidence, including an email from the plaintiff's attorney stating that the work was not complete as of July 8, 2019, and an email from the defendant's daughter stating that no workers were at the property after July 8, 2019. The judge found that the defendant did not demonstrate that the work was complete as of July 8, 2019, and accordingly denied the motion to remove the mechanic's lien.
