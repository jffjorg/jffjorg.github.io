And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Jovonny Holloway's motion to continue the trial date. The trial date is now set for June 11, 2025, at 8:30 am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The judge believes that good cause exists for the continuance, as the defendant has only recently filed an answer to the complaint and needs additional time to conduct and complete discovery. The judge has not found any opposition to the motion, and the factors outlined in California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332 weigh in favor of the requested continuance.
