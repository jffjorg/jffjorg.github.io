And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike in the case of Erdenekhuu v. Hu Trans, LLC et al. The demurrer was filed by Cross-Defendant Erdenekhuu, who challenged the second cause of action for promissory fraud in the First Amended Cross-Complaint. The judge sustained the demurrer, finding that the complaint did not adequately allege the first element of the cause of action, namely that the defendant made a representation of intent to perform some future action. The judge also found that the damages element was adequately alleged. The motion to strike was deemed moot since the demurrer was sustained.

The case involves a dispute over a loan agreement and a separate agreement for the use of trucks. The plaintiff, Cross-Complainant, alleges that the defendant, Cross-Defendant Erdenekhuu, breached the loan agreement and made misrepresentations regarding payment for the use of the trucks. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff is not entitled to punitive damages and has moved to strike that portion of the complaint. The judge has denied leave to amend the complaint since the plaintiff has already had the opportunity to amend and has not made a sufficient showing of a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.
