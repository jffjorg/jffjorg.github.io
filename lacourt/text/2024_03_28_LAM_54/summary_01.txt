```

And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:

The Court has granted the Plaintiff's motions to seal certain documents and information. The Plaintiff sought to seal the unredacted copy of its Second Amended Complaint, as well as certain exhibits and portions of the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, which contain trade secrets and confidential business information. The Court agrees that public disclosure of this information is likely to harm the Plaintiff's competitive standing, and therefore grants the motions. The Court's ruling is based on the requirements of CRC Rule 2.550(d), which sets out the criteria for sealing records.
