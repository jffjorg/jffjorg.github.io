SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
March 4, 2022, Plaintiff Marissa Baghoumian (Plaintiff) was injured during
recess. On March 14, 2023, Plaintiff, through her guardian ad litem Alan Baghoumian,
filed her complaint.
 
Plaintiff submits a petition for approval of minor’s
compromise on behalf of Marissa Baghoumian (13) for a settlement with Defendants
Sulphur Spring Union School District and Jenna Oikawa for $50,000.00. Petitioner
represents total deductions of $25,541.79 as follows: $2,591.79 in medical
expenses, $22,500.00 in attorney fees, and $450.00 for expenses; thereby
leaving a net balance of $24,458.21.
 
The settlement exceeds $5,000 and the payment will therefore
be deposited into a blocked account. (Probate Code §§ 3610, 3611(b).)
 
It appears that everything is in
order to approve the Minor’s Compromise. The petition and proposed order were
filed on the MC-350 and MC-351 forms. The petitions comply with CCP § 372;
Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600-3613; and Cal. Rules of Court Rules 3.1384, 7.101,
7.950-7.952.
 
The Court approves the Petition to
Confirm Minor’s Compromise filed on behalf of Marissa Baghoumian
 
The Court will also set a hearing to verify the deposit of
funds into the blocked account. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
