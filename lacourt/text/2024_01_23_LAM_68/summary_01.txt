And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by defendant Greystar California, Inc. and the motion to strike filed by the same defendant. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the plaintiff's first amended complaint, while the motion to strike seeks to strike allegations in support of and claims for punitive damages.

The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the complaint sufficiently pleads the elements of each cause of action. The judge has also granted the motion to strike the punitive damages claims, finding that the allegations are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.

The judge has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint to cure the defects identified in the motion to strike. The plaintiff may not add new causes of action. If the plaintiff declines or fails to file a second amended complaint, the defendant will be required to answer the original complaint.

The judge has also set a deadline for the entry of default and has ordered that the defendant give notice of the ruling.
