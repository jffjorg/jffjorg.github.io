PROCEEDINGS
 
            Jose Erick Alvarado v. Vios Auto Sales, Inc., et al.
            22TRCV01298
1.      Gene
Olives’, of Auto Legal Group LLC, Counsel for Defendant Vios Auto Sales, Inc., Motion to be Relieved as Counsel 
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Gene Olives’, of Auto Legal Group LLC, Counsel for
Defendant Vios Auto Sales, Inc., Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is granted.

 
            Background
 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on August 30, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants concealed
material information regarding the sale of a vehicle which had underlying
defects.  
 
Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel
 
Counsel
states, in the declaration, valid reasons for withdrawal. Counsel states that there
has been a breakdown of the relationship simply because the corporation has dissolved,
and the corporation’s principal is deceased. The Court finds that the attorney
has filed the required declaration.  The
Court also finds that the attorney has shown sufficient reasons why the motion
to be relieved as counsel should be granted and why the attorney brought a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure § 284(2) instead of filing a consent under
section 284(1). The Court finds that the attorney filed and served the proposed
order. 
 
Therefore, the motion to be relieved as counsel is granted.
 
The attorney is relieved as counsel of record for the client effective
upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed order upon the client. 

 
Gene Olives is ordered to give notice of the Court’s
ruling.
