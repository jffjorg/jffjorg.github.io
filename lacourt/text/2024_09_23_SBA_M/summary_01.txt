And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motions filed by Plaintiff Ronald Williams, including motions to compel further responses to special interrogatories, to compel the deposition of Defendant Torrance Memorial Medical Center, and to compel answer to deposition question. The judge has deemed Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories moot, in part, and denied it, in part. The judge has denied Plaintiff's motion to compel deposition of Defendant, finding that the deponents failed to appear for deposition and that the Defendant did not make them available. The judge has also denied Plaintiff's motion to compel answer to deposition question, finding that the deponent refused to answer the question only because it was manifestly irrelevant or calculated to harass. The judge has denied Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, finding that the parties had agreed to meet and confer on discovery disputes before filing the motion. The judge has ordered the Defendant to give notice of this ruling and has advised the parties to review their discovery disputes and attempt to resolve them without further litigation.
