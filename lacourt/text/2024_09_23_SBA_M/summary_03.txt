And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants Jalula Roberts' motion for trial preference, which is mandatory under Code of Civil Procedure section 36(a) when a party meets the requirements. The court finds that Jalula has met the requirements, as she is over 70 years old and her health condition necessitates a preferential trial date. The court also finds that Jalula's counsel has adequately complied with the requirements by submitting a conclusory declaration as to Jalula's health. The court considers the parties' arguments regarding due process concerns and determines that they are speculative at this time. The trial date is set for ______________________, and Jalula is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
