And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court sustains the demurrer to the fourth cause of action in the second amended complaint with 20 days' leave to amend as to Richard, Roberto, Jorge, and Grosac. This is the last opportunity the court will give the plaintiff to attempt to plead this cause of action.

The court sustains the demurrer to the fourth cause of action in the second amended complaint without leave to amend as to Mercado Latino.

The demurrer was filed by the defendants, and the plaintiff filed an opposition to the demurrer. The defendants replied to the opposition, and Jorge Rodriguez filed a joinder to the demurrer.

The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations of financial elder abuse are conclusory and fail to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action. The court also finds that the plaintiff's allegations regarding the defendants' alleged failure to return the plaintiff's stock certificates are conclusory and fail to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action.

The court notes that the plaintiff's allegations regarding the defendants' alleged siphoning off of dividends and profits from Grosac are also conclusory and fail to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action.

The court also notes that the plaintiff's allegations regarding the defendants' alleged failure to return the plaintiff's stock certificates are not sufficient to state a cause of action for financial elder abuse.

The court concludes that the plaintiff's allegations of financial elder abuse are insufficient and fails to state a cause of action.
