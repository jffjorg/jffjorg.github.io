And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the plaintiff's motion to vacate the void order of May 23, 2023, and has denied the motion. The plaintiff argues that the order is void due to lack of notice and confusion caused by the court's scheduling. However, the judge finds that the court's previous ruling stands. The judge also finds that there was good cause to reassign the case to Dept. P and that the plaintiff and her counsel were aware of the case but did not understand that it had different hearing dates than the related case. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's counsel received notice of the 5/23/23 hearing date but claims to have monitored their mail daily and never received notice of the hearing. The judge concludes that the plaintiff does not sufficiently indicate that the dismissal was entered as the result of excusable neglect and that the plaintiff's third argument fails.
