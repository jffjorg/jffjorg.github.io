Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses four motions filed by M.G. Unicorn, Inc. (Defendant/Cross-Complainant): (1) to compel attendance at deposition, (2) for a protective order, (3) for appointment of a discovery referee, and (4) for monetary sanctions. The Judge denies the motion to compel attendance at deposition, grants the motion for a protective order in part, denies the motion for appointment of a discovery referee, and denies the motion for monetary sanctions. The Judge finds that M.G. Unicorn, Inc.'s counsel's conduct during the deposition was obstructive and offensive, but also notes that Plaintiff/Cross-Defendants' counsel's conduct was unprofessional. The Judge orders the parties to meet and confer to schedule a resumption of the deposition and reminds counsel of their oath to conduct themselves with dignity, courtesy, and integrity.
