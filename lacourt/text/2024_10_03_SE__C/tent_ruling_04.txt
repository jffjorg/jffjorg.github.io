CASE NO.:  23NWCV00392
HEARING:  10/03/24
 
#5
 
Defendant TAHANI SOLIMAN’s Motion to Compel Appearance and
Testimony of Plaintiff MARY ROSE ORTIZ at Deposition is CONTINUED to Thursday,
October 10, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. Trial is set for November 5,
2024. The discovery cut-off date is extended as to this matter only.   
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
No Reply filed as of October 1, 2024. Due by September 25,
2024. (CCP §1005(b).) 
 
Defendant noticed the deposition of Plaintiff for July 12,
2024. Prior to the date of the deposition, Defendant’s counsel was told by a
non-attorney at Plaintiff’s office that Plaintiff would not be appearing for
the deposition. “Because Plaintiff’s counsel himself did not conform he would
not appear or produce Plaintiff, Defendant appeared for the deposition.
Plaintiff did not appear.” (Motion 3:23-25.) 
 
Defendant now moves to compel the deposition of Plaintiff,
and for monetary sanctions. 
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff argues that the Motion is
procedurally defective and must be denied because Defendant failed to submit a
declaration stating that the Defendant contacted the deponent to inquire about
the nonappearance after Plaintiff failed to appear as required by CCP
§2025.450(b)(2). 
 
Defendant’s motion for an order compelling Plaintiff to
appear at an oral deposition and for monetary sanctions is CONTINUED as
indicated above.  
 
As argued in Opposition, Defendant has not submitted a
declaration indicating either that they attempted to meet and confer after
Plaintiff failed to appear or that they otherwise contacted
Plaintiff/Plaintiff’s Counsel about the nonappearance. (CCP §2025.450(b)(2).)
Motions under CCP §2025.450 must “be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040, or when the deponent fails to attend the
deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or
things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” (CCP
§2025.450(b)(2).) 
 
Although defense counsel has submitted a declaration
indicating meet and confer efforts prior to the deposition, CCP §2025.450(b)(2)
requires evidence of such efforts after the deponent fails to appear at the
deposition. 
 
In the interests of justice and in favor of adjudicating
this matter on the merits, this matter is CONTINUED as indicated above. The
Defendant/Moving Party is ORDERED to comply with CCP §2025.450(b)(2) and then
FILE and SERVE a Declaration in compliance with the Code by no later than
October 8, 2024. 
 
The Court notes that trial is scheduled to begin on November
5, 2024, and Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is
scheduled to be heard after trial, on March 5, 2025.
