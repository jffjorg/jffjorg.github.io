And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiffs' ex parte application to advance the hearing date of their motion to be relieved as counsel. The Plaintiffs argued that the hearing date is currently set for July 10, 2025, but no motion to be relieved as counsel appears in the court system. The Judge cited California Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c), which states that a party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing of "irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte." The Judge denied the application, ordering the moving party to give notice.
