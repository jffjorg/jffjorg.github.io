Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
Untimely
Opposition filed on October 1, 2024—2 days before the hearing. Due by September
19, 2024. (CCP §1005(b).) In the untimely Opposition, Defendant’s Counsel fails
to address or explain why the Opposition could not have been timely filed or
served. The Court record does not reflect that Defendant sought any type of
continuance or leave from the Court to file untimely Opposition papers.
Notwithstanding these deficiencies, and in the absence of prejudice to the
Moving Party, the Court exercises its discretion to consider Defendant’s
untimely Opposition under CCP §473(b) because defense counsel “lost contact
with defendant Alan Hernandez for some time after answer and only recently
re-established contact with him.” (Kwan Decl., ¶2.) 
 
Motions to
Compel 
 
If a party
to whom interrogatories and document demands are directed fails to respond at
all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers
thereto. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) All that needs to be shown is that the
discovery was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond
has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. The moving party
is not required to show a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the
matter informally before filing this motion. A motion to compel initial
discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely
filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate statement. (See Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The failure to timely respond also waives all
objections. 
 
Here, Plaintiff
has shown that Special Interrogatories (set one), Form Interrogatories (set
one) and Request for Production of Documents (set one) were properly served
onto Defendant ALAN GILBERT PEREZ on September 15, 2023. 
 
In the
untimely Opposition filed two days before this hearing (on October 1, 2024),
Defendant’s Counsel states: “My office has worked with Mr. Hernandez to prepare
responses to all of the written discovery at issue, and then served the
verified responses on the same day this limited opposition is being filed, on
October 1, 2024.” (Kwan Decl., ¶4.) 
 
The Motions
are DENIED as MOOT. 
Sanctions
may be awarded against a party who fails to oppose a motion to compel, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
after the motion was filed. (C.R.C 3.1348(a).). Reasonable sanctions are
awarded as indicated below:
Reasonable Sanctions
are GRANTED in the total amount for all three Motions to Compel, of $934.95. Defendant
ALAN GILBERT PEREZ and his counsel of record are jointly and severally ORDERED
to pay Moving Party and their counsel of record sanctions in the total amount
of $934.95, payable within 30 days from the date of the Court’s issuance of
this Order. 
 
Motion to
Deem Admitted 
 
“If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the following rules apply: (a) The party to whom the requests for
admission are directed waives any objection to the requests…. The Court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both
of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210,
2033.220, and 2033.230. (2) the party’s failure to serve a timely response was
the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect…. (c) The court shall
make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7…on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.” (CCP §2033.280.)  Unverified
responses “are tantamount to no responses at all.” (Appleton v. Superior
Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) No prior attempt to resolve the
matter informally is required. 
 
Here,
RFAs were propounded on or about September 15, 2023.
 
In
the untimely Opposition filed on October 1, 2024, Defendant contends that
untimely responses were served on October 1, 2024, thus rendering this Motion
moot. 
 
Where
untimely responses were ultimately served prior to this hearing, the Motion is
DENIED as MOOT. 
 
Reasonable
sanctions are mandatory under CCP §2033.280(c) and are awarded as follows: 
 
Defendant
ALAN GILBERT HERNANDEZ and his counsel of record are jointly and severally
ORDERED to pay Moving Party and their counsel of record sanctions in the total
amount of $311.65, payable within 30 days from the date of the Court’s issuance
of this Order.
