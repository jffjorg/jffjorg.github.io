  Case Number:  21STCV00562    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2024    Dept:  C Jimenez,
et al. vs. Golden West Food Group, Inc., Case No. 21STCV00562
 
This
is a wrongful death action based on premises liability theory. Attorneys for
Plaintiffs move ex parte to advance the hearing date of Plaintiffs’ counsel’s
motion to be relieved as counsel. 
 
A
party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing
"irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)
 
Plaintiffs
argue that it is currently set for July 10, 2025, but no motion to be relieved
as counsel appears in the court system. 
 
Thus,
the court denies the application. 
 
Moving
party to give notice.
