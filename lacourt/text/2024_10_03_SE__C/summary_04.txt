And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ortiz v. Soliman, continuing the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff to October 10, 2024. The trial is set for November 5, 2024. The defendant's motion to compel the deposition and for monetary sanctions is stayed pending compliance with CCP §2025.450(b)(2), which requires a meet and confer declaration. The plaintiff's counsel failed to produce the plaintiff for the deposition, and the defendant appeared for the deposition despite being told by a non-attorney at the plaintiff's office that the plaintiff would not appear. The judge notes that the trial is scheduled to begin on November 5, 2024, and the plaintiff's counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel is scheduled to be heard after trial.
