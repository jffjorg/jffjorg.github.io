The tentative ruling denies the motion for summary judgment on all causes of action. The court finds that there is evidence to support the Orwashers' position that they could have obtained a more favorable judgment or settlement in the underlying action. The court also finds that Michels & Lew did not meet their burden of showing that they did not breach their fiduciary duty, commit fraud, or breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
