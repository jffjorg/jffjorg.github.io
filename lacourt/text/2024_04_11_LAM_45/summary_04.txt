The judge grants Defendant Varela's unopposed motion to compel arbitration, staying the court action pending binding arbitration as to the entire action. The case involves a breach of contract and related employment claims. The defendant, Gilbert Varela, is a former CEO of Central City Community Health Center, Inc. The plaintiff, Omar Moreno, alleges financial improprieties and fraud by Varela and others at Central City. The judge finds that the plaintiff's fourth cause of action for Interference with Contractual Relations is intertwined with the underlying contract and arbitration provision, entitling Varela to compel arbitration. The case is stayed pending binding arbitration as to the entire action.
