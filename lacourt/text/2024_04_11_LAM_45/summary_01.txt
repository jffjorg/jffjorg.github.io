And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denied the plaintiff's motion to expunge the lien asserted by Oak River Insurance Company. The plaintiff, Jose Villagomez, is seeking to expunge the lien for $23,526.14, which was filed by Oak River after Villagomez received workers' compensation benefits. The judge found that the Labor Code does not provide for an expungement of the lien, and that the plaintiff's argument for expunging the lien was denied based on the lack of provision for expungement in Labor Code section 3852. The judge also found that Oak River's opposition was late, and that the plaintiff's argument for denying Oak River's recovery was untimely.
