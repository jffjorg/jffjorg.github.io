And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling states that the court will treat the contentions as waived if they are not accompanied by cogent legal arguments and citations to authority. The ruling cites several previous court cases that support this approach, including In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke, Niko v. Foreman, People ex rel. Dept. of Alcoholic Beverage Control v. Miller Brewing Co., and Badie v. Bank of America. The judge intends to apply this principle to the current case, which means that any points made by the parties without sufficient legal support will be disregarded.
