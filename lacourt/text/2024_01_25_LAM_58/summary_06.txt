Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a Tentative Ruling on the demurrer filed by the Cross-Defendant (Zizi Attia) to the Cross-Complaint filed by the Cross-Complainant (Ehab Khela). The demurrer was filed in response to the Cross-Complaint, which alleges breach of oral contract, fraud, and promissory estoppel.

The Judge has overruled the demurrer in part and sustained it in part. The Judge has ruled that the statute of frauds does not apply to the alleged oral agreement, and therefore, the demurrer to the first cause of action (breach of oral contract) is overruled.

However, the Judge has sustained the demurrer to the second and third causes of action (fraud and promissory estoppel) because the claims are insufficiently pleaded. The Judge has given the Cross-Complainant leave to amend the Cross-Complaint to cure these defects.

The Judge has ordered the first amended cross-complaint to be served and filed on or before February 23, 2024.
