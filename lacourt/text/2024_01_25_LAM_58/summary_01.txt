And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the motion for summary judgment filed by the plaintiffs/cross-defendants. The plaintiffs/cross-defendants sought to bar the First Amended Cross-Complaint filed by the defendants/cross-complainants on the basis of the bankruptcy discharge order. However, the court found that the crossclaims at issue are a crossclaims for declaratory relief and indemnity arising out of the plaintiff's affirmative claims against the cross-complainants, and are therefore not barred by the bankruptcy discharge.

The court also denied the plaintiffs/cross-defendants' argument that the indemnity agreement between LA Ice and ASEC is invalid. The court found that the evidence submitted by the parties does not support the conclusion that LaRoche was an employee for all purposes, and therefore the indemnity agreement is valid.

The court's ruling is based on the evidence submitted by the parties and the applicable laws and statutes. The court's decision is tentative and subject to change after the hearing on January 25, 2024.
