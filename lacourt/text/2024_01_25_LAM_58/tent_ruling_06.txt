 
             This action arises from breach of contract. Plaintiff
Zizi Attia (Attia) alleges that he gave $50,000 to Defendant Ehab Khela (Khela)
to locate and purchase real property on Plaintiff’s behalf; Defendant failed to
perform. On May 12, 2023, Plaintiff Zizi Attia filed a Complaint for (1.)
breach of contract, (2.) fraud, (3.) breach of constructive trust, and (4.)
elder abuse. 
 
            On November
13, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Ehab Khela filed a Cross-Complaint for
(1.) breach of oral contract, (2.) fraud, and (3.) promissory estoppel. The
Cross-Complaint alleges that Khela purchased real property for Cross-Defendant Attia
in the amount of $85,000, contributing $36,500 of his own money to secure the
purchase of the property. Cross-Complainant Khela put title to the property in Cross-Defendant
Attia’s brother’s name. Cross-Defendant Attia now refuses to reimburse
Cross-Complainant Khela. 
 
On December 12, 2023, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
filed a demurrer the Cross-Complaint. Defendant/Cross-Complainant filed an
opposition to the demurrer. No reply was filed.   
 
            The demurrer
is overruled in part and sustained in part. 
 
Legal Standard for
Demurrers
 
A demurrer is an objection to a
pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the face of the
complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the
sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v.
Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law . . . .” ’ ”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007)
152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court
liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has
been stated. (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50
Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
Discussion

 
Cross-Defendant Attia argues the Cross-Complaint
fails to state a claim and is uncertain. 
 
First Cause of Action:
 
             Cross-Defendant Attia argues that the first cause of action
for breach of oral contract is barred under the statute of frauds. 
 
            The statute
of frauds, set forth in Civil Code section 1624, reads in relevant part, “The
following contracts are invalid, unless they, or some note or memorandum
thereof, are in writing and subscribed by the party to be charged.... [¶](3) An
agreement.... for the sale of real property, or of an interest therein.”
 
            Cross-Defendant argues that the alleged
contract in the Cross-Complaint was oral and for the purchase of real property.
(XC ¶ 24.) Because the contract was not in writing and was for the purchase of
real property, Cross-Defendant contends Cross-Complainant cannot enforce the
oral contract for the purchase of property.
 
            As the Opposition points out, Cross-Defendant Attia’s own
pleadings confirm the existence of this exact oral agreement. (Compl., ¶ 11.) Thus,
the statute of frauds does not apply. (Isaac v. A & B Loan Co. (1988) 201
Cal.App.3d 307, 311; see Civ. Code, § 1624, subd. (b)(3)(C) [“[t]here is
sufficient evidence that a contract has been made” if “[t]he party against whom
enforcement is sought admits in its pleading ... that a contract was made”].) 
 
The demurrer is overruled to this
cause of action. 
 
Second Cause of
Action:
 
Cross-Defendant
also demurs to the second cause of action for fraud based on a lack of
specificity.
The elements of fraud are (a) a
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
scienter or knowledge of its falsity; (c) intent to induce reliance; (d)
justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage. (Lazar v. Superior Court
(1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638.) “Fraud in the inducement is a subset of the tort
of fraud.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289,
294.) It “occurs when ‘ “the promisor knows what he is signing but his consent
is induced by fraud, mutual assent is present and a contract is formed, which,
by reason of the fraud, is voidable.” ’ ” (Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin.
Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 415 [quoting Ford v. Shearson
Lehman American Express, Inc. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 1011, 1028].)
            Further, “fraud must be pleaded specifically; general and conclusory allegations
do not suffice.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.)
“This particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts which show how,
where, to whom, and by what means” the alleged fraud occurred. (Id.) The purpose of the particularity requirement is
to “separate meritorious and nonmeritorious cases, if possible in advance of
trial.” (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167,
184.)  
Cross-Defendant
argues that the fraud claim fails to specify the representations made, the
falsity of the representations, Cross-Defendant’s knowledge of such falsity and
how Cross-Complainant relied on the representations to his detriment.
 
This
argument is well taken. This cause of action fails to allege the “who, what,
where, and how” of the allegedly false representation; this lack of particularity
is fatal to the claim. 
 
The
demurrer to this cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
Third Cause of
Action:
 
            Finally, Cross-Defendant demurs to
the cause of action for promissory estoppel on the grounds that it fails to “clearly
articulate the specific promises made” or show justifiable reliance. 
 
            A
claim for promissory estoppel consists of four elements: “ ‘[1] A promise [2]
which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on
the part of the promisee or a third person and [3] which does induce such
action or forbearance ... [and 4] injustice can be avoided only by enforcement
of the promise.’ ” (Kajima/Ray Wilson v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transp. Authority (2000) 23 Cal.4th 305, 310.) Further, the promise must be
one that is “clear and unambiguous in its terms.” (Laks v. Coast Fed. Sav.
& Loan Assn. (1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 885, 890.)
 
            The
doctrine of promissory estoppel “make[s] a promise binding under certain
circumstances, without consideration in the usual sense of something bargained
for and given in exchange.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969)
70 Cal.2d 240, 249.) “Under this doctrine a promisor is bound when he should
reasonably expect a substantial change of position, either by act or
forbearance, in reliance on his promise, if injustice can be avoided only by
its enforcement.” (Ibid.) 
 
            The demurrer is well taken. Like the
fraud claim, the nature of the promise is not sufficiently specific to satisfy
the pleading requirements. The demurrer to this cause of action is sustained
with leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
 
The demurrer is overruled as to the
first cause of action and sustained as to the second and third causes of action.
Cross-Complainant shall have leave to amend. The first amended cross-complaint
shall be served and filed on or before February 23, 2024.
