```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge grants the motion to bifurcate the trial, allowing the court to first adjudicate the defendant's affirmative defenses of res judicata, collateral estoppel, and failure to exhaust judicial remedies. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's failure to challenge the Board's findings by filing a writ of mandate renders those findings binding in this instant lawsuit, while the plaintiff argues that she was not required to exhaust the internal grievance process under the collective bargaining agreement. The judge notes that the purpose of the bifurcation motion is not to determine the merits of the defenses, but to determine how to marshal the court's limited judicial resources most efficiently for trial. The judge concludes that bifurcation is warranted in this case, as it will promote judicial economy and save judicial resources.
