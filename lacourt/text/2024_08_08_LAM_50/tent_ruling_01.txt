[TENTATIVE AND PROPOSED] STATEMENT OF DECISION BY THE COURT AFTER TRIAL 
 



 
 
[TENTATIVE
AND PROPOSED] STATEMENT OF DECISION BY
THE COURT AFTER TRIAL     
This
matter came on for trial on April 17-23, 2024, in Department 50 of the
above-entitled Court before the Hon. Teresa A. Beaudet, sitting without a jury.
The Court, having considered the evidence and read the arguments of counsel,
issues this tentative and proposed Statement of Decision. This tentative and
proposed Statement of Decision will become the Statement of Decision unless,
within 15 days hereafter, a party serves and files objections to the proposed
Statement of Decision. 
 
 
THE MATERIAL ISSUES TO BE
DETERMINED
The
following are the material issues to be determined by the Court:
A.  Did Defendant Kurshid Khan Muhammad (“Defendant”)
breach the contingency retainer agreement (the “Agreement”) he entered into
with Plaintiff Law Offices of Ramin R. Younessi (“Plaintiff”) by failing to pay
Plaintiff $101,250.00 in attorney fees and $8,054.16 in costs due under the
Agreement?
 
B.  Did Plaintiff forfeit the right to enforce the
Agreement by voluntarily withdrawing from the representation of Defendant in the
case Defendant brought against his former employer, AltaMed Health Services
Corporation (the “AltaMed Case”)?
 
C.  If Plaintiff cannot enforce the Agreement, is
Plaintiff entitled to recover fees and costs based on promissory estoppel, quantum
meruit or unjust enrichment?
 
 
A.   
Did Defendant Breach the Agreement? 
 
“To
prevail on a cause of action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove
(1) the contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the
plaintiff.” ((Richman
v. Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186).  Contract formation results from the
acceptance of proposals which are sufficiently definite such that upon
acceptance the performance promised is reasonably certain.  ((Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793,
811).   Construction of a written fee
agreement is essentially a judicial function exercised in accordance with the
legal principles of contract interpretation. ((Sayble v. Feinman (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d
509, 512); M’Guinness
v. Johnson (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 602, 617-618; Go Tek Energy, Inc. v. SoCal IP Law Group,
LLP (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1240, 1249. [attorney fees provision must be
analyzed on its own terms and in context pursuant to rules of contract
interpretation for determining actual intent of parties.]
Defendant never disputed he entered into a valid
agreement for legal services with Plaintiff on July 8, 2019.  From July 8, 2019, to May 26, 2021, Defendant
did not claim that the terms of the Agreement were vague or unenforceable.  From July 8, 2019 through May 26, 2021 Plaintiff
fully performed under the Agreement with Defendant’s knowledge that Plaintiff
was performing legal services on behalf of and for the benefit of Defendant.  Plaintiff obtained a Right to Sue Letter from
the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing on June 18, 2020 and
served the Right to Sue Letter on AltaMed. 
Plaintiff thereafter filed a lawsuit on Defendant’s behalf against
AltaMed for discrimination and related causes of action on August 18,
2020.  Back and forth communications
transpired between Plaintiff and AltaMed’s legal counsel in connection with Defendant’s
lawsuit as part of the litigation process. 
During this time, Plaintiff was in communication with Defendant himself
regarding the case and how it was proceeding. 
In an effort to avoid protracted litigation and
reach an early agreeable resolution of Defendant’s case against AltaMed, the
parties agreed to participate in mediation. 
With Defendant’s consent, the all-day mediation took place on May 26,
2021.  Defendant was an active
participant in the proceedings.  The
mediation resulted in a gross settlement amount being agreed upon between Defendant
and his former employer AltaMed.  Defendant
was presented with settlement documents which included a long-form agreement
and an MOU.  Both documents were
explained to him.  Defendant signed the
MOU which memorialized the parties’ settlement. At the conclusion
of the mediation on May 26, 2021, when the MOU was executed, the services to be
rendered by Plaintiff to Defendant were concluded. 
The Court finds that Defendant breached the Agreement
by failing to pay Plaintiff the $101,250.00 in attorney fees and $8,054.16 in
costs due under the Agreement. In accordance with the Agreement, Plaintiff had represented
Defendant in the AltaMed case through the settlement at the mediation. After
agreeing to the terms of the settlement and signing a binding MOU, Defendant
refused to perform his part under the MOU. Thereafter, Defendant also refused
to pay Plaintiff the attorney fees and costs in breach of the Agreement.[1]
 
 
B.    
Did Plaintiff Forfeit the
Right to Enforce the Agreement by Withdrawing from the Representation of
Defendant?
The
Court finds that Plaintiff did not forfeit the right to enforce the Agreement
by withdrawing from the representation of Defendant. When Defendant insisted
upon asserting a position in the AltaMed Case that lacked probable cause, under
the State Bar Rules of Professional Conduct, Plaintiff was required to withdraw
from representation of Defendant. 
C.    Is
Plaintiff Entitled to Recover Fees and Costs Based Upon Promissory Estoppel, Quantum
Meruit or Unjust Enrichment?
Even
if Plaintiff could not recover under a breach of contract theory, Plaintiff
would be entitled to recover its fees and costs pursuant to Quantum Meruit.

As
an alternative to an action on the express contract, an attorney may sue on the
basis of quantum meruit to recover for the reasonable value of the
attorney’s services. See, Hardy v. San Fernando
Valley Chamber of Commerce (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 572, 576-577.
 Even if a fee contract is void as
against public policy, an attorney may still recover in quantum meruit
for the reasonable value of the services that were rendered under the contract.
(Rosenberg v. Lawrence (1938) 10 Cal.2d 590, 593-594); (Calvert v. Stoner (1948) 33 Cal.2d 97, 104-105); see also, Denton
v. Smith (1951) 101 Cal.App.2d 841, 844-845. A quantum meruit fee is
based on the reasonable value of services rendered rather than the amount due
under a contract or the “resulting benefit” of services performed. (Earhart v. William Low Co. (1979) 25 Cal.3d 503, 505).  To recover on a quantum
meruit theory, an attorney must establish that: (1) the plaintiff attorney
was acting pursuant to either an express or implied request for such services
from the defendant; and (2) the services rendered were intended to and did
benefit the defendant. Day v. Alta Bates Med. Ctr. (2002)
98 Cal.App.4th 243, 248-249; Huskinson &
Brown, LLP v. Wolf (2004) 32 Cal.App.4th 453, 458 [attorney must show
services were rendered under some understanding or expectation of both parties
that compensation would be paid.] 
The
starting point for determining a “reasonable fee” is the “number of hours
reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly
rate.  This calculation provides an
objective basis on which to make an initial estimate of the value of a lawyer’s
services.”  Mardirossian
& Assocs., Inc. v. Ersoff  (2007)
153 Cal.App.4th 257, 272; Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132 [“lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal
services in the community.”]  In the case
of attorney discharge, when such discharge occurs “on the courthouse steps”
where the client executes a settlement obtained after work by the attorney, the
factors involved in determination of a reasonable fee “would certainly justify
a finding that the entire fee was the reasonable value of the attorney’s
services.” (Fracasse v. Brent (1972) 6 Cal.3d 784, 791).  Recovery under quantum meruit is not limited
to hours spent.  The pro rata contract
price measure allows a party to recover the “benefit of the bargain” to the
extent the contract has been performed. (Cazares v.
Saenz (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 279,
290).
Plaintiff
seeks the benefit of Plaintiff’s written agreement with Defendant.  Plaintiff seeks the full contingency fee of 45%
of the gross settlement of $225,000.00, or $101,250.00.  Plaintiff performed valuable legal services
on Defendant’s behalf in reliance on the parties’ agreement. Plaintiff assumed the
risk if there was no recovery on Defendant’s behalf, then Plaintiff would
receive no fee as that was the risk Plaintiff bore. Defendant received a
financial monetary recovery benefit through Plaintiff’s work and efforts, which
monetary recovery Defendant agreed to accept when he signed the MOU. That
settlement was upheld by the underlying trial court and the court ordered AltaMed
to pay the agreed gross settlement proceeds to Defendant.  He received the full amount of his share of the
undisputed settlement proceeds to which he was entitled under the Agreement.  Consequently, the Court finds that Plaintiff
is entitled to recover the value of the services rendered under the quantum
meruit theory.
CONCLUSION
            The Court finds in favor of Plaintiff and awards damages
in the amount of $101,250.00 in  attorney
fees and $8,054.16 in costs.  The Court
also finds that Plaintiff has a valid and enforceable lien against the
settlement proceeds from the AltaMed Case. 
Within
ten days after this Statement of Decision becomes final, Plaintiff is ordered
to file and serve a proposed judgment in accordance with these findings (with a
courtesy copy delivered to Dept. 50). The Court hereby dismisses the Doe
defendants.
            Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this tentative and
proposed Statement of Decision.
