Plaintiff Martha Conteras seeks to consolidate the instant action with an unlawful detainer matter, case no. 23LBUD03038.The Motion is denied, without prejudice, because the two cases at issue are not in the same department and there has been no attempt to relate the cases.  (Local Rule 3.3(g)(1) [“Cases may not be consolidated unless they are in the same department. A motion to consolidate two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in different departments, have been related into a single department, or if the cases were already assigned to that department.”].)Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
