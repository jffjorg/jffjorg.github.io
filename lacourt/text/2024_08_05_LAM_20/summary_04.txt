And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Honorable Judge has issued a tentative ruling on six motions to compel further responses to discovery requests. The motions were filed by Anastasiia Arseneva, Omar Zambrano, and Sydney Cubas.

The judge denied Arseneva's motions to compel further responses to her requests for admission and production, finding that she did not meet and confer in good faith and that the motions were untimely.

The judge granted Zambrano's motion to compel further responses to his requests for admission, finding that Arseneva's response was insufficient and that further responses were necessary. The judge also granted Zambrano's motion to compel further responses to his special interrogatories, finding that Arseneva's objections lacked merit.

The judge denied Sydney Cubas's motion to compel further responses to Arseneva's requests for production, finding that Cubas had provided responsive documents and that the requests were duplicative and vexatious.

The judge granted Arseneva's motion to compel further responses to Zambrano's requests for admission, finding that Zambrano's response was insufficient and that further responses were necessary.

The judge denied Zambrano's motion to compel further responses to Arseneva's requests for production, finding that Arseneva had provided responsive documents and that the requests were duplicative and vexatious.

The judge declined to award sanctions in any of the motions. The parties are ordered to comply with the judge's tentative ruling, and counsel are encouraged to submit on the tentative or appear remotely via LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
