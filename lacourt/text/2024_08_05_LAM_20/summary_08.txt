And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Jeffrey A. Asidi, counsel for plaintiff Juan Manuel Quiroz Canchola, to withdraw as counsel. The motion is granted because it meets all requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. Asidi is required to give notice to the client and is relieved as counsel of record for the client effective upon the filing of the proof of service for the court order.

The judge has also granted the motion of L.A. Live Rentals, LLC, the defendant, to enforce the stipulated settlement with plaintiff Juan Manuel Quiroz Canchola. The defendant contends that the plaintiff and other parties agreed to a settlement, but the plaintiff refuses to sign a long-form agreement, which precludes the action from being dismissed and the insurer from tendering payment under the settlement. The court has determined that the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement and has granted the motion to enforce the settlement, as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The defendant is required to give notice of the granted motion.
