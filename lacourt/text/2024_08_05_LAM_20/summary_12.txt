And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion to consolidate the instant action with an unlawful detainer matter. The motion is denied, without prejudice, because the two cases are not in the same department and there has been no attempt to relate the cases. The Judge cites Local Rule 3.3(g)(1), which states that cases cannot be consolidated unless they are in the same department. The moving party is required to give notice of the denial. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, counsel are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person if they do not submit on the tentative ruling.
