And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a motion by Target Corporation (Defendant) to compel the deposition of Enedino Espinoza (Plaintiff). The Plaintiff has already been deposed in related cases (Molina and Song) on June 29, 2024, but the Defendant seeks to depose him again in the instant case. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff only agreed to one deposition, but the Court finds that a second deposition is warranted due to remaining topics that were not addressed in the first deposition.

The Court denies the motion to compel deposition, however, because the Defendant did not serve the deposition notice in a timely manner and did not provide proof of service. The Court orders the parties to meet and confer to discuss the estimated time of a second deposition and the general topics that remain. The parties are also ordered to participate in an informal discovery conference to resolve any further disputes.
