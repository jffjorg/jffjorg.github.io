And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied Plaintiff Matthew Morgan's motion to continue trial, which was filed on August 2, 2024. The motion appears to be moot, as trial has already been continued to December 9, 2024. The judge notes that Plaintiff's previous motion to continue trial was denied, and that the Court has previously granted continuances based on good cause. The judge cites California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, which sets forth the factors to consider in ruling on a motion to continue trial. The judge finds that Plaintiff has not provided sufficient good cause to justify another continuance, and therefore denies the motion.
