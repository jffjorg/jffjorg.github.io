MOTION
 
This
case arises from an alleged motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff
Matthew Morgan (“Plaintiff”) now moves to continue trial. No opposition has
been filed.  
 
BACKGROUND
 
            The complaint was filed on January
2, 2020. The first amended complaint (“FAC”) was filed on January 21, 2020. Trial
was initially set for July 1, 2021. 
 
            On July 1, 2021, the case was
dismissed without prejudice after Plaintiff failed to appear at trial and
failed to serve the complaint. 
 
            On January 5, 2022, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s motion to set aside the dismissal. Trial was set for August
15, 2022. 
 
            On August 15, 2022, Plaintiff represented
that publication started on July 21, 2022, and would run for 30 days. As a
result, the trial was placed off calendar. 
 
            On December 28, 2022, default was
entered against Defendant. 
 
            On April 11, 2023, the Court granted
default judgment against Defendant. 
 
            On September 19, 2023, the Court
granted Defendant’s motion to set aside the default and default judgment. 
 
            On September 19, 2023, Defendant
filed his answer. 
 
            On October 6, 2023, trial was
scheduled for March 6, 2024. 
 
            On January 22, 2024, the Court granted
in part Defendant’s ex parte application and continued trial to May 22, 2024. 
 
            On April 18, 2024, pursuant to
stipulation, the Court continued trial to July 10, 2024.
 
            On June 25, 2024, at the final
status conference, the Court noted two motions to compel further discovery
responses set for July 5, 2024, and pursuant to oral stipulation, continued
trial to August 8, 2024. 
 
            On August 5, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s ex parte application and, pursuant to oral stipulation, continued
trial to December 9, 2024. The order further stated the following: “Discovery
is to remain closed absent a stipulation or an order from the Court pursuant to
the filing of a Motion to Reopen Discovery. No further continuance of the Trial
without sufficient good cause.” (Min. Order, 8/5/24.) 
 
            On October 25, 2024, the Court
denied Plaintiff’s motion to continue trial and related dates. 
            
ANALYSIS
 
Legal
Standard
 
 “Continuances are granted only on an affirmative showing of good
cause requiring a continuance.”¿ (In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke
(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 814, 823.)¿ A trial court has broad discretion in
considering a request for a trial continuance.¿ (Pham v. Nguyen (1997)
54 Cal.App.4th 11, 13-18.)¿ California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332 sets forth
factors for the Court to consider in ruling on a motion to continue
trial. 
 
“To ensure the prompt disposition of
civil cases, the dates assigned for a trial are firm. All parties and their
counsel must regard the date set for trial as certain.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1332(a).) 
 
“A party seeking a continuance of the
date set for trial, whether contested or uncontested or stipulated to by the
parties, must make the request for a continuance by a noticed motion or an ex
parte application under the rules in chapter 4 of this division, with
supporting declarations. The party must make the motion or application as soon
as reasonably practical once the necessity for the continuance is discovered.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(b).)
 
“Although continuances of trials are disfavored, each
request for a continuance must be considered on its own merits. The court may
grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance. Circumstances that may indicate good cause include:
 
(1)  
The
unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness,
or other excusable circumstances;
(2)  
The
unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;
(3)  
The
unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances; 
(4)  
The
substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing
that the substitution is required in the interests of justice;
(5)  
The
addition of a new party if:
(A) The new party has not had a
reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or
(B) The other parties have not
had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in
regard to the new party’s involvement in the case;
(6)  
A
party’s excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other
material evidence despite diligent efforts; or
(7)  
A
significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of
which the case is not ready for trial.” 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)
 
“In ruling on a motion or application for continuance, the
court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are relevant to the
determination. These may include:
 
(1)  
The
proximity of the trial date;
(2)  
Whether
there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to
any party;
(3)  
The
length of the continuance requested;
(4)  
The
availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the
motion or application for a continuance;
(5)  
The
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;
(6)  
If
the case is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that
status and whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid
delay;
(7)  
The
court’s calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending
trials;
(8)  
Whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial;
(9)  
Whether
all parties have stipulated to a continuance;
(10)  Whether the interests of
justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by
imposing conditions on the continuance; and
(11)  Any other fact or
circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or application.
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)
 
 
Discussion
 
This motion was filed on August 2, 2024, and written under the
assumption that trial was going to begin on August 8, 2024, and Plaintiff would
be unavailable because he was starting an internship on that date. Since trial
has already been continued to December 9, 2024, this motion appears moot. As a
result, the motion is denied. 
 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court DENIES as moot Plaintiff’s motion to
continue trial. 
 
Plaintiff shall give notice of this order, and file a proof
of service of such.
