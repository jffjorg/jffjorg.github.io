And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant's motion to specially set the hearing date or continue trial, without prejudice. The judge notes that the motion was procedurally defective because it was not served within the minimum statutory timeframe required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005. The judge also declines to award sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 since Plaintiff failed to show compliance with the procedural requirements. The judge concludes that the motion is denied and orders Defendant to give notice of this order and file a proof of service of such.
