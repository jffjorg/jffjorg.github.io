And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion to compel responses to discovery requests. The plaintiff, Mariefe Dizon, failed to serve responses to the discovery requests, and the defendant, Regina Isaac, is seeking to compel the plaintiff to serve verified responses. The judge has denied the defendant's motions to compel responses on procedural grounds, as the motions were not served on the plaintiff's counsel of record. The judge has also denied the defendant's request for monetary sanctions. The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Rules of Court. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to determine if a resolution may be reached, and if not, they should arrange to appear in person or remotely at the hearing.
