And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the dispute between the Plaintiff and Defendant regarding the deposition of Mr. Espinoza. The Plaintiff argues that the Defendant did not meet and confer, and that the deposition is a tactic to prepare for the Molina/Song trial. However, the Court notes that the Molina/Song case has settled and the trial date was vacated, making this argument moot. The Plaintiff also disputes the Defendant's counsel's signature on the stipulation for the deposition, but fails to show that it was clear that the two sessions of the deposition would take place on the same day. The Court and parties discussed the possibility and timing of one deposition, and the Court did not indicate that it would rule that only one deposition would be permitted. The Defendant argues that Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.610 refers to depositions taken in one case, and that the section provides that for good cause shown, the court may grant leave to take a subsequent deposition.
