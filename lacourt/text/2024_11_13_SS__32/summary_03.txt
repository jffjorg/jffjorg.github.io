And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Court has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition. The plaintiff failed to object to the deposition notice and did not appear for the deposition on October 7, 2024. The Court finds that the defendant has shown good cause for the production of documents described in the deposition notice and grants the motion. The plaintiff is ordered to appear for a deposition within 30 days of the order. The Court declines to award monetary sanctions since none are sought.
