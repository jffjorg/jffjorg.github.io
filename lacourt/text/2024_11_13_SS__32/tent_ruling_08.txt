Plaintiff disputes that Defendant met and conferred.


[2] Plaintiff
also argues the deposition is a tactic to prepare for the Molina/Song
trial. (Opp., 5.) The Court notes that the Molina/Song case has settled,
and the trial date was vacated. Therefore, this argument appears moot.  


[3]
Plaintiff’s counsel admits that the parties “stipulate[d] to one deposition of
Mr. Espinoza, in two sessions, the first including Molina and Song as to
liability, the second (which I thought was only in the Espinoza case) as to his
damages.” (Id. ¶ 14; Opp., 6.) Plaintiff appears to argue that he
believed these two parts of the deposition would occur on the same day and that
Defendant’s counsel improperly affixed Plaintiff’s counsel’s signature on the
stipulation. However, Plaintiff fails to show that it was clear that the two
sessions of Plaintiff’s deposition would take place on the same day. Nor does
Plaintiff explain why there would be two sessions of Plaintiff’s deposition if
they were to take place on the same day.


[4] The
Court and the parties discussed the possibility and timing of one deposition.
Based on concerns about the inability to timely complete Espinoza’s deposition
in one sitting due in part to outstanding medical records, the Court and
parties discussed two depositions and discussed possible ways in which the
depositions could be structured to avoid duplicative questioning at a second
deposition. The Court did not indicate that it would rule that only one
deposition would be permitted. In any event, no rulings were made at an
informal discovery conference.


[5] In this
opposition, Plaintiff cites to Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.610.
Defendant argues that that section refers to depositions taken in one case. Regardless,
that section also provides that for good cause shown, the court may grant leave
to take a subsequent deposition.
