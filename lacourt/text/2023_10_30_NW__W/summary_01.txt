And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is in response to the defendants' motion to strike or, in the alternative, to tax costs. The defendants argue that the costs claimed by the plaintiff are untimely and unnecessary. The court finds that the defendants' motion is untimely and that the costs claimed by the plaintiff must be allowed. The court also rejects the defendants' argument that the costs are unreasonable or unnecessary, as they have filed a notice of appeal and posted an undertaking. The ruling is based on California laws and case citations, including California Code of Civil Procedure section 685.070(b) and California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700.
