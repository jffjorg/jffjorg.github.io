And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court continues the hearing to allow the parties to supplement the record and brief the issue of whether the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies to the arbitration agreement. The court finds that the plaintiff's burden is met to establish that he is a transportation worker, but not as a railroad employee. The court also finds that the plaintiff's claims are arbitrable. The court will not rule on the class waiver issue at this time as it is premature.
