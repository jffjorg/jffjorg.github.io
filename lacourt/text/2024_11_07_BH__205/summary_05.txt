As for the summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is on the demurrer to the cross-complaint filed by the Formans against the Brones. The judge sustains in part and overrules in part the demurrer. The claim for deprivation of lateral and subjacent support is dismissed without leave to amend because the Formans cannot allege that their property is coterminous with the Brones Property. The claim for nuisance is sustained because the Formans have alleged sufficient facts to support an inference that the Brones' conduct was wrongful and unreasonable. The claims for negligence and indemnity are overruled because they are not defective and the Formans have a reasonable possibility of success. The judge also notes that the meet and confer requirement under Code of Civil Procedure ยง 430.41 was satisfied.
