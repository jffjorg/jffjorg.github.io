Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in YAML format:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 24SMCV01221
* Hearing Date: November 7, 2024
* Department: 205
* Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles - West District
* Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Jorge Rodriguez
* Defendant: Trader Joe's Company, et al.

**Background**

* The case arises from an employment dispute between Plaintiff Jorge Rodriguez and Defendant Trader Joe's Company.
* Plaintiff was hired by Trader Joe's in 1997 and worked there for 24 years before his termination.
* Plaintiff claims that his employment was terminated due to a "tasting" of a new whiskey at the end of his shift, which was allegedly not permitted by Trader Joe's.

**Legal Issues**

* Demurrer: Trader Joe's argues that Plaintiff's breach of contract claim fails because Plaintiff does not rebut the presumption of at-will employment and does not provide sufficient allegations about the contract.
* Motion to Strike: Trader Joe's moves to strike Plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages and attorneys' fees because Plaintiff does not provide factual or legal grounds for these remedies.

**Tentative Ruling**

* The demurrer to the breach of contract claim is sustained without leave to amend because Plaintiff's contract is deemed to be at-will and terminable at the will of either party.
* The demurrer to the implied covenant claim is sustained because Plaintiff's breach of contract claim is subject to demurrer, and therefore, the implied covenant claim is also subject to demurrer.
* The motion to strike is denied as moot because the demurrer is sustained.

**Significant Statements**

* The Court notes that Plaintiff's counsel failed to meet and confer with Defendant's counsel as required by statute and code, and therefore, the Court exercises its discretion to ignore Plaintiff's opposition.
