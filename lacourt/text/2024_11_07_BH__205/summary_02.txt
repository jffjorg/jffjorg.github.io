The court finds that Baboli was never a prospective client of Novian, and therefore, Novian did not receive confidential information from Baboli. The court also finds that the information disclosed by Baboli is not confidential and cannot prevent Novian's representation of Plaintiff. Additionally, the court notes that Baboli's delay in filing the motion to disqualify is unreasonable and causes prejudice to Plaintiff, which may result in the denial of the motion.
