Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is sustained without leave to amend. This means that the defendant must file and serve a judgment of dismissal. The judge has also set a nonappearance review date of February 26, 2024, to review the proposed judgment of dismissal.

The judge ruled that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to support a cause of action for breach of contract, negligence, fraud, and common counts. The complaint is also uncertain and fails to specify the relationship between the plaintiff and defendant, who the buyer and seller are, and how the plaintiff was harmed.

The judge noted that the plaintiff has not opposed the motion and has not provided any indication as to how the complaint could be amended to fix these difficulties. Based on the plaintiff's statements to the defendant's counsel, it appears that the plaintiff believes he is entitled to a share of any money made by the defendant in the sale of the home loan to Wells Fargo. However, the court does not see a viable cause of action under these circumstances.
