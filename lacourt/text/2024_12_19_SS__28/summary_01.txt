Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion for a security undertaking filed by Defendant The Robert Group, Inc. and has denied the motion. The motion was filed under Code of Civil Procedure section 1030, which allows a defendant to request a security undertaking from a plaintiff who resides outside the state or is a foreign corporation. The defendant contended that it was reasonably possible that it would prevail in the case and that the plaintiff would incur costs of over $35,000.00 to defend the plaintiff's claims. The plaintiff argued that the defendant's evidence was insufficient to support the contention that the plaintiff was an employee of the defendant, and that the defendant had not shown that the plaintiff could not establish that the defendant employed the person who struck the plaintiff with the party rental table. The judge found that the defendant had not carried its burden of showing a reasonable possibility of prevailing in the case and denied the motion.
