And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant, Leslie Nicole Walker, argued that the plaintiff's notice to pay rent or quit did not comply with the CARES Act, which requires landlords to provide tenants with 30 days to cure a breach in a non-payment of rent case. However, the judge found that the notice provided by the plaintiff does comply with the CARES Act, as it gives the defendant three days to cure the breach by payment of rent, or 30 days to quit and deliver possession of the premises. The judge also noted that the CARES Act only prohibits requiring a tenant to vacate the premises less than 30 days after giving the tenant the notice, and that the plaintiff's notice does not indicate that the defendant's lease would be terminated or that eviction actions would commence less than 30 days from service of the notice. Therefore, the defendant has not shown that the notice is non-compliant, and the motion for summary judgment is denied.
