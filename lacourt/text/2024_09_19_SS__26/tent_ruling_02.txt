ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff 636
NHS, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant unlawful detainer action for
possession and back rent against Defendant Leslie Nicole Walker (“Defendant”)
on November 30, 2023. Defendant filed an Answer on December 12, 2023. Defendant

Limited Jurisdiction Department. (Minute Order, 08/02/24.)
 
Discussion
 
Allegations in the Complaint
 
The Complaint alleges Defendant entered into a one-year lease agreement
with Plaintiff on June 4, 2019 for the property at 636 N. Hill Pl., #A105, Los
Angeles, California. (Compl., ¶¶1-2, 6.) The parties initially agreed to rent
of $2,095.00 per month, which was later increased to $2,450.00 per month. (Id.
at ¶6.) Defendant was served with a 30-day notice to pay rent or quit within 30
days (“the Notice”). (Id. at ¶9.) The Notice was served on October 1,
2023 and expired on November 1, 2023. (Id. at ¶¶9-10 and Exh. 2.) At the
time the Notice to pay rent or quit was served, the amount of rent due was $11,676.00.
(Id. at ¶12.) 
 
Motion for Summary Judgment
 
A defendant seeking summary
judgment must show either (1)
that one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established; or (2) that there is a complete
defense to that cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)
Plaintiff is under no evidentiary burden to produce rebuttal evidence until
Defendant meets its initial moving burden. (Binder v. Aetna Life Insurance
Company (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839-840.) A motion for summary judgment
in an unlawful detainer case must be granted or denied on the same basis as a
motion for summary judgment in any other civil action under Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, except that a separate statement need not be filed in
support of or in opposition to a motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1170.7.)
 
Defendant’s Initial Burden of Proof
 
The Motion is brought on the grounds that Plaintiff cannot prevail in
this action because the Notice did not provide Defendant with 30 days to cure
the nonpayment. (Motion, citing Amended Answer, filed 12/19/23, ¶34.)
Specifically, Defendant argues that the Notice did not comply with the U.S.
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), which
requires that landlords provide a covered tenant 30 days, not three days, to
cure a breach in a non-payment of rent case. 
 
The statute provides: “The lessor of a covered dwelling unit (1) may not
require the tenant to vacate the covered dwelling unit before the date that is
30 days after the date on which the lessor provides the tenant with a notice to
vacate.” (15 U.S.C., § 9058, subd. (c).) The statute does not require landlords
to provide a covered tenant with 30 days to cure a breach, as Defendant argues.
It only prohibits requiring a tenant to vacate the premises less than 30 days
after giving the tenant the notice. Defendant cites federal rules and
regulations for the proposition that the purpose of the 30-day notice
requirement was to protect tenants from a lease termination or eviction action
within three days. (Citing 86 Code. Fed. Reg. Part 55696; 7 Code Fed. Regs.
Part 3560.) The Notice provided by Plaintiff does not go contrary to this
purpose. It does not indicate that Defendant’s lease would be terminated or
that eviction actions would commence less than 30 days from service of the
Notice. 
 
Defendant, therefore, has not shown that statutory language requires
giving a tenant 30 days to pay rent. Nor has Defendant shown that the Notice
violates the statutory language. The Notice provided by Plaintiff states: “WITHIN
THREE (3) DAYS after the service of this Notice, excluding Saturdays and
Sundays and other judicial holidays, you are hereby required to pay to HILLSIDE
VILLA APARTMENTS, as owner/ authorized agent for the owner, the rent for the
premises described above in the amount of: ELEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED
SEVENTY-SIX DOLLARS and 00/100 ($ 11,676.00) OR QUIT AND DELIVER UP POSSESSION
OF THE PREMISES WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS.” (Compl., Exh. 2.) Contrary to
Defendant’s contention, the notice provided by Plaintiff does comport with the
CARES Act. It gives Defendant three days to cure the breach by payment of rent,
or 30 days to quit and deliver possession of the premises. 
 
Finally, the cases cited by Plaintiff are not applicable here. Watson
v. Vici Community Development Corp. (W.D. Okla. 2022) WL 910155, involved a
case where the defendants did not dispute that failing to give the tenant 30
days’ notice prior to filing for eviction was sufficient. (Watson v. Vici
Community Development Corp. (W.D. Okla. 2022) WL 910155, *10.) Smallwood
v. Willow Way, LLC simply restates the language of the CARES Act: “may not
require a tenant to vacate a dwelling unit located in or on the applicable
property before the date that is 30 days after the date on which the borrower
provides the tenant with a notice to vacate.” (Smallwood v. Willow Way, LLC (N.D.
Tex. 2021) 2021 WL 2653287, at *7.) 
 
Defendant, therefore, has not shown through undisputed facts that Plaintiff
cannot prevail on its action for unpaid rent based on a non-compliant notice.
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant Leslie Nicole Walker’s Motion for Summary Judgment is
DENIED.
 
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
