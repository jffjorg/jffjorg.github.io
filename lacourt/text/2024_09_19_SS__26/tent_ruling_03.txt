Chappell
v. AT&T Mobility, LLC, et al.DEMURRER
TO ANSWER
(CCP §§ 430.31,
et seq., 426.30, 428.50)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
PLAINTIFF ERICA
CHAPPELL’S DEMURRER TO THE AMENDED ANSWER IS PLACED OFF CALENDAR.
 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Erica
Chappell (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for violations of the Rosenthal
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Cal. Civ. Code § 1788, et seq. and the
California Unfair Competition Law, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq.
against Defendants AT&T Mobility LLC dba AT&T Air; Waypoint Resource
Group; and Prince Parker & Associates, Inc., a Division of Waypoint
Resource Group, LLC, on July 8, 2024. Defendants filed their Answer on August
9, 2024.
 
Thereafter
Defendant filed an Amended Answer on August 13, 2024. On August 21, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the instant Demurrer to the Amended Answer. Defendants filed an
opposition on September 6, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s meet and confer effort is not sufficient. “As part of the
meet and confer process, the demurring party shall identify all of the specific
causes of action that it believes are subject to demurrer and identify with
legal support the basis of the deficiencies.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a)(1).) On August 15, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a letter to defense
counsel that merely restates each affirmative defense and then states that the
defense is uncertain. (Demurrer, Robenzadeh Decl., Exh. B.) In fact, the
meet and confer letter refers to the affirmative defenses in the Answer, not
the Amended Answer. (Ibid.) This indicates that no true meet and confer
took place with respect to the Amended Answer, as required by Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a).) Merely stating that the defenses
are uncertain does not provide legal support for the purported deficiencies, as
required by the meet and confer statute. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a)(1).) Furthermore, special demurrers are not permitted in the limited
jurisdiction court, so challenging the defenses in the Amended Answer on the
basis of uncertainty is improper. (Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).) Finally,
the meet and confer declaration does not mention failure to allege sufficient
facts as one of the grounds for demurring to the Amended Answer, yet
Plaintiff’s Demurrer is also brought on that basis. (Notice of Demurrer, p.
2:5-7.) Although an improper meet and confer effort is not grounds to overrule
a Demurrer, the Court exercises its discretion to place the Demurrer off
calendar for Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the mandatory provisions of the
statute, which are a precondition to filing a demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a).)
