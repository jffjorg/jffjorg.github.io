And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of Erica Chappell v. AT&T Mobility, LLC, et al. Plaintiff Erica Chappell filed a demurrer to the Amended Answer of the defendants, alleging that the affirmative defenses in the Amended Answer are uncertain and fail to allege sufficient facts. However, the judge has ruled that the plaintiff's meet and confer effort was insufficient, as the plaintiff did not identify the specific causes of action that it believes are subject to demurrer and did not provide legal support for the basis of the deficiencies. The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff's demurrer was brought on an improper basis, as the plaintiff did not challenge the defenses in the Amended Answer on the basis of uncertainty, but rather on the basis of failure to allege sufficient facts. Therefore, the judge has placed the Demurrer to the Amended Answer off calendar.
