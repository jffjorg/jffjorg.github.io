And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Victor Hutchins, has filed two motions to compel further responses to discovery requests and requests for sanctions against the defendants, 3rd Heaven Trucking, LLC, and Jonathan Young. The motions are denied due to several defects. The plaintiff's motions do not clearly state whether they seek initial or further responses to the discovery requests, and they do not comply with the procedural requirements for notice of motion to compel further responses. Additionally, the plaintiff failed to provide separate statements with the text of each request, response, and factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses, as required by California Rules of Court Rule 3.1345. The court cannot order the defendants to serve further responses to the discovery requests.
