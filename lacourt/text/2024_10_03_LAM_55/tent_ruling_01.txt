Violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq.) for Failure
to Pay Minimum and Overtime Wages.  
The
motion now before the Court is Plaintiff’s unopposed Motion for Final Approval
of Settlement.
LEGAL
STANDARD
Approval
of class action settlements occurs in two steps: First, the court
preliminarily approves the settlement, and the class members are notified as
directed by the court. See Cal. Rules of Court, Rules
3.769(c)-(g); Cellphone Termination Fee Cases (2009) 180
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1118. Second, the court conducts a final
approval hearing to inquire into the fairness of the proposed settlement. Id.
“If
the court has certified the action as a class action, notice of the final
approval hearing must be given to the class members in the manner
specified by the court. The notice must contain an explanation of the proposed
settlement and procedures for class members to follow in filing written
objections to it and in arranging to appear at the settlement hearing and state
any objections to the proposed settlement.” Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.769(f).
“‘The
trial court has broad discretion to determine whether the settlement is fair.’”
Cellphone Termination Fee Cases, supra, 180 Cal.App.4th at 1117. “‘[A]
presumption of fairness exists where: (1) the settlement is reached through arm’s-length
bargaining; (2) investigation and discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and
the court to act intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced in similar
litigation; and (4) the percentage of objectors is small.’” Id. at
1118, (quoting Dunk v. Ford Motor Co. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1794,
1802) (citation omitted).  
Once
the presumption of fairness has been established, the court still “bears the
responsibility to ensure that the recovery represents a reasonable compromise,
given the magnitude and apparent merit of the claims being released, discounted
by the risks and expenses of attempting to establish and collect on those
claims by pursuing the litigation. ‘The court has a fiduciary responsibility as
guardians of the rights of the absentee class members when deciding whether to
approve a settlement agreement.’” Kullar v. Foot Locker Retail, Inc. (2008)
168 Cal.App.4th 116, 129 (citation omitted). 
 
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff
Marvin Osoym moves for final approval of class action settlement and final
certification of class.
1.
Notice to Class Members of Final Approval Hearing
Plaintiffs
establish that they have provided notice to class members of the final approval
hearing in the manner specified by the court, in accordance with Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.769(f). See Declaration of James M. Treglio in Support of
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Final Approval (“Treglio Decl.”), ¶ 6; Declaration of
Kevin Lee with Respect to Settlement Administration and Class Notice (“Lee
Decl.”), ¶¶ 2 – 5.  
 
2.
Notice to LWDA
The
Court notes that Plaintiff has failed to establish that he notified the
California Labor & Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) of the proposed PAGA
settlement as required by Labor Code section 2699 subdivision (s)(2). Plaintiff
is required to do so before the court can approve the proposed settlement.
See Lab. Code, § 2699 (“The superior court shall review and approve any
settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to this part. The proposed
settlement shall be submitted to the agency at the same time that it is
submitted to the court.”).
At
the hearing, Plaintiff may clarify if he has complied with this requirement.
Otherwise, the Court will continue the motion to provide Plaintiff with time to
do so.  
 
3.
Presumption of Fairness
The
Court preliminarily found in its Order on April 11, 2024, that the presumption
of fairness should be applied. No facts have come to the Court's attention that
would alter that preliminary conclusion. Accordingly, the settlement is
entitled to a presumption of fairness as set forth in the preliminary approval order.
 
4.
Is the Settlement Fair, Adequate, and Reasonable?
The
settlement was preliminarily found to be fair, adequate, and reasonable. Notice
has now been given to the Class, but not LWDA. 
 
Reaction
of the class members to the proposed settlement.
 
Number
of class members: 64. Lee Decl., ¶7.
 
Number
of notice packets mailed: 64.  Ibid. 
 
Number
of undeliverable notices: 0. Id. at ¶ 6.
Number
of opt-outs: 0. Id. at ¶ 6.
 
Number
of objections: 0. Id. at ¶ 8.
 
Number
of participating class members: 64 Id. at ¶10. 
 
Average
individual payment: $4,833.98. Id. at ¶12.
 
Highest
individual payment: $15,778.28. Ibid.
The
Court finds that the notice was given as directed and conforms to due process
requirements. Given the reactions of the Class Members to the proposed
settlement and for the reasons set for in the Preliminary Approval order, the
settlement is found to be fair, adequate, and reasonable.
 
5.
Attorney’s Fees and Costs
Class
Counsel requests $203,333.33 (33.333…%) in attorney’s fees and $7,292. in
costs. The settlement provides for attorney’s fees up to 203,333.33 and costs
up to $15,000.  The class was provided
notice of the requested awards, and none objected.  
Class
Counsel requests attorney fees in the amount of one-third of the total common
fund. (Motion at pp. 14-16.) In common fund cases, the Court may employ a
percentage of the benefit method and may, in its discretion, cross-check the
requested percentage against the lodestar. See Laffitte v. Robert
Half Int'l, Inc. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 503. Ibid. 
Class
Counsel reports 112.4 attorney hours billed at $885 per hour and 100.8
paralegal hours billed at $325 per hour for a total lodestar of $132,234.
Counsel’s lodestar requires a multiplier of approximately 1.54 to equal the requested
amount.  The Court finds such a
multiplier to be reasonable in light of the favorable result obtained and the
contingent nature of the representation. Accordingly, the Court awards
attorney’s fees in the amount of $203,333.33.
Further,
Class Counsel is requesting $7,292 in costs. Treglio
Decl., ¶ 18, The costs in this case include PAGA initiation fee, filing fees,
mediators fee, and service costs. The costs seem reasonable and necessary to
litigation. Accordingly, the Court awards $7,292 in costs.
 
6.
Incentive Award/Enhancement Fee to Named Plaintiff
The
Settlement Agreement provides for up to $10,000 for Plaintiff Marvin Osoy as an
incentive award to the class representative.
The
Court finds this amount excessively high, considering the efforts and time
expended by the named Plaintiff and the amount of the settlement. Plaintiff’s
supplemental declaration does not show that his contributions went beyond what
the average representative in a wage-and-hour class action contributes.
Accordingly, the Court awards $7,500 to Plaintiff Marvin Osoy.
 
7.
Costs of Settlement Administration
 Phoenix Settlement Administrators (“Phoenix”) requests
$10,000 for the costs of administering the settlement. Lee Decl., ¶13. This is
equal to the maximum amount estimated which was disclosed in the notice to
class members, to which there were no objections. Based on the work performed
by the Settlement Administrator, the Court awards Phoenix $10,000 in
costs.  
 
 
CONCLUSION

Based on Plaintiff’s failure to submit the proposed
PAGA settlement, the Court continues the motion to a later date.
