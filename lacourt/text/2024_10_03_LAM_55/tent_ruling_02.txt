Petition of Petitioner Luis Fernando Castro for Approval of Compromise of Claim
or Action or Disposition of Proceedings of Judgment for Minor or Person with a
Disability [regarding Fernanda Castro Quijada].
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs, Luis Fernando Castro, Elsy M. Quijada De
Castro, Erik A. C. Castro, Katherine Castro (16 years old), and Fernanda Castro
Quijada (2 years old), tenants of an apartment at 6939
Hazeltine Avenue #9, Van Nuys, CA 91405, brought this action against the
apartment building owner/manager, Defendant K A J Group #4 LLC, for alleged
habitability issues. Petitioner, Luis Fernando Castro, the father and guardian
ad litem of minor Plaintiffs, filed petitions requesting Court approval of
settlements for his minor children who, as Defendants’ tenants, allegedly
suffered from uninhabitable conditions and emotional distress.
 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
Courts must decide whether to approve a compromise by
determining if petitioners, such as guardians, are acting in the best interests
of minors. E.g., Code Civ. Proc., § 372, subd. (a); Scruton v. Korean Air
Lines Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1607. “[T]he protective role the
court generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a role to assure that
whatever is done is in the minor's best interests….  [I]ts primary concern is whether the
compromise is sufficient to provide for the minor's injuries, care and
treatment.”  Goldberg v. Superior
Court (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382. Judicial discretion in approving
petitions for minors’ compromises, and ordering distributions, and local court
policies, must be applied in the best interests of minors, in a case-by-case
method, tailored to the circumstances.  Christensen
v. Superior Court (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 139, 142-144.
A petition for court approval of a compromise under
Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court
rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1384(a). Some
of the Probate Code and the Code of Civil Procedure apply to compromises as to
minors’ claims. See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950. In large part, the
Local Rules incorporate by reference the California Rules of Court and
statutory provisions. See Super. Ct. LA County, Local Rules, rule 4.115
et seq.
A payment of attorneys’ fees on the minor’s behalf
must be approved as being reasonable by the court. Niles v. City of San
Rafael (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 230, 244. “The trial court itself must develop
and resolve any counterarguments on behalf of the minor, lest the attorney
receive an excessive award of fees.” Gonzalez v. Chen (2011) 197
Cal.App.4th 881, 887.
 
ANALYSIS
In advocating settlement approvals, the Petitioner
represents that he made a careful and diligent inquiry and investigation into
the facts and circumstances, the responsibility, and the claimants’ injuries.
Here, the Court finds that the Petitioner is acting in
the best interests of the minors in proposing to obtain approval for the
settlement and minors’ compromises.
The Court finds that the proposed settlement amounts
of $5,000 for Katherine Castro and $2,500 for Fernanda Castro Quijada are typical
among the many like cases seen in this court, as to minors who lived in
uninhabitable conditions, fully recovered, and required no medical treatment.
Further, attorney’s fees of $1,250 from Katherine
Castro and $650 from Fernanda Castro Quijada, reflecting 25 percent of the
recovery and pursuant to a written attorney-client fee agreement, are
reasonable.
 
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, both petitions are
granted as requested. The Court will sign and file proposed orders filed by the
petitioner. Petitioner must also submit a filled-out Order to Deposit Funds
into Blocked Account (MC-355) for each claimant for the Court to sign.
Plaintiff to give notice.
