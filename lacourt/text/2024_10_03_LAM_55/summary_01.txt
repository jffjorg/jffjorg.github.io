Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering the plaintiff's motion for final approval of a settlement in a class action lawsuit against Caliber Holdings, LLC. The lawsuit alleges various labor code violations, including failure to pay minimum wage, overtime, and provide meal and rest breaks. The court has previously preliminarily approved the settlement and given notice to the class members.

The plaintiff has failed to notify the California Labor & Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) of the proposed PAGA settlement as required by Labor Code section 2699. The court will continue the motion to allow the plaintiff to comply with this requirement.

The court finds that the settlement is entitled to a presumption of fairness and that the notice was given as directed and conforms to due process requirements. The court awards attorney's fees to Class Counsel in the amount of $203,333.33 and costs in the amount of $7,292. The court also awards an incentive award to the named plaintiff, Marvin Osoy, in the amount of $7,500.

The court finds that the costs of settlement administration, including the fees of the settlement administrator, Phoenix, are reasonable and awards $10,000 in costs.

The court continues the motion to a later date to allow the plaintiff to notify the LWDA of the proposed PAGA settlement.
