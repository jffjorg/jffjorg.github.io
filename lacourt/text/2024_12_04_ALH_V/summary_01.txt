And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion filed by Nina Minassian, plaintiff Sumaku H. Ali's attorney, to be relieved as counsel of record. The motion was filed under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) due to an irreconcilable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. The court has granted the motion, allowing Ms. Minassian to be relieved as counsel. The reasons for the breakdown of the relationship are that Ms. Minassian cannot continue to represent plaintiff in the manner in which plaintiff wishes. The court has also noted that Ms. Minassian has been unsuccessful in seeking a substitution of attorney. The hearing date is set for December 4, 2024.
