And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application for a temporary restraining order to enjoin the recording of the trustee's deed upon sale and for the issuance of a preliminary injunction without prejudice. The reason for the denial is that the court's file does not reflect that the defendants have been served with the complaint in this action, and the moving party is ordered to give notice to the defendants.
