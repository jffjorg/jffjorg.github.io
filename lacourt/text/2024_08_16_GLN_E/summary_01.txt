And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents propounded by the plaintiff, Guadalupe Castrellon, on April 30, 2024. The defendant, Valenzuela Properties LLC, served responses to the discovery request on May 30, 2024, but the plaintiff believes that the responses are incomplete and fail to comply with the relevant statutes.

The judge finds that the plaintiff's motion is timely and that the defendant's opposition is unavailing. The judge grants the motion to compel further responses to RFPs 1-44 and 46-98, Set One, propounded on the defendant.

The judge also considers the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant and its attorney, Dan S. Shapiro, in the amount of $4260.00. The plaintiff's counsel requests sanctions for the time spent preparing for the motion and the separate statement, reviewing the opposition, and appearing at a hearing. The judge notes that no reply was submitted and will hear argument on the matter.
