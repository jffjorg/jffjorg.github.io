BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, Guillermo
Sandoval, filed a Complaint on 10/31/2023. The Complaint alleges four causes of
action – (1) Violation of Subdivision (d) of Civil Code § 1793.2, (2) Violation
of Subdivision (b) of Civil Code § 1793.2, (3) Violation of Subdivision (a)(3)
of Civil Code § 1793.2, and (4) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability
(Civil Code, §§ 1791.1, 1794, 1795.5).
 
 
The instant motion
pertains to whether or not Defendant HMA, a nonsignatory to the “Retail
Installment Sale Contract – Simple Finance Charge (With Arbitration Provision)”
(“RISC”), can compel arbitration even though Plaintiff and non-party, Glendale
Hyundai, were the parties that signed the RISC that contained the arbitration
provision.
 
LEGAL STANDARD – MOTION TO COMPEL
ARBITRATION
CCP
§1281.2, governing orders to arbitrate controversies, provides in pertinent
part:
On petition of a
party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement
to arbitrate a controversy and that a party to the agreement refuses to
arbitrate that controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the
respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to
arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it determines that:
(a)  
The
right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or
(b)  
Grounds
exist for recission of the agreement.
 
(CCP
§1281.2(a)-(b).
 
Under
the Federal Arbitration Act, arbitration agreements “shall be valid,
irrevocable and enforceable, save upon such grounds that exist at law or in
equity for the revocation of a contract.” 
(9 U.S.C. section 2.) 
 
There
is a strong public policy in favor of arbitration of disputes and any doubts
concerning the scope of arbitrable disputes should be resolved in favor of arbitration.
(Moncharsh v. Heily & Blase (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 9 (“courts will
‘indulge every intendment to give effect to such proceedings.’”) (quotation
omitted)). (See also AT&T Mobility, LLC v. Concepcion (2011) 563
U.S. 333, 339.)  
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
HMA
attaches as Exhibit 2 to the Ameripour Declaration the instant RISC containing
the arbitration provision. This RISC is executed between Buyer (Guillermo
Sandoval) and Seller-Creditor (Glendale Hyundai).
The RISC contains an arbitration provision that is
labeled as “ARBITRATION PROVISION” and provides: 
1.
EITHER YOU OR WE MAY CHOOSE TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US DECIDED BY
ARBITRATION AND NOT IN COURT OR BY JURY TRIAL.
 
[…]
 
Any
claim or dispute, whether in contract, tort, statute or otherwise (including
the interpretation and scope of this Arbitration Provision, and the
arbitrability of the claim or dispute), between you and us or our employees,
agents, successors or assigns, which arises out of or relates to your credit
application, purchase or condition of this vehicle, this contract or any
resulting transaction or relationship (including any such relationship with
third parties who do not sign this contract) shall, at your or our election, be
resolved by neutral, binding arbitration and not by a court action ….
  
(Ameripour
Decl. ¶4, Ex. 2.)
 
Further
the arbitration provision provides: 
 
Any
arbitration under this Arbitration Clause shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration
Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et. seq.) and not by any state law concerning arbitration.
 
(Ameripour
Decl. ¶4, Ex. 2.)
 
On
the first page of the RISC, “You” is defined as the Buyer; and “we,” or “us”
refers to the Seller-Creditor.
 
Here,
the Buyer is Plaintiff Guillermo Sandoval, and the Seller-Creditor is Glendale
Hyundai, who is not a party to the instant lawsuit.

HMA
moves to compel arbitration under the RISC even though HMA is a non-signatory
to the RISC. HMA moves to compel arbitration based on the two theories of third
party beneficiaries and equitable estoppel, and under the California Supreme
Court’s holding in Sanchez v. Valencia Holding Co. (2015) 61 Cal.4th
899.
However, this Court does not find HMA’s arguments on
equitable estoppel and the third party beneficiary doctrine availing in light
of: (1) Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, rev.
granted, (Ford Motor Warranty Cases) (2) Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co.
(2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 958, rev. granted, (Montemayor), (3) Kielar
v. Superior Court (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 614, rev. granted (Kielar), Davis
v. Nissan North America, Inc. (2024) 100 Cal.App.5th 825, rev. granted (Davis),
and Yeh v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 264,
rev. granted (Yeh).
Further, HMA’s citation to Sanchez v. Valencia
Holding Co. (2015) 61 Cal.4th 899 is inapposite because in that case the
Plaintiff brought an action against the dealer. Here, Plaintiff is bringing an
action against the manufacturer. 
Although HMA cites to Felisilda v. FCA US LLC
(2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486, this Court notes it is following Ford Motor
Warranty Cases, rev. granted. “Of course, the rule under discussion has no
application where there is more than one appellate court decision, and such
appellate decisions are in conflict. In such a situation, the court exercising
inferior jurisdiction can and must make a choice between the conflicting
decisions.” (Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court of Santa Clara County
(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 456.)
This Court finds that the Ford Motor Warranty Cases
are better reasoned and the instant set of facts distinguishable from Felisilda.
Ford Motor Warranty Cases and Montemayor adequately and
extensively explain why movant’s arguments on equitable estoppel and the third
party beneficiary doctrine are inapplicable and distinguishable in the instant
scenario. Movant here, HMA, is not a party to the RISC in the instant case. 
Moreover, Ford Motor and Montemayor are
Second District cases, while Felisilda is a Third District case.
This Court notes that Ford Motor Warranty Cases,
Montemayor, Kielar, Davis, and Yeh all state,
“Review granted. See Cal Rules of Court 8.1105 and 8.1115 (and corresponding
Comment, par. 2, concerning rule 8.1115(e)(3).”
Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration is DENIED.
