And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel arbitration brought by Hyundai Motor America (HMA). The motion seeks to compel Guillermo Sandoval, the plaintiff, to arbitrate his claims under the Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC). The RISC contains an arbitration provision that allows for disputes to be resolved through arbitration.

The judge has denied the motion, finding that HMA's arguments on equitable estoppel and the third party beneficiary doctrine are not availing in light of recent Court of Appeal decisions. The judge notes that the Court of Appeal has recently issued decisions that are more persuasive and that the instant case is distinguishable from previous cases.

The judge has also granted the plaintiff's request for judicial notice of certain Court of Appeal decisions and has denied HMA's request for judicial notice of the plaintiff's Complaint. The judge has set the matter for a hearing on August 16, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
