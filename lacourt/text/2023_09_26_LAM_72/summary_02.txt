And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff, Nadia Huijara Espino, to undergo an independent psychiatric examination (IME). The defendants, SP Plus Corporation and Roberto Pacheco, moved for an order compelling the plaintiff to appear for the IME, citing the need to discover the origin, nature, and severity of the plaintiff's alleged emotional distress and mental health injuries. The plaintiff has alleged 12 causes of action, including disability discrimination, religious discrimination, and wrongful termination.

The judge found that the defendants did not comply with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310, which requires the moving party to specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination. The judge also found that the defendants did not show good cause for the IME, as they failed to specify specific facts justifying the discovery and did not demonstrate that they could not obtain the information they seek elsewhere.

The judge denied the defendants' motion without prejudice, encouraging the parties to meet and confer further on this issue to avoid the need for further motion practice. The parties are encouraged to agree on the terms of the IME, including the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, and to submit a revised motion that complies with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure.
