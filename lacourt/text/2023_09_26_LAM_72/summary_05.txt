This is a tentative ruling by a Superior Court Judge in a lemon law action case between Plaintiff Jong Bum Lee and Defendant FCA US, LLC. The Plaintiff moved to compel initial responses from the Defendant to his form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents, and to deem admitted the matters referred to in his requests for admissions. The Defendant argued that it had provided code-compliant responses on September 9 and 13, 2023, and therefore the motions were moot. The court denied the motions to compel as moot, but granted the motion for sanctions in the amount of $1,930.00 against the Defendant. The sanctions were imposed because the Defendant failed to timely respond to the Plaintiff's discovery requests, and the court found that the Defendant's failure to respond was not due to substantial justification or other circumstances that would make imposition of the sanction unjust.
