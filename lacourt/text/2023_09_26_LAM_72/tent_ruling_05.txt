SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA
COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES
 
DEPARTMENT 72
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 



JONG BUM LEE, an individual,
 
                                  Plaintiff,
  
         v.
 
 
FCA US, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, et al.,
 
                                  Defendants.
 


 Case No:  23STCV05971
 
 
MOTIONS TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO FORM AND SPECIAL
  INTERROGATORIES AND REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS; MOTION TO DEEM FACTS
  ADMITTED
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 26, 2023
 Calendar
  Number:  7
 



 
 
          Plaintiff
Jong Bum Lee (Plaintiff) moves to compel initial responses from defendant FCA
US, LLC (FCA) to her (1) form interrogatories, set one (2) special
interrogatories, set one, and (3) requests for production of documents, set
one, and to deem admitted the matters referred to in her requests for
admissions (RFAs), set one. She also requests monetary sanctions.
 
          The motions
to compel are DENIED as moot because FCA has belatedly served discovery
responses to the discovery propounded by Plaintiff.  Plaintiff’s motion for monetary sanctions is GRANTED
in part in the amount of $1,930.00.  FCA shall pay Plaintiff’s counsel $1,930.00
within 30 days.  
 
Background
 
          This is a lemon law action. Plaintiff alleges she purchased
a 2021 Chrysler Pacifica in May 2021. The vehicle exhibited substantial
defects, and defendants failed to promptly replace it or make restitution.
Plaintiff sued on March 17, 2023 for three violations of Civil Code section
1793.2, breach of express written warranty, and breach of the implied warranty
of habitability.
 
          Plaintiff now
moves for an order compelling defendant FCA to respond to her initial sets of
written discovery, to deem matters referred to in her RFAs admitted, and imposing
monetary sanctions against FCA for failure to timely respond.
 
Legal Standard
 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, “[i]f a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response . . . [t]he party
to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the
option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to
the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or the protection for
work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010)  . .
.   [and] The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subds. (a)-(b).)  The Code
provides equivalent remedies for a propounding party upon a responding party’s
failure to timely produce documents. (See id., § 2031.300, subds.
(a)-(b).)  
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision
(a), “[i]f a party to whom requests or admission are directed fails to serve a
timely response…[t]he party to whom the requests for admission are directed
waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or on
the protection for work product[.]” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)  Where a party fails to respond to requests
for admissions, the propounding party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The court “shall”
grant a motion to deem admitted the matters specified in the requests for
admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission
have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed
response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with
Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Where the court grants a
motion to compel responses, sanctions shall be imposed against a party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the
person or entity acted with substantial justification or the sanction would
otherwise be unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, 2031.90, 2033.280, subds. (c); Cal. Rule of Court, rule 3.1348.)
Further
undesignated statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.
Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s counsel attests
Plaintiff propounded discovery on April 3, via U.S. Mail; Plaintiff granted
Defendant a thirty-day extension to respond, placing its response deadline on
June 7; and as of the date Plaintiff’s motion was filed, July 13, 2023,
Plaintiff had not received responses. (Hori Decl., ¶¶ 2-4.) Counsel’s
declaration satisfies sections 2031.290, 2031.300, and 2033.280.
 
FCA argues it provided code
compliant responses on September 9 and 13 and therefore Plaintiff’s motion(s)
“ha[ve] been rendered moot.” (Hanson Decls., ¶¶ 4-6.) Plaintiff agrees
responses were provided by September 13. (Reply, 2:4-8.) While motions compelling
responses may no longer be necessary, sanctions remain warranted. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348(a).)
 
FCA argues Plaintiff did not meet
and confer prior to filing these motions. (Opp., 3:9-4:4.)[1]
There is no such requirement.
 
FCA argues, alternatively, that
its failure to timely respond was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect. (Opp., 4:5-6.) Defendant’s counsel testifies to administrative
mistake. (Hanson Decls., ¶ 7.) The standard for relief from sanctions under the
Civil Discovery Act is “substantial justification or ... other circumstances [that
would] make imposition of the sanction unjust.” (See § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
Mistake is not substantial justification, and the Court declines to relieve FCA
from sanctions.
 
As to Plaintiff’s RFAs, Plaintiff
appears to acknowledge she has received code-compliant responses. Where
code-compliant responses to RFAs are served prior to the hearing on a motion to
deem admitted, the Court imposes only monetary sanctions, not the sanction of
admissions. (§ 2033.280, subd. (c).) The Court declines to deem the matters
referred to in Plaintiff’s RFAs admitted.
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff’s counsel attests to a
reasonable hourly rate of $350. 
 
As to hours spent, counsel’s
declarations are internally inconsistent: in her “Joint Declaration” she
declares she spent 3.0 hours preparing all 3 motions (one assumes neglecting
RFAs), but in her declaration accompanying Plaintiff’s RFA motion counsel states
1.5 hours preparing “all 3 motions” (unclear to which motions she is
referring). The court finds 3.0 hours reasonable for preparation of the 4
motions. Plaintiff’s counsel estimates 1.0 hour preparing the reply, which is
reasonable. She also estimates both 4 and 2 hours, respectively, in each
declaration “for actual attendance and time incurred on the road”, which is not
reasonable, particularly where remote attendance is available for such a
straightforward motion. The court awards 1 hour of appearance time for all 4
motions. Counsel also testifies to $180 in filing fees, which were indisputably
incurred.
 
The court awards sanctions in the
amount of $1,930.00 (5 hours x $350 + $180.)
 
Conclusion
 
The court DENIES Plaintiff’s motions to compel as
moot.  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s
motion for sanctions, awarding sanctions in the amount of $1,930.00 against
Defendant FCA US, LLC.
