Case No:  22STCV18691
 
 
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH DEPOSITION
  SUBPOENA FOR PRODUCTION OF BUSINESS RECORDS
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 26, 2023
 Calendar
  Number:  4



 
          Defendants
Airport Terminal Management, Inc. and Bryant Cisneros move to compel Pacific
Clinics to comply with Defendants’ deposition subpoena for the production of
business records. Plaintiff Eduardo Jimenez has filed no opposition.
 
          The Court
notes with approval Defendant’s counsel’s attempts to meet and confer with
plaintiff and with the deponent. (Park Decl., ¶ 6.) The Court also notes Plaintiff’s
counsel’s expressed objection to the broad terms of the subpoena and willingness
to stipulate to a narrower scope. (Id., Ex. F.) Finally, the Court notes
that the Chief Legal Officer for the deponent, Pacific Clinics, has indicated
they will “not produce Plaintiff’s records absent a signed authorization from
him or a court order.” (Id., ¶ 6.)
 
          Given that it
appears the parties can resolve the issue amicably with a limited voluntary
release signed by the Plaintiff, the Court is not inclined to intervene at this
time.
 
          The Court
sets an informal discovery conference on this matter for October 11, 2023, at
9:30 a.m. Counsel are ordered meet and confer on or before October 2, 2023. If
the matter is not resolved via counsel’s conference, the parties are ordered to
file written statements of position not exceeding two pages in length, and with
no attachments, no later than October 4, 2023.
 
          The Court
CONTINUES the hearing on the instant motion to November 2, 2023.
